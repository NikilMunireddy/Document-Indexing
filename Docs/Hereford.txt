'''Hereford''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Hereford.ogg|ˈ|h|ɛr|ɨ|f|ər|d}}) is a [[cathedral city]], [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] and [[county town]] of [[Herefordshire]], [[England]]. It lies on the [[River Wye]], approximately {{convert|16|mi|km}} east of the border with [[Wales]], {{convert|24|mi|km}} southwest of [[Worcester]], and {{convert|23|mi|km}} northwest of [[Gloucester]]. With a population of 53,516 people,<ref name=census /> it is the largest settlement in the county.

The name "Hereford" is said to come from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] "here", an army or formation of soldiers, and the "[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]", a place for crossing a river. If this is the origin it suggests that Hereford was a place where a body of armed men forded or crossed the [[River Wye|Wye]]. The [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for Hereford is ''Henffordd'', meaning "old road", and probably refers to the Roman road and Roman settlement at nearby [[Stretton Sugwas]].

An early town charter from 1189 granted by [[Richard I of England]] describes it as "Hereford [[Welsh Lost Lands|in Wales]]".<ref name="charters">{{cite web | url= http://www.herefordwebpages.co.uk/charters.shtml | title= The Royal Charters of the City of Hereford | work= Hereford Web Pages | accessdate= 7 September 2011}}</ref> Hereford has been recognised as a city since [[time immemorial]], with the status being reconfirmed as recently as October 2000.<ref>Beckett, J V (2005).

It is now known chiefly as a trading centre for a wider agricultural and rural area. Products from Hereford include: [[cider]], [[beer]], [[leather]] goods, [[nickel]] alloys, poultry, [[chemical]]s, and [[cattle]], including the famous [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford breed]].

==History==
[[File:Hereford Cathedral, from Church Street.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Hereford Cathedral, from Church Street]]
Hereford became the seat of [[Putta]], [[Bishop of Hereford]], some time between AD 676 and 688, after which the settlement continued to grow due to its proximity to the border between [[Mercia]] and [[Wales]], becoming the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] capital of West [[Mercia]] by the beginning of the 8th century.<ref name=DNB>Sims-Williams [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22912 "Putta (d. c.688)"] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

Hostilities between the Anglo-Saxons and the [[Britons (historical)|Welsh]] came to a head with the [[Battle of Hereford]] in 760, in which the Britons freed themselves from the influence of the English.<ref>''Annales Cambriae''</ref> Hereford was again targeted by the Welsh during their conflict with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] King [[Edward the Confessor]] in AD 1056 when, supported by [[Viking]] allies, [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], King of Gwynedd and Powys, marched on the town and put it to the torch before returning home in triumph.<ref name=Archenfeld>[http://www.archenfield.com/history_anglosaxon.htm ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> Hereford had the only mint west of the [[Severn]] in the reign of [[Athelstan]] (924–39), and it was to Hereford, then a border town, that Athelstan summoned the leading Welsh princes.<ref>J and M Tonkin, The Book of Hereford, 1975</ref>

The present [[Hereford Cathedral]] dates from the early 12th century, as does the first bridge across the [[River Wye|Wye]].<ref>J. Hillaby, Bishop Richard de Capella and the foundation of Herefordshire's market towns, in Woolhope Naturalists Field Club,Essays in honour of Jim and Muriel Tonkin, 2011</ref>  Former [[Bishop of Hereford|Bishops of Hereford]] include [[Thomas Cantilupe|Saint Thomas de Cantilupe]] and Lord High Treasurer of England [[Thomas Charlton (bishop)|Thomas Charlton]].

The city gave its name to two suburbs of [[Paris]], [[France]]: [[Maisons-Alfort]] (population 54,600) and [[Alfortville]] (population 36,232), due to a manor built there by [[Peter of Aigueblanche]], [[Bishop of Hereford]], in the middle of the 13th century.

Hereford, a base for successive holders of the title [[Earl of Hereford]], was once the site of a [[castle]], [[Hereford Castle]], which rivalled that of [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] in size and scale. This was a base for repelling Welsh attacks and a secure stronghold for English kings such as [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] when on campaign in the [[Welsh Marches]] against [[Owain Glyndŵr]]. The castle was dismantled in the 18th century and landscaped into Castle Green.

After the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]] in 1461, during the [[Wars of the Roses]], the defeated Lancastrian leader [[Owen Tudor]] (grandfather of the future [[Henry VII of England]]) was taken to Hereford by Sir Roger Vaughan and executed in High Town. A plaque now marks the spot of the execution. Vaughan was later himself executed, under a flag of truce, by Owen's son Jasper.

[[File:The Old House, High Town, Hereford - geograph.org.uk - 11172.jpg|thumb|[[The Old House, Hereford|The Old House]], High Town. This timber-framed Jacobean building, built in 1621, is now a [[The Old House, Hereford#Museum|museum]].]]
During the [[English civil war|civil war]] the city changed hands several times. On 30 September 1642 [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] led by [[Robert Harley (1579–1656)|Sir Robert Harley]] and [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford]] occupied the city without opposition. In December they withdrew to [[Gloucester]] because of the presence in the area of a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army under [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert]]. The city was again occupied briefly from 23 April to 18 May 1643 by Parliamentarians commanded by [[William Waller|Sir William Waller]] but it was in 1645 that the city saw most [[Military action|action]]. On 31 July 1645 a [[Scotland|Scottish]] army of 14,000 under [[Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven]] [[siege|besieged]] the city but met stiff resistance from its [[garrison]] and inhabitants. They withdrew on 1 September when they received news that a force led by [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] was approaching. The city was finally taken for [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] on 18 December 1645 by [[John Birch (soldier)|Colonel Birch]] and [[Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet|Colonel Morgan]]. King Charles showed his gratitude to the city of Hereford on 16 September 1645 by augmenting the city's coat of arms with the three lions of [[Richard I of England]], ten Scottish Saltires signifying the ten defeated Scottish regiments, a very rare lion crest on top of the coat of arms signifying "defender of the faith" and the even rarer gold-barred peer's helm, found only on the arms of one other municipal authority: those of the [[City of London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/gbr/h/hereford.htm |title=Coat of arms of Hereford (England) |publisher=Ngw.nl |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

[[Nell Gwynne]], actress and mistress of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], is said to have been born in Hereford in 1650 (although other towns and cities, notably [[Oxford]], also claim her as their own); Gwynn Street is named after her. Another famous actor born in Hereford is [[David Garrick]] (1717–1779).

The Bishop's Palace next to the Cathedral was built in 1204 and continually used to the present day.<ref>http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol04/4_069_080.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/hereford.html |title=A History of Hereford |publisher=Localhistories.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>  Hereford Cathedral School is also one of the oldest schools in England.

During [[World War I]], in 1916, a [[Garrick Theatre fire, Hereford|fire at the Garrick Theatre]] killed eight young girls who had been performing at a charity concert.<ref name="Chester">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-25154112|title=World War One: Hereford theatre fire killed eight at fundraiser|last=Chester|first=Jerry|date=24 February 2014|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>

==Governance==
[[File:Town Hall, Hereford - geograph.org.uk - 739270.jpg|thumbnail|180|right|Hereford Town Hall (opened 1904)]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A CoatofArms1.jpg|thumb|The Coat of Arms of the City of Hereford]] -->
The main [[local government]] body covering Hereford is [[Herefordshire Council]]. Hereford has a "City Council" but this is actually a [[civil parish|parish council]] with [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]], and has only limited powers.

Historically Hereford has been the [[county town]] of [[Herefordshire]]. In 1974 Herefordshire was merged with [[Worcestershire]] to become part of the county of [[Hereford and Worcester]], and Hereford became a [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] of the new county. Hereford had formed a historic borough and was reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].<ref>Vision of Britain – [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10024559 Hereford MB]</ref> On 1 April 1998 the County of Hereford and Worcester was abolished, and Herefordshire and Worcestershire were re-established as separate counties, although with slightly altered borders.

However the new Herefordshire was a [[unitary authority]] without any districts, and so Hereford lost its district status (although, confusingly, the authority's full legal name is the County of Herefordshire District Council). [[Charter Trustees]] were appointed to preserve mayoral traditions until a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] council could be set up, which happened in 2000. Hereford is one of only seven civil parishes in England which have city status.

[[Hereford (UK Parliament constituency)|Hereford]] was the name of a parliamentary constituency centring on the city, from 1295 to 2010, when it was renamed as Hereford and South Herefordshire. The current [[Member of Parliament|member]] of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for [[Hereford and South Herefordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Hereford and South Herefordshire]] is [[Jesse Norman]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

==Climate==
As with all of the UK, Hereford experiences a [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with limited seasonal temperature ranges, and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest [[Met Office]] weather station for which 30-year averages are available is [[Credenhill]] weather station, about {{convert|4|mi|0}} north east of the city centre. Before 2001, the weather station at Preston Wynne (7 miles, 11&nbsp;km to the north-east) provided the data.<ref>http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcq04hx21</ref>

Since 2001, extremes at Hereford Credenhill have ranged from  {{convert|33.6|°C|°F}}<ref>{{cite web

==Transport==
{{The Railways of Hereford}}

===Roads===
There have been plans for many years for a north–south [[bypass (road)|bypass]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/4157187.High_hopes_for_Hereford___60m_bypass_bid/ |title=Hereford Times |publisher=Hereford Times |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> and currently the plan is for a nine-mile (14&nbsp;km) [[dual carriageway]]; however, HM Government as yet has refused to grant permission or supply funds. Until then the A49 [[Trunk Road]], A465, and A438 continue to run through the city centre.

===Rail===
Hereford is served by a 4-platform [[Hereford railway station|railway station]] on the [[Welsh Marches Line]] which opened in 1854. Services regularly connect to [[Worcester]], [[Birmingham]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Cardiff]] and other settlements in south [[Wales]]. The station is currently operated by [[Arriva Trains Wales]]. A second station, [[Hereford Barton railway station|Hereford Barton]], was closed and later redeveloped. A new station is proposed for construction in the government-designated [[Enterprise zone]] in [[Rotherwas]], south of the River Wye.

==Military associations==
[[RAF Hereford]] was a non-flying station of the [[Royal Air Force]] located nearby to Hereford. It was the home of a wide variety of training schools from 1940 until it closed for RAF training in 1999. Subsequently the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) moved their base to there from its previous location in the city. There is a clocktower in Hereford where the names of dead SAS men are inscribed.<ref>{{cite news| last=Staff |date= 19 May 1980 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924110,00.html |title=World: Britain's SAS.: Who Dares Wins|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref>

*[[Wye Valley Brewery]] – Producers of such beers as Butty Bach and Hereford Pale Ale (HPA) and other real ales.
*[[Weston's Cider]] – Award-winning cider and perry producer based just outside Hereford

Herefordshire is a global centre for [[cider]] production as it supports many acres of orchards, so many breweries and associated organisations exist here, along with other heavy and light industries.<ref>http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/regional/herefordshire/11114579.Update__UBL_Ledbury___Cider_production_to_shift_to_Hereford/</ref> Within the city, many are based at the Rotherwas Industrial Estate.

==Regeneration==
Many of the schools in Hereford have been rebuilt and improved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/8189738.stm |title=Bbc News |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>  The [[Herefordshire and Ludlow College]] has also been rebuilt to a 21st-century standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hct.ac.uk/College/h_campus.html |title=Herefordshire College of Technology |publisher=Hct.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> A new NMITE (New Model in Technology and Engineering) university is also planned, which will teach STEM subjects and is slated to open in 2016. There has also been a number of improvements at [[Hereford Sixth Form College]], where a new business block extension was completed in 2013 and a new reception area was completed in 2015.

Hereford benefitted from the [[Private finance initiative|PFI]] reconstruction schemes for NHS hospitals, with the former County Hospital site having £60 million spent on a brand new, one-site hospital to replace the former 3 hospitals: the General, the Eye Hospital, and the County Hospital. The new Hereford County Hospital was the single largest investment in Herefordshire at that point. In 2015, further funds for more improvements at the hospital were granted.

===Current and future projects===
A major regeneration project is taking place in Hereford city centre, formerly known as the [[Edgar Street Grid]]. This covers an area of around {{convert|100|acre|km2}} just north of the old city walls. Work started on 8 October 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/9172256.Work_starts_on_Hereford_s_old_cattle_market/|title=Work Starts on Hereford's Old Cattle Market |publisher=Herefordtimes.com |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> and should take around 15 years to complete the whole project. The regeneration includes the rebuilding of the canal basin at the end of the currently disused [[Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal]].
The £80 million phase 1 includes a supermarket, department store, multiplex cinema, shops, restaurants, and other facilities and opened in late Spring 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanhopeplc.com/?page=42&id=617 |title=Stanhope PLC |publisher=Stanhope PLC |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

The Butter [[market (place)|Market]] is also due for refurbishment and proposals are being examined.

A proposed [[bypass (road)|bypass]] has been drawn up to circulate the city, which suffers from rush hour traffic, with potential routes either to the east or west of the city. Both routes would connect with the Rotherwas Access Road which was recently completed, connecting the Rotherwas [[Industrial Estate]] to the [[A49 road|A49]]. Rotherwas itself has recently been awarded an [[Enterprise Zone]] status by the government which is expected to boost the economy and bring in thousands of new jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-14555547 |title=Rotherwas named Enterprise Zone |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

A second railway station for Hereford has been discussed, which would be situated in Rotherwas as part of the Enterprise Zone.

Hereford is due to receive half of the 20,600 new homes expected to be built in the county by 2026 as part of the [[Regional Spatial Strategy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmra.gov.uk/Planning_and_Regional_Spatial_Strategy/Regional_Spatial_Strategy/Regional_Spatial_Strategy_(RSS).aspx |title=West Midlands Regional Spatial Strategy |publisher=Wmra.gov.uk |date=31 March 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

==Sport==
[[File:Hufc-lwme.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hereford United]]'s [[Edgar Street]] ground.]]
Hereford is the home of the [[association football|football]] club, [[Hereford F.C.|Hereford FC]] and they play at [[Edgar Street]] in the [[Midland Football League]] Premier Division. They are a phoenix club that was set up in the wake of the demise of [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United Football Club]] in 2014. 
United were best known for beating [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] 2-1 in an [[FA Cup]] replay in January 1972, when they were still a non-league side and Newcastle were in the top division of English football.
Other notable city clubs include [[Westfields F.C.|Westfields]] and [[Pegasus Juniors]].

[[Hereford Rugby Club]] announced plans in 2012 for a major £6 million move to a new home.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woodman |first=Ian |url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/herefordrfc/news/outline-planning-permission-gr-368789.html |title=Planning permission for new club |publisher=Pitchero.com |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

The city is also home to [[Hereford Racecourse]], a traditional [[National Hunt]] course to the north of the city centre which hosted around twenty meetings a year. The company who leased the site decided in 2012 that the site was not viable. What many thought to be the last meeting was held on 16 December 2012, however in January 2016, [[Arena Racing Company]] announced plans to re-open the course, with the first meeting scheduled for 6 October 2016.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/35377729</ref>

Many golf courses surround the city at Wormsley (Herefordshire GC), [[Burghill]] and Brockington. The racecourse surrounds a golf course in Holmer.

===Public leisure===
Hereford's public leisure facilities are managed by a not-for-profit trust called HALO Leisure, which runs the Hereford [[Leisure Centre]] (that includes huge sports halls, [[gym]]nasium, squash courts, and an outdoor [[sport|athletics]] facility), and the Hereford [[Human swimming|Leisure Pool]] (which includes a gymnasium, full size swimming pool, leisure pool, diving pool, and learners pool).

===Clubs and societies===
The Hereford Rowing Club (along with the Kayak Club) uses the [[River Wye]]; it is a popular club with a junior group. The stretch of river is also used for other water sports.
Hereford has a nine pin [[Skittles (sport)|skittle]] league, formed on 24 October 1902, and today consists of five divisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herefordskittles.org/public_html/pages/history.htm |title=Hereford Skittles Club |publisher=Herefordskittles.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

Hereford has other clubs and societies including the Railway Club, Welsh Club, Military Club, Richmond Place Club and the Whitecross [[Squash (sport)|Squash]] & Lawn [[Tennis]] Club.

Hereford has several music clubs/societies such as [[Hereford Youth Orchestra]], a group for those up to the age of 18 which anyone in and around the Herefordshire area can audition for. The orchestra is conducted by both Sir Richard Mynors and Hazel Davies.

==Education==

===University===
Herefordshire is one of only three English counties not to have a university. However, until 1977 Hereford was home to [[Hereford College of Education]], a higher education institution which offered teacher training qualifications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1975/mar/27/hereford-college-of-education |title=UK Parliament Hansard |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

Plans are now in progress to create, from scratch, a New University in Hereford, to teach STEM subjects from 2017.<ref>http://nmite.org.uk/</ref>

===Colleges===
Hereford is home to five colleges, including:
*[[Hereford College of Arts]] – a publicly funded art school located on Folly Lane, with a [[Higher Education]] centre on Whitecross Road, and a Media Centre on Bath Street. The [[University of Gloucestershire]] and universities in Wales co-operate to provide degree qualifications.
*[[Herefordshire College of Technology|Herefordshire and Ludlow College]] (formerly known as Hereford College of Technology) – the only main higher education facility in the county, and the largest in terms of property ownership. In late 2005 HCT secured £28.4 million from the [[Learning and Skills Council]] to fund a new Learning Village, which would secure Further Education for the long term in a county that has no university. Herefordshire Council announced preliminary work would begin in early 2006,<ref>BBC News (2005-12-12) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/4521552.stm "£28 m funding for city's colleges"].
