==History==

===Launch===
'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''' now known as (AJA) was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the BBC's [[Arabic language]] television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html|title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station|publisher=Allied-media|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>

The [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ($137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.

[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]
Al Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; increased to 12 hours by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable, as well as through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although [[Qatar]], like many other Arab countries, barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.

At the time of Al Jazeera's launch, [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref>

Al Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the [[Arabsat]] satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments ([[Qatar]] had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.

In presenting "The opinion and the other opinion" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting [[Israelis]] speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on [[Arab Radio and Television Network|Arab TV]] for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect. Al Jazeera was also becoming a favorite sounding board for militant groups such as Hamas and Chechen separatists.

Al Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.

===Around the clock===
1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html|title=A decade of growth|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=1 November 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees, and the agency had bureaus at a dozen sites as far as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.

However controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the [[Saudi Arabia]]-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in [[Arabian language|Arabic]]. Al Jazeera launched a free [[Arabic language]] web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].

===War in Afghanistan===
Al Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joel Campagna|url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php|title=Between Two Worlds|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=October 2001|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jennifer Bryson|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml|title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified?|publisher=Newsmax|date=30 October 2001|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Eskenazi|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/|title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says|publisher=Jweekly|date=17 October 2003|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news|author=Fouad Ajami|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all|title=What the Muslim World Is Watching|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 November 2001|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>

Many other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage. [[CNN International]] had exclusive rights to it for six hours before other networks could broadcast, a provision that was broken by the others on at least one controversial occasion.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jason Gay|url=http://observer.com/2001/10/cnn-snaps-back-to-action/|title=CNN Snaps Back to Action|newspaper=New York Observer|date=29 October 2001|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] soon appeared on an Al Jazeera talk show on 14 November 2001 to state Britain's case for pursuing the Taliban into [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Risen|first=James|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/12/world/a-nation-challenged-propaganda-interview-with-bin-laden-makes-the-rounds.html?src=pm|title=A nation challenged – Interview With bin Laden Makes the Rounds|location=New York City; Great Britain; Washington (DC); Afghanistan|newspaper=NY Times|date=12 December 2001|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref>

Al Jazeera's prominence rose during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] because it had opened a bureau in [[Kabul]] before the war began. This gave it better access for videotaping events than other networks, which bought Al Jazeera's footage, sometimes for as much as $250,000.<ref name="books.google.com">Mohammed El-Nawawy, 2003. Al-jazeera: The Story of the Network That Is Rattling Governments and Redefining Modern Journalism.

The network remained dependent on government support in 2002, with a budget of $40&nbsp;million and ad revenues of about $8&nbsp;million. It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, [[Al Arabiya]], an offshoot of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]], which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.<ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Feuilherade|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2780985.stm|title=Al-Jazeera competitor launches|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 February 2003|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>

===2003 Iraq War===
Before and during the United States-led invasion of [[Iraq]], where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.

Al Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel. An English language web site had launched earlier in March 2003. The channel had about 1,300 to 1,400 employees, its newsroom editor told [[The New York Times]]. There were 23 bureaus around the world and 70 foreign correspondents, with 450 journalists in all.

On 1 April 2003, a United States plane fired on Al Jazeera's [[Baghdad]] bureau, killing reporter Tareq Ayyoub.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan Steele|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/apr/09/iraq.guardianobituaries|title=Obituary: Tareq Ayyoub|newspaper=the Guardian|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=18 November 2012|location=London}}</ref> The attack was called a mistake; however, Qatar had supplied the US with a precise map of the location of the bureau in order to spare it from attack.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2928153.stm|title=Foreign media suffer Baghdad losses|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>Robert Fisk: ''The Independent'', 2 November 2011. Retrieved 5 November 2011</ref>

[[Afshin Rattansi]] became the channel's first English-language broadcast journalist after he left the BBC Today Programme, after the death of UK Government Scientist, [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]].

==Organization==
The original Al Jazeera channel was launched 1 November 1996 by an emiri decree with a loan of 500 million [[Qatari riyal]]s (US$137&nbsp;million) from the [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Hugh Miles, 2005.

Many governments in the Middle East deploy state-run media or government censorship to impact local media coverage and public opinion, leading to international objections regarding press freedom and biased media coverage.<ref name="boot" /> Some scholars and commentators use the notion of ''[[contextual objectivity]]'',<ref name="ref1" /> which highlights the tension between objectivity and audience appeal, to describe the station's controversial yet popular news approach.<ref name="tbsjournal fall02">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Fall02/Iskandar.html |title=The Minotaur of 'Contextual Objectivity': War coverage and the pursuit of accuracy with appeal |publisher=TBS Journal.com |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211102357/http://www.tbsjournal.com:80/Archives/Fall02/Iskandar.html |archivedate=11 February 2012 }}</ref>

Increasingly, Al Jazeera's exclusive interviews and other footage are being rebroadcast in American, British, and other [[western media outlets]] such as [[CNN]] and the [[BBC]]. In January 2003, the BBC announced that it had signed an agreement with Al Jazeera for sharing facilities and information, including news footage.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2668007.stm BBC in news deal with Arabic TV] ''BBC News'', published 17 January 2003</ref>

Al Jazeera's availability (via satellite) throughout the Middle East changed the television landscape of the region. Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including [[Saudi Arabia]], Kuwait, [[Bahrain]] and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about [[Syria]]'s relationship with [[Lebanon]], and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' ("The Opposite Direction"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country), to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name="boot">[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 Books of our Time: Al-Jazeera] at [[Google Video]]; TV programme feat.

At that time, Al Jazeera was not yet generally known in the Western world, but where it was known, opinion was often favourable<ref>E.g. in 1999, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[Thomas L. Friedman]] called Al-Jazeera "the freest, most widely watched TV network in the Arab world". – {{cite journal|author=Friedman, Thomas L.|title=Fathers and Sons|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 February 1999|pages=A27|url= }}</ref> and Al Jazeera claimed to be the only [[politics|politically]] independent television station in the Middle East. However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm|title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 November 2002|accessdate=12 April 2012|first=Kathryn|last=Westcott}}</ref>

Some observers have argued that Al Jazeera has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>

<blockquote>
The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed—and, more importantly, whether it is accepted—by the Palestinian public.
</blockquote>

Al Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world "operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]]. The ''[[New York Times]]'' stated in January 2011: "The protests rocking the Arab world this week have one thread uniting them: Al Jazeera,&nbsp;... whose aggressive coverage has helped propel insurgent emotions from one capital to the next." The newspaper quoted Marc Lynch, a professor of Middle East Studies at [[George Washington University]]: "They did not cause these events, but it's almost impossible to imagine all this happening without Al Jazeera."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/middleeast/28jazeera.html "Seizing a Moment, Al Jazeera Galvanizes Arab Frustration"], ''The New York Times'', 27 January 2011</ref>

With Al Jazeera's growing global outreach and influence, some scholars including [[Adel Iskandar]] have described the station as a transformation of the very definition of "[[alternative media]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tbsjournal.com/Iskandar.html |title=Is Al Jazeera Alternative?

===Al Jazeera English===
{{main|Al Jazeera English}}
[[File:Al Jazeera English Newsdesk.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Al Jazeera English]] newsroom]]
In 2003, Al Jazeera hired its first English-language journalists, among whom was [[Afshin Rattansi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afshinrattansi.com/|title=Afshinrattansi.com|publisher=Afshinrattansi|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref> from the BBC's [[Today Programme]].

In March 2003, it launched an English-language website.<ref>[http://aljazeera.com/ aljazeera.com] {{wayback|url=http://aljazeera.com/ |date=20120305100750 |df=y }}</ref> (see [[#On the Web|below]])

On 4 July 2005 Al Jazeera officially announced plans to launch a new English-language satellite service to be called [[Al Jazeera International]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/07/04/aljazeera.spread.ap/index.html|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20050710010536/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/07/04/aljazeera.spread.ap/index.html|archivedate=10 July 2005|title=Al Jazeera turns its signal West|publisher=Web.archive|date=10 July 2005|accessdate=12 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>
The new channel started at 12h [[GMT]] on 15 November 2006 under the name [[Al Jazeera English]] and has broadcast centers in [[Doha]] (next to the original Al Jazeera headquarters and broadcast center), London, [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Washington D.C. The channel is a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week news channel, with 12 hours broadcast from Doha, and four hours each from London, Kuala Lumpur, and Washington D.C.

Al Jazeera launched an English language channel, originally called '''Al Jazeera International''', in 2006. Among its staff were journalists hired from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Nightline]] and other top news outfits. [[Josh Rushing]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Power|url=http://matthewpower.net/Matthew_Power/GQRushing.html|title=Josh Rushing: From USMC to Al Jazeera|publisher=Matthew Power: GQ|date=June 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> a former media handler for [[CENTCOM]] during the [[Iraq]] war, agreed to provide commentary; [[David Frost]] was also on board.<ref>{{cite news|author=Deborah Soloman|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/magazine/12wwln_q4.html?_r=0|title=Bye-Bye, BBC|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 February 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4318284.stm|title=David Frost joins al-Jazeera TV|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 October 2005|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> In an interesting technical feat, the broadcast of the new operation was handed off between bases in [[Doha]], London, Washington, D.C., and [[Kuala Lumpur]] on a daily cycle.

The new English language venture faced considerable regulatory and commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jamal Dajani|url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=f3d3ade3488a2bca1e957e754c4ebd08|title=Al Jazeera English Falls Short of Expectations|publisher=New America Media|date=21 November 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Tony Burman |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/about/burman/letters/2006/11/aljazeera_should_be_available.html |title=Al-Jazeera should be available in Canada |newspaper=CBC |date=17 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430025039/http://www.cbc.ca/news/about/burman/letters/2006/11/aljazeera_should_be_available.html |archivedate=30 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6105952.stm|title=Al-Jazeera English TV date set|newspaper=BBC News|date=1 November 2006|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the [[Arabic language]]. There were hundreds of millions of potential viewers among the non-[[Arabic language]] speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who might be interested in seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny [[Qatar]], beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the [[BBC World Service]] was preparing to launch its own [[Arabic language]] station in 2007.

===Al Jazeera Balkans===
{{main|Al Jazeera Balkans}}
In 2011, Al Jazeera Media Network launched [[Al Jazeera Balkans]] based in [[Sarajevo]] and serving [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in both the [[Bosnian language]], [[Serbian language]] and the [[Croatian language]]. The look and feel of the network is similar to Al Jazeera English.

===Al Jazeera America===

In January 2013, [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] purchased [[Current TV]], which was partially owned by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Using part of Current TV's infrastructure, Al Jazeera launched an American news channel on 20 August 2013.

Though Current TV had large distribution throughout the United States on cable and satellite television, it averaged only 28,000 viewers at any time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stelter |first=Brian |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/current-tv-finds-a-good-number-within-its-tiny-ratings/|title=Current TV Finds a Good Number Within Its Tiny Ratings|newspaper=new York Times|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref> The acquisition of Current TV by Al Jazeera allowed [[Time Warner Cable]] to drop the network due to its low ratings, but they released a statement saying that they would consider carrying the channel after they evaluated whether it made sense for their customers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeerausannouncement.com/|title=Ali Velshi Joins Al Jazeera America|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/02/business/al-jazeera-current-tv/index.html?eref=edition |title=Al Jazeera buys Al Gore's Current TV|newspaper=CNN|accessdate=9 April 2013|date=3 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/usa/news/al-jazeera-buys-current-tv-252/ |title=Al Jazeera buys Current TV in bid for US airtime|newspaper=RT News|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/01/2013132255769130.html |title=Al Jazeera buys US channel Current TV|newspaper=Al Jazeera|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20896484#TWEET494584|title=Al Jazeera targets US expansion after buying Current TV|newspaper=BBC|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/03/time-warner-cable-al-jazeera-america_n_2404879.html|title=Time Warner Cable Will Consider Carrying Al Jazeera's U.S. Network|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013|first=Michael|last=Calderone}}</ref> Time Warner Cable later began carrying Al Jazeera America in December 2013.

Following the launch of Al Jazeera America, Al Jazeera English is no longer available in the United States. It had been available through live streaming over the Al Jazeera website, [[free to air]] [[DVB-S]] on the [[Galaxy 19]] (and [[Galaxy 23]] C-band) satellites, and it had been broadcast over the air in the Washington, DC DMA by WNVC on digital channel 30-5, and on digital channel 48.2 in the New York metro area, but those broadcasts were discontinued on 20 August 2013. Al Jazeera English had been available to cable TV viewers in [[Toledo, Ohio]]; [[Burlington, Vermont]]; New York City (WRNN rebroadcast), Washington State and Washington, D.C (a rebroadcast of WNVC's feed), but those sources were switched to Al Jazeera America on 20 August 2013. Many analysts had considered the limited availability of Al Jazeera English in the United States to be effectively a "black out".<ref name=HuffPo>[[Ryan Grim|Grim, Ryan]] (30 January 2011) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/30/al-jazeera-english-us_n_816030.html Al Jazeera English Blacked Out Across Most Of U.S.], ''[[The Huffington Post]]''</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ronnie Lovler|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/02/20/INHD1HO6NG.DTL|title=Absence of Al Jazeera English in US is troubling|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=20 February 2011|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>

In contrast, in the United Kingdom, Al Jazeera English is available on the [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Freesat]] satellite platforms, as well as the standard terrestrial service (branded [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]), thus making it available to the vast majority of UK households. On 26 November 2013 it launched a HD simulcast on certain terrestrial transmitters.<ref>{{cite web|author=Al Jazeera|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/pressoffice/2013/11/al-jazeera-english-available-hd-freeview-20131126102749418462.html|title=Al Jazeera launches on Freeview HD|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>

Al Jazeera can also be freely viewed with a DVB-S receiver in Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East as it is broadcast on the [[SES Astra|Astra 1M]], [[Hot Bird|Eutelsat Hot Bird 13A]], [[Eutelsat 10A]], [[Arabsat|Badr 4]], [[Turksat 2A]], [[Thor 6]], [[Nilesat 102]], [[Hispasat 1C]] and [[Eutelsat 28A]] satellites. The [[Optus C1]] satellite in Australia carries the channel for free and from July 2012 is available at no extra charge to all subscribers to Australia's Foxtel pay-TV service.

The Arabic version of the site was brought offline for about 10 hours by an [[FBI]] raid on its ISP, [[InfoCom Corporation]], on 5 September 2001. InfoCom was later convicted of exporting to [[Syria]] and [[Gaddafi]]-ruled [[Libya]], of knowingly being invested in by a [[Hamas]] member (both of which are illegal in the United States), and of underpaying customs duties.<ref>{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20060221123700 |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/txn/PressRel04/elashi_conv.pdf |title=Elisha Brothers convicted }}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>

in 2014 Al Jazeera Media Network launched an online only channel called [[AJ+]]. The channel is based out of the former Current TV studios in San Francisco and has outposts in Doha, Kuala Lumpur and other locations. It is independent of all of Al Jazeera's other channels and is mostly in an on demand format. The channel launched on 13 June 2014 on with a preview on YouTube.

==Controversies associated with Al Jazeera==
{{main|Al Jazeera controversies and criticism}}
While Al Jazeera has a large audience in the Middle East, the organization and the original Arabic channel in particular have taken criticism and been involved in several controversies.<ref>[http://aljazeera.com/News/Archive/Archive?ArchiveID=38330 Al Jazeera under fire]  {{dead link|date=April 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

===Algeria===
On 27 January 1999, several Algerian cities lost power simultaneously, reportedly to keep residents from watching a program in which Algerian dissidents implicated the Algerian military in a series of massacres.<ref name="boot"/><ref name="ref1"/><ref name="Algeria"/>

On 4 July 2004, the Algerian government froze the activities of Al Jazeera's Algerian correspondent. The official reason given was that a reorganization of the work of foreign correspondents was in progress. The international pressure group [[Reporters Without Borders]] says, however, that the measure was really taken in reprisal for a broadcast the previous week of another ''Al-Itijah al-Mouakiss'' debate on the political situation in Algeria.<ref>[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10868 RSF strongly condemns ban on al-Jazeera] {{wayback|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10868 |date=20061128064744 |df=y }}</ref>

===Bahrain===
In May 2000, Bahrain banned Al Jazeera broadcast due to channel's comments about Bahrain's municipal elections, labelling it as "serving Zionism".<ref name=der29july>{{cite news|last=Derhally|first=Massoud|title=Al Jazeera row causes Saudi Al Watan to attack Qatari FM|url=http://m.arabianbusiness.com/al-jazeera-row-causes-saudi-al-watan-attack-qatari-fm-139910.html|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=Arabian Business|date=29 July 2002}}</ref>

During his visit to [[Egypt]] in November 2011, [[Nabeel Rajab]], the president of [[Bahrain Centre for Human Rights]], criticized Al Jazeera's coverage of the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahraini uprising]], saying that it represents an Arabic double standard. Rajab commented, "Al Jazeera's intentional ignoring for coverage of Bahrain protests makes me strongly believe that we need channels that are sponsored by people rather than by regimes".<ref name="Tahrir 2.11.2011">{{cite news | author=Ahmed Al Samany | title = حقوقي بحريني: "استقبال "العسكري" للملك رسال سيئة.. والجزيرة تجاهلت أحداث البحرين" | date=2 November 2011 | publisher=Tahrir newspaper | url = http://tahrirnews.com/%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF/%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%88%D9%82%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A-%C2%AB%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84-%C2%AB%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%C2%BB-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84/#.TrEbQEK3etk.twitter | accessdate=2015-05-17}}</ref>

===China===
In May 2012 Chinese authorities refused to renew Al Jazeera correspondent's press credentials and visa, or allow a replacement journalist. Al Jazeera consequently closed its bureau in Beijing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2012/05/201257195136608563.html|title=Al Jazeera English to close China bureau|date=8 May 2012|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> Al Jazeera re-opened a bureau in China in 2014.

During the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], on 30 January, the Egyptian government ordered the TV channel to close its offices.

In August 2013, [[Memri]] translated an 17 August 2013 clip from Al Jazeera, in which Gamal Nasser, a former Muslim Brotherhood official and Al Jazeera commentator, said that General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] is "of Jewish origin" and "implementing a Zionist plan to divide Egypt".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/3948.htm|title=Al-Jazeera Commentator, Former MB Official, Gamal Nassar: Al-Sisi is Jewish, Implementing Protocols of Elders of Zion in Egypt}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/el-sissis-uncle-the-haganah-member/|title=El-Sissis's uncle, the Haganah member}}</ref>

In late June 2014, three Al Jazeera English employees were sentenced to seven- to ten-year jail terms on "terrorism" charges for news reports deemed supportive of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.

===India===
The Indian government banned the Al-Jazeera TV channel in April 2015 for five telecast days as it repeatedly displayed wrong maps of India. The Surveyor General of India (SGI) had observed that in some of the maps displayed by Al Jazeera, "a portion of Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir (i.e. PoK and Aksai Chin) has not been shown as a part of Indian territory."

The SGI asserted that it was outrageous that the channel also did not show Lakshadweep and Andaman Islands as Indian territories in some of the maps. The SGI also said that the maps were not in accordance with the Survey of India copyright map and is also against the National Map policy, 2005 and map restriction policy issued by Ministry of Defence from time to time. The Ministry of External Affairs also pointed out similar airing of a wrong map by the channel.

In their reply to a Show Cause Notice, Al Jazeera said that all maps that are displayed by them are generated by an internationally known software used by Global News Providers. The channel also added that it takes Indian government's concerns about maps very seriously and accordingly reviews all its India and Pakistan maps to ensure compatibility with recent official UN map. As per the order of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, the Inter Ministerial Committee which was also attended by representatives of the Ministry of External Affairs, after deliberations, held that the channel had clearly violated the provisions of the programme code and prohibited transmission or re-transmission of the channel throughout India for five days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/al-jazeera-penalised-for-showing-wrong-map-of-india-off-air-for-5-days-757255|title=Al Jazeera Penalised for Showing Wrong Map of India, Off Air for 5 Days|date=22 April 2015|work=NDTV.com|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

On 13 March 2008, Israel announced a "boycott" of the Arabic broadcaster al-Jazeera, accusing it of bias particularly during coverage of the conflict in the Gaza Strip and of slanted coverage favoring [[Hamas]]. Ministers will refuse to do interviews and according to some reports, will deny visa applications from its staff. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Majali Wahbe accused the Qatari-owned station of prioritizing/focusing exclusively on Palestinian suffering, and ignoring Israeli suffering. "We have seen that Al-Jazeera has become part of Hamas . . . taking sides and cooperating with people who are enemies of the state of Israel," said Wahbe, a [[Durzi|Druse]] Arab. "The moment a station like Al-Jazeera gives unreliable reports, represents only one side, and doesn't present the positions of the other side, why should we cooperate?", adding: "These reports are untrustworthy and they hurt us, and they arouse people to terrorist activities." Israeli officials backed their claim by saying al-Jazeera had covered the Gaza incursion but not the Palestinian rocket attacks against the Israeli city of Ashkelon. Wahabi said that the [[Foreign Ministry of Israel|Israeli Foreign Ministry]] would send letters of complaint to the government of Qatar and Al Jazeera. Officials of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party also accuse al-Jazeera of being biased in favour of Hamas, with which it is at political loggerheads, and prominent Fatah official and former Gaza strongman Mohammed Dahlan has organized a lawsuit against the broadcaster.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7292676.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Middle East – Israel accuses al-Jazeera of bias|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015|work=BBC News|date=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-to-boycott-al-jazeera-tv-claiming-incitement-to-terror-1.241188|title=Israel to boycott Al-Jazeera TV, claiming incitement to terror|author=DPA|date=12 March 2008|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2008/03/13/israel_imposes_sanctions_on_al_jazeera/|newspaper=The Boston Globe|first=Matti|last=Friedman|title=Israel imposes sanctions on Al-Jazeera|date=13 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanonews.net/node/11685|title=Israel boycotts Al-Jazeera|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

In February 2009, Israel again imposed sanctions on Al Jazeera after Qatar closed the Israeli trade office in [[Doha]] in protest to the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. Initially, Israel contemplated declaring Al Jazeera a hostile entity and shutting down its Israel offices, but after a legal review, the Israeli government decided instead to impose limited measures to restrict Al Jazeera's activities in the country. All Al Jazeera employees would not have their visas renewed, and the Israeli government would issue no new visas. Al Jazeera staff would also not be allowed to attend government briefings and reduced access to government and military offices or interview [[Knesset]] members. The station would only be allowed access to three official spokespersons: The [[Office of the Prime Minister (Israel)|Prime Minister's Office]], the [[Foreign Ministry of Israel|Foreign Ministry]], and the [[IDF Spokesperson's Unit]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2009/February/Govt-Sanctions-on-al-Jazeera-in-Israel-/|title=Gov't.

===Palestinian National Authority===
On 15 July 2009, the [[Palestinian National Authority]] closed down Al Jazeera's offices in the West Bank, apparently in response to claims made on the channel by [[Farouk Kaddoumi]] that PA President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] had been involved in the death of [[Yasser Arafat]]. In a statement announcing the decision, the Palestinian Information Ministry said the station's coverage was "unbalanced" and accused it of incitement against the PLO and the PA.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8152418.stm|title=Al-Jazeera closed in West Bank|newspaper=BBC News|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>

===Syria===
In January 2013 a former News Editor at Al Jazeera, who was from Syria, and had been at Al Jazeera for "nearly a decade" was fired without cause given, but in an interview stated their belief that it was linked to his/her resistance of ongoing strong pressure to conform to biased coverage of the Syrian civil war. The former Editor stated that the Muslim Brotherhood was "controlling the Syrian file at Al-Jazeera" with both organizations biasing news coverage in favour of the Brotherhood ousting the Syrian government of Assad by force and warning the then-editor "the majority [in Syria] is with the Muslim Brotherhood and [taking power] is within our grasp" so  "thank your god if you get a pardon when we become the government." The source named the names of several other former employees who resigned in protest, including director of the Berlin bureau Aktham Sleiman, a Syrian, "who was, at the beginning, with the [Syrian] opposition" but resisted what the interviewee terms the "lies and despicable [political and ethnic] sectarianism" and concluded that "Al-Jazeera has lied and is still lying" about Syria and in favour of armed overthrow and of the Muslim Brotherhood.<ref>[http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_65277.shtml An exclusive interview with a news editor of Al-Jazeera Channel] at AxisOfLogin</ref><ref>[http://www.filmyboxoffice.com/news/interview-with-a-former-journalist-in-the-qatari-al-jazeera.html An exclusive interview with a news editor of Al-Jazeera Channel] at FilmBoxOffice</ref>

''[[Shariah]] and Life'' (''al-Sharīʿa wa al-Ḥayāh'') is an Al Jazeera Arabic show with an estimated audience of 60 million worldwide and stars Muslim preacher [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], who is described as "Islam's Spiritual 'Dear Abby'".<ref name="Influential 500">No.9 Sheikh Dr Yusuf al Qaradawi, Head of the International Union of Muslim Scholars – "The 500 most influential Muslims in the world 2009", Prof John Esposito and Prof Ibrahim Kalin – Edmund A.

In January 2013, Al Jazeera was nominated for the Responsible Media of the Year award at the [[British Muslim Awards]].<ref name="asianimage">{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.asianimage.co.uk/news/10197507.Winners_honoured_at_British_Muslim_Awards/|title=Winners honoured at British Muslim Awards|work= |location= |publisher=''Asian Image''|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref>

==Competitors==
* [[Al Mayadeen]] is a pan-Arabist satellite television channel launched on 11 June 2012 in Lebanon. The channel, claims Gulf-supported media, aims at reducing the influence of the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya networks, both funded by oil-rich Sunni Arab countries in the Persian Gulf. However, it is said to plan to present an alternative to mainstream Arab satellite media, largely dominated by these two channels.
* In response to Al Jazeera, a group of Saudi investors created [[Al Arabiya]] in the first quarter of 2003. Despite (especially initial) skepticism over the station's Saudi funding (cf. [[#History|History]]) and a perception of censorship of anti-Saudi content,<ref>{{cite web|author=Attacks on the Press 2004: Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.cpj.org/attacks04/mideast04/saudi.html|title=Attacks on the Press – 2004: Mideast|publisher=Cpj.org|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref> Al Arabiya has successfully emulated Al Jazeera, garnered a significant audience share, and has also become involved in controversy – Al Arabiya has been severely criticised by the Iraqi and US authorities and has had journalists killed on the job.<ref>{{cite news|last=Feuilherade|first=Peter|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3236654.stm|title=Profile: Al Arabiya TV|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 November 2003|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4743050.stm|title=Shock over Iraqi reporter's death|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 February 2006|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref>
* In order to counter a perceived bias of Al Jazeera, the U.S. government in 2004 founded [[Al Hurra]] ("the free one"). Al Hurra is forbidden to broadcast to the US under the provisions of the [[Smith–Mundt Act]]. A [[Zogby International|Zogby]] poll found that 1% of Arab viewers watch Al Hurra as their first choice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=7&section=0&article=77899&d=16&m=2&y=2006|title=Time for the Last Hurrah for US' Al-Hurra|newspaper=Arab News|date=16 February 2006|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref> while an Ipsos-MENA poll from March–May 2008 showed that Al Hurra was drawing more viewers in Iraq than Al Jazeera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscpublicdiplomacy.com/index.php/newswire/cpdblog_detail/alhurra_locates_the_arab_street/|title=Alhurra Locates the "Arab Street"|publisher=USC Center on Public Diplomacy|date=7 January 2009|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> Citing these figures, [[Alvin Snyder]], author and former [[United States Information Agency|USIA]] executive, referred to Al Hurra as a "go to" network in Iraq.<ref name=Snyder>{{cite web|last=Snyder|first=Alvin|title=ALHURRA LOCATES THE "ARAB STREET"|url=http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/index.php/newswire/cpdblog_detail/alhurra_locates_the_arab_street/|publisher=University of Southern California Center on Public Diplomacy|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>
* Another competitor is [[Al-Alam News Network|Al Alam]], Established in 2003 by [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]], it broadcasts continuously. It seeks to address the most challenging issues of the Muslim and [[Arab world]] and the Middle East.
* A further competitor is the [[Rusiya Al-Yaum]] channel – the first Russian TV news channel broadcasting in Arabic and headquartered in Moscow, Russia. Rusiya Al-Yaum started broadcasting on 4 May 2007. The Channel is established and operated by ''[[RIA Novosti]]'', the same news agency that launched [[Russia Today TV]] in December 2005 to deliver a Russian perspective on news to English-speaking audiences, and "Rusiya Al-Yaum" is indeed a translation of "Russia Today" into Arabic.
* The BBC launched [[BBC Arabic Television]] on 11 March 2008, an Arabic-language news channel in North Africa and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7288062.stm|newspaper=BBC News|title=BBC launches Arabic TV channel|date=11 March 2008|accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> This is the second time that the BBC has launched an Arabic language TV channel; as mentioned [[#History|above]], the demise of the original BBC World Service Arabic TV channel had at least contributed to the founding of the original Al Jazeera Arabic TV channel.
* [[Deutsche Welle]] began broadcasting in Arabic in 2002. On 12 September 2011, the German international broadcaster launched DW (Arabia), its Arabic language television channel for North Africa and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltveurope.net/15056/deutsche-welle-debuts-arabic-channel/|title=Deutsche Welle debuts Arabic channel|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> The network has expanded from an initial two-hour block to 16 hours of daily programming in Arabic starting March 2014. The schedule is completed with 8 hours of English language programming. In February 2014, DW (Arabia) announced the acquisition of reprise transmission rights of Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef's popular show [[El Bernameg|''AlBernameg'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw-television-to-broadcast-series-by-egyptian-satirist-bassem-youssef/a-17404680|title=DW television to broadcast series by Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef|work=DW.DE|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>
* When [[Euronews]] started broadcasting its programs in Arabic on 12 July 2008, it entered into competition with Al Jazeera. Arabic is the eighth language in which Euronews is broadcast, after English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese.
* Since the launch of [[Al Jazeera English]], Al Jazeera directly competes with [[BBC World]] and [[CNN International]], as do a growing number of other [[international broadcasting|international broadcasters]] such as [[Deutsche Welle]], [[France 24]], [[NHK World]], and [[RT (TV network)|RT]].
* [[Al Jazeera America]] is in direct competition with American networks [[Cable News Network|CNN]], [[MSNBC]], [[FOX News Channel]] and in certain markets [[TheBlaze|The Blaze]] and [[RT (TV network)|RT]].
