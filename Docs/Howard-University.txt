==History==
[[File:MainandMiner Hall.GIF|thumb|left|Main Hall (right) and Miner Hall in 1868.]]
Shortly after the end of the [[American Civil War]], members of The First Congregational Society of Washington considered establishing a theological seminary for the education of African-American clergymen. Within a few weeks, the project expanded to include a provision for establishing a university. Within two years, the University consisted of the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Medicine. The new institution was named for General [[Oliver Otis Howard]], a Civil War hero, who was both the founder of the University and, at the time, Commissioner of the [[Freedman bureau|Freedmen's Bureau]]. Howard later served as President of the university from 1869–74.<ref name="official_history">{{cite web |url=http://www.howard.edu/explore/history.htm |title=Brief History of Howard University |publisher=Howard.edu |accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref>

U.S. Congress chartered Howard on March 2, 1867, and much of its early funding came from endowment, private benefaction, and tuition. An annual congressional appropriation administered by the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] funds Howard University and Howard University Hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/programs/howard/ |title=U.S. Department of Education funding of Howard University}}</ref>

Many improvements were made on campus. Howard Hall was renovated and made a dormitory for women. J. Stanley Durkee, Howard's last white president, was appointed in 1918.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/94/9403/woodson.html |title=Woodson at the Library of Congress}}</ref>

Howard University has played an important role in [[American history]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] on a number of occasions. [[Alain Locke]], Chair of the Department of Philosophy and first [[African American]] [[Rhodes Scholar]], authored ''[[The New Negro]]'', which helped to usher in the [[Harlem Renaissance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africawithin.com/bios/alain_locke.htm |title=Biography of Alan Locke.}}</ref> [[Ralph Bunche]], the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner of African descent, served as chair of the Department of [[Political Science]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1950/bunche-bio.html |title=Biography of Ralph Johnson Bunche.}}</ref> Beginning in 1942, Howard University students pioneered the "stool-sitting" technique, which was to play a prominent role in the later civil rights movement. By January, 1943, students had begun to organize regular sit-ins and pickets at cigar stores and cafeterias around Washington, D.C. which refused to serve them because of their race. These protests continued until the administration asked the students to stop in the Fall of 1944.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[The Crisis]] | date = November 1944 |last = Murray | first = Pauli | authorlink = Pauli Murray | title = A Blueprint for First Class Citizenship}} reprinted in {{cite book |last1=Carson |first1=Clayborne |authorlink1=Clayborne Carson |last2=Garrow |first2=David J. |authorlink2=David J.

In 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive [[affirmative action]] to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/speeches.hom/650604.asp |title=University of Texas speeches archive}}</ref> At the time, the Voting Rights bill was still pending in the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Lyndon B.|title=To Fulfill These Rights|url=http://www.whatsoproudlywehail.org/curriculum/the-meaning-of-america/to-fulfill-these-rights|publisher=What So Proudly We Hail|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>

In 1975 the historic [[Freedman's Hospital]] closed after 112 years of use as [[Howard University College of Medicine|Howard University College of Medicine's]] primary teaching hospital. Howard University Hospital opened that same year and continues to be used as Howard University College of Medicine's primary teaching hospital with service to the surrounding community.

In 1989, Howard gained national attention when students rose up in protest against the appointment of then-Republican National Committee Chairman [[Lee Atwater]] as a new member of the university's Board of Trustees. Student activists disrupted Howard's 122nd anniversary celebrations, and eventually occupied the university's Administration building.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957283,00.html |title=Saying No to Lee Atwater |publisher=Time Warner |work=Time.com |first=Alessandra | last=Stanley |author2=Jacob V. Lamar |date=March 20, 1989}}</ref> Within days, both Atwater and Howard's President, [[James E. Cheek]], resigned.

In April 2007 the head of the faculty senate called for the ouster of Howard University President [[H. Patrick Swygert]], saying that the school was in a state of crisis and it was time to end "an intolerable condition of incompetence and dysfunction at the highest level."<ref name="Wapo31007">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030902184.html |title=Ouster Sought of Howard President |authors=Susan Kinzie and Keith L.

Six years later, in 2013, university insiders again alleged that the university was in crisis. In April, the vice chairwoman of the university's board of trustees wrote a letter to her colleagues harshly criticizing the university's president and calling for a vote of no confidence; her letter was subsequently obtained by the media where it drew national headline.<ref name=CHE_2013_BOT_letter>{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/article/In-Ominous-Letter-a-Trustee/139689/ |title=In Ominous Letter, a Trustee Blasts Howard U.'s President and Board Chair |author=Jack Stripling |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name=WP_2013_BOT_letter>{{cite news |url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-07/local/39811315_1_howard-s-colleges-board-chairman |title=Howard trustee says university in 'trouble' |author=Nick Anderson |publisher=The Washington Post |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref> Two months later, the university's Council of Deans alleged that "fiscal mismanagement is doing irreparable harm," blaming the university's senior vice president for administration, chief financial officer and treasurer and asking for his dismissal.<ref name=WP_2013_Council_of_Dean>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/howard-academic-deans-allege-fiscal-mismanagement/2013/07/01/ecd78f90-e0d8-11e2-8ae9-5db15d3c0fca_story.html |title=Howard academic deans allege 'fiscal mismanagement' |author=Nick Anderson |publisher=The Washington Post |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref> In October, the faculty voted no confidence in the university's Board of Trustees executive committee, two weeks after university president Sidney A.
