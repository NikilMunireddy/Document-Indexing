'''Hindi''' ({{lang-hi|[[wikt:हिन्दी|हिन्दी]] ''hindī''|links=no}}), sometimes spelled हिंदी, also called '''Modern Standard Hindi''' ({{lang-hi|मानक हिन्दी ''mānak hindī''}}), is a [[Standard language|standardised]] and [[Sanskrit#Influence on other languages|Sanskritised]] [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of the [[Hindustani language]]. Hindi is an official language of the Union of [[India]], and the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Hindi belt|Hindi belt languages]].

In the 2001 Indian census, 258 million people in India reported Hindi to be their native language. However, this number includes tens of millions of people who are [[first language|native speakers]] of related languages but who consider their speech to be a dialect of Hindi.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

Hindi is the fourth-most natively spoken language in the world, after [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]].<ref name="Nationalencyklopedin">Mikael Parkvall, "Världens 100 största språk 2007" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]''.  Asterisks mark the
 [http://www.ne.se/spr%C3%A5k/v%C3%A4rldens-100-st%C3%B6rsta-spr%C3%A5k-2010 2010 estimates] for the top dozen languages.</ref>

==Official status==
Article 343 (1) of the Indian constitution states:

<blockquote>"The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in [[Devanagari]] script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals."<ref name="auto"/></blockquote>

Article 351 of the [[Indian constitution]] states

<blockquote>"It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-indexenglish.htm|title=Constitution of India |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

It was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the Union Government by 1965 (per directives in Article 344 (2) and Article 351),<ref name=eighthschedule>{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/govt/documents/hindi/PARTXVII.pdf |title=Rajbhasha |publisher=india.gov.in |language=Hindi, English |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131084820/http://www.india.gov.in/govt/documents/hindi/PARTXVII.pdf |archivedate=19 January 2012}}</ref> with state governments being free to function in the language of their own choice. However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in [[South India]] (such as the [[anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|those in Tamil Nadu]]), [[Maharashtra]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]], led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

At the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following Indian states: [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Uttarakhand]]. Each may also designate a "co-official language"; in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, depending on the political formation in power, this language is generally [[Urdu]]. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of official language in the following [[Union Territories]]: [[Andaman & Nicobar Islands]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Dadra & Nagar Haveli]], [[Daman & Diu]], [[National Capital Territory]].

National-language status for Hindi is a long-debated theme. An Indian court clarified that Hindi is not the national language of India because the constitution does not mention it as such.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hindi-not-a-national-language-court/article94695.ece |title=Hindi, not a national language: Court |date=25 January 2010<!-- 17:41 IST--> |publisher=The Hindu |accessdate=20 March 2014 }}</ref>

===Outside India===
Outside [[Asia]] a form of Hindi is an official language in [[Fiji]]. However, this is not the same language as the official language of India. The Hindi spoken in Fiji is [[Fiji Hindi]], a form of [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], whereas the Modern Standard Hindi of India is a form of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. Hindi is also spoken by a large population of  [[Madheshi]]s (people having roots in north-india but have migrated to nepal over hundreds of years) of [[Nepal]] In [[Pakistan]], being extermely close to [[Urdu]], Hindi is easily understood. Apart from this, Hindi is spoken by the large [[Indian diaspora]] which hails from, or has its origin from the "Hindi Belt" of India. A substantially large Indian diaspora lives in countries like The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], The [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] and many other countries, where it is natively spoken at home and among communities. Outside [[India]], Hindi speakers are 100,000 in the [[USA]]; 685,170 in [[Mauritius]]; 890,292 in [[South Africa]]; 232,760 in [[Yemen]]; 147,000 in [[Uganda]]; 5,000 in [[Singapore]]; 8 million in [[Nepal]]; 20,000 in [[New Zealand]]; 30,000 in [[Germany]].<ref>[http://hindinideshalaya.nic.in/english/hindi_orgin/introduction.html An introduction to Hindi] Official English version website of the [[Central Hindi Directorate]]</ref> The picture below shows the various parts of the world, where Hindi is spoken n understood by people, based on the population of the Hindi-speaking, Indian diaspora and the inteligibility of the language.

==History==
{{further|History of Hindustani}}
Hindi is considered to be a direct descendant of [[Sanskrit]], through [[Prakrit]] and [[Apabhramsha]]. It has been influenced by [[Dravidian languages]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[English language|English]].<ref>http://hindinideshalaya.nic.in/english/hindi_orgin/introduction.html</ref> Hindi emerged as [[Apabhramsha]] (Sanskrit:अपभ्रंश; Corruption or corrupted speech), a degenerated form of [[Prakrit]], in the 7th century A.D. By the 10th century A.D., it became stable. [[Braj]], [[Awadhi]], [[Khari Boli]] etc. are the dialects of Hindi. The dialect of [[Hindustani]] on which Standard Hindi is based is ''[[Khariboli dialect|Khariboli]]'', the vernacular of [[Delhi]] and the surrounding western [[Uttar Pradesh]] and southern [[Uttarakhand]]. ''[[Urdu]]'', literally meaning, "the language of the camp", a dialect of Hindustani, acquired official [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|linguistic prestige]] in the later [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]] (1800s). In the late 19th century, the movement standardising a written language from Khariboli, for the Indian masses in North India, started to standardise Hindi as a separate language from Urdu, which was learnt by the Mughal elite. In 1881, [[Bihar]] accepted Hindi as its sole official language, replacing Urdu, and thus became the first state of India to adopt Hindi.

After independence, the government of India instituted the following conventions:{{Or|date=August 2011}}
* standardisation of grammar: In 1954, the Government of India set up a committee to prepare a grammar of Hindi; The committee's report was released in 1958 as ''A Basic Grammar of Modern Hindi''.
* standardisation of the orthography, using the [[Devanagari]] script, by the Central Hindi Directorate of the Ministry of Education and Culture to bring about uniformity in writing, to improve the shape of some Devanagari characters, and introducing diacritics to express sounds from other languages.

The Constituent Assembly adopted Hindi as an [[Languages with official status in India|official language of India]] on 14 September 1949. Now, it is celebrated as [[Hindi Day]].

== Comparison with Modern Standard Urdu ==
{{see also|Hindi–Urdu controversy|Hindustani phonology|Hindustani grammar}}
[[Linguistics|Linguistically]], Hindi and [[Urdu]] are two registers of the same language. Hindi is written in the [[Devanagari]] script and uses more [[Sanskrit]] words, whereas [[Urdu]] is written in the [[Perso-Arabic]] script and uses more Arabic and Persian words. Hindi along with English is the most commonly used  official language in India. Urdu is the official language of [[Pakistan]] (along with English), and is one of the 22 official languages of [[India]].

==Script==
{{See also|Devanagari}}
Hindi is written in Devanagari script (देवनागरी लिपि ''devanāgarī lipi''). Devanagari consists of 11 [[Devanagari script#Vowels|vowels]] and 33 [[Devanagari script#consonants|consonants]] and is written from left to right. It is an [[abugida]] as well.

===Romanization===
{{main|Devanagari transliteration}}
The [[Government of India]] uses [[Hunterian transliteration]] as its official system of writing Hindi in the Latin script. Various other systems also exist, such as [[IAST]], [[ITRANS]] and [[ISO 15919]].

==Vocabulary==
{{further|Hindustani etymology|List of Sanskrit and Persian roots in Hindi}}
Traditionally, Hindi words are divided into five principal categories according to their etymology:
* '''[[Tatsama]]''' (तत्सम "same as that") words: These are words which are spelled the same in Hindi as in Sanskrit (except for the absence of final case inflections).<ref name="sirysq">Masica, p. 65</ref> They include words inherited from Sanskrit via [[Prakrit]] which have survived without modification (e.g. Hindi नाम ''nām'' / Sanskrit नाम ''nāma'', "name"; Hindi कर्म ''karm'' / Sanskrit कर्म ''karma'', "deed, action; [[karma]]"),<ref>Masica, p. 66</ref> as well as forms borrowed directly from Sanskrit in more modern times (e.g. प्रार्थना ''prārthanā'', "prayer").<ref>Masica, p. 67</ref> Pronunciation, however, conforms to Hindi norms and may differ from that of classical Sanskrit. Amongst nouns, the ''tatsam'' word could be the Sanskrit non-inflected word-stem, or it could be the nominative singular form in the Sanskrit nominal declension.
* '''Ardhatatsama''' (अर्धतत्सम "semi-tatsama") words: Such words have typically undergone sound changes subsequent to being borrowed. (e.g. Hindi सूरज ''sūraj'' from Sanskrit सूर्य ''surya'')
* '''[[Tadbhava]]''' (तद्भव "born of that") words: These are words that are spelled differently from in Sanskrit but are derivable from a Sanskrit prototype by phonological rules (e.g. Sanskrit कर्म ''karma'', "deed" becomes [[Pali]] कम्म ''kamma'', and eventually Hindi काम ''kām'', "work").<ref name = "sirysq"/>
* '''Deshaj''' (देशज) words: These are words that were not borrowings but do not derive from attested Indo-Aryan words either. Belonging to this category are [[onomatopoetic]] words or ones borrowed from local non-[[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] languages.
* '''Videshī''' (विदेशी "foreign") words: These include all [[loanwords]] purportedly from non-indigenous languages. The most frequent sources identified in this category have been [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], [[English language|English]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Examples are कमेटी ''kameṭī'' from English ''committee'' and Hindi साबुन ''sābun'' "soap" from Arabic].

===Sanskrit===
Much of Modern Standard Hindi's vocabulary is derived from Sanskrit, either as ''tatsama'' or ''tadbhava'', especially in technical and academic field. The Hindi standard, from which much of the Persian, Arabic and English vocabulary has been purged and replaced by [[neologism]]s compounding ''tatsam'' words, is called ''Shuddha Hindi'' (pure Hindi), and is viewed as a more prestigious dialect over other more colloquial forms of Hindi.

Excessive use of ''tatsama'' words creates problems for native speakers. They may have Sanskrit consonant clusters which do not exist in native Hindi. The educated middle class of India may be able to pronounce such words, but others have difficulty. Persian and Arabic vocabulary given 'authentic' pronunciations cause similar difficulty.

===Persian===
Hindi also features significant [[Persian language|Persian]] influence, standardized from spoken [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].<ref name="kachru">{{cite book|last1=Kachru|first1=Yamuna|title=Hindi|date=2006|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=9789027238122|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Many have come to take the place of ''tatsama'' vocabulary, such as दरवाज़ा ''darvāzā'' "door" (''tatsama'' द्वारा ''dvārā''), and many more are used alongside ''tatsama'' words.

===Arabic===
[[Arabic]] also shows influence in Hindi, often via Persian but sometimes directly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=D.|first1=S.|title=Arabic and Hindi|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2011/02/arabic_and_hindi|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>

==Media==

===Literature===
{{Main|Hindi literature}}
Hindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being ''[[Bhakti]]'' (devotional – [[Kabirdas|Kabir]], [[Raskhan]]); ''Shringar'' (beauty – [[Keshav]], [[Bihari (poet)|Bihari]]); ''Virgatha'' (extolling brave warriors); and ''Adhunik'' (modern).

Medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of [[Bhakti]] movement and the composition of long, epic poems. It was primarily written in other [[Hindi languages|varieties of Hindi]], particularly [[Avadhi]] and [[Braj Bhasha]], but also in [[Khariboli]]. During the [[British Raj]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] became the prestige dialect. Hindustani with heavily [[Sanskrit]]ised vocabulary or ''Sahityik'' Hindi (Literary Hindi) was popularised by the writings of [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]], [[Bhartendu Harishchandra]] and others. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Hindustani popular with the educated people.

[[Chandrakanta (novel)|Chandrakanta]], written by [[Devaki Nandan Khatri]] in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/756105/stop-outraging-over-marathi-hindi-and-english-chauvinism-is-much-worse-in-india|title=Stop outraging over Marathi – Hindi and English chauvinism is much worse in India}}</ref> The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was [[Munshi Premchand]], who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement.

The ''Dwivedi Yug'' ("Age of Dwivedi") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after [[Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi]], who played a major role in establishing the Modern Hindi language in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love.

In the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as ''[[Chhayavaad]]'' (''shadowism'') and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as ''Chhayavaadi''. [[Jaishankar Prasad]], [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']], [[Mahadevi Varma]] and [[Sumitranandan Pant]], are the four major ''Chhayavaadi'' poets.

''Uttar Adhunik'' is the post-modernist period of Hindi literature, marked by a questioning of early trends that copied the West as well as the excessive ornamentation of the [[Chhayavaad]]i movement, and by a return to simple language and natural themes.

===Internet===
Hindi has a steadily increasing presence on the [[internet]], with 402 million Indians with access to the web as of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/internet-users-in-india-to-reach-402-million-by-dec-2015-49-growth-over-last-year-287989.html |title=Internet users in India to reach 402 million by Dec 2015; 49 percent growth over last year – Tech2 |website=Tech.firstpost.com |date=2015-11-17 |accessdate=2016-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/india-to-have-402-million-internet-users-by-december-end-iamai-766216 |title=India to Have 402 Million Internet Users by December-End: IAMAI |website=Gadgets.ndtv.com |date=2015-11-17 |accessdate=2016-01-06}}</ref>

The [[Hindi Wikipedia]] was the first Indic-language wiki to reach 100,000 articles.
