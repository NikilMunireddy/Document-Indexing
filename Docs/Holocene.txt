The Holocene also encompasses the growth and impacts of the human species worldwide, including [[History of writing|all its written history]], development of major civilizations, and overall significant transition toward urban living in the present. Human impacts on modern-era [[Earth]] and its [[ecosystem]]s may be considered of global significance for future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] evidence, or more recently [[atmospheric]] evidence of human impacts. Given these, a new term, ''[[Anthropocene]]'', is specifically proposed and used informally only for the very latest part of [[modern history]] and of significant human impact since the epoch of the ''[[Neolithic Revolution]]'' (around 12,000 years [[Before Present|BP]]).

==Overview==
It is accepted by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] that the Holocene started approximately 11,700 years before AD 2000.<ref name="Walker, M. 2009. pp. 3"/> The epoch follows the [[Pleistocene]] and the [[last glacial period]] (local names for the last glacial period include the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsinan]] in North America,<ref name=Clayton1982>{{cite journal|last1=Clayton|first1=L.|last2=Moran|first2=S.R.|title=Chronology of late wisconsinan glaciation in middle North America|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|date=1982|volume=1|issue=1|pages=55–82|doi=10.1016/0277-3791(82)90019-1|ref=Clayton1982}}</ref> the [[Weichselian glaciation|Weichselian]] in Europe,<ref name=Svendsen1999>{{cite journal|last1=Svendsen|first1=J.I.|last2=Astakhov|first2=V.I.|last3=Bolshiyanov|first3=D.Y.|last4=Demidov|first4=I.|last5=Dowdeswell|first5=J.A.|last6=Gataullin|first6=V.|last7=Hjort|first7=C.|last8=Hubberten|first8=H.W.|last9=Larsen|first9=E.|last10=Mangerud|first10=J.|last11=Melles|first11=M.|last12=Moller|first12=P.|last13=Saarnisto|first13=M.|last14=Siegert|first14=M.J.|title=Maximum extent of the Eurasian ice sheets in the Barents and Kara Sea region during the Weichselian|journal=Boreas|date=1999|volume=28|issue=1|pages=234–242|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3885.1999.tb00217.x|ref=Svendsen1999}}</ref> the Devensian in the United Kingdom,<ref name=Eyles1989>{{cite journal|last1=Eyles|first1=N.E.|last2=McCabe|first2=A.M.|title=The Late Devensian (<22,000 BP) Irish Sea Basin: The sedimentary record of a collapsed ice sheet margin|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|date=1989|volume=8|issue=4|pages=307–351|doi=10.1016/0277-3791(89)90034-6|ref=Eyles1989}}</ref> the Llanquihue in Chile<ref name=Denton1999>{{cite journal|last1=Denton|first1=G.H.|last2=Lowell|first2=T.V.|last3=Heusser|first3=C.J.|last4=Schluchter|first4=C.|last5=Andersern|first5=B.G.|last6=Heusser|first6=L.E.|last7=Moreno|first7=P.I.|last8=Marchant|first8=D.R.|title=Geomorphology, stratigraphy, and radiocarbon chronology of LlanquihueDrift in the area of the Southern Lake District, Seno Reloncavi, and Isla Grande de Chiloe, Chile|journal=Geografiska Annaler Series A Physical Geography|date=1999|volume=81A|issue=2|pages=167–229|doi=10.1111/j.0435-3676.1999.00057.x|ref=Denton1999}}</ref> and the Otiran in New Zealand<ref name=Newnham2007>{{cite journal|last1=Newnham|first1=R.|last2=Vandergoes|first2=M.|last3=Hendy|first3=C.|last4=Lowe|first4=D.J.|last5=Preusser|first5=F.|title=A terrestrial palynological record for the last two glacial cycles from southwestern New Zealand|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|date=2007|volume=26|pages=517–535|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2006.05.005|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277379106001843|accessdate=15 June 2014|ref=Newnham2007}}</ref>).

The [[Blytt–Sernander system|Blytt–Sernander classification]] of climatic periods defined, initially, by plant remains in [[peat moss]]es, is now being explored currently by geologists working in different regions studying sea levels, peat bogs and ice core samples by a variety of methods, with a view toward further verifying and refining the Blytt–Sernander sequence. They find a general correspondence across Eurasia and North America, though the method was once thought to be of no interest. The scheme was defined for [[Northern Europe]], but the [[climate change]]s were claimed to occur more widely. The periods of the scheme include a few of the final pre-Holocene oscillations of the last glacial period and then classify climates of more recent [[prehistory]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

[[Paleontologists]] have defined no [[faunal stage]]s for the Holocene. If subdivision is necessary, periods of human technological development, such as the [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Bronze Age]], are usually used. However, the time periods referenced by these terms vary with the emergence of those technologies in different parts of the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Climatically, the Holocene may be divided evenly into the [[Holocene Climatic Optimum|Hypsithermal]] and [[Neoglaciation|Neoglacial]] periods; the boundary coincides with the start of the [[Bronze Age]] in European civilization. According to some scholars, a third division, the [[Anthropocene]], began in the 18th century.<ref>[[Fred Pearce]] (2007). ''With Speed and Violence'', p. 21. ISBN 978-0-8070-8576-9</ref>

Continental motions due to [[plate tectonics]] are less than a kilometre over a span of only 10,000 years. However, ice melt caused world [[Sea level rise|sea levels to rise]] about {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} due to [[post-glacial rebound]] over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6226537/England-is-sinking-while-Scotland-rises-above-sea-levels-according-to-new-study.html |title=England is sinking while Scotland rises above sea levels, according to new study |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2014-06-10}}</ref>

The sea level rose and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from [[Vermont]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Michigan]]. Other than higher-latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain, and cave deposits.  Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely [[tectonic uplift]] of non-glacial origin.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Post-glacial rebound in the [[Scandinavia]] region resulted in the formation of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The region continues to rise, still causing weak [[earthquake]]s across [[Northern Europe]]. The equivalent event in [[North America]] was the rebound of [[Hudson Bay]], as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial [[Tyrrell Sea]] phase, to near its present boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Climate has been fairly stable over the Holocene. [[Ice core]] records show that before the Holocene there was global warming after the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] and cooling periods, but climate changes became more regional at the start of the [[Younger Dryas]]. During the transition from the last glacial to the Holocene, the [[Huelmo–Mascardi Cold Reversal]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] began before the Younger Dryas, and the maximum warmth flowed south to north from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. It appears that this was influenced by the residual glacial ice remaining in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] until the later date.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The [[Holocene climatic optimum|hypsithermal]] was a period of warming in which the global climate became warmer. However, the warming was probably not uniform across the world. This period of warmth ended about 5,500 years ago with the descent into the [[Neoglacial]]. At that time, the climate was not unlike today's, but there was a slightly warmer period from the 10th–14th centuries known as the [[Medieval Warm Period]]. This was followed by the [[Little Ice Age]], from the 13th or 14th century to the mid 19th century, which was a period of significant cooling, though not everywhere as severe as previous times during neoglaciation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Compared to glacial conditions, habitable zones have expanded northwards, reaching their northernmost point during the hypsithermal. Greater moisture in the polar regions has caused the disappearance of [[steppe-tundra]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The temporal and spatial extent of Holocene climate change is an area of considerable uncertainty, with solar forcing recently proposed to be the origin of cycles identiﬁed in the North Atlantic region. Climate cyclicity through the Holocene ([[Bond events]]) has been observed in or near marine settings and is strongly controlled by glacial input to the North Atlantic.<ref name="Bond1997">{{cite journal| author = Bond, G. | url=http://rivernet.ncsu.edu/courselocker/PaleoClimate/Bond%20et%20al.,%201997%20Millenial%20Scale%20Holocene%20Change.pdf | year = 1997 | title = A Pervasive Millennial-Scale Cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and Glacial Climates | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 278 | issue = 5341 | pages = 1257–1266 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5341.1257 | bibcode=1997Sci...278.1257B|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Bond |first=G. |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=Persistent Solar Influence on North Atlantic Climate During the Holocene |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5549 |pages=2130–2136 |doi=10.1126/science.1065680 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=11739949 |bibcode = 2001Sci...294.2130B |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Periodicities of ~2500, ~1500, and ~1000 years are generally observed in the North Atlantic.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bianchi | first1 = G.G. | last2 = McCave | first2 = I.N. | year = 1999 | title = Holocene periodicity in North Atlantic climate and deep-ocean flow south of Iceland | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 397 | issue = | pages = 515–517 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Viau | first1 = A.E. | last2 = Gajewski | first2 = K. | last3 = Sawada | first3 = M.C. | last4 = Fines | first4 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Millennial-scale temperature variations in North America during the Holocene | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 111 | issue = | page = D09102 | doi = 10.1029/2005JD006031 | bibcode=2006JGRD..111.9102V}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Debret | first1 = M. | last2 = Sebag | first2 = D. | last3 = Crosta | first3 = X. | last4 = Massei | first4 = N. | last5 = Petit | first5 = J.-R. | last6 = Chapron | first6 = E. | last7 = Bout-Roumazeilles | first7 = V. | year = 2009 | title = Evidence from wavelet analysis for a mid-Holocene transition in global climate forcing | url = | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 2675–2688 | doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2009.06.005}}</ref> At the same time spectral analyses of the continental record, which is remote from oceanic influence, reveal persistent periodicities of 1000 and 500 years that may correspond to solar activity variations during the Holocene epoch.<ref name="Krav">{{cite journal | last1 = Kravchinsky | first1 = V.A. | last2 = Langereis | first2 = C.G. | last3 = Walker | first3 = S.D. | last4 = Dlusskiy | first4 = K.G. | last5 = White | first5 = D. | year = | title = Discovery of Holocene millennial climate cycles in the Asian continental interior: Has the sun been governing the continental climate?. | url = | journal = Global and Planetary Change | volume = 110 | issue = | pages = 386–396 | doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.02.011}}</ref> A 1500-year cycle corresponding to the North Atlantic oceanic circulation may have widespread global distribution in the Late Holocene.<ref name="Krav" />

Animal and plant life have not evolved much during the relatively short Holocene, but there have been major shifts in the distributions of plants and animals. A [[Pleistocene megafauna|number of large animals]] including [[mammoth]]s and [[mastodon]]s, [[saber-toothed cat]]s like ''[[Smilodon]]'' and ''[[Homotherium]]'', and [[giant sloth]]s disappeared in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene—especially in North America, where animals that survived elsewhere (including horses and camels) became extinct. This extinction of American [[megafauna]] has been explained as caused by the arrival of the ancestors of [[Amerindian]]s; though most scientists assert that climatic change also contributed. In addition, a controversial [[bolide impact]] over North America has been hypothesized to have triggered the [[Younger Dryas]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dalton | first1 = Rex | year = | title = Blast from the Past?

Throughout the world, ecosystems in cooler climates that were previously regional have been isolated in higher altitude ecological "islands".{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The ''[[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 ka event]]'', an abrupt cold spell recorded as a negative excursion in the {{delta|18|O|link}} record lasting 400 years, is the most prominent climatic event occurring in the Holocene epoch, and may have marked a resurgence of ice cover. It is thought that this event was caused by the final drainage of [[Lake Agassiz]], which had been confined by the glaciers, disrupting the [[thermohaline]] circulation of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eos.ubc.ca/research/glaciology/research/Publications/ClarkeLeveringtonTellerDyke(QSR-2004).pdf|title=Paleohydraulics of the last outburst flood from glacial Lake Agassiz and the 8200 BP cold event |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2003.06.004 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}</ref>

The beginning of the Holocene corresponds with the beginning of the [[Mesolithic]] age in most of [[Europe]]; but in regions such as the [[Middle East]] and [[Anatolia]] with a very early [[neolithisation]], [[Epipaleolithic]] is preferred in place of Mesolithic. Cultures in this period include: [[Hamburg culture|Hamburgian]], [[Federmesser culture|Federmesser]], and the [[Natufian culture]], during which [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|the oldest inhabited places still existing on Earth]] were first settled, such as [[Jericho]] in the [[Middle East]],<ref name="encyclopedia1">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043547/Jericho "Jericho"], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref> as well as evolving archeological evidence of [[origin of religion|proto-religion]] at locations such as [[Göbekli Tepe]], as long ago as the [[9th millennium BCE]].<ref name="Smithsonian">{{cite web|url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/30706129.html |title= Göbekli Tepe: The World’s First Temple? |last=Curry |first=Andrew |date = November 2008|publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=2009-03-14 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090317075937/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/30706129.html |archivedate= 17 March 2009 }}</ref>

Both are followed by the aceramic Neolithic ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) and the pottery [[Neolithic]].  The Late Holocene brought advancements such as the bow and arrow and saw new methods of warfare in North America.  Spear throwers and their large points were replaced by the bow and arrow with its small narrow points beginning in Oregon and Washington.  Villages built on defensive bluffs indicate increased warfare, leading to food gathering in communal groups for protection rather than individual hunting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snow|first=Dean|title=Archaeology of Native North America|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River NJ}}</ref>
