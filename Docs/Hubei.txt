'''Hubei''' ({{zh|c=湖北}}) is a [[Provinces of China|province]] of China, located in the easternmost part of [[Central China]]. The name of the province means "north of the lake", referring to its position north of [[Dongting Lake]].<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces], [[People's Daily Online]].</ref> The provincial capital is [[Wuhan]], a major transportation thoroughfare and the political, cultural, and economic hub of Central China.

Hubei is officially abbreviated to "鄂" (''È''), an ancient name associated with the eastern part of the province since the [[Qin dynasty]], while a popular name for Hubei is "楚" (''Chǔ''), after the powerful [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] that existed here during the [[Eastern Zhou dynasty]]. It borders [[Henan]] to the north, [[Anhui]] to the east, [[Jiangxi]] to the southeast, [[Hunan]] to the south, [[Chongqing]] to the west, and [[Shaanxi]] to the northwest. The high-profile [[Three Gorges Dam]] is located at [[Yichang]], in the west of the province.

== History ==
The Hubei region was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures.<ref>Zhang Chi 張弛, “The Qujialing-Shijiahe Culture in the Middle Yangzi River Valley,” in A Companion to Chinese Archaeology, ed. Anne P. Underhill (Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, 2013), 510–34; Rowan K. Flad and Pochan Chen, Ancient Central China: Centers and Peripheries along the Yangzi River (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013).</ref> By the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (770–476 BC), the territory of today's Hubei was part of the powerful [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]]. Chu was nominally a tributary state of the [[Zhou dynasty]], and it was itself an extension of the Chinese civilization that had emerged some centuries before in the north; but it was also a culturally unique blend of northern and southern culture, and was a powerful state that held onto much of the middle and lower [[Yangtze River]], with power extending northwards into the [[North China Plain]].<ref>Constance A. Cook and John S. Major, eds. Defining Chu: Image and Reality in Ancient China, (Honolulu: University of Hawai’i Press, 1999); Lothar von Falkenhausen, Chinese Society in the Age of Confucius (1000–250 BC): The Archaeological Evidence (Los Angeles: Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, 2006), 262–88.</ref>

During the [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BC) Chu became the major adversary of the upstart [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] to the northwest (in what is now [[Shaanxi]] province), which began to assert itself by outward expansionism. As wars between Qin and Chu ensued, Chu lost more and more land: first its dominance over the [[Sichuan Basin]], then (in 278 BC) its heartland, which correspond to modern Hubei. In 223 BC Qin chased down the remnants of the Chu regime, which had fled eastwards, as part of Qin's bid for the conquest of all China.

Qin founded the [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BC, the first unified state in the region. Qin was succeeded by the [[Han dynasty]] in 206 BC, which established the province (''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]'') of [[Jingzhou province|Jingzhou]] in what is now Hubei and [[Hunan]]. The Qin and Han played an active role in the agricultural colonization of Hubei, maintaining a system of river dikes to protect farmland from summer floods.<ref>Brian Lander. State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region . T'oung Pao 100.4-5 (2014): 325–362.</ref> Towards the end of the Han Dynasty in the beginning of the 3rd century, Jingzhou was ruled by regional warlord [[Liu Biao]]. After his death, Liu Biao's realm was surrendered by his successors to [[Cao Cao]], a powerful warlord who had conquered nearly all of north China; but in the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]], warlords [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]] drove Cao Cao out of Jingzhou. Liu Bei then took control of Jingzhou; he went on to conquer Yizhou (the Sichuan Basin), but lost Jingzhou to Sun Quan; for the next few decades Jingzhou was controlled by the [[Wu Kingdom]], ruled by Sun Quan and his successors.

The incursion of northern nomadic peoples into the region at the beginning of the 4th century began nearly three centuries of  division  into a nomad-ruled (but increasingly Sinicized) north and a [[Han Chinese]]-ruled south. Hubei, to the South, remained under southern rule for this entire period, until the unification of China by the [[Sui dynasty]] in 589. In 617 the [[Tang dynasty]] replaced Sui, and later on the Tang dynasty placed what is now Hubei under several [[circuit (political division)|circuits]]: [[Jiangnanxi Circuit]] in the south; [[Shannandong Circuit]] in the west, and [[Huainan Circuit]] in the east. After the Tang dynasty disintegrated in the 10th century, Hubei came under the control of several regional regimes: [[Jingnan]] in the center, [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] (later [[Southern Tang]]) to the east, and the [[Five Dynasties]] to the north.

The [[Song dynasty]] reunified the region in 982 and placed most of Hubei into [[Jinghubei Circuit]], a longer version of Hubei's current name. [[Mongol]]s conquered the region in 1279, and under [[Yuan dynasty|their rule]] the province of [[Huguang]] was established, covering Hubei, Hunan, and parts of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]]. During the Mongol rule, in 1334, Hubei was devastated by an outbreak of the [[Black Death]], which according to Chinese sources spread during the following three centuries to decimate populations throughout Eurasia.<ref>{{Cite book

The [[Ming dynasty]] drove out the Mongols in 1368. Their version of Huguang province was smaller, and corresponded almost entirely to the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan combined. While Hubei was geographically removed from the centers of the Ming power. During the last years of the Ming, today's Hubei was ravaged several times by the rebel armies of  [[Zhang Xianzhong]] and  [[Li Zicheng]]. The [[Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] which had much of the region in 1644, soon split Huguang into the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan. The Qing dynasty, however, continued to maintain a [[Viceroy of Huguang]], one of the most well-known being [[Zhang Zhidong]], whose modernizing reforms made Hubei (especially [[Wuhan]]) into a prosperous center of commerce and industry. The [[Huangshi]]/[[Daye, Hubei|Daye]] area, south-east of Wuhan, became an important center of mining and metallurgy.

In 1911 the [[Wuchang Uprising]] took place in modern-day Wuhan, overthrowing the Qing dynasty and establishing the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In 1927 Wuhan became the seat of a government established by left-wing elements of the [[Kuomintang]], led by [[Wang Jingwei]]; this government was later merged into [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government in [[Nanjing]]. During [[World War II]] the eastern parts of Hubei were conquered and occupied by [[Japan]] while the western parts remained under Chinese control.

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the 1960s, Wuhan saw fighting between rival [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] factions.

As the fears of a nuclear war increased during the time of [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]]s in the late 1960s, the [[Xianning]] prefecture of Hubei was chosen as the site of [[Underground Project 131|Project 131]], an underground military command headquarters.

The province—and Wuhan in particular—suffered severely from the [[1954 Yangtze River Floods]]. Large scale dam construction followed, with the [[Gezhouba Dam]] on the [[Yangtze River]] near [[Yichang]] started in 1970 and completed in 1988; the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]], further upstream, began in 1993. In the following years, authorities resettled millions of people from western Hubei to make way for the construction of the dam. A number of smaller dams have been constructed on the Yangtze's tributaries as well.

The [[Jianghan Plain]] takes up most of central and southern Hubei, while the west and the peripheries are more [[mountain]]ous, with ranges such as the [[Wudang Mountains]], the [[Jing Mountains]], the [[Daba Mountains]], and the [[Wu Mountains]] (in rough north-to-south order). The [[Dabie Mountains]] lie to the northeast of the Janghan Plain, on the border with [[Henan]] and [[Anhui]]; the [[Tongbai Mountains]] lie to the north on the border with [[Henan]]; to the southeast, the [[Mufu Mountains]] form the border with [[Jiangxi]]. The highest peak in Hubei is [[Shennong Peak]], found in the [[Daba Mountains]] and in the [[forestry]] area of [[Shennongjia]]; it has an altitude of 3105 m.

The two major river of Hubei are the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and its left tributary  [[Hanshui River|Hanshui]]; they give their name to the [[Jianghan Plain]]. The [[Yangtze River]] enters Hubei from the west via the [[Three Gorges]]; the eastern half of the [[Three Gorges]] ([[Xiling Gorge]] and part of [[Wu Gorge]]) lies in western Hubei, while the western half is in neighbouring [[Chongqing]]. The Hanshui enters the province from the northwest. After crossing most of the province, the two great rivers  meet at Wuhan, the provincial capital.

Among the notable tributaries of the Yangtze within the province are the  [[Shen Nong Stream]] (a small northern tributary, severely affected by the Three Gorges Dam project); the [[Qing River|Qing]], a major waterway of southwestern Hubei; the [[Huangbo River|Huangbo]] near [[Yichang]]; and the [[Fushui River|Fushui]] in the southeast.

Thousands of lakes dot the landscape of  Hubei's Jianghan Plain, giving Hubei the name of: "Province of Lakes"; the largest of these lakes are [[Lake Liangzi]] and [[Hong Lake]].  The numerous hydro dams created a number of large reservoirs, the largest of which is the [[Danjiangkou Reservoir]] on the Hanshui, on the border between Hubei and [[Henan]].

Hubei has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' or ''Cwa'' under the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold, with average temperatures of {{convert|1|to|6|°C|°F}} in January, while summers are hot and humid, with average temperatures of {{convert|24|to|30|°C|°F}} in July; punishing temperatures of {{convert|40|°C}} or above are widely associated with Wuhan, the provincial capital. The mountainous districts of western Hubei, in particular [[Shennongjia]], with their cooler summers, attract numerous visitors from Wuhan and other lowland cities.

Besides the capital [[Wuhan]], other important cities are [[Jingmen]]; [[Shiyan]], a center of automotive industry and the gateway to the [[Wudang Mountains]]; [[Yichang]], the main base for the gigantic hydroelectric projects of southwestern Hubei; and [[Shashi District|Shashi]].

== Administrative divisions ==
{{main|List of administrative divisions of Hubei}}
Hubei is divided into thirteen [[Administrative divisions of China#Prefectural level|prefecture-level divisions]] (of which there are twelve [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] (including a [[Sub-provincial divisions in the People's Republic of China|sub-provincial city]]) and one [[Autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China|autonomous prefecture]]), as well as three directly-administered [[County-level city|county-level cities]] (all [[Sub-prefecture-level city|sub-prefecture-level cities]]) and one directly-administered county-level forestry area.

The thirteen [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture-level divisions]] and four directly administered [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]] of Hubei are subdivided into 103 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]] (39 [[District of China|district]]s, 24 [[county-level cities]], 37 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]], 2 [[autonomous counties]], 1 forestry district; the directly-administered county-level divisions are included here). Those are in turn divided into 1234 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]] (737 [[town of China|town]]s, 215 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|township]]s, nine [[ethnic township]]s, and 273 [[subdistrict]]s).

Hubei is often called the "Land of Fish and Rice" ({{lang|zh-cn|鱼米之乡}}). Important agricultural products in Hubei include [[cotton]], [[rice]], [[wheat]], and [[tea]], while industries include [[automobiles]], metallurgy, machinery, power generation, textiles, foodstuffs and high-tech commodities.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com">http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/hubei-province/</ref>

[[Mineral]] resources that can be found in Hubei in significant quantities include [[borax]], [[hongshiite]], [[wollastonite]], [[garnet]], [[marlstone]], [[iron]], [[phosphorus]], [[copper]], [[gypsum]], [[rutile]], [[rock salt]], [[gold]] amalgam, [[manganese]] and [[vanadium]]. The province's recoverable reserves of [[coal]] stand at 548 million tons, which is modest compared to other Chinese provinces. Hubei is well known for its mines of fine turquoise and green faustite.

Once completed, the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in western Hubei will provide plentiful [[hydroelectricity]], with an estimated annual power production of 84,700 Gwh. Existing hydroelectric stations include [[Gezhouba Dam|Gezhouba]], [[Danjiangkou]], [[Geheyan]], [[Hanjiang Dam|Hanjiang]], [[Duhe]], [[Huanglongtan]], [[Bailianhe]], [[Lushui]] and [[Fushui]].

Hubei's economy ranks 11th in the country and its nominal GDP for 2011 was 1.959 trillion yuan (311 billion USD) and a per capita of 21,566 RMB (2,863 USD). The government of Hubei hopes to keep the GDP growth rate above 10% annually and double per capita GDP by 2020.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com"/>

People in Hubei speak [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dialects; most of these dialects are classified as [[Southwestern Mandarin]] dialects, a group that also encompasses the Mandarin dialects of most of southwestern China.

Perhaps the most celebrated element of [[Hubei cuisine]] is the [[Wuchang fish]], a freshwater [[bream]] that is commonly steamed.

Types of traditional [[Chinese opera]] popular in Hubei include [[:zh:汉剧 (湖北)|Hanju]] ({{zh|s=汉剧 |t=漢劇 |p=Hàn Jù}}) and [[Chuju (Chinese opera)|Chuju]] ({{zh|c=楚剧 |p=Chǔ Jù |labels=no}}).

The [[Shennongjia]] area is the alleged home of the ''[[Yeren]]'', a wild undiscovered [[Hominidae|hominid]] that lives in the forested hills.

The people of Hubei are given the uncomplimentary nickname "[[Nine-headed Bird]]s" by other Chinese, from a [[Chinese mythology|mythological]] creature said to be very aggressive and hard to kill. ''"In the sky live nine-headed birds. On the earth live Hubei people."'' ({{zh|s=天上九头鸟，地上湖北佬<!--|t=天上九頭鳥，地上湖北佬-->|p=Tiānshàng jiǔ tóu niǎo, dìshàng Húběi lǎo |labels=no}})

[[Wuhan]] is one of the major culture centers in China.

Hubei is thought to be the province that originated the card game of [[Dou Di Zhu]].

== Education==
The premier [[Wuhan University]] (founded in 1893) and many other institutions in Wuhan makes it a hub of higher education and research in China.

== Transportation ==
[[Image:Wuhan-boat-0157.jpg|thumb|Boats on the [[Yangtze River]] in [[Wuhan]]]]

Prior to the construction of China's national railway network, the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Hanshui]] Rivers had been the main transportation arteries of Hubei for many centuries, and still continue to play an important transport role.

Historically, Hubei's overland transport network was hampered by the lack of bridges across the [[Yangtze River]], which divides the province into northern and southern regions.  The first bridge across the Yangtze in Hubei, the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]] was completed in 1957, followed by the Zhicheng Bridge in 1971.  As of October 2014, Hubei had [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|23 bridges and tunnels]] across the Yangtze River, including nine bridges and three tunnels in Wuhan.

===Rail===
The [[Jingguang railway|railway from Beijing]] reached Wuhan in 1905, and was later extended to Guangzhou, becoming the first north-to-south railway mainline to cross China. A number of other lines crossed the province later on, including the [[Jiaozuo-Liuzhou Railway]] and [[Beijing-Kowloon Railway]], respectively, in the western and eastern part of the province.

The first decade of the 21st century has seen a large number of new railway construction in Hubei. The [[Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]], roughly parallel to the original Wuhan-Guangzhou line, opened in late 2009, and is currently being [[Shiwu Passenger Railway|extended to the north]], towards Beijing. A new east-west high-speed corridor connecting major cities along the Yangtze (the [[Huhanrong Passenger Dedicated Line]]) is being constructed as well: the [[Hewu Passenger Railway|Hefei-Wuhan]] section, which opened in 2009, has enabled fast service between Wuhan and Shanghai, while the [[Hanyi Railway|Wuhan-Yuchang]] and [[Yiwan Railway|Yichang-Wanzhou]] sections are (as of 2010) under construction.

===Air===
Hubei's main airport is [[Wuhan Tianhe International Airport]]. [[Yichang Sanxia Airport]] serves the Three Gorges region. There are also passenger airports [[Xiangfan Airport|in Xiangfan]], [[Enshi Airport|Enshi]], and [[Jingzhou]] ([[Shashi Airport]], named after the city's [[Shashi District]]).

== Tourism ==
The province's best-known natural attraction (shared with the adjacent [[Chongqing]] municipality) is the scenic area of the [[Three Gorges]] of the Yangtze. Located in the far west of the province, the gorges can be conveniently visited by one of the numerous tourist boats (or regular passenger boats) that travel up the Yangtze from [[Yichang]] through the [[Three Gorges]] and into the neighboring [[Chongqing]] municipality.

The [[Daba Mountains|mountains of western Hubei]], in particular in [[Shennongjia]] District, offer a welcome respite from Wuhan's and Yichang's summer heat, as well as skiing opportunities in winter. The tourist facilities in that area concentrate around [[Muyu, Hubei|Muyu]] in the southern part of Shennongjia, the gateway to Shennongjia National Nature Reserve (神农架国家自然保护区).  Closer to the provincial capital, Wuhan, is the [[Mount Jiugong]] (''Jiugongshan'') national park, in [[Tongshan County, Hubei|Tongshan County]] near the border with [[Jiangxi]].

A particular important site of both natural and cultural significance is [[Mount Wudang]] (''Wudangshan'') in the northwest of the province. Originally created early in the [[Ming Dynasty]], its building complex has been listed by [[UNESCO]] since 1994 as a [[World Heritage Site]].

Other historic attractions in Hubei include:
*The old [[Jingzhou]] City
*The [[Xianling]] Mausoleum, built by the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Jiajing Emperor]] for his parents at their [[fief]] near [[Zhongxiang]]<ref>Eric N. Danielson, "[http://www.chinaheritagenewsletter.org/articles.php?searchterm=016_mingancestor.inc&issue=016 The Ming Ancestor Tomb]"</ref>
*The [[Yellow Crane Tower]] in [[Wuhan]]
*The [[Hubei Provincial Museum]] in Wuhan, with extensive archaeological and cultural exhibits and performance presentations of ancient music and dance. This is one of the best places to learn about the ancient [[state of Chu]], which flourished in the territory of present-day Hubei during the [[Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] and developed its own unique culture, quite distinct from that of the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]]/[[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] civilization of northern China.

The province also has historical sites connected with China's more recent history, such as the [[Wuchang Uprising]] Memorial in Wuhan, [[Underground Project 131|Project 131]] site (a Cultural-Revolution-era underground military command center) in [[Xianning]], and the National Mining Park (国家矿山公园) in [[Huangshi]].<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-09/22/content_7046446.htm "Mining for tourism in Hubei"], By Li Jing (China Daily). Updated: 2008-09-22</ref>

== Sports ==
[[Image:Hustfields.jpg|thumb|University Stadium of [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology]] in Wuhan]]
Professional sports teams in Hubei include:
* [[Chinese Football Association Super League]]
* [[Wuhan Huanghelou]]

== Twinning ==
In 2005, Hubei province signed a twinning agreement with [[Telemark]] county of Norway. A "Norway-Hubei Week" was held in 2007.<ref>http://www.norway-hubei.net</ref>
