The '''Gulf of Mexico''' ({{lang-es|Golfo de México}}) is an [[oceanic basin|ocean basin]] largely surrounded by the [[North America]]n continent.<ref name="GNIS1">{{cite web|title=Gulf of Mexico|date=January 1, 2000|publisher=[[Geographic Names Information System]]|accessdate=July 8, 2010|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:558730}}</ref> It is bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], on the southwest and south by [[Mexico]], and on the southeast by [[Cuba]]. The [[United States|U.S.]] states of [[Texas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]] border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the "Third Coast" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the "south coast", in juxtaposition to the [[Great Lakes]] region being the "north coast." One of the gulf's seven main areas is the [[Gulf of Mexico basin]].

The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of [[plate tectonics]].<ref name="HuertaOther2012a">Huerta, A.D., and D.L.

It is connected to part of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] through the [[Florida Straits]] between the U.S. and Cuba, and with the [[Caribbean Sea]] (with which it forms the [[American Mediterranean Sea]]) via the [[Yucatan Channel]] between Mexico and Cuba. With the narrow connection to the Atlantic, the Gulf experiences very small [[Tides|tidal ranges]]. The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup> (615,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters. The basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters (550 quadrillion Imperial gallons, 660 quadrillion US gallons, 2.5 million km<sup>3</sup> or 600,000 cu mi).<ref name="epa">{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/gmpo/about/facts.html |title=General Facts about the Gulf of Mexico |publisher=epa.gov |accessdate=December 27, 2006}}</ref>

Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies [[Yucatan]], within the middle of the large supercontinent of [[Pangea]]. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the [[Marathon Uplift]] in West [[Texas]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]] of [[Oklahoma]], and to [[Alabama]] where it linked directly to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox, this mountain range was breached in Late [[Cretaceous]] times by the formation of the [[Mississippi Embayment]].<ref name="VanArsdale(2009)">Van Arsdale, R. B.

Van Arsdale (2002) ''The Mississippi Embayment, North America: a first order continental structure generated by the Cretaceous superplume mantle event.'' Journal of Geodynamics. 34:163–176.</ref>

Geologists and other Earth scientists agree in general that the present Gulf of Mexico basin originated in Late Triassic time as the result of [[rifting]] within Pangea. The rifting was associated with zones of weakness within Pangea, including sutures where the [[Laurentia]], South American, and African plates collided to create it. First, there was a Late Triassic-Early [[Jurassic]] phase of rifting during which [[rift valley]]s formed and filled with continental [[red beds]]. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical thickness, 35 [[kilometer]]s, of normal continental crust. It was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the [[Pacific Ocean]] across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the subsiding basin created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the Gulf of Mexico. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of [[Louann Salt]] and associated [[anhydrite]] [[evaporite]]s. Initially, during the Late Jurassic, continued rifting widened the Gulf of Mexico and progressed to the point that [[sea-floor spreading]] and formation of [[oceanic crust]] occurred. At this point, sufficient circulation with the Atlantic Ocean was established that the deposition of Louann Salt ceased.<ref name="Salvador(1991)"/><ref name="SternOther(2010)"/><ref name="Buffler(1991)">Buffler, R.

During the Late Jurassic through Early Cretaceous, the basin occupied by the Gulf of Mexico experienced a period of cooling and subsidence of the crust underlying it. The subsidence was the result of a combination of crustal stretching, cooling, and loading. Initially, the combination of crustal stretching and cooling caused about 5–7&nbsp;km of tectonic subsidence of the central thin transitional and oceanic crust. Because subsidence occurred faster than sediment could fill it, the Gulf of Mexico expanded and deepened.<ref name="Salvador(1991)"/><ref name="Galloway(2008)"/><ref name="SawyerOther(1991)">Sawyer, D. S., R. T. Buffler, and R. H. Pilger, Jr., 1991, ''The crust under the Gulf of Mexico basin,'' in A. Salvador, ed., pp. 53-72, The Gulf of Mexico Basin: The Geology of [[North America]], v. J., [[Geological Society of America]], [[Boulder, Colorado]].</ref>

Later, loading of the crust within the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent coastal plain by the accumulation of kilometers of sediments during the rest of the [[Mesozoic]] and all of the [[Cenozoic]] further depressed the underlying crust to its current position about 10–20&nbsp;km below sea level. Particularly during the Cenozoic, thick [[clastic wedge]]s built out the continental shelf along the northwestern and northern margins of the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name="Salvador(1991)"/><ref name="Galloway(2008)"/><ref name="SawyerOther(1991)"/>

To the east, the stable [[Florida platform]] was not covered by the sea until the latest Jurassic or the beginning of Cretaceous time. The Yucatan platform was emergent until the mid-Cretaceous. After both platforms were submerged, the formation of [[Carbonate rock|carbonates]] and [[evaporites]] has characterized the geologic history of these two stable areas. Most of the basin was rimmed during the Early Cretaceous by carbonate platforms, and its western flank was involved during the latest Cretaceous and early [[Paleogene]] periods in a compressive deformation episode, the [[Laramide Orogeny]], which created the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] of eastern Mexico.<ref name="gulfbase">[http://www.gulfbase.org/facts.php gulfbase.org]</ref>

In 2002 geologist Michael Stanton published a speculative essay suggesting an [[Impact event|impact origin]] for the Gulf of Mexico at the close of the [[Permian]], which could have caused the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]].<ref name="Stanton(2002)">Stanton, M.

Tulsa Oklahoma.</ref> However, Gulf Coast geologists do not regard this hypothesis as having any credibility. Instead they overwhelmingly accept plate tectonics, not an asteroid impact, as having created the Gulf of Mexico as illustrated by papers authored by Kevin Mickus and others.<ref name="HuertaOther2012a"/><ref name="SternOther(2010)"/><ref name="Galloway(2008)"/><ref name="MickusOther(2009)">Mickus, K., R.

Today, the Gulf of Mexico has the following 7 main areas:<ref name="gulfbase"/>
*[[Gulf of Mexico basin]], which contains the [[Sigsbee Deep]] and can be further divided into the continental rise, the [[Sigsbee Abyssal Plain]], and the [[Mississippi Cone]].
*[[Northeast Gulf of Mexico]], which extends from a point east of the [[Mississippi River Delta]] near [[Biloxi]] to the eastern side of [[Apalachee Bay]].
*[[South Florida Continental Shelf and Slope]], which extends along the coast from Apalachee Bay to the [[Straits of Florida]] and includes the Florida Keys and [[Dry Tortugas]].
*[[Campeche Bank]], which extends from the [[Yucatan Straits]] in the east to the [[Tabasco]]–[[Campeche Basin]] in the west and includes [[Arrecife Alacran]].
*[[Bay of Campeche]], which is an isthmian [[embayment]] extending from the western edge of Campeche Bank to the offshore regions just east of the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]].

Although [[Christopher Columbus]] was credited with the discovery of the Americas by Europeans, the ships in his four voyages never reached the Gulf of Mexico.  Instead, Columbus sailed into the [[Caribbean]] around Cuba and [[Hispaniola]]. The first [[Europe]]an exploration of the Gulf of Mexico was by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1497.  He followed the coastal land mass of [[Central America]] before returning to the Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Florida between [[Florida]] and Cuba. In his letters, Vespucci described this trip, and once [[Juan de la Cosa]] returned to [[Spain]], a [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|famous world map]], depicting Cuba as an island, was produced.

In 1506, [[Hernán Cortés]] took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba, receiving a large estate of land and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] slaves for his effort. In 1510, he accompanied [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]], an aide of the governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. In 1518 Velázquez put him in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization.

In 1517, [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (discoverer of Yucatán)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]] discovered the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. This was the first [[European ethnic groups|European]] encounter with [[Mesoamerican civilizations|an advanced civilization]] in the [[Americas]], with solidly built buildings and a complex social organization which they recognized as being comparable to those of the [[Old World]]; they also had reason to expect that this new land would have [[gold]]. All of this encouraged two further expeditions, the first in 1518 under the command of [[Juan de Grijalva]], and the second in 1519 under the command of Hernán Cortés, which led to the Spanish exploration, military invasion, and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the [[Conquest of Mexico]]. Hernández did not live to see the continuation of his work: he died in 1517, the year of his expedition, as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage, and disappointed in the knowledge that [[Diego Velázquez]] had given precedence to Grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to Yucatán.

In 1523, [[Ángel de Villafañe]] sailed toward [[Mexico City]], but was shipwrecked en route along the coast of [[Padre Island]], Texas, in 1554. When word of the disaster reached Mexico City, the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and immediately sent Villafañe marching overland to find the treasure-laden vessels. Villafañe traveled to Pánuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site, which had already been visited from that community. He arrived in time to greet García de Escalante Alvarado (a nephew of Pedro de Alvarado), commander of the salvage operation, when Alvarado arrived by sea on July 22, 1554. The team labored until September 12 to salvage the Padre Island treasure. This loss, in combination with other ship disasters around the Gulf of Mexico, gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern Gulf Coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways. As a result, the expedition of [[Tristán de Luna y Arellano]] was sent and landed at [[Pensacola Bay]] on August 15, 1559.

On December 11, 1526, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] granted [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] a license to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States, known as the [[Narváez expedition]]. The contract gave him one year to gather an army, leave Spain, be large enough to found at least two towns of 100 people each, and garrison two more fortresses anywhere along the coast. On April 7, 1528, they spotted land north of what is now [[Tampa Bay]]. They turned south and traveled for two days looking for a great harbor the master pilot Miruelo knew of. Sometime during these two days, one of the five remaining ships was lost on the rugged coast, but nothing else is known of it.

In 1697, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] sailed for [[France]] and was chosen by the Minister of Marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] and to colonize [[Louisiana]] which the [[England|English]] coveted. Iberville's fleet sailed from Brest on October 24, 1698. On January 25, 1699, Iberville reached Santa Rosa Island in front of [[Pensacola]] founded by the Spanish; he sailed from there to [[Mobile Bay]] and explored Massacre Island, later renamed [[Dauphin Island]]. He cast anchor between [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] and [[Ship Island]]; and on February 13, 1699, he went to the mainland, Biloxi, with his brother [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]].<ref name="Kevin_Knight">{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07614b.htm|title = Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville|publisher = newadvent.org| accessdate = May 8, 2009 | last=Kevin Knight |quote=}}</ref> On May 1, 1699, he completed a fort on the north-east side of the Bay of Biloxi, a little to the rear of what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]]. This fort was known as [[Fort Maurepas]] or Old Biloxi. A few days later, on May 4, Pierre Le Moyne sailed for France leaving his teenage brother, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, as second in command to the French commandant.

==Shipwrecks==
The ''Mardi Gras Shipwreck'' sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of Louisiana in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. She is believed to have been a [[privateer]] or trader. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). In May 2007, an expedition, led by Texas A&M University and funded by OGGC under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. As part of the project educational outreach [[Nautilus Productions]] in partnership with [[BOEM]], Texas A&M University, the [[Florida Public Archaeology Network]]<ref>{{cite web|title=FPAN Home|url=http://www.flpublicarchaeology.org/|website=Florida Public Archaeology}}</ref> and Veolia Envirommental produced a one-hour HD documentary<ref>{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}</ref> about the project, short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition. Video footage from the ROV was an integral part of this outreach and used extensively in the ''Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck'' documentary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck Documentary|url=http://mua.apps.uri.edu/in_the_field/mardigras.html|website=MUA}}</ref>

On July 30, 1942 the ''Robert E. Lee'', captained by  William C. Heath, was torpedoed by the {{GS|U-166|1941|6}}. She was sailing southeast of the entrance to the [[Mississippi River]] when the explosion destroyed the #3 hold, vented through the B and C decks and damaged the engines, the radio compartment and the steering gear. After the attack she was under escort by the ''USS PC-566'', captained by LCDR Herbert G. Claudius, en route to [[New Orleans]]. The ''USS PC-566'' began dropping depth charges on a sonar contact, sinking the ''U-166''. The badly damaged ''Robert E. Lee'' first listed to port then to starboard and finally sank within about 15 minutes of the attack. One officer, nine crewmen and 15 passengers were lost. Ironically the passengers aboard the ''Robert E. Lee'' were primarily survivors of previous torpedo attacks by German U-boats.<ref>{{cite web

The German submarine ''U-166'' was a [[German Type IXC submarine|Type IXC]] [[U-boat]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]]. The submarine was laid down on 6 December 1940 at the [[Seebeckwerft]] (part of [[Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG]], Deschimag) at [[Bremerhaven|Wesermünde]] (modern Bremerhaven) as yard number 705, launched on 1 November 1941 and commissioned on 23 March 1942 under the command of ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' Hans-Günther Kuhlmann. After training with the [[4th U-boat Flotilla]], ''U-166'' was transferred to the [[10th U-boat Flotilla]] for front-line service on 1 June 1942.

In 2001 the wreck of ''U-166'' was located in 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of water, less than two miles from where it had attacked the ''Robert E. Lee''. An archaeological survey of the seafloor prior to construction of a natural gas pipeline led to the discoveries by C & C Marine archaeologists Robert A. Church and Daniel J. Warren. The sonar contacts consisted of two large sections lying approximately 500 feet apart at either end of a debris field that indicated the presence of a U-boat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Daniel J.

The Gulf of Mexico's eastern, northern, and northwestern shores lie along the US states of Florida, Alabama, [[Mississippi]], Louisiana, and Texas.  The US portion of the Gulf coastline spans {{convert|1680|mi|km}}, receiving water from 33 major rivers that drain 31 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/water/waterplan/documents/05guidance.htm#gulf |title=National Water Program Guidance: FY 2005 |publisher=epa.gov |accessdate=January 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061002133559/http://www.epa.gov/water/waterplan/documents/05guidance.htm |archivedate=October 2, 2006 }}</ref> The Gulf's southwestern and southern shores lie along the [[Mexican state]]s of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Veracruz]], Tabasco, [[Campeche]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], and the northernmost tip of [[Quintana Roo]]. The Mexican portion of the Gulf coastline spans 1,743 miles (2,805&nbsp;km). On its southeast quadrant the Gulf is bordered by Cuba. It supports major American, Mexican and Cuban fishing industries. The outer margins of the wide continental shelves of Yucatán and Florida receive cooler, [[nutrient]]-enriched waters from the deep by a process known as [[upwelling]], which stimulates plankton growth in the [[euphotic zone]]. This attracts fish, shrimp, and squid.<ref name="tshaonline">{{cite web | url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rrg07 | title=Gulf of Mexico | work=Handbook of Texas Online | publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref> [[River]] drainage and atmospheric fallout from industrial coastal cities also provide nutrients to the coastal zone.

The [[Gulf Stream]], a warm Atlantic Ocean current and one of the strongest [[ocean current]]s known, originates in the gulf, as a continuation of the [[Caribbean Current]]-Yucatán Current-[[Loop Current]] system. Other circulation features include the anticyclonic [[gyre]]s which are shed by the Loop Current and travel westward where they eventually dissipate, and a permanent cyclonic gyre in the Bay of Campeche. The Bay of Campeche in Mexico constitutes a major arm of the Gulf of Mexico.  Additionally, the gulf's shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets. A number of rivers empty into the gulf, most notably the Mississippi River and Rio Grande in the northern gulf, and the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] rivers in the southern gulf. The land that forms the gulf's coast, including many long, narrow barrier islands, is almost uniformly low-lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach.

The Gulf of Mexico is an excellent example of a [[passive margin]]. The [[continental shelf]] is quite wide at most points along the coast, most notably at the Florida and Yucatán Peninsulas. The shelf is exploited for its [[petroleum|oil]] by means of offshore drilling rigs, most of which are situated in the western gulf and in the Bay of Campeche. Another important commercial activity is fishing; major catches include [[Lutjanus campechanus|red snapper]], [[amberjack]], [[tilefish]], [[swordfish]], and various [[grouper]], as well as [[shrimp]] and [[crabs]].  [[Oysters]] are also harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds. Other important industries along the coast include shipping, petrochemical processing and storage, military use, paper manufacture, and tourism.

The gulf's warm water temperature can feed powerful Atlantic [[hurricane]]s causing extensive human death and other destruction as happened with [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. In the Atlantic, a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths and making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow in its wake (warm water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation). However, the Gulf is shallower; when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds and becomes capable of supporting another tropical storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |title=Warm Waters Provide Fuel for Potential Storms |publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=May 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061001040517/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |archivedate=October 1, 2006 }}</ref>

The Gulf is considered [[aseismic]]; however, mild tremors have been recorded throughout history (usually 5.0 or less on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]). Earthquakes may be caused by interactions between sediment loading on the sea floor and adjustment by the crust.<ref>{{cite web

===Maritime boundary delimitation agreements===
'''Cuba and Mexico:''' Exchange of notes constituting an agreement on the [[Boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of the exclusive economic zone of Mexico in the sector adjacent to Cuban maritime areas (with map), of July 26, 1976.

'''Cuba and United States of America:''' [[Maritime boundary]] agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba, of December 16, 1977.

'''Mexico and United States of America:''' Treaty to resolve pending boundary differences and maintain the Rio Grande and Colorado River as the international boundary, of November 23, 1970; Treaty on maritime boundaries between the United States of America and the United Mexican States (Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean), of May 4, 1978, and Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States on the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Western Gulf of Mexico beyond {{convert|200|nmi|km}}, of June 9, 2000.

On 13 December 2007, Mexico submitted information to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) regarding the extension of Mexico's continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biblio.juridicas.unam.mx/revista/pdf/MexicanLawReview/10/nte/nte8.pdf|title=Mexico's Attempt to Extend its Continental Shelf Beyond 200 Nautical Miles Serves as a Model for the International Community, Mexican Law Review, Volume V, Number 2, Jan.– June 2013}}</ref> Mexico sought an extension of its continental shelf in the Western Polygon based on international law, UNCLOS, and bilateral treaties with the United States, in accordance with Mexico's domestic legislation. On 13 March 2009, the CLCS accepted Mexico's arguments for extending its continental shelf up to 350 NM into the Western Polygon. Since this would extend Mexico's continental shelf well into territory claimed by the United States, however, Mexico and the U.S. would need to enter a bilateral agreement based on international law that delimits their respective claims.

==Pollution==

The major environmental threats to the Gulf are [[agricultural runoff]] and [[oil drilling]].

There are frequent "[[Algal bloom#Red tides|red tide]]" algae blooms<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore. This has especially been plaguing the southwest and southern Florida coast, from the Florida Keys to north of [[Pasco County, Florida]].

The Gulf contains a [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]] that runs east-west along the Texas-Louisiana coastline. In July 2008, researchers reported that between 1985 and 2008, the area roughly doubled in size and now stretches from near [[Galveston, Texas]], to near [[Venice, Louisiana]]. It is now about {{convert|8000|sqmi|km2}}, nearly the record.<ref>Joel Achenbach, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/07/31/ST2008073100349.html?hpid=topnews "A 'Dead Zone' in The Gulf of Mexico: Scientists Say Area That Cannot Support Some Marine Life Is Near Record Size"], ''Washington Post'', July 31, 2008</ref> Poor agricultural practices in the northern portion of the Gulf of Mexico have led to a tremendous increase of [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] in neighboring marine ecosystems, which has resulted in [[algae]] blooms and a lack of available oxygen. Occurrences of [[masculinization]] and estrogen suppression were observed as a result. An October 2007 study of the [[Atlantic croaker]] found a disproportioned sex ratio of 61% males to 39% females in hypoxic Gulf sites. This was compared with a 52% to 48% male-female ratio found in reference sites, showing an impairment of reproductive output for fish populations inhabiting hypoxic coastal zones.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Peter|author2=Md Saydur Rahman|title=Extensive Reproductive Disruption, Ovarian  Masculinization and Aromatase Suppression in Atlantic Croaker in the Northern Gulf of Mexico Hypoxic Zone|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2012|volume=279|issue=1726|pages=28–38|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.0529}}</ref>

There are 27,000 abandoned oil and gas wells beneath the Gulf.

===''Ixtoc I'' explosion and oil spill===
{{Main|Ixtoc I|Ixtoc I oil spill}}
In June 1979, the ''[[Ixtoc I]]'' [[oil platform]] in the Bay of Campeche suffered a [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] leading to a catastrophic explosion, which resulted in a [[Ixtoc I oil spill|massive oil spill]] that continued for nine months before the well was finally capped. This was ranked as the largest oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico until the ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill in 2010.

===''Deepwater Horizon'' explosion and oil spill===
{{Main|Deepwater Horizon explosion|Deepwater Horizon oil spill}}

On April 20, 2010, the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' oil platform, located in the [[Mississippi Canyon]] about {{convert|40|mi|km}} off the Louisiana coast, suffered a catastrophic explosion; it sank a day-and-a-half later.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/04/23/burning_oil_rig_sinks_setting_stage_for_spill_11_still_missing "Burning oil rig sinks, setting stage for spill; 11 still missing"], by Kevin McGill and Holbrook Mohr ([[Associated Press]]), ''[[Boston Globe]],'' April 23, 2010</ref> It was in the process of being sealed with cement for temporary abandonment, to avoid environmental problems.<ref name="bfp100707"/> Although initial reports indicated that relatively little oil had leaked, by April 24, it was claimed by BP that approximately {{convert|1000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day were issuing from the [[wellhead]], about {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} below the surface on the ocean floor.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/articles/2010/04/25/well_from_sunken_rig_leaking_oil "Well from sunken rig leaking oil"], by Cain Burdeau ([[Associated Press]]), ''[[Boston Globe]],'' April 25, 2010</ref> On April 29, the U.S. government revealed that approximately {{convert|5000|oilbbl|m3}} per day, five times the original estimate, were pouring into the Gulf from the wellhead.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29spill.html | work=The New York Times | title=Size of Spill in Gulf of Mexico Is Larger Than Thought | first1=Campbell | last1=Robertson | first2=Leslie | last2=Kaufman | date=April 28, 2010}}</ref>  The resulting [[oil spill|oil slick]] quickly expanded to cover hundreds of square miles of ocean surface, posing a serious threat to [[Marine biology#Lifeforms|marine life]] and adjacent [[Salt marsh|coastal wetlands]], and to the livelihoods of Gulf Coast shrimpers and fishermen.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/articles/2010/04/27/race_to_plug_leaking_oil_well_off_la_spurs_new_tactics "Race to plug leaking oil well off La. spurs new tactics"], by Cain Burdeau ([[Associated Press]]), ''[[Boston Globe]],'' April 27, 2010</ref> Coast Guard Rear Adm. Sally Brice O'Hare stated that the U.S. government will be "employing booms, skimmers, chemical dispersants and controlled burns" to combat the oil spill. By May 1, 2010, the oil spill cleanup efforts were underway, but hampered by rough seas and the "tea like" consistency of the oil. Cleanup operations were resumed after conditions became favorable. On May 27, 2010, The [[USGS]] had revised the estimate of the leak from {{convert|5000|oilbbl/d}} to 12,000–{{convert|19000|oilbbl/d}}<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100527-energy-nation-gulf-oil-spill-top-kill-obama/ "Gulf Oil Spill Worst in U.S. History; Drilling Postponed"], by Marianne Lavelle, ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', May 27, 2010</ref> an [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill#Spill flow rate|increase from earlier estimates]]. On July 15, 2010, BP announced that the leak stopped for the first time in 88 days.

In July 2015 BP reached an $18.7bn settlement with the US government, the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, as well as 400 local authorities. To date BP's cost for the clean-up, environmental and economic damages and penalties has reached $54bn.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ed Crooks|first1=Christopher Adams,|title=BP: Into uncharted waters|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a71ce8c-24b9-11e5-9c4e-a775d2b173ca.html|website=ft.com|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>
