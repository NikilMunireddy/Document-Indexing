Assam is known for [[Assam tea]] and [[Assam silk]]. The first oil well in Asia was drilled here.  The state has conserved the one-horned [[Indian rhinoceros]] from near extinction, along with the [[wild water buffalo]], [[pygmy hog]], tiger and various species of Asiatic birds. It provides one of the last wild habitats for the [[Asian elephant]]. The Assamese economy is aided by [[wildlife tourism]], centred around [[Kaziranga National Park]] and [[Manas National Park]] which are [[World Heritage Site]]s. [[Shorea robusta|Sal tree]] forests are found in the state, which as a result of rainfall looks green all year round. Assam receive more rainfall compared to most part of India. This rain feeds the [[Brahmaputra River]], whose tributaries and [[oxbow lake]]s provide the region with a hydro-[[geomorphic]] and aesthetic environment.

== Etymology ==
{{main|Etymology of Assam}}
The precise etymology of "Assam" came from Ahom Dynasty. In the classical period and up to the 12th century the region east of the [[Karatoya river]], largely congruent to present-day Assam, was called [[Kamarupa]], and alternatively, [[Pragjyotisha]].<ref>"Prior to the thirteenth century the
present region was called Kāmarūpa or, alternatively, Prāgjyotiṣapur", Lahiri, Nayanjot., ''Pre-Ahom Assam'' (Delhi 1991) p14</ref> In medieval times the Mughals used ''Asham'' (eastern Assam) and Kamrup (western Assam),<ref>Sukalpa Bhattacharjee, C Joshua Thomas,2013,''Society,Representation and Textuality:The Critical Interface'' It deals with the expansion of the Mughal Empire in Bengal, Kamrup and Assam.</ref><ref>Satish Chandra (2005), ''Medieval India:Fro Sultanate to the Mughals Part - II'' They had support of many Hindu Rajas of Jessore, Kamrup (Western Assam), Cachar, Tippera, etc.</ref><ref>Peter Jackson,2003,''The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History'',P. 141, into the region of Assam the Muslims called Kamrup or Kamrud</ref> and during British colonialism, the English used Assam. Though many authors have associated the name with the 13th century Shan invaders<ref>"The word 'Assamese' is an English one based on the anglicised form 'Assam' from the native word "Asam", which in its turn is connected with the Shans who invaded the Brahmaputra Valley in the 13th century." Kakati, Banikanta, ''Aspects of Early Assamese Literature'' (Gauhati University Press, 1953) p1; "Assam is the English form of 'Asama' (i.e. peerless) which is apparently a Sanskritised form of the tribal name Ahom", D C Sircar, ''Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa'' in ''The Comprehensive History of Assam'' Vol I (Guwahati, 1991) p59 cf1; Satyendra Nath Sharma, ''Assamese Literature'' (Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 1976) p1; "The term 'Assam' is, relatively speaking, of recent origin and traces back to the tradition of the Ahoms who entered the Brahmaputra valley in the thirteenth century", Nayanjot Lahir, ''Pre-Ahom Assam'' (Delhi 1991, based on PhD Thesis) p14; "These references show that the term 'Axom or Asom' was earlier used to mean the Shan community...Subsequently the term came to be used to mean also the territory they ruled", M Taher, ''Geography of Assam'' (Delhi, 2001) pp2-3</ref> the precise origin of the name is not clear.  It was suggested by some that the Sanskrit word ''Asama'' ("unequalled", "peerless", etc.) was the root, which has been rejected by Kakati,<ref>"...but most probably ''Asama'' meaning peerless or unequalled is a latter day Sanskritisation of some earlier form like ''Āchām'', Banikanta Kakati, ''Early Aspects of Assamese Literature'' (Gauhati, 1953) p2</ref> and more recent authors have concurred that it is a latter-day Sanskritization of a native name.<ref>Satyendra Nath Sharma, ''Assamese Literature'' (Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 1976) p1</ref>  Among possible origins are Tai (''A-Cham'')<ref>"In Tai the root ''cham'' means "to be undefeated". With the privative Assamese affix ''ā'' the whole formation ''Āchām'' would mean undefeated.", Banikanta Kakati, ''Aspects of Early Assamese Literature'' (Gauhati University Press, 1953) p2</ref> and Bodo (''Ha-Sam'').<ref>"The Ahom domain of Upper Assam came to be known to the Dimasa and other Bodo people as ''Ha-Sam'' (the land of the ''Shams'' or ''Shans'') in their language.", Amalendu Guha, ''The Ahom Political System: An Enquiry into the State Formation Process in Medieval Assam (1228-1714)'' in ''Social Scientist'' Vol. 11, No. 12, (1983) p24</ref>

=== Pre-history ===
{{further|Danava dynasty|Naraka dynasty|Indo-Aryan migration to Assam}}
Assam and adjoining regions have evidences of human settlements from all the periods of the [[Stone age]]s. The hills at the height of 1,500–2,000 feet (460 to 615 m) were popular habitats probably due to availability of exposed dolerite basalt, useful for tool-making.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA">{{Citation

=== Mythology ===
According to a late text, [[Kalika Purana]] (c. 9th–10th century [[Anno Domini|AD]]), the earliest ruler of Assam was Mahiranga Danav of the [[Danava dynasty]], which was removed by [[Naraka]]  of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] who established the [[Naraka dynasty]].  The last of these rulers, also Naraka, was slain by [[Krishna]].  Naraka's son Bhagadatta became the king, who (it is mentioned in the Mahabharata) fought for the [[Kaurava]]s in the [[Kurukshetra War|battle of Kurukshetra]] with an army of ''[[kiratas]]'', ''[[chinas]]'' and ''dwellers of the eastern coast''.

{{further|Kamarupa}}
[[Samudragupta]]'s 4th century [[Allahabad Pillar#Samudragupta inscriptions|Allahabad pillar inscription]] mentions [[Kamarupa]] ([[Western Assam]])<ref>Tej Ram Sharma,1978,"Personal and geographical names in the Gupta inscriptions. (1.publ.)", Page 254, Kamarupa consisted of the Western districts of the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state.</ref> and [[Davaka]] (Central Assam)<ref>Suresh Kant Sharma, Usha Sharma - 2005,"Discovery of North-East India: Geography, History, Cutlure, ... - Volume 3", Page 248, Davaka (Nowgong) and Kamarupa as separate and submissive friendly kingdoms.</ref> as frontier kingdoms of the [[Gupta Empire]]. 
Davaka was later absorbed by Kamarupa, which grew into a large kingdom that spanned from Karatoya river to near present [[Sadiya]] and covered the entire Brahmaputra valley, [[North Bengal]], parts of [[Bangladesh]] and, at times [[Purnea]] and parts of [[West Bengal]].<ref>The eastern border of Kamarupa is given by the temple of the goddess Tamreshvari (Pūrvāte Kāmarūpasya devī Dikkaravasini in [[Kalika Purana]]) near present-day Sadiya.  "...the temple of the goddess Tameshwari (Dikkaravasini) is now located at modern Sadiya about 100 miles to the northeast of Sibsagar" {{harv|Sircar|1990|pp=63–68}}.</ref>

Ruled by three dynasties [[Varman dynasty|Varmanas]] (c. 350–650 CE), [[Mlechchha dynasty]] (c.655–900 CE) and [[Pala dynasty (Kamarupa)|Kamarupa-Palas]] (c. 900–1100 CE), from their capitals in present-day [[Guwahati]] ([[Pragjyotishpura]]), Tezpur ([[Haruppeswara]]) and [[North Gauhati]] ([[Durjaya]]) respectively. Country was 10,000 [[Li (unit)|li]] (6000&nbsp;km) in circuit and capital city Pragjyotishpura was about 30 li (18&nbsp;km).  All three dynasties claimed their descent from [[Narakasura]], an immigrant from [[Āryāvarta|Aryavarta]].<ref>''The Cooch Behar State and Its Land Revenue Settlements'' (1903), Page 213 Naraka was not a native of the soil. He was evidently an Aryan conqueror and came from the Aryavarta.</ref>

In the reign of the Varman king, [[Bhaskar Varman]] (c. 600–650 AD), the Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]] visited the [[Kamrup region|region]] and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was somewhat extended till c. 1255 AD by the Lunar I (c. 1120–1185 AD) and Lunar II (c. 1155–1255 AD) dynasties.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />

Three later dynasties, the [[Ahom Dynasty|Ahoms]], the [[Sutiya kingdom|Sutiya]] and the [[Koch dynasty|Koch]]. The Ahoms, a [[Tai peoples|Tai]] group, ruled [[Upper Assam]]<ref>Banikanta Kakati, ''Assamese:Its formation and development'' The Shans built their kingdom and consolidated their
power in Eastern Assam with the modern town of Sibsagara as their capital and brought the whole tract down to the border of
the modern district of Kamrup permanently under their sway. It was towards the close of their reign that modern Kamrup came within the compass of the Shan rule.</ref>  for nearly 600 years (1228–1826 AD) while the Sutiya rulers (1187 -1673 AD) held the regions on the north bank of Brahmaputra with its domain from [[Biswanath Chariali|Vishwanath]] in the west to [[Parshuram Kund]] in the east in [[Upper Assam]] and in the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. The Koch, a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burmese]], established sovereignty in c. 1510 AD. The Koch kingdom in western Assam and present North Bengal was at its zenith in the early reign of Naranarayana (c. 1540–1587 AD). It split into two in c. 1581 AD, the western part as a [[Moghul]] vassal and the eastern as an Ahom satellite state. Since c. the 13th century AD, the nerve centre of Ahom polity was upper Assam; the kingdom was gradually extended till [[Karatoya River]] in the c. 17th or 18th century. It was at its zenith during the reign of Sukhrungpha or Sworgodeu Rudra Simha (c. 1696–1714 AD). Among other dynasty, the [[Kachari Kingdom|Kacharis]] (13th century-1854 AD) ruled from Dikhow River to central and southern Assam and had their capital at [[Dimapur]]. The rivalry between the Sutiyas and Ahoms for the supremacy of eastern Assam led to a series of battles between them from the early 16th century till the start of the 17th century, which saw great loss of men and money. With expansion of Ahom kingdom, by the early 17th century, the Sutiya areas were annexed and since c. 1536 AD Kacharis remained only in [[Cachar]] and [[North Cachar]] more as an Ahom ally then a competing force. Despite numerous invasions, mostly by the Muslim rulers, no western power ruled Assam until the arrival of the British. Though the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]] made seventeen attempts to invade, they were never successful. The most successful invader [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], a governor of [[Aurangzeb]], briefly occupied [[Garhgaon]] (c. 1662–63 AD), the then capital, but found it difficult to control people making [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on his forces, forcing them to leave. The decisive victory of the Assamese led by the great general [[Lachit Borphukan]] on the Mughals, then under command of Raja Ram Singha at [[Saraighat]] (1671) had almost ended Mughal ambitions in this region. Mughals were finally expelled from Lower Assam during the reign of [[Supaatphaa|Gadadhar Singha]] in 1682 AD. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The discovery of [[Camellia sinensis]] in 1834 in Assam was followed by its tests in 1836–37 in London. The British allowed companies to rent land from 1839 onwards. Thereafter tea plantations mushroomed in Eastern Assam,<ref name=Roy>{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Tirthankar|title=India in the World Economy: From Antiquity to the Present|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1107009103|page=202}}</ref> where the soil and the climate were most suitable. Problems with the imported labourers from China and hostilities of native Assamese resulted in migration of forced labourers from central and eastern parts of India. After initial trial and error with planting the Chinese and the Assamese-Chinese hybrid varieties, the planters later accepted the local [[Camellia assamica]] as the most suitable one for Assam. By the 1850s, the industry started seeing some profits. Industry saw initial growth, when in 1861, investors were allowed to own land in Assam and it saw substantial progress with invention of new technologies and machinery for preparing processed tea during the 1870s.

Despite the commercial success, tea laborers continued to be exploited,{{clarify|reason=this means used to their fullest capacity, not abused|date=September 2014}} working and living under poor conditions.{{clarify|reason=what are "poor" conditions compared to the rest of India? Needs data rather than pitiable subjective adjectives|date=September 2014}} Fearful of greater government interference, the tea growers formed the [http://www.indiatea.org/ Indian Tea Association] in 1888 to lobby to retain the status quo. The organization was very successful in this, and even after India’s independence, conditions of the laborers have improved very little.<ref>{{Citation

In the later part of the 18th century, religious tensions and atrocities of nobles led to the [[Moamoria rebellion]], resulting in tremendous casualties of lives and property. The rebellion was suppressed but the kingdom was severely weakened by the civil war.

The arrangement lasted till 1838 and thereafter the British gradually annexed the entire region.

Initially Assam was made a part of the [[Bengal Presidency]], then in 1906 it was a part of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] province, and in 1912 it was reconstituted into a chief commissioners' province. In 1913, a legislative council and, in 1937, the Assam Legislative Assembly, were formed in Shillong, the erstwhile capital of the region. The British tea planters imported labour from central India adding to the demographic canvas.

With the partition of India in 1947, Assam became a constituent state of India. The [[Sylhet district|district of Sylhet]] of Assam (excluding the Karimganj subdivision) was given up to East Pakistan (which later became Bangladesh).

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Assam in 1950s.png|thumb|22em|<center>Assam till the 1950s; The new states of Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram formed in the 1960-70s. From Shillong, the capital of Assam was shifted to Dispur, now a part of Guwahati. After the Indo-China war in 1962, Arunachal Pradesh was also separated out.</center>]]

The government of India, which has the unilateral powers to change the borders of a state, divided Assam into several states since 1970 to satisfy national aspirations of the tribal populations living within the then borders of then Assam. In 1963 the Naga Hills district became the 16th state of India under the name of [[Nagaland]]. Part of Tuensang was added to Nagaland. In 1970, in response to the demands of the tribal peoples of the [[Karbi-Meghalaya plateau|Meghalaya Plateau]], the districts embracing the Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills, and Garo Hills were formed into an autonomous state within Assam; in 1972 it became a separate state under the name of Meghalaya. In 1972, Arunachal Pradesh (the [[North East Frontier Agency]]) and Mizoram (from the Mizo Hills in the south) were separated from Assam as union territories; both became states in 1986. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Since the restructuring of Assam after independence, communal tensions and violence remain there. Separatist groups began forming along ethnic lines, and demands for autonomy and sovereignty grew, resulting in fragmentation of Assam. In 1961, the Government of Assam passed a legislation making use of the [[Assamese language]] compulsory. It was withdrawn later [[Bengali Language Movement (Barak Valley)|under pressure from Bengali speaking people in Cachar]]. In the 1980s the Brahmaputra valley saw a six-year [[Assam Agitation]]<ref name="Hazarika">{{Citation

The post 1970s experienced the growth of armed separatist groups like [[United Liberation Front of Asom]] (ULFA)<ref name="Hazarika" /> and [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland]] (NDFB). In November 1990, the [[Government of India]] deployed the [[Indian army]], after which low-intensity military conflicts and political homicides have been continuing for more than a decade. In recent times, ethnicity based militant groups have grown. Regional autonomy has been ensured for [[Bodo-Kachari community]] in [[Bodoland Territorial Council]] Areas (BTC), for the Karbis in [[Karbi Anglong district|Karbi Anglong]] and for the people of [[Dima Hasao district]] under the 6th schedule and Autonomous District Councils (ADC) areas under Indian constitution, while Non-6th Schedule States in the North-East where under 73rd and 74th amendments (Panchayati Raj Institutions) have been applied in Assam (excluding ''Karbi Anglong Autonomous District Council'' and ''North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council''), after agitation of the communities due to sluggish rate of development and general apathy of successive state governments towards indigenous communities. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[File:Assam Valley.JPG|thumb|<center>Environs: Assam, dissected hills of the South Indian Plateau system and the Himalayas all around its north, north-east and east.</center>]]

A significant geographical aspect of Assam is that it contains three of six physiographic divisions of India - The Northern Himalayas (Eastern Hills), The Northern Plains (Brahmaputra plain) and Deccan Plateau (Karbi Anglong). As the Brahmaputra flows in Assam the climate here is cold and there is rainfall most of the month.Geomorphic studies conclude that the Brahmaputra, the life-line of Assam is an antecedent river, older than the Himalayas. The river with steep [[Canyon|gorges]] and rapids in Arunachal Pradesh entering Assam, becomes a [[braided river]] (at times 10&nbsp;mi/16&nbsp;km wide) and with tributaries, creates a flood plain (Brahmaputra Valley: 50–60&nbsp;mi/80–100&nbsp;km wide, 600&nbsp;mi/1000&nbsp;km long).<ref name="RLSinghIndia">{{Citation

===Climate===
With the "Tropical Monsoon Rainforest Climate", Assam is temperate (summer max. at 95–100&nbsp;°F or 35–38&nbsp;°C and winter min. at 43–46&nbsp;°F or 6–8&nbsp;°C) and experiences heavy rainfall and high humidity.<ref name="RLSinghIndia" /><ref>{{cite web

====Flooding====
<!---can move to economy, if not here--->
Every year, flooding from the Brahmaputra and other rivers deluges places in Assam. The water levels of the rivers rise because of rainfall resulting in the rivers overflowing their banks and engulfing nearby areas. Apart from houses and livestock being washed away by flood water, bridges, railway tracks and roads are also damaged by the calamity, which causes communication breakdown in many places. Fatalities are also caused by the natural disaster in many places of the State.<ref name="Assam Flood Toll Rises to 13">{{cite web|url=http://m.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-flood-toll-rises-to-13-chief-minister-gogoi-undertakes-aerial-visit-1210178 |title=Assam Flood Toll Rises to 13 |publisher=NDTV |date=August 23, 2015 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Flood situation in Assam worsens">{{cite web|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flood-situation-in-assam-worsens-7-dead-over-650-000-displaced/article1-1383226.aspx |title=Flood situation in Assam worsens |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=August 23, 2015 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

Growth of population in Assam has risen since the mid-decades of the 20th century. Population grew from 3.29&nbsp;million in 1901 to 6.70&nbsp;million in 1941. It increased to 14.63&nbsp;million in 1971 and 22.41&nbsp;million in 1991.<ref name="GoAStats" /> The growth in the western and southern districts was high primarily due to the influx of people from [[East Pakistan]], now Bangladesh.<ref name="SinhaSKillmig" />

The Assamese Hindus are the largest community people in Assam . The population of Assamese Hindus in Assam is 11,379,000 making up 36.50% of Assam population at 2011 census . The People of India project has studied 115 of the ethnic groups in Assam. 79 (69%) identify themselves regionally, 22 (19%) locally, and 3 trans-nationally. The earliest settlers were [[Austroasiatic]] and [[Dravidians]] speakers, followed by [[Tibeto-Burman]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan speakers]], and [[Tai–Kadai]] speakers.<ref>Taher, Mohammad (1993) ''The Peopling of Assam and contemporary social structure'' in Ahmad, Aijazuddin (ed) Social Structure and Regional Development, Rawat Publications, New Delhi</ref> Forty-five languages are spoken by different communities, including three major language families: Austroasiatic (5), [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] (24) and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (12).

[[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Bodo language|Bodo]] are the major indigenous and official languages while [[Bengali language|Bengali]] holds official status in the three districts in the [[Barak Valley]] and is the second most widely spoken language of the state (27.5%).<ref name="censusindia.gov.in"/>

Traditionally Assamese was the language of the commons (of mixed origin – Austroasiatic, Tibeto-Burman, [[Prakrit]]) in the ancient [[Kamarupa kingdom|Kamarupa]] and in the medieval kingdoms of Kamatapur, [[Kachari kingdom|Kachari]], [[Sutiya kingdom|Sutiya]], Borahi, [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] and [[Koch kingdom|Koch]]. Traces of the language is found in many poems by Luipa, Sarahapa, etc. in [[Charyapada]] (c. 7th–8th century AD). Modern dialects Kamrupi, [[Goalpariya dialect|Goalpariya]] etc. are the remnants. Moreover, Assamese in its traditional form was used by the ethno-cultural groups in the region as lingua-franca, which spread during the stronger kingdoms and was required for needed economic integration. Localised forms of the language still exist in Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh. The form used in the upper Assam was enriched by the advent of Tai-Shans in the 13th century.

Linguistically modern Assamese traces its roots to the version developed by the American Missionaries based on the local form in practice near [[Sivasagar]] (Xiwôxagôr) district. Assamese (''Ôxômiya'') is a rich language due to its hybrid nature with its unique characteristics of pronunciation and softness. Assamese literature is one of the richest.

The word [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]] etymologically translates to "Son of the big river " (Di- Water, ma- suffix for great, sa-sons), the river being the mighty Brahmaputra. The Dimasa word "Di" for water forms the root word for many of the major rivers of Assam and the North East India like Dikrang which means green river, Dikhow which means "fetched water", Diyung (huge river) etc. The Brahmaputra River is known as Dilao (long river) among the Dimasas. Many of the towns and cities in Assam and Nagaland derived their names from Dimasa words.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} For example, Dimapur (a capital of Dimasa Kingdom), Dispur, Hojai, Diphu and Khaspur.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Bodo is an ancient language of Assam. Spatial distribution patterns of the ethno-cultural groups, cultural traits and the phenomenon of naming all the major rivers in the [[North-East India|North East Region]] with Bodo-Kachari words (e.g. [[Dihing]], Dibru, [[Dihong]], D/[[Teesta River|Tista]], Dikrai, etc.) reveal that it was the most important language in the ancient times. Bodo is now spoken largely in the Western Assam (Bodo Territorial Council area). After years of neglect, now Bodo language is getting attention and its literature is developing. Other native languages of Tibeto-Burman origin and related to Bodo-Kachari are [[Deori language|Deori]] [http://deori-jimochhayan.blogspot.com/], [[Mising language|Mising]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], and [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There are approximately 7 lakhs [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers spread all over the state forming about 2.2% of Assam's total population. Majority of the Nepali speakers are found in the district of Sonitpur where over 3 lakh people speaks in Nepali language.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There are speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Assam. A total of six Tai language were spoken in Assam. Two are now extinct.<ref name="Morey">Morey, Stephen. 2005. ''The Tai languages of Assam: a grammar and texts''. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.</ref>
* [[Tai Phake language|Tai Phake]]
* [[Tai Aiton language|Tai Aiton]]
* [[Khamti language|Khamti]]
* [[Khamyang language|Khamyang]] (critically endangered)
* [[Ahom language|Ahom]] (extinct)
* [[Turung language|Turung]] (extinct)

The Tai Ahom language (brought by [[Sukaphaa]] and his followers), is no longer a spoken language today. The language is receiving increased attention for research after centuries of usage by the Bailungs (traditional priests).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Bengali is the official language in Barak Valley and the widely spoken language. Some [[Bengali dialects]] like Maymensinghiya, Noakhaliya, Dhakaya are spoken in Brahmaputra Valley by some East Bengali origin people. [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], an unclear dialect of Bengali is mostly spoken in the region of Barak Valley and Hojai district.

[[Sadri]], a dialect of Hindi, [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]]  and [[Mundari language|Mundari]]  is spoken by the 6 millions tribal population ([[Tea tribes]]  ) spread in the tea garden dominated districts of Assam. They were brought as tea estate labourers by the British from the tribal heartland of central-eastern India to Assam during the 1860s. They are mostly found in the districts of Upper Assam and Bodoland Territorial Administration Districts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

{{As of|2015|08}}, the state has [[List of districts of Assam|32 administrative districts]]. On August 15, 2015, five new districts were formed in addition to former 27 districts. The five new districts are Biswanath (carved out of [[Sonitpur district|Sonitpur]]), Charaideo (of [[Sivasagar district|Sivasagar]]), Hojai (of [[Nagaon district|Nagaon]]), South Salmara-Mankachar (of [[Dhubri district|Dhubri]]) and West Karbi Anglong (of [[Karbi Anglong district|Karbi Anglong]]).<ref name="new districts">{{cite news|title=Govt announces 5 new districts|url=http://www.assamtimes.org/node/14546|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=Assam Times|date=15 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="RDGoA">Revenue Department, Government of Assam</ref> These districts are further sub-divided into 54 "Sub-divisions" or ''[[Tehsil|Mohkuma]]''.<ref name="RDGoA" /> Every district is administered from a district headquarters with the office of the [[District Collector|Deputy Commissoner]], District Magistrate, Office of the District Panchayat and usually with a [[District Courts of India|district court]].

The districts are delineated on the basis of the features such as the rivers, hills, forests, etc. and majority of the newly constituted districts are sub-divisions of the earlier districts.

===Local government===
The [[Local Governance in India|local governance]] system is organised under the ''jila-parishad'' (District Panchayat) for a district, ''[[Panchayati Raj|panchayat]]'' for group of or individual rural areas and under the urban local bodies for the towns and cities. There are now 2489 village panchayats covering 26247 villages in Assam.<ref name="DIPRGoA">{{cite web|last=Directorate of Information and Public Relations |first=Government of Assam |title=Area of the National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries in Assam, 2002 |url=http://janasanyogassam.nic.in/assamataglance.htm |accessdate=29 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071006161204/http://janasanyogassam.nic.in/assamataglance.htm |archivedate=6 October 2007 }}</ref> The 'town-committee' or ''nagar-somiti'' for small towns, 'municipal board' or ''pouro-sobha'' for medium towns and [[municipal corporation]] or ''pouro-nigom'' for the cities consist of the urban local bodies.

For the revenue purposes, the districts are divided into revenue circles and ''mouza''s; for the development projects, the districts are divided into 219 'development-blocks' and for law and order these are divided into 206 police stations or ''thana''. As on 19 May 2016, [[BJP]] under the leadership of [[Sarbananda Sonowal]] won the Assembly elections, thus forming the first BJP led [[Government of Assam|government in Assam]].<ref>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bjp-win-assam-sarbananda-sonowal-elections-2016-results-2812854/</ref>

Assam schools are run by the Indian government or by private organisations. Medium of instruction is mainly in Assamese, English or Bengali.  Most of the schools follow the state’s examination board which is called the [[Secondary Education Board of Assam]].  Almost all private schools follow the [[Central Board for Secondary Education|Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE)]], [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE)]] and [[Indian School Certificate|Indian School Certificate (ISC)]]  syllabuses.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Assamese language is the main medium in educational institutions but [[Nepali language]] is also taught as a major [[Languages of India|Indian language]]. In Guwahati and Digboi, many Jr. basic School and Jr. high School are Nepali linguistic and all the teachers are [[Indian Gorkha]]. [[Nepali language|Nepali]] is included by Assam State Secondary Board, [[Assam Higher Secondary Education Council]] and [[Gauhati University]] in their HSLC, higher secondary and graduation level respectively, in some junior basic and higher secondary schools and colleges, Nepali language speaking [[Indian Gorkha]] teachers and lecturers are appointed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The capital, Guwahati, contains institutions of higher education for students of the north-eastern region. [[Cotton College]], Guwahati, dates back to the 19th century. Assam has several institutions for tertiary education and research.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Macro-economy ===
The economy of Assam today represents a unique juxtaposition of backwardness amidst plenty.<ref>National Commission for Women 2004</ref> Despite its rich natural resources, and supplying of up to 25% of India's petroleum needs, Assam’s growth rate has not kept pace with that of India; the difference has increased rapidly since the 1970s.<ref name="AHDR2003">UNDP 2004, pp. 22–23</ref> The Indian economy grew at 6% per annum over the period of 1981 to 2000; the growth rate of Assam was only 3.3%.<ref>UNDP 2004, p. 22</ref> In the Sixth Plan period, Assam experienced a negative growth rate of 3.78% when India's was positive at 6%.<ref name="AHDR2003" /> In the post-liberalised era (after 1991), the difference widened further.

According to recent analysis, Assam’s economy is showing signs of improvement. In 2001–02, the economy grew (at 1993–94 constant prices) at 4.5%, falling to 3.4% in the next financial year.<ref name="GoAESA0405">{{cite web

Sectoral analysis again exhibits a dismal picture. The average annual growth rate of agriculture, which was 2.6% per annum over the 1980s, has fallen to 1.6% in the 1990s.<ref name="AHDR2003II">UNDP 2004, pp. 24–25</ref> The manufacturing sector showed some improvement in the 1990s with a growth rate of 3.4% per annum than 2.4% in the 1980s.<ref name="AHDR2003II" /> For the past five decades, the tertiary sector has registered the highest growth rates of the other sectors, which even has slowed down in the 1990s than in the 1980s.<ref name="AHDR2003II" />

===Employment===
Unemployment is one of the major problems of Assam which can be attributed to overpopulation, and a faulty education system. Every year, large numbers of students obtain higher academic degrees but because of non-availability of proportional vacancies, most of these students remain unemployed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/indicators/Poor-infrastructure-stringent-policies-bottleneck-for-Assams-growth-Assocham/articleshow/48003338.cms |title=Poor infrastructure, stringent policies bottleneck for Assam’s growth |publisher=The Economic Times |date=July 9, 2015 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/assam/panel-for-study-of-unemployment-problem-in-assam_807697.html |title=Panel for study of unemployment problem in Assam |publisher=Zee News |date=October 26, 2012 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> A number of employers hire over-qualified or efficient, but under-certified, candidates, or candidates with narrowly-defined qualifications. The problem is exacerbated by the growth in the number of technical institutes in Assam which increases the unemployed community of the State. Many job-seekers are ineligible for jobs in sectors like Railways, and [[Oil India]] by the appointment of candidates from outside Assam to those posts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=oct1713/at098 |title=The Assam Tribune |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=October 17, 2013 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=jan2114/city07 |title=The Assam Tribune |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

Reduction of the unemployed has been threatened by [[illegal immigration]] from Bangladesh. This has increased the workforce without a commensurate increase in jobs. Immigrants compete with local workers for jobs at lower wages, particularly in construction, domestics, Rickshaw-pullers, and vegetable sellers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-08-05/news/65244059_1_foreigners-tribunals-illegal-migrants-assam|title=Centre taking steps to check illegal immigration into Assam |publisher=The Economic Times |date=August 5, 2015 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-blueprint-to-detect-deport-illegal-bangladeshis-in-assam/article1-1294954.aspx |title=Soon blueprint to deport illegal Bangladeshis in Assam |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=December 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The government has been identifying (via [[National Register of Citizens of India|NRC]]) and deporting illegals.

=== Agriculture ===
In Assam among all the productive sectors, agriculture makes the highest contribution to its domestic sectors, accounting for more than a third of Assam’s income and employs 69% of workforce.<ref>{{cite web|author=Government of Assam |title=Economic Survey of Assam 2001–2002 in Assam Human Development Report, 2003 |page=32 |url=http://planassam.org/reports/hdr_2003/HRD.htm |format=PDF |accessdate=6 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070220213032/http://planassam.org:80/reports/hdr_2003/HRD.htm |archivedate=20 February 2007 }}</ref> Assam's biggest contribution to the world is [[Assam tea]]. It has its own variety ''Camellia assamica''. The state produces rice, [[rapeseed]], [[mustard seed]], [[jute]], potato, sweet potato, banana, [[papaya]], [[areca nut]], sugarcane and [[turmeric]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Assam’s agriculture is yet to experience modernisation in a real sense. With implications for food security, per capita food grain production has declined in the past five decades.<ref name="AHDR2003III">UNDP 2004, p. 33</ref> Productivity has increased marginally, but is still low compared to highly productive regions. For instance, the yield of rice (staple food of Assam) was just 1531&nbsp;kg per hectare against India’s 1927&nbsp;kg per hectare in 2000–01<ref name="AHDR2003III" /> (which itself is much lower than [[Egypt]]’s 9283, US’s 7279, South Korea’s 6838, Japan’s 6635 and China’s 6131&nbsp;kg per hectare in 2001<ref>{{cite web

Assam's proximity to some neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, benefits its trade. The major [[Border checkpoint]]s through which border trade flows to Bangladesh from Assam are :- Sutarkandi (Karimganj), Dhubri, Mankachar (Dhubri) and Golokanj.  To facilitate border trade with Bangladesh, Border Trade Centres have been developed at Sutarkandi and [[Mankachar]]. It has been proposed in the 11th five-year plan{{clarify|WHOSE five-year plan?|date=January 2015}} to set up two more Border Trade Center, one at [[Ledo, Assam|Ledo]] connecting China and other at [[Darrang]] connecting Bhutan.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Assam }}
{{See also|Assamese cinema}}

[[Assamese Culture|Assamese culture]] is traditionally a [[Hybridity|hybrid]] one developed due to assimilation of ethno-cultural groups in the past. Therefore, both local elements or the local elements in Sanskritised forms are distinctly found.<ref name="BKakatiAIFD">{{Citation
| first = Banikanta | last = Kakati
| title = Assamese, Its Formation and Development, 2nd edition
| place = Guwahati, India
| publisher = Lawyer's Book Stall
| year = 1962 }}</ref> The major milestones in evolution of Assamese culture are:
* Assimilation in the Kamarupa Kingdom for almost 700 years (under the [[Varman dynasty|Varmans]] for 300 years, Salastambhas and [[Pala dynasty (Kamarupa)|Palas]] for each 200 years).<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />
* Establishment of the [[Sutiya Kingdom|Sutiya dynasty]] in the 12th century in eastern Assam and assimilation for next 400 years.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />
* Establishment of the Ahom dynasty in the 13th century AD and assimilation for next 600 years.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />
* Assimilation in the [[Koch Kingdom]] (15th–16th century AD) of western Assam and Kachari Kingdom (12th–18th century AD) of central and southern Assam.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />
[[File:Dakhinpat Temple.jpg|22em|thumb|<center>Dakhinpat Satra of [[Majuli]]</center>]]
[[File:Celebrations 1.jpg|22em|thumb|<center>Presenting ''Gayan Bayan'' in Majuli, the Neo-Vaishnavite Cultural heritage of Assam</center>]]
* [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] Movement led by '''[[Srimanta Shankardeva]]''' (''Sonkordeu'') and its contribution and cultural changes. Vaishanava Movement, the 15th century religio-cultural movement under the leadership of great [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] (Sonkordeu) and his disciples have provided another dimension to Assamese culture. A renewed Hinduisation in local forms took place, which was initially greatly supported by the Koch and later by the Ahom Kingdoms. The resultant social institutions such as ''[[namghar]]'' and ''[[sattra]]'' (the Vaishnav Monasteries) have become part of Assamese way life. The movement contributed greatly towards language, literature and performing and fine arts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The modern culture was influenced by events in the British and the Post-British Era. The language was standardised by the American [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|Missionaries]] such as [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]], [[Miles Bronson and the Noctes|Dr. Miles Bronson]] and local pundits such as [[Hemchandra Barua]] with the form available in the [[Sibsagar]] (''Sivasagar'') District (the ex-nerve centre of the Ahom Kingdom).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Increasing efforts of standardisation in the 20th century alienated the localised forms present in different areas and with the less-assimilated [[Ethnic groups|ethno-cultural groups]] (many source-cultures). However, Assamese culture in its hybrid form and nature is one of the richest, still developing and in true sense is a [[Cultural system|'cultural system']] with sub-systems. It is interesting that many source-cultures of Assamese cultural-system are still surviving either as sub-systems or as sister entities, e.g. the tribal minorities such as; [[Bodo people|Bodo]] or [[Karbi people|Karbi]] or [[Mising people|Mishing]]. It is important to keep the broader system closer to its roots and at the same time to focus on development of the sub-systems.

Some of the common and unique cultural traits in the region are peoples' respect towards [[Betel nut|areca-nut]] and [[betel]] leaves, symbolic  ([[gamosa]], arnai, etc.), [[Assam silk|traditional silk]] garments (e.g. [[mekhela chador]], traditional dress of Assamese women) and towards forefathers and elderly. Moreover, great hospitality and bamboo culture are common.

=== Symbolism ===
{{See also|List of Assam state symbols|Jaapi}}

[[File:Jaapi with Gamosa.jpg|thumb|<center>A decorative Assamese ''[[Jaapi]]'' laid over a Gamosa</center>]]

Symbolism is an ancient cultural practice in Assam and is still a very important part of Assamese way of life. Various elements are being used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. ''Tamulpan'', ''[[Xorai]]'' and ''Gamosa'' are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. ''Tamulpan'' (the areca nut and betel leaves) or ''guapan'' (gua from ''kwa'') are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition is an ancient one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austro-Asiatic culture. ''[[Xorai]]'' is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.

There were many other symbolic elements and designs, but are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or in use today for only religious purposes. The typical designs of ''assamese-lion'', ''dragon'', ''flying-lion'', etc. were used for symbolising various purposes and occasions. The archaeological sites such as the Madan Kamdev (c. 9th–10th centuries AD) exhibits mass-scale use of lions, dragon-lions and many other figures of demons to show case power and prosperity. The Vaishnava monasteries and many other architectural sites of late medieval period display the use of lions and dragons for symbolic effects.

=== Festivals and traditions ===

[[File:Ali-ai-ligang.jpg|thumb|150px|''Tribal'' - Mising girls dancing during Ali Ai Ligang (Spring Festival)]]

There are diversified important traditional festivals in Assam. [[Bihu]] is the most important and common and celebrated all over Assam. It is the Assamese new year celebrated in April of the Gregorian calendar. [[Durga Puja]] is another festival celebrated with great enthusiasm. Muslims celebrate two Eids ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]) with much eagerness all over Assam.

Bihu is a series of three prominent festivals. Primarily a non-religious festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over a yearly cycle. Three Bihus, ''rongali'' or ''bohag'', celebrated with the coming of spring and the beginning of the sowing season; ''kongali'' or ''kati'', the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the ''[[Bhogali Bihu|bhogali]]'' or ''magh'', the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to ''rongali'' bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.

[[Bwisagu]] is one of the popular seasonal festival of the [[Bodo people|Bodos]]. Bwisagu start of the new year or age. Baisagu is a Boro word which originated from the word "Baisa" which means year or age, ang "Agu" that means starting or start.

[[Dimasa people#Festivals|Bushu Dima]] or simply Bushu is a major harvest festival of the [[Dimasa]] people. This festival is celebrated during the end of January. Officially 27 January has been declared as the day of Bushu Dima festival. The Dimasa people celebrate their festival by playing musical instruments- khram (a type of drum), muri ( a kind of huge long flute). The people dances to the different tunes called "murithai" and each dance has got its name, the prominent being the "Baidima" There are three types of Bushu celebrated among the Dimasas Jidap, Surem and Hangsou.

Moreover, there are other important traditional festivals being celebrated every year on different occasions at different places. Many of these are celebrated by different ethno-cultural groups (sub and sister cultures). Some of these are:

[[File:GHOST CHILLY CHICKEN.jpg|thumb|left|An ethnic preparation of  Ghost chilly chicken curry of Assam]]
Typically, an Assamese meal consists of many things as ''[[Bhat (food)|bhat]]'' ([[rice]]) with ''dal'' ([[lentils]]), ''masor jool'' ([[fish]] curry), with ''mangxô'' ([[meat]] curry) or ''xaak'' and ''bhaji'' ([[herbs]] and [[vegetables]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Rice is one of the main dishes of Assam, and a variety of different rices are grown and eaten in different ways: roasted, grounded, boiled or just soaked.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Fish curries made of ''rôu'', ''illish'', or ''sitôl'' are the most popular. Fowl such as ducks and pigeon are used in dishes while pork, chicken and mutton dishes are mainly popular among the younger generation.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Another favourite combination is ''[[luchi]]'' (fried flatbread), a curry which can be vegetarian or non-vegetarian, and ''asar'' (pickle).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The two main characteristics of a traditional meal in Assam are ''[[Assamese cuisine#Khar|khar]]'' (named after its main ingredient) and the sour dish ''tenga''. ''Khorika'' is the smoked or fired meat eaten with the meal. The various meats more commonly taken include pork, fowl, duck and goose, fish, goat, beef (among Muslim and Christian communities) and pigeon; these being often involved with religious ceremonies. Other kinds of meat include grasshoppers, locusts, silkworms, snails, eels, wild fowl and other birds, deer meat and so on.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

''Khorisa'' (fermented [[bamboo shoots]]) are used at times to flavour curries while they can also be preserved and made into pickles. ''Koldil'' ([[banana flower]]) and squash can be cooked into ''sabji's''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Many households still continue to brew their traditional drinks; variously known as Laupani, Xaaj, Paniyo, Jou, Joumai, Hor and so on. During the time of the traditional festivities, guests are offered these drinks. Declining then is considered socially offensive.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
