The '''Avengers''' are a fictional team of [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The team made its debut in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], inspired by the success of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Justice League of America]]''.

Labeled ''Earth's Mightiest Heroes'', the Avengers originally consisted of [[Hank Pym]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. The original [[Captain America]] was discovered, trapped in ice (issue #4), and joined the group after they revived him. A rotating roster became a hallmark, although one theme remained consistent: the Avengers fight "the foes no single superhero can withstand." The team, famous for its battle cry of "Avengers Assemble!", has featured humans, [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], [[inhumans]], robots, aliens, supernatural beings, and even former villains.

The team has appeared in a wide variety of media outside of comic books including a number of different animated television series and direct-to-video films. The 2012 live-action feature film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', directed by [[Joss Whedon]], set numerous records during its box office run, including one of the [[List of biggest opening weekends|biggest opening debuts]] in North America, with a weekend gross of $207.4&nbsp;million.<ref name="BOM-opening">{{cite news|last=Subers|first=Ray|title= Weekend Report: ''Avengers'' Smashes Records|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3438&p=.htm|date=May 6, 2012|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2012-05-06 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6GkGOHz5H|archivedate= 2013-05-19|deadurl= no}}</ref> A second ''Avengers'' film titled ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' was released on May 1, 2015.

==Publication history==
The team debuted in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963).  Much like the Justice League, the Avengers were an assemblage of pre-existing superhero characters created by Lee and [[Jack Kirby]]. This initial series, published bi-monthly through issue #6 (July 1964) and monthly thereafter ran through issue #402 (Sept. 1996), with spinoffs including several [[annual publication|annuals]], [[miniseries]] and a giant-size quarterly sister series that ran briefly in the mid-1970s.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 1571|title= The Avengers}}</ref>

Other spinoff series include ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'', initially published as a four-issue miniseries in 1984, followed by a 102-issue series (Oct. 1985–Jan. 1994), retitled ''Avengers West Coast'' with #47;<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3061|title= West Coast Avengers ''vol. 2'}}</ref><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3830|title= Avengers West Coast}}</ref> and the 40-issue ''[[Solo Avengers]]'' (Dec.1987–Jan. 1991), retitled ''Avengers Spotlight'' with #21.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3435|title= Solo Avengers}}</ref><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3829|title= Avengers Spotlight}}</ref>

Between 1996 and 2004, Marvel relaunched the primary Avengers title three times. In 1996, the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" line took place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]], with a revamped history unrelated to mainstream Marvel continuity.

''The Avengers'' vol. 3 relaunched and ran for 84 issues from February 1998 to August 2004. To coincide with what would have been the 500th issue of the original series, Marvel changed the numbering, and ''The Avengers'' #500-503 (Sept.– Dec. 2004), the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Avengers Finale'' (Jan. 2005)<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 224494|title= Avengers Finale}}</ref> became the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" storyline and final issues. In January 2005, a new version of the team appeared in the ongoing title ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'',<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 12464|title= The New Avengers}}</ref> followed by ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'', ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', and ''[[Dark Avengers]]''. ''Avengers'' vol. 4 debuted in July 2010 and ran until January 2013.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 48969|title= The Avengers ''vol. 4'}}</ref> Vol. 5 was launched in February 2013.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 70263|title= The Avengers ''vol. 5'}}</ref> After [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]], a new Avengers team debuted, dubbed the ''All-New, All-Different Avengers'', starting with a [[Free Comic Book Day]] preview.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://marvel.com/cards/60/all-new_all-different_avengers_assemble|title= All-New, All-Different Avengers Assemble!|first= Ben|last= Morse|date= 2015-03-26|publisher= Marvel Comics|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150626214908/http://marvel.com/cards/60/all-new_all-different_avengers_assemble|archivedate= 2015-06-26|deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Avengers titles in late 1989 were involved in the major crossover event "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" where Loki assembled many of Marvel's arch-villains, his inner circle consisted of Doctor Doom, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], and [[Red Skull]], in a plot to destroy the team.

The U.S. government revoked the Avengers' New York State charter in a treaty with the Soviet Union.

At this point ongoing story lines and character development focused on the Black Knight, [[Sersi]], [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], Hercules, the Vision, and the Black Widow. Their primary antagonists in this run were the mysterious [[List of Marvel Comics characters: P#Proctor|Proctor]] and his team of other-dimensional Avengers known as the Gatherers.

During the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] event, many of the Avengers together with the [[Fantastic Four]] and others, died trying to stop the psychic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], although it was revealed that [[Franklin Richards]] preserved those heroes in a pocket universe. Believing the main team to be gone, the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] disbanded the Avengers, and only butler Edwin Jarvis remained to tend to the Mansion.

The previous continuity of the [[Marvel Universe]] was set aside as the heroes were "reborn" in the pocket universe. While The "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" line ended.<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 282: "Although the flashy excitement of the Heroes Reborn event had given fans a nostalgic visit to the early part of the decade, by the end of the year, Marvel had set the stage for the return to its time-honored classic lineup."</ref>

The [[limited series]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' was a [[time travel]] story that explored the history of the Avengers and resolved many outstanding questions.

In the company-wide "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" story arc, Marvel superheroes were split over compliance with the U.S. government's new [[Superhuman Registration Act]], which required all superpowered persons to register their true identities with the federal government and become agents of same. The New Avengers disbanded, with a rebel underground starring in a series retaining ''The New Avengers'' in its [[trademark]]ed cover logo and ''New Avengers'' in its [[copyright]] [[indicia (publishing)|indicia]]. Luke Cage led this team, consisting of himself, [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]], Ronin, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman, Wolverine, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Doctor Strange]]. During the long-term [[Secret Invasion]] by the shape-shifting alien race the [[Skrulls]], Spider-Woman had been abducted and replaced by the Skrull queen [[Veranke]]. After the Skrulls' defeat, Spider-Woman was rescued along with other abducted and replaced heroes. During the company-wide story arc "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]", Echo and Iron Fist left the team and the Avengers gained [[Ms. Marvel]], [[Bucky|Bucky Barnes]] as a fill-in [[Captain America]], and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].

Iron Man, in the series ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'', formed a team under the aegis of the government's [[Fifty State Initiative]] program, and took up residency in New York City, joined by [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], the Sentry, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Wonder Man]], and leader Carol Danvers as [[Ms. Marvel]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Frank Cho|Cho, Frank]]|inker= Cho, Frank|story= The Mighty Avengers|title= [[The Mighty Avengers]]|issue= 1|date= May 2007}}</ref><ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 335: "With the help of artist Frank Cho, [Brian Michael] Bendis created the Mighty Avengers, a government-sponsored team that would serve as the antithesis to the still-underground New Avengers."</ref> After the events of the [[Secret Invasion]] story arc, [[Norman Osborn]] assumed control of the formerly S.H.I.E.L.D.-sponsored Avengers, now under the auspices of his own agency, H.A.M.M.E.R. All but Ares and the Sentry left this team — the Wasp appeared to have died — and the team migrated to the series ''[[Dark Avengers]]''. Osborn recruited [[Marvel Boy]] to pose as Captain Marvel and [[Daken]] to pose as his father, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], bringing Moonstone, Bullseye, and Venom from his previous [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] team to impersonate Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man, respectively.

In ''The Mighty Avengers'', Pym, assumed the Wasp identity in tribute to his fallen ex-wife, led a new team of Avengers, and claimed the name for his team as he was the only founding Avenger on any of the three active Avengers rosters. His team operated under a multinational umbrella group, the Global Reaction Agency for Mysterious Paranormal Activity (GRAMPA). This team featured the roster of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], Amadeus Cho, [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]], the Vision, [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], [[U.S. Agent]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and Pym.

===Avengers Next===
{{Main|A-Next}}

In the alternate future timeline known as [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], the Avengers disbanded and Avengers Mansion was a museum.

===Ultimate Marvel===
{{Main|Ultimates}}
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, the Avengers are named the [[Ultimates]], and were formed by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nicholas Fury]] to protect America against superhuman threats. They first appeared in ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]'' by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Bryan Hitch]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Millar|first = Mark|authorlink = Mark Millar|author2=Hitch, Bryan |authorlink2=Bryan Hitch |title = [[Ultimates|The Ultimates Vol. 1: Super-Human]]|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2006|page = 160|isbn = 978-0-7851-0960-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Millar|first = Mark|author2=Hitch, Bryan|title = The Ultimates Vol. 2: Homeland Security |publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2006|page = 200|isbn = 978-0-7851-1078-1}}</ref> After the events of ''[[The Ultimates 2]]'', the team left S.H.I.E.L.D. employment to become independent and financed by [[Ultimate Iron Man|Tony Stark]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Millar, Mark|penciller= Hitch, Bryan|inker= [[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]]|story= Independence Day|title= [[The Ultimates 2]]|issue= 13|date= February 2007}}</ref>

A Black Ops team called the ''Avengers'' debuted sometime after the ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' storyline. This version was a project headed up by Nick Fury and Tony Stark's brother [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Gregory Stark|Gregory Stark]] to bring Captain America back. Its known members consisted of [[War Machine]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the Black Widow II (Monica Chang), Spider (a Spider-Man clone created by Gregory Stark from the DNA of Spider-Man and Professor X), [[Tyrone Cash]] (who was the original Hulk before Bruce Banner), the [[Swarm (comics)|Red Wasp]], and Nerd Hulk (an intelligent clone of the Hulk who lacks the Hulk's rage).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Millar, Mark|penciller= [[Steve Dillon|Dillon, Steve]]|inker= Lanning, Andy|story= Blade Versus The Avengers Part 1 of 6|title= [[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]|issue= 13|date= October 2010}}</ref> Additional members included [[Punisher]] (who joined the Avengers against a [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]] manhunt)<ref>{{cite book|last = Millar|first = Mark|author2=Yu, Leinil Francis|title = Ultimate Comics Avengers Vol. 2: Crime and Punishment|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2011|page = 144|isbn = 978-0-7851-3671-2}}</ref> and the half vampire [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (who joined the group to help against a [[Vampires (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] invasion).<ref>{{cite book|last = Millar|first = Mark|author2=Dillon, Steve|title = Ultimate Comics Avengers: Blade Vs. the Avengers|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2011|page = 152|isbn = 978-0-7851-4009-2}}</ref>

===Avengers Forever===
One of the timelines seen in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' is an alternate future where [[Martians (War of the Worlds)|Martians]] have ravaged Earth and killed most of its heroes. An older version of [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] leads a team of Avengers consisting of [[Killraven]], [[Living Lightning]], [[Jocasta (Marvel Comics)|Jocasta]], a new [[Crimson Dynamo]], and [[Thundra]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Stern, Roger; Busiek, Kurt|penciller= Pacheco, Carlos|inker= Merino, Jesus|story= Running Out of Time|title= Avengers Forever|issue= 4|date= March 1999}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Stern, Roger; Busiek, Kurt|penciller= Pacheco, Carlos|inker= Merino, Jesus|story= Past Imperfect… Future Tense!|title= Avengers Forever|issue= 5|date= April 1999}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Stern, Roger; Busiek, Kurt|penciller= Pacheco, Carlos|inker= Merino, Jesus|story= In the Meantime...

===Marvel Zombies===
The Avengers existed as a team prior to a zombie contagion's arrival in the original Marvel Zombies universe, and resembled their pre-disassembled roster. When several of their members were infected, they set about eating humanity and sent out a bogus "Avengers Assemble" call to draw super-humans to the Avengers Mansion, infected more heroes and thus spread the virus. The team fell apart and many of its members were killed as time passed.<ref>{{cite book|last = Kirkman|first = Robert|authorlink = Robert Kirkman|author2=Phillips, Sean |authorlink2=Sean Phillips |title = [[Marvel Zombies]]|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2007|page = 136|isbn = 978-0-7851-2014-8}}</ref>

Also on the team were the zombies [[Moon Knight]], [[Namor]], [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Thundra]], and [[Super-Skrull]].
