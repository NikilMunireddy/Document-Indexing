Arthur William Baden Powell

'''Arthur William Baden Powell''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CBE}} (4 April 1901 – 1 July 1987) was a New Zealand [[malacology|malacologist]], [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[palaeontologist]], a major influence in the study and classification of New Zealand [[mollusc]]s through much of the 20th century. He was known to his friends and family by his third name, "Baden".

The name Baden had been a given name in a Powell family since 1731, when Susannah Powell née Thistlethwayte (1696-1762) gave to her child (1731-1792) the maiden name of her mother, Susannah Baden (1663-1692).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  The name Baden, particularly when associated with the surname Powell, became famous in 1900-1901, the year Arthur William Baden Powell was born, because of the [[Siege of Mafeking]], the most famous British action in the [[Second Boer War]], which turned the British Commander of the besieged, [[Robert Baden-Powell]], into a national hero.  Throughout the British Empire, babies were named after him.  No family connection has yet been established between Arthur William Baden Powell and Robert Baden-Powell.

Powell was born at [[Wellington]], New Zealand, on 4 April 1901.  His schooling was in [[Auckland]], and he trained in printing at the [[Elam School of Fine Arts]].  This training, and his interest in  [[conchology]], set him on his life's work.  He started writing scientific papers on [[mollusca]] in 1921, and became one of the few experts in New Zealand shellfish.

Powell married Isabel Essie Gittos on 19 December 1928, at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]] in Auckland. They had a son.

He was appointed to the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]] as [[palaeontologist]] and conchologist in 1929, working on some lesser-known mollusc families.  He also studied New Zealand’s big land snails, the ''[[Paryphanta]]'', and the ''[[Placostylus]]'' flax snails.  From 1932 Powell participated in dredging expeditions on the British research ship ''Discovery II'' exploring coastal [[Northland Region|Northland]] and discovering large numbers of new species.  Other field trips from the 1930s to 1960 took him to [[Stewart Island]], the [[Chatham Islands]], the [[Kermadec Islands]] and the [[Antarctica]] and  [[Subantarctic]] region, resulting in many important papers.

Powell wrote over 100 scientific papers and three books. His 500-page ''New Zealand Mollusca'', published in 1979, was a gigantic and important undertaking, the result of 50 years of single-handed work.

Powell was a fellow of the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] from 1940 and was the recipient of the [[Hector Memorial Medal]] and Prize in 1947.  He also received an honorary [[DSc]] in 1956 from the [[University of New Zealand]] and was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to marine science in the [[1981 New Year Honours]].<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/48469/supplements/39 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 48469, 31 December 1980].

His wife died in 1976. Two years later, he married Ida Madoline Worthy (née Hayes) at [[Whangarei]]. Powell died on 1 July 1987 in Auckland.
