==History==
ASCII Media Works is the result of a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] between two Japanese publishing companies—[[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] and [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]—on April 1, 2008.<ref name="mainichi"/><ref name="yahoonews"/> The company is a continuation of MediaWorks, but despite this, the former president of ASCII, Kiyoshi Takano,<ref name="yahoonews"/> became the president of ASCII Media Works. The company is a member of the [[Kadokawa Corporation|Kadokawa Group]] and is thus affiliated with [[Kadokawa Shoten]], another Japanese publishing company.<ref name="mainichi"/><ref>{{cite book| title=Who Owns Whom|publisher=Dun & Bradstreet|year=2005|volume=3|pages=866|isbn=1-86071-616-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Emu3AAAAIAAJ&hl=ru&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> According to an official press release by [[Kadokawa Corporation]], the merger stemmed from a steady outgrowth in the [[Internet]] and mobile parts of society which led publishing companies to branch out in order to encompass the ever increasing needs and demands of the consumers.<ref name="merger">{{cite web|url= http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hjNDujKRMEEJ:www.kadokawa-hd.co.jp/topics/20070927.pdf+http://www.kadokawa-hd.co.jp/topics/20070927.pdf&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a|title=Announcement of the merger between ASCII and MediaWorks|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|accessdate=2007-12-08|language=Japanese}}</ref> Due to mutual company interests, the merger went through in order to create a stronger company which has more outreaching possibilities than either company could have done on their own.

These games are typically [[visual novel]]s, a genre of [[adventure game]]s, but some have also been [[sound novel]]s, which has less attributes of an adventure game than a normal visual novel. The video games produced are ported to the [[PlayStation 2]] or [[Nintendo DS]]. Since ASCII Media Works is a continuation of [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]], the company includes the video games previously produced before the merger with [[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] on their official website for their video games.<ref name="d-game">{{cite web|url=http://d-game.dengeki.com/|title=D-game, ASCII Media Works' video game portal| publisher=ASCII Media Works|accessdate=2008-05-18|language=Japanese}}</ref> The video games produced are organized into categories for similarly made games. Aside from the main class of visual and sound novels produced, three games were re-released in the Dengeki SP series at reduced prices from their original release; SP stands for "special price". Another class produced exclusively for the Nintendo DS are under the [[brand]] imprint series DS Dengeki Bunko, and are games based on [[light novel]]s published under ASCII Media Works' male light novel imprint [[Dengeki Bunko]]. Five games have been produced under this brand, and the two games in the series based on ''[[Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu]]'' were re-released in a single package together. The company lists the titles which have been the most popular among the games they have produced which include releases based on ''[[Sister Princess]]'', ''[[DearS]]'', ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', ''[[Futakoi]]'', and ''[[Strawberry Panic!]]''.<ref name="d-game"/>
