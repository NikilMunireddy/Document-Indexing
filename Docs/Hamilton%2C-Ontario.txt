{{Main|History of Hamilton, Ontario}}
[[File:UnitedEmpireLoyalistsHamilton.JPG|left|thumb|[[United Empire Loyalists]]]]
In pre-[[New France|colonial]] times, the [[Neutral Nation|Neutral Indians]] used much of the land but were gradually driven out by the [[Iroquois|Five (later Six) Nations]] (Iroquois) who were allied with the [[Canada under British Imperial control (1764-1867)|British]] against the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and their French allies. A member of the Iroquois Confederacy provided the route and name for [[Mohawk Road (Hamilton, Ontario)|Mohawk Road]], which originally included King Street in the lower city. In 1784, about 10,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] settled in [[Upper Canada]] (what is now southern Ontario), chiefly in [[Regional Municipality of Niagara, Ontario|Niagara]], around the [[Bay of Quinte]], and along the [[St. Lawrence River]] between [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Montreal]]. They were soon followed by many more Americans, some of them not so much ardent loyalists but attracted nonetheless by the availability of inexpensive, arable land. At the same time, large numbers of [[Iroquois]] loyal to Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario.<ref name=LOYALISTS>{{cite web |url=http://www.uelac.org/PDF/loyalist.pdf |title=A Short History of the United Empire Loyalists |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |last=Mackenzie |first=Ann| format=PDF| publisher=United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada}}</ref>

The town of Hamilton was conceived by [[George Hamilton (politician)|George Hamilton]] (a son of a [[Queenston]] entrepreneur and founder, [[Robert Hamilton (1753-1809)|Robert Hamilton]]), when he purchased farm holdings of [[James Durand]], the local Member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|British Legislative Assembly]], shortly after the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="WEAVER1985"/> [[Nathaniel Hughson]], a property owner to the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare a proposal for a courthouse and jail on Hamilton's property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at [[York, Upper Canada|York]] during a session of the Legislative Assembly and a new [[Gore District, Upper Canada|Gore District]] was established of which the Hamilton townsite was a member.<ref name="WEAVER1985"/><!-- This citation applies to the paragraph in entirety -->

Initially, this town was not the most important centre of the Gore District. A permanent jail was not constructed until 1832 when a cut-stone design was completed on one of the two squares created in 1816, Prince's Square.<ref name="WEAVER1985"/> Subsequently, the first police board and the town limits were defined by statute on February 13, 1833.<ref>Statutes of Upper Canada, 1833 3° William IV pg.&nbsp;58–68.

As the city grew, several prominent buildings were constructed in the late 19th century, including the [[Grand Lodge of Canada]] in 1855,<ref name=GRANDLODGE>

Though suffering through the [[Hamilton Street Railway]] strike of 1906, with industrial businesses expanding, Hamilton's population doubled between 1900 and 1914. Two steel manufacturing companies, [[Stelco]] and [[Dofasco]], were formed in 1910 and 1912, respectively, and [[Procter & Gamble]] and the [[Beech-Nut|Beech-Nut Packing Company]] opened manufacturing plants in 1914 and 1922, respectively, their first outside the US.<ref name=HISINDI>

Since then, many of the large industries have moved or shut down operations<ref name=HISINDI/> and the economy has shifted more toward the service sector, such as transportation, education, and health services.

On January 1, 2001, the new city of Hamilton was formed from the amalgamation of Hamilton and its five neighbouring municipalities: [[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]], [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]], [[Flamborough, Ontario|Flamborough]], [[Glanbrook, Ontario|Glanbrook]], and [[Stoney Creek, Ontario|Stoney Creek]].<ref name=amalgprovles/><!--<ref name=headlake/> --> Before amalgamation, the "old" City of Hamilton had 331,121 Hamiltonians divided into 100 neighbourhoods. The former region of Hamilton-Wentworth had a population of 490,268. The amalgamation created a single-tier municipal government ending subsidization of its suburbs. The new amalgamated city has 519,949 people in over 100 old neighbourhoods, and surrounding communities.<ref name=FOOTSTEPS>{{cite book|title=Footsteps in Time: Exploring Hamilton's heritage neighbourhoods|first=Bill |last=Manson |publisher=North Shore Publishing Inc|year=2003|isbn=1-896899-22-6}}</ref>

Hamilton is located in [[Southern Ontario]] on the western end of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and wraps around the westernmost part of [[Lake Ontario]]; most of the city, including the downtown section, is on the south shore. Hamilton is situated in the geographic centre of the [[Golden Horseshoe]] and is roughly the midway point between [[Toronto]] and [[Buffalo, New York]], although slightly closer to the former. Its major physical features are Hamilton Harbour, marking the northern limit of the city, and the [[Niagara Escarpment]] running through the middle of the city across its entire breadth, bisecting the city into "upper" and "lower" parts. The maximum high point is 250m (820') above the level of Lake Ontario.<ref name=about>{{cite web

[[Hamilton Harbour]] is a natural harbour with a large [[sandbar]] called the Beachstrip. This sandbar was deposited during a period of higher lake levels during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]], and extends southeast through the central lower city to the escarpment. Hamilton's deep sea port is accessed by ship canal through the beach strip into the harbour and is traversed by two bridges, the QEW's [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway]] and the lower Canal Lift Bridge.<ref name=Bay>{{cite web

<br />Between 1788 and 1793, the townships at the Head-of-the-Lake were surveyed and named. The area was first known as The Head-of-the-Lake for its location at the western end of Lake Ontario.<ref name=headlake/> [[John Ryckman]], born in Barton township (where present day downtown Hamilton is), described the area in 1803 as he remembered it: "The city in 1803 was all forest. The shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick, almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth&nbsp;... Bears ate pigs, so settlers warred on bears. Wolves gobbled sheep and geese, so they hunted and trapped wolves. They also held organized raids on rattlesnakes on the mountainside. There was plenty of game.

[[George Hamilton (politician)|George Hamilton]], a settler and local politician, established a town site in the northern portion of Barton Township in 1815. He kept several east–west roads which were originally Indian trails, but the north–south streets were on a regular grid pattern. Streets were designated "East" or "West" if they crossed [[James Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|James Street]] or Highway 6. Streets were designated "North" or "South" if they crossed [[King Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|King Street]] or Highway 8.<ref name=HAMBIO1>{{cite book

  |first=Thomas Melville |last=Bailey

  |year=1981}}</ref> The overall design of the townsite, likely conceived in 1816, was commonplace. George Hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in [[Upper Canada]] and throughout the American frontier. The eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet; each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve-foot lane. It took at least a decade for all of the original lots to be sold, but the construction of the Burlington Canal in 1823, and a new court-house in 1827, encouraged Hamilton to add more blocks around 1828–9. At this time, he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands, but the natural growth of the town was to the north of Hamilton's plot.<ref name=Hamilton2>{{cite web

=== Climate ===
Hamilton's climate is humid-continental, characterized by changeable weather patterns. However, its climate is moderate compared with most of Canada. Hamilton's location on an embayment at the southwestern corner of Lake Ontario with an escarpment dividing upper and lower parts of the city results in noticeable disparities in weather over short distances. This is also the case with pollution levels, which depending on localized winds patterns or low clouds can be high in certain areas mostly originating from the city's steel industry mixed with regional vehicle pollution. With a July average of exactly {{convert|22.0|C|1}},<ref name = RBGstats /> the lower city is located in a pocket of the [[Humid continental climate#Dfa/Dwa/Dsa: Hot (or very warm) summer subtype|''Dfa'' climate zone]] found at the southwestern end of Lake Ontario (between Hamilton and Toronto and eastward into the [[Niagara Peninsula]]), while the upper reaches of the city fall into the [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|''Dfb'' climate zone]].

The airport's open, rural location and higher altitude (240m vs. 85m ASL downtown) results in lower temperatures, generally windier conditions and higher snowfall amounts than lower, built-up areas of the city. One exception is on early spring afternoons; when colder than air lake temperatures keep shoreline areas significantly cooler, under the presence of an east or north-east onshore flow.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Hamilton was 41.1°C (106°F) on 14 July 1868.<ref name="Hamilton (July 1868)">

According to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian Census]], more than 20 percent of the local population was [[Immigration to Canada|not born in Canada]]. This is the third highest such proportion in Canada after [[Toronto]] at 49%, and [[Vancouver]] at 39%. Between 2001 and 2006, the foreign-born population increased by 7.7% while the total population of the Hamilton census metropolitan area (CMA) grew by 4.3%. The share of Canada's recent immigrants who settle in Hamilton has remained unchanged since 2001 at 1.9%. Hamilton was home to 20,800 immigrants who arrived in Canada between 2001 and 2006, half of whom were born in [[Canadians of Asian ancestry|Asia]] and the Middle East, while nearly one-quarter (23%) were from Europe. Hamilton also had a high proportion of people with [[Italians|Italian]], [[English Canadian|English]], [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]], [[German Canadian|German]] and [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] ancestry.

Hamilton also has a large French community for which provincial services are offered in French. In Ontario, urban centres where there are at least 5000 Francophones or where at least 10% of the population is francophone are designated areas where bilingual provincial services have to be offered. According to the latest statistics, the Francophone community grew by 50% between 2006 and 2011 in Hamilton, and in the City, 45,000 citizens claim to have knowledge of both official languages, amongst which 13,000 have French as a mother tongue. The Franco-Ontarian community of Hamilton boasts two schoolboards (Conseil scolaire Viamonde and Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud) five schools (2 secondary and 3 elementary), a community health centre that is part of the LHIN (Centre de santé communautaire Hamilton/Niagara), a cultural centre (Centre français Hamilton), three daycare centres, a provincially funded employment centre (Options Emploi), a community college site (Collège Boréal) and a community organization that supports the development of the francophone community in Hamilton (ACFO Régionale Hamilton).
