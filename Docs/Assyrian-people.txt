== History ==

=== Pre-Christian history ===
{{Main|History of the Assyrian people|Arameans|Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Assyria}}
In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to [[Neanderthal]]s such as have been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in Assyria were the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100 BC and [[Tell Hassuna]], the centre of the [[Hassuna culture]], c. 6000 BC.

The history of the Assyrian people begins with the formation of [[Assyria]] perhaps as early as the 25th century BC,.<ref>Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq, p. 187</ref> 
The [[Assyrian king list]] records kings dating from the 25th century BC onwards, the earliest being [[Tudiya]], who was a contemporary of [[Ibrium]] of [[Ebla]]. However, many of these early kings would have been local rulers, and from the late 24th century BC to the early 22nd century BC, usually subject to the [[Akkadian Empire]].

In the traditions of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], they are descended from [[Abraham]]'s grandson ([[Dedan]] son of [[Jokshan]]), progenitor of the ancient Assyrians.<ref>Genesis 25:3</ref> However, there is no historical basis for the biblical assertion whatsoever; there is no mention in Assyrian records (which date as far back as the 24th century BC).

The Assyrian people, after the fall of their empire, fell under foreign domination ever since. The [[Persian Empire]] was founded, which consumed the entire Neo-Babylonian or "Chaldean" Empire in 539 BC. Assyrians became [[front line]] soldiers for the Persian Empire under [[Xerxes I]], playing a major role in the [[Battle of Marathon]] under [[Darius I]] in 490&nbsp;BC.<ref>''Artifacts show rivals Athens and Sparta'', Yahoo News, December 5, 2006.</ref>

The Assyrian army accounted for three legions of the [[Roman army]], defending the [[Parthia]]n border. In the 1st century, it was the Assyrian army that enabled [[Vespasian]]'s coup. From the later 2nd century, the [[Roman Senate]] included several notable Assyrians, including [[Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus]] and [[Avidius Cassius]].

From the 1st century BC, Assyria was the theatre of the protracted [[Roman–Persian Wars]]. It would become [[Assyria (Roman province)|a Roman province]] (Assyria Provincia) between 116 and 363 AD. Despite the influx of foreign elements, the presence of Assyrians is confirmed by the worship of god [[Ashur]], all proof of the continuity of the Assyrians.<ref name="books.google.nl">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=32HS_jUi4NEC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=parthian+rule+over+the+assyrians&source=bl&ots=qVSC-dMG_n&sig=2_UjlDc_APHBxhKauLu86gcdneU&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ur6PVJW7Acmu7AaU04G4DA&ved=0CCgQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&q=parthian%20rule%20over%20the%20assyrians&f=false|title=Ancient and Modern Assyrians: A Scientific Analysis|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref> The Greeks, Parthians, and Romans had a rather low-level of integration with the local population in Mesopotamia, which allowed their cultures to survive.<ref>Olmatead, ''History of the Persian Empire'', Chicago University Press, 1959, p.39</ref>

[[File:Southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire.jpg|thumb|220px|Map of [[Asōristān]] (226 AD-637 AD).]]
{{further|Syriac Christianity|History of Eastern Christianity|Asōristān}}
The Assyrians were Christianized in the first to third centuries in [[Roman Syria]] and Roman Assyria. The population of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian province]] of [[Asōristān]] was a mixed one, composed of Assyrians, [[Arameans]] in the far south and the western deserts, and [[Persian people|Persians]].<ref name=RP>{{cite book|last=Etheredge|first=Laura|title=Iraq|year=2011|publisher=[[Rosen Publishing]]|isbn=9781615303045|page=72}}</ref> The [[Greeks|Greek]] element in the cities, still strong during the [[Parthian Empire]], ceased to be ethnically distinct in Sasanian times. The majority of the population were [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic speakers]].

Along with the Arameans, [[Armenians]], Greeks, and [[Nabataeans]], the Assyrians were among the first people to convert to [[Christianity]] and spread [[Eastern Christianity]] to the [[Far East]]. The [[Council of Seleucia]] of ca. 325 dealt with jurisdictional conflicts among the leading bishops. They were divided by the [[Nestorian Schism]] in the 5th century, and from the 8th century, they became a [[minority religion]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].

At the subsequent [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] of 410, the Christian communities of [[Mesopotamia]] renounced all subjection to Antioch and the "Western" bishops and the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] (modern [[al-Mada'in]]) assumed the rank of [[Catholicos]]. Whereas Latin and Greek Christian cultures became protected by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s, respectively, Assyrian/Syriac Christianity often found itself marginalised and persecuted.

The Nestorian schism and [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] schisms of the 5th century divided the church into separate denominations. With the rise of [[Syriac Christianity]], eastern Aramaic enjoyed a renaissance as a classical language in the 2nd to 8th centuries, and the modern Assyrian people continue to speak eastern [[Neo-Aramaic languages]].

Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century, and Assyrian identity, personal, family and tribal names, and both spoken and written varieties of Aramaic have survived from ancient times to this day.

The Assyrians initially experienced some periods of religious and cultural freedom interspersed with periods of severe religious and ethnic persecution after the Arab Islamic invasion and conquest of the 7th century AD. As heirs to ancient Mesopotamian civilization and culture, they also contributed hugely to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the [[Ummayad Caliphate|Umayyads]] and the [[Abbasids]] by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] to Syriac and afterwards to [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

However, despite this, indigenous Assyrians became second-class citizens (''[[dhimmi]]'') in a greater Arab Islamic state, and those who resisted Arabisation and conversion to Islam were subject to severe religious, ethnic and cultural discrimination, and had certain restrictions imposed upon them.<ref>Clinton Bennett (2005).

They couldn't own a Muslim slave and had to wear different clothing from Muslims in order to be distinguishable. In addition to the jizya tax, they were also required to pay the [[Kharaj]] tax on their land which was heavier than the jizya.

As non-Islamic [[proselytising]] was punishable by death under [[Sharia]] law, the Assyrians were forced into preaching in [[Transoxania]], [[Central Asia]], [[India]], [[Mongolia]] and [[China]] where they established numerous churches. The [[Church of the East]] was considered to be one of the major Christian powerhouses in the world, alongside Latin Christianity in Europe and the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Dietmar|title=Hidden Treasures And Intercultural Encounters: Studies On East Syriac Christianity In China And Central Asia|year=2009|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7f9gS40A_3IC&pg=PA321}}</ref>

From the 7th century AD onwards Mesopotamia saw a steady influx of Arabs, [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] and other [[Iranian peoples]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Aboona|first=Hirmis|title=Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdZfWpd4YrYC&pg=PR11}}</ref> and later [[Turkic peoples]], and the indigenous population retaining native Mesopotamian culture, identity, language, religion and customs were steadily marginalised and gradually became a minority in their own homeland. Conversion to Islam as a result of heavy taxation which also resulted in decreased revenue from their rulers. As a result, the new converts migrated to Muslim garrison towns nearby. These conversions were so great in number that [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]], the governor of Iraq forced them to leave the towns and pay their taxes. These upheavals lasted for over a century before it was made mandatory for everyone including the Muslim Arabs to pay the land tax.<ref>{{cite book|last=Khanbaghi|first=Aptin|title=The fire, the star and the cross: minority religions in medieval and early modern Iran|year=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iAbUEaXnfEC&pg=PA86}}</ref>

Assyrian people, still retaining [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] infused and influenced [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]] [[Christianity]], remained dominant in the north of Mesopotamia (what had been Assyria) as late as the 14th century AD<ref>According to Georges Roux and Simo Parpola</ref> and the city of [[Assur]] was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the [[Muslim]] Turco-Mongol ruler [[Tamurlane]] conducted a religiously motivated massacre of indigenous Assyrians. After that, there are no traces of a settlement at Ashur in the archaeological and numismatic record, and from this point the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>

Starting from the 19th century after the rise of nationalism in the [[Balkans]], the Ottomans started viewing Assyrians and other Christians in their eastern front as a potential threat. The Kurdish Emirs sought to consolidate their power by attacking Assyrian communities which were already well established there. Scholars estimate that tens of thousands of Assyrian in the [[Hakkari]] region were [[Massacres of Badr Khan|massacred in 1843]] when [[Badr Khan]] the emir of [[Bohtan]] invaded their region.<ref>David Gaunt, Massacres, resistance, protectors: Muslim-Christian relations in Eastern, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4mug9LrpLKcC&pg=PA32 pp. 32]</ref> After a later massacre in 1846 the Ottomans were forced by the western powers into intervening in the region, and the ensuing conflict destroyed the Kurdish emirates and reasserted the Ottoman power in the area. The Assyrians of [[Amid]] were also subject to the [[Massacres of Diyarbakir (1895)|massacres of 1895]].<ref>[[Hirmis Aboona]], Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdZfWpd4YrYC&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 105]</ref>

Culturally, ethnically and linguistically distinct from, although both quite influencing on and influenced by, their neighbours in the Middle East — the Arabs, [[Persian people|Persians]], Kurds, [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Jews]] and [[Armenians]] — the Assyrians have endured much hardship throughout their recent history as a result of religious and ethnic persecution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Khanbaghi|first=Aptin|title=The fire, the star and the cross: minority religions in medieval and early modern Iran|year=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iAbUEaXnfEC&pg=PA87}}</ref>

=== Mongolian and Turkic rule ===
{{further|Timurid Empire|Ag Qoyunlu |Kara Koyunlu}}
After initially coming under [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid]] rule, the region eventually came under the control of the [[Mongol Empire]] after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] in 1258. The Mongol khans were sympathetic with Christians and did not harm them. The most prominent among them was probably [[Isa Kelemechi]], a diplomat, astrologer, and head of the Christian affairs in the [[Yuan dynasty]] of [[East Asia]]. He spent some time in Persia under the [[Ilkhans]]. The 14th century massacres of [[Timur]] in particular, devastated the Assyrian people. Timur's massacres and pillages of all that was Christian drastically reduced their existence. At the end of the reign of Timur, the Assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places. Toward the end of the thirteenth century, [[Bar Hebraeus]] (or Bar-Abraya), the noted Assyrian scholar and hierarch, found "much quietness" in his diocese in Mesopotamia. Syria’s diocese, he wrote, was "wasted."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The region was later controlled by the in Iran-based Turkic confederations of the [[Ag Qoyunlu|Ağ Qoyunlu]] and [[Kara Koyunlu|Qara Qoyunlu]]. Subsequently all Assyrians, like with the rest of the ethnicities living in the former Ağ Qoyunlu territories, fell into [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] hands from 1501 and on.

The Ottomans secured their control over Mesopotamia and Syria in the first half of the 17th century following the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39)]] and the resulting [[Treaty of Zuhab]]. Non-Muslims were organised into [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]. Syriac Christians, however, were often considered one millet alongside Armenians until the 19th century, when Nestorian, Syriac Orthodox and Chaldeans gained that right as well.<ref name=kennith255>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fHtSuvaVAAoC&pg=PA255 The Blackwell companion to Eastern Christianity], Kenneth Parry</ref>

A religious schism amongs the Assyrians took place in the mid to late 16th century. Dissent over the hereditary succession within the Assyrian Church of the East grew until 1552, when a group of Assyrian bishops, from the northern regions of [[Amid]] and [[Salmas]], elected a priest, Mar [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa|Yohannan Sulaqa]], as a rival patriarch. To look for a bishop of [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] rank to consecrate him patriarch, Sulaqa traveled to the [[pope]] in Rome and entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]]. In 1553 he was consecrated bishop and elevated to the rank of patriarch taking the name of Mar Shimun VIII. He was granted the title of "Patriarch of the Chaldeans," and his church was named the Church of ''Athura and Mosul''.<ref>George V. Yana (Bebla), "Myth vs. Reality," ''JAA Studies'', Vol. XIV, No. 1, 2000 p. 80</ref>

Mar Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa returned to northern [[Mesopotamia]] in the same year and fixed his seat in Amid. Before being put to death by the partisans of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] patriarch of [[Alqosh]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Frazee|first=Charles A. |title=Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453–1923 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-02700-7|page=56}}</ref>{{rp|57}} he ordained five metropolitan bishops thus beginning a new ecclesiastical hierarchy: the patriarchal line known as the ''Shimun line''. The area of influence of this patriarchate soon moved from Amid east, fixing the See, after many places, in the isolated Assyrian village of [[Qochanis]]. Although this new church eventually drifted away from Rome by 1600 AD and reentered communion with the Assyrian Church, the archbishop of [[Amid]] reinstated relations with Rome in 1672 AD, giving birth to the modern [[Chaldean Catholic Church]].

In the 1840s many of the Assyrians living in the mountains of [[Hakkari]] in the south eastern corner of the Ottoman Empire were massacred by the Kurdish emirs of Hakkari and Bohtan.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aboona|first=H|author-link=Hirmis Aboona|title=Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire|pages=218–219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdZfWpd4YrYC|year=2008|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=978-1-60497-583-3}}</ref>

Another major massacre of Assyrians (and Armenians) in the [[Ottoman Empire]] occurred between 1894 and 1897 AD by Turkish troops and their Kurdish allies during the rule of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert [[Pan-Islamism]] in the Ottoman Empire, resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. Assyrians were massacred in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Hasankeyef]], [[Sivas]] and other parts of Anatolia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced "Ottomanisation" of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Turkish troops looted the remains of the Assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by Kurds. Unarmed Assyrian women and children were raped, tortured and murdered.<ref>{{cite book|last=de Courtois|first=S|title=The forgotten genocide: eastern Christians, the last Arameans|pages=105–107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whDcogCNZs4C|year=2004|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-077-4}}</ref>

==== World War I and aftermath ====

{{Main|Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian struggle for independence}}
The Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries AD,<ref>Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. pp. 218–219. ISBN 978-1-60497-583-3.</ref> culminating in the large scale [[Hamidian massacres]] of unarmed men, women and children by [[Muslim]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] in the late 19th century at the hands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its associated (largely [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Arab]]) militias, which further greatly reduced numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey.

The most significant recent persecution against the Assyrian population was the [[Assyrian genocide]] which occurred during the First World War. Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population.

This led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, [[Iran]], and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]].<ref>The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? - Page 51 by United States Congress</ref><ref>The Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum – Page 272 edited by Richard Hovannisian</ref><ref>Not Even My Name: A True Story – Page 131 by Thea Halo</ref><ref>The Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G. Korbani</ref>

In reaction to the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and lured by [[United Kingdom|British]] and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by [[Agha Petros]] and [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the Bit-[[Tyari]] tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces in an [[Assyrian war of independence]]. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|200px|Assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the [[Khabur]] river in Syria.]]
The majority of Assyrian living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of [[Iraq]] and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader [[Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII]] asked the [[League of Nations]] to recognize the right of Assyrians to govern the area known as the "[[Assyrian triangle]]" in northern Iraq.

The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and [[Tartan (Assyrian)|Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,<ref>Len Dieghton, ''Blood Sweat and Tears''</ref> and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During [[World War II]], eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the [[Royal Marine Commando]] and were involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-[[Nazi]] Iraqi forces at the battle of [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] in 1941.

However, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were massacred during the [[Simele Massacre]] by the [[Iraqi Army]] in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of [[Shimun XXIII Eshai]] the Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.<ref>{{Citation|last=Zubaida|first=S|title=Contested nations: Iraq and the Assyrians|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=July 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=363–382|doi=10.1111/j.1354-5078.2000.00363.x|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/contestednations.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref><ref name="peshitta1">{{cite web|title=Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|url=http://www.peshitta.org/initial/mareshai.html|work=Committee of the 50th Anniversary of the Patriarchate of Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|publisher=peshitta.org|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports

The [[Ba'ath Party]] seized power in [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'état|Iraq]] and [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|Syria]] in 1963, which introduced laws that aimed at suppressing the Assyrian national identity, the Arab Nationalist policies of the Ba'athists included renewed attempts to forcibly "Arabize" the indigenous Assyrians. The giving of traditional Assyrian/Akkadian names and East Aramaic/Syriac versions of Biblical names was banned, Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed and Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as ''Arab Christians''. The Ba'athist government refused to recognise Assyrians as an ethnic group, and fostered divisions among the ethnic Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church vs Assyrian Protestant).<ref name="UNHCR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html|title=Refworld – Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>

In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=زوعا|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna in particular was a target of the [[Saddam Hussein]] Ba'ath government for many years.

The [[al-Anfal campaign]] of 1986–1989 in Iraq was predominantly aimed at Kurds. However, 2,000 Assyrians were murdered through its gas campaigns; over 31 towns and villages and 25 Assyrian monasteries and churches were razed to the ground; a number of Assyrians were murdered; others were deported to large cities, and their land and homes then being appropriated by Arabs and Kurds.<ref>[http://www.indict.org.uk/crimedetails.php?crime=Anfal The Anfal Offensives], indict.org.uk</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Certrez, Donabed, and Makko |title=The Assyrian Heritage: Threads of Continuity and Influence |pages=288–289|year=2012|publisher=Uppsala University|isbn=978-91-554-8303-6}}</ref>

The ''Syriac Military Council'' is an Assyrian/Syriac military organisation in Syria. The establishment of the organisation was announced on 8 January 2013. According to the Syriac Military Council the goal of the organisation is to stand up for the national rights of Syriacs and to protect the Syriac people in Syria.

The organisation will fight mostly in the densely populated Syriac areas of the Governorates of [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]], [[Damascus]], [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|Al-Hasakah]], [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] and [[Homs Governorate|Homs]].<ref>[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/syriacs-establish-military-council-in-syria.aspx?pageID=238&nid=40329 Syriacs establish military council in Syria], ''[[Hürriyet Daily News]]'', 2 February 2013</ref>

In recent years, the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked [[Islamic terrorism]]. As a result, Assyrians have taken up arms, alongside other groups (such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians) in response to unprovoked attacks by [[Al Qaeda]], [[ISIS]]/[[ISIL]], [[Nusra Front]] and other [[terrorist]] [[Islamic Fundamentalist]] groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIS attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the [[Assyrian Homeland]] of northern Iraq, together with cities such as [[Mosul]] and [[Kirkuk]] which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of atrocities committed by ISIS terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape, forced conversions, [[Ethnic Cleansing]], robbery, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non Muslims. Assyrians in Iraq have responded by forming armed militias to defend their territories.

There are an estimated 25,000 Assyrians in all of Turkey, with most living in Istanbul.<ref name=autogenerated18>[http://sor.cua.edu/SOCNews/2002/20021201EUPStmt.html Statement on Assyrians/Syriacs in Turkey/Iraq<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The second area of the Assyrian settlement, known as Hakkari which is located in what is the modern day [[Hakkari Province]] and [[Siirt province]] of Turkey, was completely purged in the 1915 [[Assyrian genocide]], which also caused many of the Assyrians/Syriacs in Turkey to flee to other, unaffected areas of Assyrian settlement in Syria, Iran, and Iraq. However, some went to other neighbouring countries in and around the [[Caucasus]] and [[Middle East]] like Armenia, Georgia, southern Russia, Lebanon, Jordan, and others left entirely the Middle East area and went to the [[Western world|western]] countries.

The Assyrian/Syriac people can be divided along geographic, linguistic, and denominational lines, the three main groups being:
* the "[[West Syrian Rite|Western]]" or "Jacobite" group, which are from/reside in northeastern Syria ([[Al-Hasakah Governorate|Al-Hasakah Province]]) and southeastern Turkey (The [[Tur Abdin]] region) ([[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Syriac Catholic Church]]);
* the "[[East Syrian Rite|Eastern]]" or "Nestorian" group, which are from/reside in northern Iraq ([[Dohuk province]]), northeast Syria ([[Al-Hasakah Governorate|Al-Hasakah Province]]), southeastern Turkey ([[Hakkari Province]]), and northwest Iran ([[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]]);
* the [[Chaldean Christians|"Chaldean Christian" or "Chaldean Catholic"]]/Chaldo-Assyrian group, which are from/reside in northern and central Iraq ([[Ninawa Province]] and [[Baghdad]]), and northwestern Iran ([[Chaldean Catholic Church]])

Note: Assyrian followers of the Chaldean Catholic church make up the majority of the Iraqi Christian population since their conversion to Catholicism from the Assyrian [[Church of the East]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.

=== Persecution ===
Due to their Christian faith and ethnicity, the Assyrians have been persecuted since their adoption of Christianity. During the reign of [[Yazdegerd I]], Christians in Persia were viewed with suspicion as potential Roman subversives, resulting in persecutions while at the same time promoting [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Christianity as a buffer between the Churches of Rome and Persia. Persecutions and attempts to impose [[Zoroastrianism]] continued during the reign of [[Yazdegerd II]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1u2oP2RihIgC&lpg=PA85&ots=kajqpsTjCe&dq=constantine%20christianity%20yazdegerd&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q=constantine%20christianity%20yazdegerd&f=false ''This History of the Medieval World''] by Susan Wise Bauer, pg. 85-87</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2nWP0_6gkiYC&lpg=PA83&ots=lI-wd4D4Mk&dq=constantine%20christianity%20yazdegerd&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=constantine%20christianity%20yazdegerd&f=false ''A Short World History of Christianity''] by Robert Bruce Mullin, pp. 82-85</ref>

During the eras of Mongol rule under [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Timur]], there was indiscriminate slaughter of tens of thousands of Assyrians and destruction of the Assyrian population of northwestern Iran and central and northern Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409819/Nestorian |title=Nestorian (Christian sect) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>

More recent persecutions since the 19th century include the [[Massacres of Badr Khan]], the [[Massacres of Diyarbakır (1895)]], the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Assyrian genocide]], the [[Simele Massacre]], and the [[al-Anfal campaign]].

=== Diaspora ===
Since the [[Assyrian genocide]], many Assyrians have fled their Assyrian homeland for a more safe and comfortable life in the Western world countries. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Assyrian population in the Middle East has decreased dramatically. As of today there are more Assyrians in Europe, United States, Canada, and Australia than in their former homeland.

Today, the largest Assyrian diaspora communities are found in the [[Assyrians/Syriacs in the United States|United States]] (110,807–400,000),<ref name="Data Access and Dissemination Systems DADS">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_1YR_S0201&prodType=table|title=American FactFinder – Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="Brief History of Assyrians">{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/brief.html|title=Brief History of Assyrians|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> [[Assyrians in Jordan|Jordan]] (100,000–150,000),<ref name="Thrown to the Lions">[http://spectator.org/archives/2007/07/02/thrown-to-the-lions Thrown to the Lions], [[Doug Bandow]], The America Spectator</ref><ref name="aina.org">[http://www.aina.org/releases/20070511014200.htm Jordan Should Legally Recognize Displaced Iraqis As Refugees], AINA.org.

=== Assyrian vs. Syrian naming controversy ===
As early as the 8th century BC [[Luwian]] and [[Cilician]] subject rulers referred to their Assyrian overlords as ''Syrian'', a western [[Indo-European]] bastardisation of the true term ''Assyrian''.
This corruption of the name took hold in the Hellenic lands to the west of the old Assyrian Empire, thus during [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Seleucid]] rule from 323 BC the name ''Assyria'' was altered to ''Syria'', and this term was also applied to [[Aramea]] to the west which had been an Assyrian colony. When the Seleucids lost control of Assyria to the Parthians they retained the corrupted term (Syria), applying it to ancient Aramea, while the Parthians called Assyria "Assuristan," a Parthian form of the original name. It is from this period that the Syrian vs Assyrian controversy arises. Today it is accepted by the majority of scholars that the Medieval, Renaissance and Victorian term ''Syriac'' when used to describe the indigenous Christians of Mesopotamia and its immediate surrounds in effect means ''Aramean''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/ata/20070218144107.htm |title=Inscription From 800 BC Shows the Origin of the Name 'Syria' |publisher=Aina.org |date=2007-02-18 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>

The modern terminological problem goes back to colonial times, but it became more acute in 1946, when with the independence of Syria, the adjective ''Syrian'' referred to an independent state. The controversy isn't restricted to [[exonyms]] like English "Assyrian" vs. "Aramaean", but also applies to self-designation in Neo-Aramaic, the minority "Aramaean" faction endorses both ''Sūryāyē'' {{lang|syr|ܣܘܪܝܝܐ}} and ''Ārāmayē'' {{lang|syr|ܐܪܡܝܐ}}, while the majority "Assyrian" faction insists on ''Āṯūrāyē'' {{lang|syr|ܐܬܘܪܝܐ}} but also accepts ''Sūryāyē''. However, an increasing number of scholars as well as "Syriacs" have begun to use [[Aramean]] to refer to this distinct ethnicity (as opposed to ethic [[Assyrian nationalism|Assyrians]]) since this is historically, culturally and linguistically a more accurate term.

[[File:Iraqvillagealqosh.JPG|thumb|left|200ppx|[[Alqosh]], located in the midst of Assyrian contemporary civilization.]]
The question of ethnic identity and self-designation is sometimes connected to the scholarly debate on the [[Syria (etymology)|etymology of "Syria"]]. The question has a long history of academic controversy, but majority mainstream opinion currently strongly favours that ''Syria'' is indeed ultimately derived from the Assyrian term 𒀸𒋗𒁺 𐎹 '''''Aššūrāyu'''''.<ref name="Richard Nelson Frye Syria and Assyria">{{cite journal |author=Frye, R.

Silvio Zaorani (Turin, 1993), pp. 106–107</ref>

Rudolf Macuch points out that the Eastern Neo-Aramaic press initially used the term "Syrian" (''suryêta'') and only much later, with the rise of nationalism, switched to "Assyrian" (''atorêta'').<ref>Rudolf Macuch, ''Geschichte der spät- und neusyrischen Literatur'', New York: de Gruyter, 1976.</ref> According to Tsereteli, however, a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] equivalent of "Assyrians" appears in ancient Georgian, Armenian and Russian documents.<ref>Tsereteli, ''Sovremennyj assirijskij jazyk'', Moscow: Nauka, 1964.</ref> This correlates with the theory of the nations to the East of Mesopotamia knew the group as Assyrians, while to the West, beginning with Greek influence, the group was known as Syrians. Syria being a Greek corruption of Assyria.

The debate appears to have been settled by the discovery of the [[Çineköy inscription]] in favour of Syria being derived from Assyria.

The ''Çineköy inscription'' is a [[Hieroglyphic Luwian]]-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] [[bilingual inscription|bilingual]], uncovered from Çineköy, [[Adana Province]], Turkey (ancient [[Cilicia]]), dating to the 8th century BC. Originally published by Tekoglu and Lemaire (2000),<ref>Tekoglu, R. & Lemaire, A. (2000). La bilingue royale louvito-phénicienne de Çineköy. ''Comptes rendus de l’Académie des inscriptions, et belleslettres, année 2000'', 960–1006.</ref> it was more recently the subject of a 2006 paper published in the [[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]], in which the author, Robert Rollinger, lends support to the age-old debate of the name "Syria" being derived from "Assyria" (see [[Etymology of Syria]]).

The object on which the inscription is found is a monument belonging to Urikki, [[vassal]] king of [[Quwê|Hiyawa]] (i.e., [[Cilicia]]), dating to the eighth century BC. In this monumental inscription, Urikki made reference to the relationship between his kingdom and his Assyrian overlords. The Luwian inscription reads "Sura/i" whereas the Phoenician translation reads ''’ŠR'' or "Ashur" which, according to Rollinger (2006), "settles the problem once and for all".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Rollinger |title=The terms "Assyria" and "Syria" again |url=http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf | doi=10.1086/511103 |format=PDF |journal=[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]| volume=65| issue=4 |pages=284–287 |year=2006}}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Assyrian culture}}
[[File:Assyrianclothes23.jpg|thumb|Assyrian child dressed in traditional clothes.]]

Assyrian culture is largely influenced by Christianity.<ref>http://www.aina.org/articles/chicago.pdf</ref> Main festivals occur during religious holidays such as Easter and Christmas. There are also secular holidays such as [[Kha b-Nisan]] (vernal equinox).<ref>[http://www.assyrianconference.com/ashur/002.htm The Assyrian New Year]</ref>

People often greet and bid relatives farewell with a kiss on each cheek and by saying "{{lang|syr|ܫܠܡܐ ܥܠܝܟ}}" ''[[Shlama]]/Shlomo lokh'', which means: "Peace be upon you." Others are greeted with a handshake with the right hand only; according to Middle Eastern customs, the left hand is associated with evil. Similarly, shoes may not be left facing up, one may not have their feet facing anyone directly, whistling at night is thought to waken evil spirits, etc.<ref>Chamberlain, AF. "Notes on Some Aspects of the Folk-Psychology of Night". ''American Journal of Psychology'', 1908 – JSTOR.</ref>

There are many Assyrian customs that are common in other Middle Eastern cultures. A parent will often place an eye pendant on their baby to prevent "an evil eye being cast upon it".<ref>Gansell, AR.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}

The Neo-Aramaic languages are ultimately descended from [[Old Aramaic]], the lingua franca in the later phase of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, displacing the [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Assyrian dialect of Akkadian]]. Aramaic was the language of commerce, trade and communication and became the vernacular language of Assyria in classical antiquity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightofword.org/aramaic/pdf/Introduction.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – PeshittaNewTestament.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-16| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202005322/http://www.lightofword.org/aramaic/pdf/Introduction.pdf| archivedate=2 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>Bae, C.

To the native speaker, "Syriac" is usually called ''Soureth'' or ''Suret''. A wide variety of languages and dialects exist, including [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], [[Western Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]]. Minority dialects include [[Senaya]] and [[Bohtan Neo-Aramaic]], which are both [[Endangered language|near extinction]]. All are classified as Neo-Aramaic languages and are written using [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]], a derivative of the ancient [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]]. [[Jewish Aramaic|Jewish]] varieties such as [[Lishanid Noshan]], [[Lishán Didán]] and [[Lishana Deni]], written in the [[Hebrew script]], are spoken by Assyrian Jews.<ref name="Avenery, Iddo 1988">Avenery, Iddo, ''The Aramaic Dialect of the Jews of Zakho''.

There is a considerable amount of [[mutually intelligible|mutual intelligibility]] between Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Senaya, Lishana Deni and Bohtan Neo-Aramaic. Therefore, these "languages" would generally be considered to be dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic rather than separate languages. The [[Jewish Aramaic]] languages of Lishan Didan and Lishanid Noshan share a partial intelligibility with these varieties. The mutual intelligibility between the aforementioned languages and Turoyo and Western Neo-Aramic is, depending on the dialect, limited to partial, and may be asymmetrical.<ref name="Avenery, Iddo 1988"/><ref>[[Wolfhart Heinrichs|Heinrichs, Wolfhart]] (ed.)

Assyrians also may speak one or more languages of their country of residence. Being [[Stateless nation|stateless]], Assyrians also learn the language or languages of their adopted country, usually Arabic, [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In northern Iraq and western Iran, Turkish and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] are widely spoken. Also, due to their statelessness, [[List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrians would have loanwords]] from the aforementioned languages.

[[File:Syriac Christian Churches.svg|thumb|right|280px|Historical divisions within Syriac Christian Churches in the Middle East.]]
{{Main|Syriac Christianity}}
Assyrians belong to various [[Christian denominations]] such as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], with an estimated 400,000 members,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_41.html#303 |title=Adherents.com |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> the Chaldean Catholic Church, with about 900,000 members,<ref>J. Martin Bailey, Betty Jane Bailey, Who Are the Christians in the Middle East? p. 163: "more than two thirds" out of "nearly a million" Christians in Iraq.</ref> and the Syriac Orthodox Church ''(ʿIdto Suryoyto Triṣaṯ Šuḇḥo)'', which has between 1,000,000 and 4,000,000 members around the world (only some of whom are Assyrians),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_622.html|title=Adherents.com|work=adherents.com}}</ref> the [[Ancient Church of the East]] with some 100,000 members, and various [[Protestant]] churches, such as the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] with 25,000 adherents, and the [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]. While Assyrians are predominantly [[Christians]], a number are [[irreligious]].

{{As of|2011}} [[Mar Dinkha IV]], resident in Chicago Illinois, was [[Patriarch]] of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Mar Addai II]], with headquarters in Baghdad, was Patriarch of the [[Ancient Church of the East]], and [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]] was Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church, with headquarters in [[Damascus]]. [[Emmanuel III Delly|Mar Emmanuel III Delly]], the Patriarch of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], was the first Patriarch to be elevated to Cardinal, joining the [[college of cardinals]] in November 2007.

Many members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet system]].
The group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of [[Syriac Christianity]] and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into:
* adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]] following the [[East Syrian Rite]] also known as "'''Nestorians'''"
* adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] following the [[West Syrian Rite]] also known as '''Jacobites'''
* adherents of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] following the West Syrian Rite
For obvious reasons the [[Chaldean Catholic]]s who follow the East Syrian Rite and were originally members of the historical [[Church of the East]] are not Nestorian in theology, a designation which the Church of the East itself denied.

A small minority of Assyrians of the above denominations accepted the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 20th century, possibly due to British influences, and is now organized in the [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]], the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and other Protestant Assyrian groups.

Baptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a [[Bris]] or [[Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of [[Jesus]]; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.

Some well known Assyrian/Syriac singers in modern times are [[Ashur Bet Sargis]], [[Sargon Gabriel]], [[Habib Mousa]], [[Josef Özer]], [[Janan Sawa]], [[Klodia Hanna]], [[Juliana Jendo]], and [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]].

The first International [[Aramaic Music Festival]] was held in Lebanon from 1 August until 4 August 2008 for Assyrian people internationally. Assyrians are also involved in western contemporary music, such as Rock/Metal ([[Melechesh]]), Rap ([[Timz]]) and Techno/Dance ([[Aril Brikha]]).

=== Dance ===
{{Main|Assyrian folk dance}}
Assyrians have numerous traditional [[dance]]s which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings. Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general near eastern elements.

=== Festivals ===
Assyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which [[Easter]] is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the [[Gregorian calendar]] and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter]. Article from [[United States Naval Observatory]] (March 27, 2007).</ref> However, members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East celebrate Easter on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 inclusively on the Gregorian calendar (March 22 and April 25 on the [[Julian calendar]]). During [[Lent]], Assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based.

Assyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones:
* [[Kha b-Nisan]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|ܚܕ ܒܢܝܣܢ}}'', the Assyrian New Year, traditionally on April 1, though usually celebrated on January 1. Assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties, dancing, and listening to poets telling the story of creation.<ref>[http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf AUA Release March 26, 2006.]</ref>
* [[Sauma d-Ba'utha]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|ܒܥܘܬܐ ܕܢܝܢܘܝܐ}}'', the Nineveh fast, is a three-day period of fasting and prayer.<ref name=SycOrth>{{cite web|title=Three Day Fast of Nineveh|url=http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/|publisher=syrianorthodoxchurch.org|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>
* Somikka, All Saints Day, is celebrated to motivate children to fast during Lent through use of frightening costumes
* Kalu d'Sulaqa, feast of the Bride of the Ascension, celebrates Assyrian resistance to the invasion of Assyria by Tamerlane
* Nusardyl, commemorating the baptism of the Assyrians of Urmia by St. Thomas.<ref name="cultureofiran.com">[http://www.cultureofiran.com/assyrian_festivals.html "Assyrian Festivals and Events in Iran"], ''Encyclopædia Iranica''</ref>
* Sharra d'Mart Maryam, usually on August 15, a festival and feast celebrating St. Mary with games, food, and celebration.<ref name="cultureofiran.com" />
* Other Sharras (special festivals) include: Sharra d'Mart Shmuni, Sharra d'Mar Shimon Bar-Sabbaye, Sharra d'Mar Mari, and Shara d'Mar Zaia, Mar Bishu, Mar Sawa, Mar Sliwa, and Mar Odisho
* Yoma d'Sah'deh (Day of Martyrs), commemorating the thousands massacred in the [[Simele Massacre]] and the hundreds of thousands massacred in the [[Assyrian Genocide]].

Assyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2–3 days; in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] they last 1–2 days.

=== Traditional clothing ===
{{Main|Assyrian clothing}}
Assyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Assyrian cuisine}}
Assyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines. It is rich in [[grain]], [[meat]], [[potato]], [[cheese]], [[bread]] and [[tomato]]. Typically [[rice]] is served with every meal, with a stew poured over it. [[Tea]] is a popular drink, and there are several dishes of desserts, snacks, and beverages. [[Alcohol]]ic drinks such as [[wine]] and [[wheat beer]] are organically produced and drunk.

Late 20th century DNA analysis conducted by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]], Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, "shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population."<ref name="assyrianfoundation.org">[http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm Dr. Joel J.

In a 2006 study of the Y chromosome DNA of six regional Armenian populations, including, for comparison, Assyrians and Syrians, researchers found that, "the Semitic populations (Assyrians and Syrians) are very distinct from each other according to both [comparative] axes. This difference supported also by other methods of comparison points out the weak genetic affinity between the two populations with different historical destinies." <ref name="Iran and the Caucasus">[http://www.rau.am/downloads/publ.kafedr/episkoposyan_medbiolog/Yepiskoposian_I&C_06.pdf Yepiskoposian et al., Iran and the Caucasus, Volume 10, Number 2, 2006, pp. 191-208(18), "Genetic Testing of Language Replacement Hypothesis in Southwest Asia"]</ref>

A 2008 study on the genetics of "old ethnic groups in Mesopotamia," including 340 subjects from seven ethnic communities ("Assyrian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, Armenian, Turkmen, the Arab peoples in Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait") found that Assyrians were homogeneous with respect to all other ethnic groups sampled in the study, regardless of religious affiliation.<ref name="pubmed.gov">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18505046 Banoei et al., Human Biology.

[[Endogamy]] was found to be high for this population through determination of the heterogeneity coefficient (+0,6867), Our study supports earlier findings indicating the relatively closed nature of the Assyrian community as a whole, which as a result of their religious and cultural traditions, have had little intermixture with other populations."</ref>

In a 2011 study focusing on the genetics of Marsh Arabs of Iraq, researchers identified Y chromosome haplotypes shared by Marsh Arabs, Iraqis, and Assyrians, "supporting a common local background." <ref name="BMC Evolutionary Biology">[http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-11-288.pdf Al-Zahery et al., BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:288, "In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: a survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq"]"In the less frequent J1-M267* clade, only marginally affected by events of expansion, Marsh Arabs shared haplotypes with other Iraqi and Assyrian samples, supporting a common local background."</ref>
