'''Damascus''' ({{lang-ar|دمشق}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Dimashq}}'' {{IPA-ar|ˈdimaʃq|IPA}}) is the capital and the second-largest city of [[Syria]] after [[Aleppo]] prior to the civil war. It is now most likely the largest city of Syria, due to the decline of Aleppo because of the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as ''ash-Sham'' ({{lang-ar|الشام}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ash-Shām}}'') and nicknamed as the ''City of [[Jasmine]]'' ({{lang-ar|مدينة الياسمين}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Madīnat al-Yāsmīn}}''). In addition to being one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious center of the [[Levant]]. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 {{As of|2009|lc=y}}.<ref name="Syrian Population"/>

Located in southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area of 2.6 million people (2004).<ref>Central Bureau of Statistics Syria [http://www.cbssyr.org/General%20census/census%202004/pop-man.pdf Syria census 2004]</ref> Geographically embedded on the eastern foothills of the [[Anti-Lebanon]] mountain range {{convert|80|km|mi}} inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau {{convert|680|m|ft}} [[above sea level]], Damascus experiences a semi-arid climate because of the [[rain shadow effect]]. The [[Barada|Barada River]] flows through Damascus.

First settled in the second millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] from 661 to 750. After the victory of the [[Abbasid dynasty]], the seat of Islamic power was moved to [[Baghdad]]. Damascus saw a political decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] and [[Mamluk]] periods. During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the city decayed while maintaining a certain cultural prestige.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Today, it is the seat of the central government and all of the government ministries.

The name of Damascus first appeared in the geographical list of [[Thutmose III]] as T-m-ś-q in the 15th century BC.<ref>List I, 13 in J. Simons, ''Handbook for the Study of Egyptian Topographical Lists relating to Western Asia'', Leiden 1937. See also Y. AHARONI, ''The Land of the Bible: A Historical Geography'', London 1967, p147, No. 13.</ref>
The [[etymology]] of the ancient name "T-m-ś-q" is uncertain, but it is suspected to be pre-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]]. It is attested as ''{{Transl|sem|Dimašqa}}'' in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], ''{{Transl|sem|T-ms-ḳw}}'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], ''{{Transl|sem|Dammaśq}}'' ({{lang|he|דמשק}}) in [[Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]] and ''Dammeśeq'' ({{lang|he|דמשק}}) in [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]]. The Akkadian spelling is found in the [[Amarna letters]], from the 14th century BC. Later [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] spellings of the name often include an intrusive ''[[resh]]'' (letter ''r''), perhaps influenced by the root ''dr'', meaning "dwelling". Thus, the [[Qumran]]ic ''Darmeśeq'' ({{lang|he|דרמשק}}), and ''Darmsûq'' ({{lang|syr|ܕܪܡܣܘܩ}}) in [[Syriac language|Syriac]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-097X%28198805%290%3A270%3C97%3AADAHSO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S |title=(in Book Reviews) ''Ancient Damascus: A Historical Study of the Syrian City-State from Earliest Times Until Its Fall to the Assyrians in 732 BC.'', Wayne T.

''{{transl|ar|ALA|Ash-Shām}}'' is an Arabic term for "[[Levant]]" and for "Syria"; the latter, and particularly the historical [[region of Syria]], is called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Bilādu sh-Shām}}'' ({{lang|ar|بلاد الشام}} / "land of the Levant").

==Geography==
[[File:Damascus SPOT 1363.jpg|thumb|left|Damascus in spring seen from [[Spot (satellites)|Spot satellite]]]]
Damascus was built in a strategic site on a plateau  above sea-level and about {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} inland from the Mediterranean, sheltered by the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]], supplied with water by the Barada River, and at a crossroads between trade routes: the north-south route connecting Egypt with Asia Minor, and the east-west cross-desert route connecting Lebanon with the Euphrates river valley. The Anti-Lebanon mountains mark the border between Syria and Lebanon. The range has peaks of over 10,000&nbsp;ft. and blocks precipitation from the Mediterranean sea, so that the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times this was mitigated by the Barada River, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the [[Ghouta]], irrigated farmland where many vegetables, cereals fruits have been farmed since ancient times. Maps of Roman Syria indicate that the Barada river emptied into a lake of some size east of Damascus. Today it is called Bahira Atayba, the hesitant lake, because in years of severe drought it does not even exist.<ref name="romeartlover"/>

The modern city has an area of {{convert|105|km2|abbr=on}}, out of which {{convert|77|km2|abbr=on}} is urban, while [[Jabal Qasioun]] occupies the rest.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Damascus Metropolitan Area Urban Planning and Development |url=http://dma-upd.org/PublicFiles/File/Discussion%20Papers/02_Strategy%20and%20Frameworks%20for%20the%20Damascus%20City%20Urbanization%20to%20Guide%20the%20City%20Master%20Plan%20Revision_R1.pdf?lang=en |title=DMA-UPD Discussion Paper Series No.2 |date=October 2009 |page=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028075616/http://dma-upd.org/PublicFiles/File/Discussion%20Papers/02_Strategy%20and%20Frameworks%20for%20the%20Damascus%20City%20Urbanization%20to%20Guide%20the%20City%20Master%20Plan%20Revision_R1.pdf?lang=en |archivedate=2012-10-28}}</ref>

[[File:Barada river in Damascus (April 2009).jpg|thumb|upright|One of the rare periods the [[Barada]] river is high, seen here next to the [[Four Seasons Hotel Damascus|Four Seasons]] hotel in downtown Damascus]]
The old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river [[Barada]] which is almost dry ({{convert|3|cm|0|abbr=on}} left). To the south-east, north and north-east it is surrounded by suburban areas whose history stretches back to the Middle Ages: [[Midan]] in the south-west, [[Sarouja]] and [[Imara, Damascus|Imara]] in the north and north-west. These neighborhoods originally arose on roads leading out of the city, near the tombs of religious figures. In the 19th century outlying villages developed on the slopes of [[Jabal Qasioun]], overlooking the city, already the site of the al-Salihiyah neighborhood centred on the important shrine of Sheikh [[Ibn Arabi|Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi]]. These new neighborhoods were initially settled by Kurdish soldiery and Muslim refugees from the European regions of the Ottoman Empire which had fallen under Christian rule. Thus they were known as ''al-Akrad'' ''(the Kurds)'' and ''[[al-Muhajirin (district)|al-Muhajirin]]'' ''(the migrants)''. They lay {{convert|2|-|3|km|abbr=on|0}} north of the old city.

From the late 19th century on, a modern administrative and commercial centre began to spring up to the west of the old city, around the Barada, centred on the area known as ''[[Marjeh Square|al-Marjeh]]'' or ''the meadow''. ''Al-Marjeh'' soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern Damascus, with the city hall on it. The courts of justice, post office and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south. A Europeanised residential quarter soon began to be built on the road leading between [[Marjeh Square|al-Marjeh]] and [[al-Salihiyah]]. The commercial and administrative centre of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area.

[[File:Districts of damascus english.svg|thumb|210px|[[Municipalities of Damascus]]]]In the 20th century, newer suburbs developed north of the Barada, and to some extent to the south, invading the Ghouta oasis. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1956-1957 the new neighborhood of [[Yarmouk (camp)|Yarmouk]] became a second home to thousands of Palestinian refugees.<ref>The palestinian refugees in Syria. Their past, present and future. Dr. Hamad Said al-Mawed, 1999</ref> City planners preferred to preserve the Ghouta as far as possible, and in the later 20th century some of the main areas of development were to the north, in the western [[Mezzeh]] neighborhood and most recently along the Barada valley in [[Dummar]] in the north west and on the slopes of the mountains at Berze in the north-east. Poorer areas, often built without official approval, have mostly developed south of the main city.

Damascus used to be surrounded by an [[oasis]], the [[Ghouta]] region (الغوطة ''al-ġūṭä''), watered by the Barada river. The Fijeh spring, west along the Barada valley, used to provide the city with drinking water. The Ghouta oasis has been decreasing in size with the rapid expansion of housing and industry in the city and it is almost dry. It has also become polluted due to the city's traffic, industry, and sewage. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[File:Eagle Dome2(js).jpg|240px||thumb|Umayyad Mosque façade]]

===Early settlement===
[[Carbon-14]] dating at [[Tell Ramad]], on the outskirts of Damascus, suggests that the site may have been occupied since the second half of the seventh millennium BC, possibly around 6300 B C.<ref>Moore, A.M.T. ''The Neolithic of the Levant''. Oxford, UK: Oxford University, 1978. 192–198. Print.</ref> However, evidence of settlement in the wider Barada basin dating back to 9000 BC exists, although no large-scale settlement was present within Damascus walls until the second millennium BC.<ref name="Burns2">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=2}}</ref>

Damascus was a part of the ancient province of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] in the [[Hyksos]] Kingdom, from 1720 to 1570 BC.<ref>MacMillan, pp.&nbsp;30–31</ref> Some of the earliest [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] records are from the 1350 BC [[Amarna letters]], when Damascus (called ''Dimasqu'') was ruled by king [[Biryawaza]]. The Damascus region, as well as the rest of Syria, became a battleground circa 1260 BC, between the [[Hittites]] from the north and the [[Ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]] from the south,<ref name="Burns5">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=5–6}}</ref> ending with a signed treaty between [[Hattusili III|Hattusili]] and [[Ramesses II]] where the former handed over control of the Damascus area to Ramesses II in 1259 BC.<ref name="Burns5"/> The arrival of the [[Sea Peoples]], around 1200 BC, marked the end of the [[Bronze Age]] in the region and brought about new development of warfare.<ref name="Burns7">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=7}}</ref> Damascus was only the peripheral part of this picture which mostly affected the larger population centers of ancient Syria. However, these events had contributed to the development of Damascus as a new influential center that emerged with the transition from the Bronze Age to the [[Iron Age]].<ref name="Burns7"/>

Damascus is mentioned in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:15 as existing at the time of the [[Chedorlaomer|War of the Kings]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2014:15&version=NIV|title=Genesis 14:15 (New International Version)|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=25 November 2009|ref=harv}}</ref> According to the 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] in his twenty-one volume ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Damascus (along with [[Trachonitis]]), was founded by [[Uz (son of Aram)|Uz]], the son of [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link2HCH0006 |title=The Antiquities of the Jews, by Flavius Josephus, Book 1, Ch. 6, Sect. 4 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> In Antiquities i. 7,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link2HCH0007 |title=The Antiquities of the Jews, by Flavius Josephus, Book 1, Ch. 7, Sect. 2 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> Josephus reports:

<blockquote>[[Nicolaus of Damascus]], in the fourth book of his History, says thus: "[[Abraham]] reigned at Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an army out of the land above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldeans: but, after a long time, he got him up, and removed from that country also, with his people, and went into the land then called the land of [[Canaan]], but now the land of Judea, and this when his posterity were become a multitude; as to which posterity of his, we relate their history in another work. Now the name of Abraham is even still famous in the country of Damascus; and there is shown a village named from him, The Habitation of Abraham.</blockquote>

Damascus is not documented as an important city until the arrival of the [[Aramaeans]], a [[Semitic people]] from [[Mesopotamia]], in the 11th century BC. By the start of the first millennium BC, several Aramaic kingdoms were formed, as Aramaeans abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and formed federated tribal states. One of these kingdoms was [[Aram-Damascus]], centered on its capital Damascus.<ref name="Burns9">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=9}}</ref> The Aramaeans who entered the city without battle, adopted the name "Dimashqu" for their new home. Noticing the agricultural potential of the still-undeveloped and sparsely populated area,<ref name="Burns10">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=10}}</ref> they established the water distribution system of Damascus by constructing canals and tunnels which maximized the efficiency of the river Barada. The same network was later improved by the Romans and the Umayyads, and still forms the basis of the water system of the old part of the city today.<ref name="Burns13">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=13–14}}</ref> The Aramaeans initially turned Damascus into an outpost of a loose federation of Aramaean tribes, known as [[Zobah|Aram-Zobah]], based in the [[Beqaa Valley]].<ref name="Burns10"/>

The city would gain preeminence in southern Syria when Ezron, the claimant to Aram-Zobah's throne who was denied kingship of the federation, fled Beqaa and captured Damascus by force in 965 BC. Ezron overthrew the city's tribal governor and founded the independent entity of Aram-Damascus. As this new state expanded south, it prevented the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] from spreading north and the two kingdoms soon clashed as they both sought to dominate trading hegemony in the east.<ref name="Burns10"/> Under Ezron's grandson, [[Ben-Hadad I]] (880–841 BC), and his successor [[Hazael]], Damascus annexed [[Bashan]] (modern-day [[Hauran]] region), and went on the offensive with Israel. This conflict continued until the early 8th century BC when [[Ben-Hadad II]] was captured by Israel after unsuccessfully besieging [[Sebastia, Nablus|Samaria]]. As a result, he granted Israel trading rights in Damascus.<ref name="Burns11">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=11}}</ref>

Another possible reason for the treaty between Aram-Damascus and Israel was the common threat of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] which was attempting to expand into the Mediterranean coast. In 853 BC, King [[Hadadezer]] of Damascus led a [[Levant]]ine coalition, that included forces from the northern Aram-Hamath kingdom and troops supplied by [[King Ahab]] of Israel, in the [[Battle of Qarqar]] against the Neo-Assyrian army. Aram-Damascus came out victorious, temporarily preventing the Assyrians from encroaching into Syria. However, after Hadadzezer was killed by his successor, Hazael, the Levantine alliance collapsed. Aram-Damascus attempted to invade Israel, but was interrupted by the renewed Assyrian invasion. Hazael ordered a retreat to the walled part of Damascus while the Assyrians plundered the remainder of the kingdom. Unable to enter the city, they declared their supremacy in the Hauran and Beqa'a valleys.<ref name="Burns11"/>

By the 8th century BC, Damascus was practically engulfed by the Assyrians and entered a dark age. Nonetheless, it remained the economic and cultural center of the Near East as well as the Arameaen resistance. In 727, a revolt took place in the city, but was put down by Assyrian forces. After Assyria went on a wide-scale campaign of quelling revolts throughout Syria, Damascus became totally subjugated by their rule. A positive effect of this was stability for the city and benefits from the spice and incense trade with [[Arabia]]. However, Assyrian authority was dwindling by 609–605 BC, and Syria-Palestine was falling into the orbit of Pharaoh [[Necho II]]'s Egypt. In 572, all of Syria had been conquered by the [[Neo-Babylonian]]s, but the status of Damascus under [[Babylon]] is relatively unknown.<ref name="Burns2123">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=21–23}}</ref>

Damascus was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, Damascus became the site of a struggle between the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] and [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] empires. The control of the city passed frequently from one empire to the other. [[Seleucus I Nicator]], one of Alexander's generals, made [[Antioch]] the capital of his vast empire, which led to the decline of Damascus' importance compared with new Seleucid cities such as [[Latakia]] in the north. Later, Demetrius III Philopator rebuilt the city according to the Greek [[hippodamian]] system and renamed it "Demetrias".<ref>Cohen raises doubts about this claim in {{Citation | author1=Cohen, Getzel M | author2=EBSCOhost | title=The Hellenistic settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa | publication-date=2006 | publisher=University of California Press | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32915052 | accessdate=26 May 2014 }} page 137 note 4 - suggeasting the ''received tradition'' of the renaming rests on a few writers following Mionnets writings in 1811</ref>

In 64 BC, the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] general [[Pompey]] annexed the western part of Syria. The Romans occupied Damascus and subsequently incorporated it into the league of ten cities known as the [[Decapolis]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=qQKIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Rome in the East: The Transformation of an Empire|author= Warwick Ball|page= 181|year= 2002}}</ref> which themselves were incorporated  into the province of Syria and granted autonomy.<ref>Skolnik, Fred; Michael Berenbaum ( 2007) ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' Volume 5 Granite Hill Publishers pg 527</ref>

The city of Damascus was entirely redesigned by the Romans after Pompey conquered the region. Still today the Old Town of Damascus retains the rectangular shape of the Roman city, with its two main axes: the Decumanus Maximus (east-west; known today as the ''Via Recta'') and the Cardo (north-south), the Decumanus being about twice as long. The Romans built a monumental gate which still survives at the eastern end of Decumanus Maximus. The gate originally had three arches: the central arch was for chariots while the side arches were for pedestrians.<ref name="romeartlover">romeartlover, [http://romeartlover.tripod.com/Damasco1.html "Damascus: the ancient town"]</ref>

in 23 BE Herod the Great was gifted lands controlled by [[Zenodorus son of Lysanias]] by Caesar Augustus<ref>Knoblet, Jerry (2005) ''Herod the Great'' University Press of America.</ref> and some scholars believe that Herod was also granted control of Damascus as well.<ref>Burns, Ross (2007) ''Damascus: A History'' Routledge pg 52</ref>  The control of Damascus reverted to Syria either upon the death of Herod the Great or was part of the lands given to Herod Philip which were given to Syria with his death in 33/34.

Some scholars suggest that control of Damascus was gained by [[Aretas IV Philopatris]] of [[Nabataean kingdom|Nabatea]] between the death of Herod Phillip in 33/44 and the death of Aretas in 40 CE but there is substantial evidence against Aretas controlling the city before 37 CE and many reasons why it could not have been a gift from Caligula between 37 and 40 CE.<ref>Riesner, Rainer (1998) ''Paul's Early Period: Chronology, Mission Strategy, Theology'' Wm.

Damascus became a metropolis by the beginning of the 2nd century and in 222 it was upgraded to a ''colonia'' by the Emperor [[Septimius Severus]]. During the ''[[Pax Romana]]'', Damascus and the Roman province of Syria in general began to prosper. Damascus's importance as a [[caravan city]] was evident with the trade routes from southern [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[Palmyra]], [[Petra]], and the silk routes from China all converging on it. The city satisfied the Roman demands for eastern luxuries. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Little remains of the architecture of the Romans, but the town planning of the old city did have a lasting effect. The Roman architects brought together the Greek and Aramaean foundations of the city and fused them into a new layout measuring approximately {{convert|1500|by|750|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}}, surrounded by a city wall. The city wall contained seven gates, but only the eastern gate (Bab Sharqi) remains from the Roman period. Roman Damascus lies mostly at depths of up to five meters (16.4&nbsp;ft) below the modern city.

The old borough of [[Bab Tuma]] was developed at the end of the Roman/Byzantine era by the local [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] community. According to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], Saint Paul and [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] both lived in that neighborhood. Roman Catholic historians also consider Bab Tuma to be the birthplace of several [[Popes]] such as [[Pope John V|John V]] and [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]].

Muhammad's first interaction with the people of Damascus was when he sent Shiya bin Wahab to Haris bin Ghasanni the king of Damascus during the [[Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)]] called Harith bin Abi Shimr Al-Ghassani. In the Letter Muhammad stated: "Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall prevail everywhere.

===Islamic Arab era===
[[File:Courtyard2(js).jpg|thumb|right|Courtyard of the [[Umayyad Mosque]]]]
After most of the Syrian countryside was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] during the reign of Caliph [[Umar]], Damascus itself was [[Siege of Damascus (634)|conquered]] by the [[Muslim-Arab]] general [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] in September–August 635 CE. His [[Rashidun army|army]] had previously attempted to capture the city in April 634, but without success.<ref name="Burns99">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=98–99}}</ref> With Damascus now in Muslim-Arab hands, the Byzantines, alarmed at the loss of their most prestigious city in the Near East, had decided to wrest back control of it. Under Emperor [[Heraclius]], the Byzantines fielded an army superior to that of the Rashidun in manpower. They advanced into southern Syria during the spring of 636 and consequently Khalid ibn al-Walid's forces withdrew from Damascus to prepare for renewed confrontation.<ref name="Burns100">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=100}}</ref> In August, the two powers met along the [[Yarmouk River]] where they a fought a [[Battle of Yarmouk|major battle]] which ended in a decisive Muslim victory, solidifying the latter's rule in Syria and Palestine.<ref name="Burns104">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=103–104}}</ref>

While the Muslims administered the city, the population of Damascus remained mostly Christian—[[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Monophysite]]—with a growing community of [[Muslims]] from [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], and the [[Syrian Desert]].<ref name="Burns105">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=105}}</ref> The governor assigned to the city which had been chosen as the capital of [[Bilad al-Sham|Islamic Syria]] was [[Mu'awiya I]]. After the death of Caliph [[Ali]] in 661, Mu'awiya was chosen as the caliph of the expanding Islamic empire. Because of the vast amounts of assets his clan, the [[Umayyad]]s, owned in the city and because of its traditional economic and social links with the [[Hijaz]] as well as the [[Christian Arab]] tribes of the region, Mu'awiya established Damascus as the capital of the entire [[Caliphate]].<ref name="Burns107">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=106–107}}</ref> With the ascension of Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] in 685, an Islamic coinage system was introduced and all of the surplus revenue of the Caliphate's provinces were forwarded to the treasury of Damascus. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was also established as the official language, giving the Muslim minority of the city an advantage over the Aramaic-speaking Christians in administrative affairs.<ref name="Burns110">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=110}}</ref> It is critical to note that, at the time Damascus was conquered by the Muslims, the majority of Arabs were either pagans or Christians. Damascus itself was predominantly Aramaic with Arab speaking people.

Abd al-Malik's successor, al-Walid initiated construction of the [[Grand Mosque of Damascus]] (known as the Umayyad Mosque) in 706. The site originally had been the Christian Cathedral of St. John and the Muslims maintained the building's dedication to [[John the Baptist]].<ref name="Burns113">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=113}}</ref> By 715, the mosque was complete. Al-Walid died that same year and he was succeeded at first by [[Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik]] and then by [[Umar II]], who each ruled for brief periods before the reign of [[Hisham]] in 724. With these successions, the status of Damascus was gradually weakening as Suleiman had chosen [[Ramla]] as his residence and later Hisham chose [[Resafa]]. Following the murder of the latter in 743, the Caliphate of the Umayyads—which by then stretched from Spain to India— was crumbling as a result of widespread revolts. During the reign of [[Marwan II]] in 744, the capital of the empire was relocated to [[Harran]] in the northern [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] region.<ref name="Burns122">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=121–122}}</ref>

[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Dome of the Treasury211099.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Qubbat al-Khazna|dome of Damascus' treasury]] in the Umayyad Mosque]]

On 25 August 750, the [[Abbasid]]s, having already beaten the Umayyads in the [[Battle of the Zab]] in Iraq, conquered Damascus after facing little resistance. With the heralding of the Abbasid Caliphate, Damascus became eclipsed and subordinated by [[Baghdad]], the new Islamic capital. Within the first six months of Abbasid rule, revolts began erupting in the city, albeit too isolated and unfocused to present a viable threat. Nonetheless, the last of the prominent Umayyads were executed, the traditional officials of Damascus ostracized, and army generals from the city were dismissed. Afterward, the Umayyad family cemetery was desecrated and the city walls were torn down, reducing Damascus into a provincial town of little importance. It roughly disappeared from written records for the next century and the only significant improvement of the city was the Abbasid-built treasury dome in the Umayyad Mosque in 789. In 811, distant remnants of the Umayyad dynasty staged a strong uprising in Damascus that was eventually put down.<ref name="Burns132">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=130–132}}</ref>

[[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], a dissenting Turkish governor appointed by the Abbasids, conquered Syria, including Damascus, from his overlords in 878-79. In an act of respect for the previous Umayyad rulers, he erected a shrine on the site of Mu'awiya's grave in the city. [[Tulunid]] rule of Damascus was brief, lasting only until 906 before being replaced by the [[Qarmatians]] who were adherents of [[Shia Islam]]. Due to their inability to control the vast amount of land they occupied, the Qarmatians withdrew from Damascus and a new dynasty, the [[Ikhshidid]]s, took control of the city. They maintained the independence of Damascus from the Arab [[Hamdanid]] dynasty of [[Aleppo]] and the [[Baghdad]]-based Abbasids until 967. A period of instability in the city followed, with a Qarmatian raid in 968, a Byzantine raid in 970, and increasing pressures from the [[Fatimid]]s in the south and the Hamdanids in the north.<ref name="Burns135">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=135–136}}</ref>

The Shia Fatimids gained control in 970, inflaming hostilities between them and the Sunni Arabs of the city who frequently revolted. A Turk, [[Alptakin]] drove out the Fatimids five years later, and through diplomacy, prevented the Byzantines from attempting to annex the city. However, by 977, the Fatimids under Caliph [[al-Aziz]], wrested back control of the city and tamed Sunni dissidents. The Arab geographer, [[al-Muqaddasi]], visited Damascus in 985, remarking that the architecture and infrastructure of the city was "magnificent", but living conditions were awful. Under al-Aziz, the city saw a brief period of stability that ended with the reign of [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] (996–1021). In 998, Hundreds of Damascene leaders were rounded up and executed by him for incitement. Three years after al-Hakim's mysterious disappearance, the Arab tribes of southern Syria formed an alliance to stage a massive rebellion against the Fatimids, but they were crushed by the Fatimid Turkish governor of Syria and Palestine, [[Anushtakin|Anushtakin al-Duzbari]], in 1029. This victory gave the latter mastery over Syria, displeasing his Fatimid overlords, but gaining the admiration of Damascus' citizens. He was exiled by Fatimid authorities to [[Aleppo]] where he died in 1041.<ref name="Burns138">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=137–138}}</ref> From that date to 1063, there are no known records of the city's history. By then, Damascus lacked a city administration, had an enfeebled economy, and a greatly reduced population.<ref name="Burns139">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=139}}</ref>

===Seljuq and Ayyubid rule===
[[File:Damascus domes.jpg|thumb|The dome of the mausoleum of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]]]]
With the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]] in the late 11th century, Damascus again became the capital of independent states. It was ruled by [[Tutush I|Abu Sa'id Taj ad-Dawla Tutush I]] starting in 1079 and he was succeeded by his son [[Duqaq|Abu Nasr Duqaq]] in 1095. The Seljuqs established a court in Damascus and a systematic reversal of Shia inroads in the city. The city also saw an expansion of religious life through private endowments financing religious institutions (''[[madrasa]]s'') and hospitals (''maristans''). Damascus soon became one of the most important centers of propagating Islamic thought in the Muslim world. After Duqaq's death in 1104, his mentor (''[[atabeg]]''), [[Toghtekin]], took control of Damascus and the [[Burid Dynasty|Burid line]] of the Seljuq dynasty. Under Duqaq and Toghtekin, Damascus experienced stability, elevated status and a revived role in commerce. In addition, the city's Sunni majority enjoyed being a part of the larger Sunni framework effectively governed by various Turkic dynasties who in turn were under the [[moral authority]] of the Baghdad-based Abbasids.<ref name="Burns142">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=142}}</ref>

While the rulers of Damascus were preoccupied in conflict with their fellow Seljuqs in Aleppo and [[Diyarbakir]], the Crusaders, who arrived in the [[Levant]] in 1097, conquered [[Jerusalem]], [[Mount Lebanon]] and Palestine. Duqaq seemed to have been content with Crusader rule as a buffer between his dominion and the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. Toghtekin, however, saw the Western invaders as a viable threat to Damascus which, at the time, nominally included [[Homs]], the Beqaa Valley, Hauran, and the Golan Heights a part of its territories. With military support from Sharaf al-Din [[Mawdud]] of [[Mosul]], Toghtekin managed to halt Crusader raids in the Golan and Hauran. Mawdud was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque in 1109, depriving Damascus of northern Muslim backing and forcing Toghtekin to agree to a truce with the Crusaders in 1110.<ref name="Burns147">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=147}}</ref>

Following Tughtakin's death in 1128, his son, Taj al-Din Buri, became the nominal ruler of Damascus. Coincidentally, the Seljuq prince of [[Mosul]], [[Zengi|Imad al-Din Zengi]], took power in Aleppo and gained a mandate from the Abbasids to extend his authority to Damascus. In 1129, around 6,000 [[Isma'ili|Isma'ili Muslims]] were killed in the city along with their leaders. The Sunnis were provoked by rumors alleging there was a plot by the Isma'ilis, who controlled the strategic fort at [[Banias]], to aid the Crusaders in capturing Damascus in return for control of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Soon after the massacre, the Crusaders aimed to take advantage of the unstable situation and launch an assault against Damascus with nearly 60,000 troops. However, Buri allied with Zengi and managed to prevent their army from reaching the city.<ref name="Burns148-9">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=148–149}}</ref> Buri was assassinated by Isma'ili agents in 1132; he was succeeded by his son, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il who ruled tyrannically until he himself was murdered in 1135 on secret orders from his mother, Safwat al-Mulk Zumurrud; Isma'il's brother, Shihab al-Din Mahmud, replaced him. Meanwhile, Zengi, intent on putting Damascus under his control, married Safwat al-Mulk in 1138. Mahmud's reign then ended in 1139 after he was killed for relatively unknown reasons by members of his family. [[Mu'in al-Din Unur]], his ''[[mamluk]]'' ("slave soldier") took effective power of the city, prompting Zengi—with Safwat al-Mulk's backing—to lay siege against Damascus the same year. In response, Damascus allied with the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to resist Zengi's forces. Consequently, Zengi withdrew his army and focused on campaigns against northern Syria.<ref name="Burns151">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=151}}</ref>

In 1144 Zengi [[Siege of Edessa|conquered Edessa]], a crusader stronghold, which led to [[Second Crusade|a new crusade]] from Europe in 1148. In the meantime Zengi was assassinated and his territory was divided among his sons, one of whom, [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], emir of Aleppo, made an alliance with Damascus. When the European crusaders arrived, they and the nobles of Jerusalem agreed to attack Damascus. [[Siege of Damascus (1148)|Their siege]], however, was a complete failure. When the city seemed to be on the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls, and were driven back. By 1154, Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last= Phillips|title=The Second Crusade: Extending the Frontiers of Christendom |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year= 2007|pages= 216–227}}</ref>

In 1164, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|King Amalric]] of Jerusalem [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|invaded Fatimid Egypt]], which requested help from Nur ad-Din. The Nur ad-Din sent his general [[Shirkuh]], and in 1166 Amalric was defeated at the [[Battle of al-Babein]]. When Shirkuh died in 1169, he was succeeded by his nephew Yusuf, better known as [[Saladin]], who defeated a joint crusader-Byzantine siege of [[Damietta]].<ref>Hans E. Mayer, ''The Crusades'' (Oxford University Press, 1965, trans. John Gillingham, 1972), pp. 118–120.</ref> Saladin eventually overthrew the Fatimid caliphs and established himself as Sultan of Egypt. He also began to assert his independence from Nur ad-Din, and with the death of both Amalric and Nur ad-Din in 1174, he was well-placed to begin exerting control over Damascus and Nur ad-Din's other Syrian possessions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Christopher |last=Tyerman|title=God's War: A New History of the Crusades|publisher=Penguin|year=2006|page=350}}</ref> In 1177 Saladin was defeated by the crusaders at the [[Battle of Montgisard]], despite his numerical superiority.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bernard|last= Hamilton|title=The Leper King and his Heirs: Baldwin IV and the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2000|pages=132–136}}</ref> Saladin also [[siege of Kerak|besieged Kerak]] in 1183, but was forced to withdraw. He finally launched a full invasion of Jerusalem in 1187, and annihilated the crusader army at the [[Battle of Hattin]] in July. [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] fell to Saladin soon after, and Jerusalem itself [[siege of Jerusalem (1187)|was captured]] in October. These events shocked Europe, resulting in the [[Third Crusade]] in 1189, led by [[Richard I of England]], [[Philip II of France]] and [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]], though the last drowned en route.<ref>"The Third Crusade: Richard the Lionhearted and Philip Augustus", in ''A History of the Crusades'', vol. II: The Later Crusades, 1189–1311, ed. R. L. Wolff and H. W. Hazard (Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 1969), pp. 45–49.</ref>

The surviving crusaders, joined by new arrivals from Europe, put Acre to a [[Siege of Acre (1189–1191)|lengthy siege]] which lasted until 1191. After re-capturing Acre, Richard defeated Saladin at the [[Battle of Arsuf]] in 1191 and the [[Battle of Jaffa (1192)|Battle of Jaffa]] in 1192, recovering most of the coast for the Christians, but could not recover Jerusalem or any of the inland territory of the kingdom. The crusade came to an end peacefully, with the [[Treaty of Ramla]] in 1192. Saladin allowed pilgrimages to be made to Jerusalem, allowing the crusaders to fulfill their vows, after which they all returned home. The native crusader barons set about rebuilding their kingdom from Acre and the other coastal cities.<ref>Wolff and Hazard, pp. 67–85.</ref>

Saladin died in 1193, and there were frequent conflicts between different [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid sultans]] ruling in Damascus and Cairo. Damascus was the capital of independent Ayyubid rulers between 1193 and 1201, from 1218 to 1238, from 1239 to 1245, and from 1250 to 1260. At other times it was ruled by the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt. The patterned Byzantine and Chinese silks available through Damascus, one of the Western termini of the [[Silk Road]], gave the English language "damask".

===Mamluk period===
Ayyubid rule (and independence) came to an end with the Mongol invasion of Syria in 1260, and following the Mongol defeat at [[Battle of Ain Jalut|Ain Jalut]] in the same year, Damascus became a provincial capital of the [[Mamelukes|Mamluk Empire]], ruled from Egypt, following the Mongol withdrawal. The [[Black Death]] of 1348–1349 killed as much as half of the city's population.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/150420/Damascus/25659/Islamic-city Islamic city]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''</ref>

In 1400 [[Timur]], the [[Turco-Mongol]] conqueror, besieged Damascus. The Mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from Cairo, including [[Ibn Khaldun]], who negotiated with him, but after their withdrawal he put the city to sack. The [[Umayyad Mosque]] was burnt and men and women taken into slavery. A huge number of the city's artisans were taken to Timur's capital at [[Samarkand]]. These were the luckier citizens: many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the north-east corner of the walls, where a city square still bears the name ''burj al-ru'us'', originally "the tower of heads".

Rebuilt, Damascus continued to serve as a Mamluk provincial capital until 1516.

===Ottoman rule===

[[File:Takiyya as-Süleimaniyya Mosque 02.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tekkiye Mosque]]]]
[[File:Al-Hamidiyah Souq 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Al-Hamidiyah Souq]]]]
In early 1516, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], wary of the danger of an alliance between the Mamluks and the Persian [[Safavids]], started a campaign of conquest against the Mamluk sultanate. On 21 September, the Mamluk governor of Damascus fled the city, and on 2 October the [[khutba]] in the Umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of [[Selim I]]. The day after, the victorious sultan entered the city, staying for three months. On 15 December, he left Damascus by Bab al-Jabiya, intent on the conquest of Egypt. Little appeared to have changed in the city: one army had simply replaced another. However, on his return in October 1517, the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque, [[Khanqah|tekkiye]] and mausoleum at the shrine of Shaikh [[Ibn Arabi|Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi]] in [[al-Salihiyah]]. This was to be the first of Damascus' great Ottoman monuments.

The Ottomans remained for the next 400 years, except for a brief occupation by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] from 1832 to 1840. Because of its importance as the point of departure for one of the two great [[Hajj]] caravans to [[Mecca]], Damascus was treated with more attention by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] than its size might have warranted—for most of this period, [[Aleppo]] was more populous and commercially more important. In 1560 the [[Tekkiye Mosque|Tekkiye al-Sulaimaniyah]], a mosque and [[caravanserai|khan]] for pilgrims on the road to Mecca, was completed to a design by the famous Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]], and soon afterwards a [[Al-Salimiyah Madrasa|madrasa]] was built adjoining it.

Under [[Ottoman rule]], Christians and [[Jews]] were considered [[dhimmi]]s and were allowed to practice their religious precepts. The [[Damascus affair]] that took place in 1840 was an incident in which the accusation of [[ritual murder]] was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. In addition the [[1860 Druze-Christian conflict in Lebanon|massacre of Christians in 1860]] was also one of the most notorious incidents of these centuries, when fighting between [[Druze]] and [[Maronites]] in [[Mount Lebanon]] spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the citadel. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including a number of churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory [[Midan]] district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbours.

Miller records that in 1867 the population of the city was 'about' 140,000, of whom 30,000 were Christians, 10,000 Jews and 100,000 'Mohammedans' with fewer than 100 Protestant Christians.<ref>Ellen Clare Miller, 'Eastern Sketches – notes of scenery, schools and tent life in Syria and Palestine'.

In the early years of the 20th century, nationalist sentiment in Damascus, initially cultural in its interest, began to take a political colouring, largely in reaction to the [[turkicisation]] programme of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] government established in Istanbul in 1908. The hanging of a number of patriotic intellectuals by [[Jamal Pasha]], governor of Damascus, in Beirut and Damascus in 1915 and 1916 further stoked nationalist feeling, and in 1918, as the forces of the [[Arab Revolt]] and the British Imperial forces approached, residents fired on the retreating Turkish troops.

On 1 October 1918, [[T. E. Lawrence]] entered Damascus, the third arrival of the day, the first being the Australian [[3rd Light Horse Brigade]], led by Major A.C.N. 'Harry' Olden.<ref>Barker, A. (1998) "The Allies Enter Damascus", ''History Today'', Volume 48</ref> Two days later, 3 October 1918, the forces of the Arab revolt led by [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faysal]] also entered Damascus.<ref>Roberts, P.M., ''World War I, a Student Encyclopedia'', 2006, ABC-CLIO, p.657</ref> A military government under [[Shukri Pasha]] was named and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal ibn Hussein]] was proclaimed king of Syria. Political tension rose in November 1917, when the new [[Bolshevik]] government in Russia revealed the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] whereby Britain and France had arranged to partition the Arab east between them. A new Franco-British proclamation on 17 November promised the "complete and definitive freeing of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks." The [[Syrian National Congress]] in March adopted a democratic constitution. However, the [[Versailles Conference]] had granted France a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] over Syria, and in 1920 a French army commanded by the General [[Mariano Goybet]] crossed the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, defeated a small Syrian defensive expedition at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] and entered Damascus. The French made Damascus capital of their [[League of Nations]] [[French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon|Mandate for Syria]].

When in 1925 the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] in the [[Hauran]] spread to Damascus, the French suppressed with heavy weaponry, bombing and shelling the city on 9 May 1926. As a result, the area of the old city between [[Al-Hamidiyah Souq]] and [[Medhat Pasha Souq]] was burned to the ground, with many deaths, and has since then been known as ''[[al-Hariqa]]'' ("the fire"). The old city was surrounded with barbed wire to prevent rebels infiltrating from the [[Ghouta]], and a new road was built outside the northern ramparts to facilitate the movement of armored cars.

On 21 June 1941, 3 weeks into the Allied [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]], [[Battle of Damascus (1941)|Damascus was captured]] from the [[Vichy French]] forces by a mixed British Indian and Free French force. The French agreed to withdraw in 1946, thus leading to the full independence of Syria. Damascus remained the capital.

==Demographics==
[[File:Damascusfashion.jpg|thumb|upright|Three Damascene women; lady wearing qabqabs, a [[Druze]], and a [[peasant]], 1873]]
The estimated population of Damascus in 2011 was 1,711,000. Damascus is the centre of an over-crowded metropolitan area with an estimated population of 5 million. The metropolitan area of Damascus includes the cities of [[Douma, Syria|Douma]], [[Harasta]], [[Darayya]], [[Al-Tall (Syria)|Al-Tall]] and [[Jaramana]].

The majority of the population in Damascus came as a result of [[Urbanization|rural-urban migration]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Ethnicity===
The vast majority of Damascenes are [[Arabs]]. The [[Kurds in Syria|Kurds]] are the largest ethnic minority, with a population of approximately 300,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Displacement and Dispossession in the Modern Middle East|last = Chatty|first = Dawn|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0521521048|location = |pages = 267|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8OsgAwAAQBAJ}}</ref> They reside primarily in the neighborhoods of Wadi al-Mashari ("Zorava" or "Zore Afa" in Kurdish) and [[Rukneddine|Rukn al-Din]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/17762|title=Kurds of Damascus: Trapped Between Secession and Integration}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/05042013|title=As Fighting Rages in Damascus, Kurds Flee Their Neighborhoods}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[Islam]] is the dominant religion. The majority of Muslims are [[Sunni]], while [[Alawites]] and [[Twelver Shi'a]] comprise sizeable minorities. Alawites live primarily in the [[Mezzeh]] districts of Mezzeh 86 and Sumariyah. Twelvers primarily live near the Shia holy sites of [[Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque|Sayyidah Ruqayya]] and [[Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque|Sayyidah Zaynab]]. It is believed that there are more than 200 mosques in Damascus, the most well-known being the [[Umayyad Mosque]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Flood|first=Finbarr Barry|title=The Great Mosque of Damascus: studies on the makings of an Umayyad visual culture|publisher=BRILL|year=2001|volume=33|page=12|isbn=978-90-04-11638-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=r5f8kxIyykQC&printsec=frontcover&q=|accessdate=26 November 2009|ref=harv}}</ref> Christians represent about 15%-20% of the population.{{citation-needed|date=May 2016}} Several Eastern Christian rites
have their headquarters in Damascus. The Christian districts in the city are [[Bab Tuma]], [[Qassaa]] and Ghassani. Each have many churches, most notably the ancient [[Chapel of Saint Paul]]. At the suburb [[Our Lady of Soufanieh|Soufanieh]] a series of [[apparitions of the Virgin Mary]] have reportedly been observed between 1982 and 2004.<ref>Sbalchiero in: Laurentin/ Sbalchiero (2007), p. 1093-1097.</ref> A smaller [[Druze]] minority inhabits the city, notably in the mixed Christian-Druze suburbs of [[Tadamon, Syria|Tadamon]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/01/alawites-syria-siege-sunni-druze.html|title=Syria’s Alawites Under Siege}}</ref> [[Jaramana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://syriadirect.org/news/jaramana-despite-pressures-druze-remain-in-regime-camp|title=Despite pressure Druze remain in regime camp}}</ref> and [[Sahnaya]].

There was a small [[Syrian Jews|Jewish community]] namely in what is called ''Haret al-Yahud'' the Jewish quarter. They are the remnants of an ancient and much larger [[Syrian Jews|Jewish presence in Syria]], dating back at least to Roman times, if not before to the time of King David.<ref>Katz, Ketsi'ah (1981), Masoret ha-lashon ha-'Ibrit shel Yehude Aram-Tsoba (Ḥalab) bi-qri'at ha-Miqra ve-ha-Mishnah (The Hebrew Language Tradition of the Jews of Aleppo in the Reading of the Bible and Mishnah)</ref>

====Sufism====
Sufism throughout the second half of the 20th century has been an influential current in the Sunni religious practises, particularly in Damascus. The largest women-only and girls-only Muslim movement in the world happens to be [[Sufi]]-oriented and is based in Damascus, led by [[Munira al-Qubaysi]]. Syrian Sufism has its stronghold in urban regions such as Damascus, where it also established political movements such as Zayd, with the help of a series of [[mosque]]s, and clergy such as [[Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi]], [[Sa'id Hawwa]], [[Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri]] and [[Muhammad al-Yaqoubi]].<ref>http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/10/syria-sufi-salafi-war-islam.html#</ref>

==Historical sites==
[[File:Damascus square1.jpg|thumb|A square in old Damascus]]
[[File:Damasco via rectaHPIM3222.JPG|thumb|left|Typical ancient Damascene street]]
Damascus has a wealth of historical sites dating back to many different periods of the city's history. Since the city has been built up with every passing occupation, it has become almost impossible to excavate all the ruins of Damascus that lie up to {{convert|8|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} below the modern level. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The [[Citadel of Damascus]] is located in the northwest corner of the Old City. The ''[[Damascus Straight Street]]'' (referred to in the [[Conversion of Saint Paul|conversion]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9:11), also known as the ''[[Via Recta]]'', was the [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]] (East-West main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}}. Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The [[Bab Sharqi]] street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of [[Bab Tuma]] (St. Thomas's Gate). [[Medhat Pasha Souq]] is also a main market in Damascus and was named after [[Midhat Pasha]], the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the [[House of Saint Ananias|House of Ananias]], an underground chapel that was the cellar of [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]]'s house. The [[Umayyad Mosque]], also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of [[St. John the Baptist]]. The [[Mausoleum of Saladin|mausoleum]] where [[Saladin]] was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. [[Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque]], the shrine of the youngest daughter of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of [[Amara District|Amara]] is also within a walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is [[Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque]], where the tomb of [[Zaynab bint Ali]] is located.

Shias, Fatemids and Dawoodi Bohras believe that after the battle of Karbala (680 AD), in Iraq, the Umayyad caliph Yezid brought Imam Husain's head to Damascus, where it was first kept in the courtyard of Yezid Mahal, now part of Umayyad Mosque complex. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} All other remaining members of Imam Husain's family (left alive after Karbala) along with heads of all other companions, who were killed at Karbala, were also brought to Damascus. These members were kept as prisoners on the outskirts of the city (near [[Bab al-Saghir]]), where the other heads were kept at the same location, now called "Raous-us-sohda-e-karbala", visited by all Shias. There is a qibla (place of worship) marked at the place, where [[Ali ibn Husayn|Imam Ali-Zain-ul-Abedin]] used to pray while in captivity.

===Walls and gates of Damascus===
[[File:Bab Touma Gate Damascus.jpg|thumb|[[Bab Tuma]] gate]]
The Old City of Damascus with an approximate area of 128 hectares<ref>{{cite web|author=InterNoetics |url=http://www.damascus.org.sy/?d=259&id=555 |title=Old Damascus |publisher=Damascus.org.sy |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref> is surrounded by ramparts on the northern and eastern sides and part of the southern side. There are seven extant city gates, the oldest of which dates back to the Roman period. These are, clockwise from the north of the citadel:
* [[Bab al-Faradis]] ("the gate of the orchards", or "of the paradise")
* [[Bab al-Salam]] ("the gate of peace"), all on the north boundary of the Old City
* [[Bab Tuma]] ("Touma" or "Thomas's Gate") in the north-east corner, leading into the Christian quarter of the same name,
* [[Bab Sharqi]] ("eastern gate") in the east wall, the only one to retain its Roman plan
* [[Bab Kisan]] in the south-east, from which tradition holds that Saint Paul made his escape from Damascus, lowered from the ramparts in a basket; this gate has been closed and turned into [[Chapel of Saint Paul]] marking this event,
* [[Bab al-Saghir]] (The Small Gate)
* [[Bab al-Jabiya]] at the entrance to Souk Midhat Pasha, in the south-west.

Other areas outside the walled city also bear the name "gate": [[Bab al-Faraj (Damascus)|Bab al-Faraj]], [[Bab Mousalla]] and [[Bab Sreija]], both to the south-west of the walled city.

===Threats to the future of the old City===
[[File:Damascusalley.JPG|upright|thumb|Narrow alley in old Damascus]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Due to the rapid decline of the population of Old Damascus (between 1995–2005 more than 20,000 people moved out of the old city for more modern accommodation){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, a growing number of buildings are being abandoned or are falling into disrepair. In March 2007, the local government announced that it would be demolishing Old City buildings along a {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}} stretch of rampart walls as part of a redevelopment scheme. These factors resulted in the Old City being placed by the [[World Monuments Fund]] on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. It is hoped that its inclusion on the list will draw more public awareness to these significant threats to the future of the historic Old City of Damascus.

====Current state of old Damascus====

==Education==
[[File:Damascus university internal view.jpg|thumb|[[Damascus University]]]]
Damascus is the main center of education in Syria. It is home to [[Damascus University]], which is the oldest and largest university in Syria. After the enactment of legislation allowing private higher institutions, several new universities were established in the city and in the surrounding area, including:
* [[Syrian Virtual University]]
* [[International University for Science and Technology]]
* [[Syrian Private University]]
* [[Arab International University]]
* [[University of Kalamoon]]
* [[Yarmouk Private University]]
* [[Wadi International University]]
The institutes play an important rule in the education, including:
* Higher Institute of Business Administration
* [[Higher Institute for Applied Science and Technology]]
* National Institute of Administration

==Transportation==
[[File:Damascus-Hejaz station.jpg|thumb|Al-Hejaz Station]]
[[File:Traffic at Damascus streets.jpg|left|thumb|Traffic in Damascus in 2008]]
The main airport is [[Damascus International Airport]], approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the city, with connections to a few Middle Eastern cities. Before the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the Airport had connectivity to many Asian, European, African, and, South American cities.
Streets in Damascus are often narrow, especially in the older parts of the city, and speed bumps are widely used to limit the speed of vehicles.

Public transport in Damascus depends extensively on [[minibuses]]. There are about one hundred lines that operate inside the city and some of them extend from the city center to nearby suburbs. There is no schedule for the lines, and due to the limited number of official bus stops, buses will usually stop wherever a passenger needs to get on or off. The number of buses serving the same line is relatively high, which minimizes the waiting time. Lines are not numbered, rather they are given captions mostly indicating the two end points and possibly an important station along the line and [[Taxicab]].

Served by [[Chemins de Fer Syriens]], the former main railway station of Damascus was [[Hejaz Railway|al-Hejaz railway station]], about {{convert|1|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} west of the old city. The station is now defunct and the tracks have been removed, but there still is a ticket counter and a shuttle to Damacus Kadam station in the south of the city, which now functions as the main railway station.

In 2008, the government announced a plan to construct a [[Damascus Metro]] with opening time for the green line scheduled for 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damascus-metro.com |title=الخط الأخضر " أهلاً بكم في موقع الخط الأخضر |publisher=Damascus-metro.com |accessdate=29 May 2009|ref=harv}}</ref> The green line will be an essential West-East axis for the future public transportation network, serving Moadamiyeh, Sumariyeh, Mezzeh, Damascus University, Hijaz, the Old City, Abbassiyeen and Qaboun Pullman bus station. A four-line metro network is expected be in operation by 2050.

Popular sports include [[association football|football]], basketball, swimming, tennis, table tennis, [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] and [[chess]]. Damascus is home to many football clubs that participate in the [[Syrian Premier League]] including [[Al-Jaish SC Damascus|Al-Jaish]], [[Al-Shurta SC Damascus|Al-Shurta]], [[Al-Wahda SC Damascus|Al-Wahda]] and [[Al-Majd Damascus|Al-Majd]]. Many Other sport clubs are located in several districts of the city: [[Barada SC]], [[Qasioun SC]], [[Nidal SC]], [[Al-Muhafaza]], [[Al-Fayhaa SC]], [[Al-Thawra SC]], [[Dummar SC]] and [[Al-Arin SC]].

The [[1976 Pan Arab Games|fifth]] and the [[1992 Pan Arab Games|seventh]] [[Pan Arab Games]] were held in Damascus in 1976 and 1992 respectively.

Damascus has quite busy midnights. Coffeehouses, where —in addition to [[Arabic coffee]] and tea— [[nargileh]] (water pipes) are served, proliferate Damascus. [[Card game]]s, [[Tables (board game)|tables]] ([[backgammon]] variants), and [[chess]] are activities frequented in cafés.<ref>Beatties and Pepper, 2001, p. 102.</ref>

Tishreen Park is one of the largest and popular parks in Damascus. It is home to the annual Damascus Flower Show. Other parks include: al-Jahiz, al-Sibbki, al-Tijara, al-Wahda, etc. Damascus' [[Ghouta]] (Oasis) is also a popular weekend-destination for recreation. Many recreation centres operate in the city including sport clubs, swimming pools and golf courses. The Syrian Arab Horse Association in Damascus offers a wide range of activities and services for horse breeders and riders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saha-sy.org/ |title=Syrian Arab Horse Association |publisher=Saha-sy.org |accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>
