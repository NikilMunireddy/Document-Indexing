'''Davao City''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Dabaw}}, {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Dabaw}}, [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Kota Davao'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Ciudad de Dávao'') is a city on [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]]. As of the {{#invoke:Wikidata|getQualifierDateValue|P1082|P585|FETCH_WIKIDATA|y}} census, it had a population of {{#property:P1082}} people, making it the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by population|fourth-most-populous city in the Philippines]] and the most populous in Mindanao.<ref name=NSO10/> It is the center of [[Metro Davao]], the third most populous metropolitan area in the Philippines (as of 2010 census with a population of 2.26 million, after [[Metro Manila]]'s 11.86 million and [[Metro Cebu]]'s 2.55 million). With a total land area of 2,444 square kilometers,<ref name=nscb/> the city is the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by area|largest in the country in terms of land area]]. The city serves as the main trade, commerce, and industry hub of [[Mindanao]] and the regional center of [[Davao Region]]. Davao is home to [[Mount Apo]], the highest mountain in the Philippines. Davao is also known as the "Durian Capital" of the Philippines.

For geographical and statistical purposes, Davao City is grouped with the province of [[Davao del Sur]] but is governed independently from it. The city is divided into three congressional districts, which are subdivided into 11 administrative districts with a total of 182 [[barangay]]s.

Davao City is constantly described by its residents and the national media as arguably among one of the safest cities in the Philippines, however this has been met with criticism, especially by [[Imperial Manila|the people from Metro Manila]].<ref>[http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/10/12/Duterte-press-conference-October-12.html Duterte calls for press conference Monday afternoon - ''CNN Philippines''.]</ref><ref>[https://sg.news.yahoo.com/aerial-drones-eyed-davao-city-disaster-response-031244604.html Aerial drones eyed for Davao City disaster response - ''Yahoo!

==Etymology==
The region's name is derived from its [[Bagobo]] origins. The word ''davao'' came from the [[phonetic]] blending of three [[Lumad peoples|Bagobo]] subgroups' names for the [[Davao River]], a major waterway emptying into the [[Davao Gulf]] near the city. The [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] Obos, who inhabit the [[hinterlands]] of the region, called the river ''Davah'' (with a gentle vowel ending, although later pronunciation is with a hard ''v'' or ''b''); the Clatta (or Giangan/Diangan) called it ''Dawaw'', and the Tagabawas called it ''Dabo''. To the Obos, ''davah'' also means "a place beyond the high grounds" (alluding to settlements at the mouth of the river surrounded by high, rolling hills).

When asked where they were going, the usual reply was ''davah'' (pointing towards the town). ''Dawaw'' also refers to a trading settlement, where forest goods are bartered for salt and other commodities. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==History==

===Spanish Era===
Although Spaniards began to explore the Davao Gulf area as early as the 16th century, [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish influence]] was negligible in the Davao region until 1844, when the Spanish brigadier general Agustin Bocallan claimed the area in what is now Davao City for the Spanish Crown, despite opposition by the Sultan of [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Maguindanao]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Official colonization of the area, however, began in 1848 when an expedition of 70 men and women led by José Cruz de Oyanguren of [[Bergara|Vergara]], Spain, established a [[Christianity|Christian]] settlement in an area of mangrove swamps which is now Bolton Riverside. Davao was then ruled by a chieftain, Bago, who had a settlement on the banks of the Davao River (then called the Tagloc River by the Bagobos).

After Cruz de Oyanguren defeated Bago, he renamed the region ''Nueva [[Guipúzcoa]]'', founding the town of ''Nueva Vergara'' (the future Davao) on 29 June 1848<ref>Hon. Nunez, Camilo T.; Diansay, Dante P., ''Cateel Centennial Book 2003''</ref> to honor of his home in Spain and becoming its first [[governor]]. He was reported to have peacefully conquered the entire Davao Gulf region by year's end, despite a lack of support from the Spanish government in [[Manila]] and his allies. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

By Saturnino Urios, who labored among the [[Moro people|Moros]] of Hijo in 1892, divided the population {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}; those who wanted to live among the Christians left Hijo, and were resettled in Tigatto, Mawab and Agdao under the supervision of Francisco Bangoy and Teodoro Palma Gil. These groups generally refer to themselves today as Kalagans.

===American Period===
The development of large-scale plantations faced a labor shortage, and workers were contracted from [[Luzon]] and the [[Visayas]] (including Japanese laborers from the Baguio, Benguet road construction). Many Japanese became landowners, acquiring lands by government lease or buying American plantations. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[File:Davao Japantown in 1930s.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Man bicycling down street in old photo, with cars in background|Japan-town, Davao City (circa 1930s)]]

Because of increasing Japanese influence in the region's economy, on March 16, 1936, congressman Romualdo Quimpo from Davao filed Bill 609 (passed as Commonwealth Act 51), creating the City of Davao from the Town of Davao (Mayo) and Guianga District. The bill called for the appointment of local officials by the president.<ref>Davao, Reconstructing history from text to memory, Macario Tiu, author, Ateneo de Davao publisher 2005</ref>

Davao was inaugurated as a [[charter city]] on October 16, 1936 by President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. The City of Davao became provincial capital of a united [[Davao (province)|Davao Province]]. It was one of the first two towns in [[Mindanao]] to be converted into a city (the other was Zamboanga). By that time, the city's population was 68,000. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

====Second World War====
[[File:Davao Times December 8 1942.JPG|thumb|right|alt=front page old newspaper|Davao Times, December 8, 1942 under Japanese Occupation]]
{{Main|Battle of Mindanao|Battle of Davao}}
On December 8, 1941, Japanese planes bombed the harbor and from December 20, 1941 [[Japanese invasion of Davao|landed forces]] and began an occupation of the city which lasted to 1945. Davao was among the earliest to be occupied by Japanese forces, and the city was immediately fortified as a bastion of Japanese defense. 

The city was subjected to extensive bombing by forces led by [[Douglas MacArthur]] before American forces landed in [[Leyte]] in October 1944. The [[Battle of Mindanao|Battle of Davao]] towards the end of [[World War II]] was one of longest and bloodiest battles during the Philippine Liberation, and brought tremendous destruction to the city, setting back the economic and physical strides made before the Japanese occupation.

===Post-war period===
In 1967, the Province of Davao was divided into three provinces: [[Davao del Norte]], [[Davao Oriental]] and [[Davao del Sur]]. The city of Davao became part of Davao del Sur; no longer the provincial capital, it became a commercial center of southern Mindanao. Davao has become an ethnic melting pot {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}; it attracts migrants from throughout the Philippines, lured by prospects for prosperity in the country's second-largest city. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} During the 1970s, Davao became regional capital of southern Mindanao; with the reorganization, it became the regional capital of the [[Davao Region]] (Region XI) and  highly urbanized city in the province of Davao del Sur.

The city witnessed mayhem as it entered the early 1980s. It became a focal point for conflict between criminals, [[Communist Party of the Philippines|communist]] guerrillas and leftists. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The conflict inside the city became severe that murders in the streets were the norm at the time. It lasted until 1985, when the locals formed the vigilante group "Alsa Masa" (People's Rise) to drive out such elements from the city.<ref>[http://census.gov.ph/content/davao-city-population-expected-double-24-years-results-2000-census-population-and-housing Davao City: Population Expected to Double in 24 Years (Results from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing, NSO)]</ref>

Real social stability in the city, however, began in the earnest when [[Rodrigo Duterte]] first assumed office as the city mayor in 1988. The city was still considered that time as the country's murder capital.<ref name="time">Zabriskie, Phil: ''[http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501020701-265480,00.html The Punisher]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (Asia edition), June 24, 2002.</ref>

== Geography ==
Davao City is approximately {{convert|588|mi|km}} southeast of Manila over land, and {{convert|971|km|nmi}} by sea. The city is located in southeastern Mindanao, on the northwestern shore of [[Davao Gulf]], opposite [[Samal, Davao del Norte|Samal Island]].

=== Topography ===
[[File:Davao river mouth.JPG|thumb|upright|200px|Mouth of the [[Davao River]] in Talomo District]]
[[File:MountApo1.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Mount Apo]] is the tallest mountain in the Philippines.]]
Davao City's land, totaling about {{Convert|2,443.61|km2}},<ref name=nscb/> is hilly in the west (the Marilog district) and slopes down to the southeastern shore. [[Mount Apo]], the highest peak in the Philippines, is located at the city's southwestern tip. Mount Apo National Park (the mountain and its surrounding vicinity), was inaugurated by [[President of the Philippines|President]] Manuel Quezon (in Proclamation 59 of May 8, 1936) to protect the flora and fauna of the surrounding mountain range. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The [[Davao River]] is the city's primary drainage channel. Draining an area of over {{convert|1700|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the {{convert|160|km|mi|adj=on}} river begins in the town of [[San Fernando, Bukidnon]]. The mouth of the river is located at Barangay Bucana at Talomo District.

=== Climate ===
Davao has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Af''), with little seasonal variation in temperature. Average monthly temperatures are always above {{convert|26|C|1}}, and average monthly precipitation is above {{convert|77|mm|in|2}}. This gives the city a tropical climate, without a true [[dry season]]; while there is significant rainfall in winter, most precipitation occurs during the summer months (see climate chart, below).
