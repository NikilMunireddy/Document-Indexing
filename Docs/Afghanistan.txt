'''Afghanistan''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Afghanistan.ogg|æ|f|ˈ|ɡ|æ|n|ɨ|s|t|æ|n}} ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]/[[Dari language|Dari]]: {{nq|افغانستان}}, ''Afġānistān''), officially the '''Islamic Republic of Afghanistan''', is a [[landlocked country]] located within [[South Asia]] and [[Central Asia]].<ref name="Factbook" /><ref name="South Asia" /> It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the [[list of countries by population|42nd]] most populous country in the world. It is bordered by [[Pakistan]] in the south and east; [[Iran]] in the west; [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Tajikistan]] in the north; and [[China]] in the far northeast. Its territory covers {{convert|652,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, making it the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|41st largest]] country in the world.

Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] Era, and the country's [[Geostrategy|strategic]] location along the [[Silk Road]] connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. Through the ages the land has been home to various peoples and witnessed numerous military campaigns; notably by [[Alexander the Great]], [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Muslim Arabs]], [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|Mongols]], [[First Anglo-Afghan War|British]], [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet Russians]], and in the modern-era by [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Western powers]]. The land also served as the source from which the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]], [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]], [[Saffarid Empire|Saffarids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghorids]], [[Khilji dynasty|Khiljis]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], [[Hotak Empire|Hotaks]], [[Durrani dynasty|Durranis]], and others have risen to form major empires.<ref name="Galvin-PreIslamic">{{cite web |url=http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/PreIslamic.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011103002246/http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/PreIslamic.html |archivedate=3 November 2001|title=The Pre-Islamic Period |publisher=Illinois Institute of Technology |work=Afghanistan Country Study |first=Luke |last=Griffin |date=14 January 2002 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref>

The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century.  In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in the "[[The Great Game|Great Game]]" between [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919, [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]] unsuccessfully attempted to modernize the country. It remained peaceful during [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]]'s forty years of monarchy. A series of coups in the 1970s was followed by a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|series of civil wars]] that devastated much of Afghanistan. This was followed by the recent $100 billion nationwide rebuilding process.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article24783502.html |title=Pentagon can’t account for $1 billion in Afghan reconstruction aid |publisher=mcclatchydc.com |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Afghanistan}}
The name ''Afghānistān'' ([[Pashto]] |افغانستان) is believed to be as old as the [[ethnonym]] [[Afghan (ethnonym)|''Afghan'']], which is documented in the 10th-century [[geography]] book ''[[Hudud ul-'alam]]''. The [[root (linguistics)|root]] name "[[Afghan]]" was used [[history|historically]] in reference to a member of the ethnic [[Pashtuns]], and the [[suffix]] "[[-stan]]" means "place of" in [[Sanskrit]]. Therefore, Afghanistan translates to ''land of the Afghans'' or, more specifically in a historical sense, to ''land of the Pashtuns''. However, the modern [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] states that "[t]he word Afghan shall apply to every [[Demographics of Afghanistan|citizen of Afghanistan]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.embassyofafghanistan.org/page/constitution |year=2004 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Afghanistan}}
{{History of Afghanistan}}
[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] of prehistoric sites by [[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Dupree]] and others suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to [[Egypt]] in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites.<ref name="JFS">{{cite web |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwDUj6WJ |title=Afghanistan&nbsp;– John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726195140/http://www.webcitation.org/5kwDUj6WJ |archivedate=2013-07-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1881896-1,00.html |title=Afghanistan: A Treasure Trove for Archaeologists |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726153721/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1881896-1,00.html |archivedate=2013-07-26 }}</ref>

The country sits at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], and the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]].<ref>The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity by George Erdosy, p.321</ref>

Many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Khilji dynasty|Khiljis]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally the [[Hotak dynasty|Hotak]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state.<ref>The History of Afghanistan by Meredith L.

=== Pre-Islamic period ===
{{Main|Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan}}
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual ([[Koine Greek|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) [[Edicts of Ashoka|edict]] by Emperor [[Ashoka]] from the 3rd century BCE discovered in the southern city of [[Kandahar]]]]
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilisation today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. In more detail, it extended from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the [[Oxus River]] at [[Shortugai]] in northern Afghanistan.<ref name="The Ancient Indus pp.1">The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society. pp.1</ref><ref>Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998).

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] [[Indo-Iranians]]. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]].<ref name="JFS" /><ref>Bryant, Edwin F.

The religion [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]]. Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation |publisher=Gandhara.com.au |date=15 February 1989 |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021728/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |archivedate=2013-07-27 }}</ref>

[[Alexander the Great]] and his Macedonian forces arrived to Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. They were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.<ref name="LoC-pdf" /><ref>The History of Afghanistan by Meredith L. Runion, p.44</ref>

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region, but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]] who, in turn, were replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. By the 6th century CE, the successors to the Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty called [[Kabul Shahi]]. Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by Buddhist culture.<ref name="Habibi">{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm |title=Afghan and Afghanistan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref>

[[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s brought Islam to [[Herat]] and [[Zaranj]] in 642&nbsp;CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. The land was collectively recognized by the Arabs as al-Hind due to its cultural connection with [[Greater India]]. Before Islam was introduced, people of the region were mostly Buddhists and Zoroastrians, but there were also [[Surya]] and [[Nana (Afghan goddess)|Nana]] worshipers, [[History of the Jews in Afghanistan|Jews]], and others. The [[Zunbils]] and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870&nbsp;CE by the [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarid]] Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the [[Samanids]] extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still lived side by side in Kabul before the [[Ghaznavids]] rose to power in the 10th century.<ref name="Elliot-2">{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=80201012&ct=98 |title=A.—The Hindu Kings of Kábul |work=Sir H.

By the 11th century, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively [[Islamized]] the wider region, with the exception of [[Kafiristan]]. Afghanistan became one of the main centers in the [[Muslim world]] during this [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The Ghaznavid dynasty was overthrown by the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], who expanded and advanced the already powerful Islamic empire.

In 1219&nbsp;AD, [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army overran the region. His troops are said to have annihilated the Khorasanian cities of Herat and Balkh as well as [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |title=Central Asian world cities |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=6 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723185841/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |archivedate=2013-07-23 }}</ref> The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society.<ref>{{cite news |last=Page |first=Susan |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-02-17-afghanistan-forces_N.htm |title=Obama's war: Deploying 17,000 raises stakes in Afghanistan |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> Mongol rule continued with the [[Ilkhanate]] in the northwest while the [[Khilji dynasty]] administered the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of [[Timur]], who established the [[Timurid Empire]] in 1370.

In the early 16th century, [[Babur]] arrived from [[Fergana]] and captured Kabul from the [[Arghun dynasty]]. In 1526, he invaded [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] in India to replace the [[Lodi dynasty]] with the [[Mughal Empire]].

The Afghan Empire was under threat in the early 19th century by the [[Qajar dynasty|Persians]] in the west and the [[British Raj|British]]-backed [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]] in the east. Fateh Khan, leader of the [[Barakzai dynasty|Barakzai tribe]], had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. After his death, they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves.

The large defensive wall around the city was removed in the early 1930s by the order of [[Mohammed Nadir Shah|King Nadir]].]]
Following the [[1842 retreat from Kabul|1842 defeat of the British-Indian forces]] and victory of the Afghans, the British established [[foreign relations of Afghanistan|diplomatic relations]] with the Afghan government and withdrew all forces from the country. They returned during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] in the late 1870s for about two years to assist [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] defeat [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]]. The United Kingdom began to exercise a great deal of influence after this and even controlled the state's [[foreign policy]]. In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This was a standard [[divide and rule]] policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.
[[File:Zahir Shah of Afghanistan in 1930s-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], the last king of Afghanistan, who reigned from 1933 to 1973.]]
After the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] in 1919, King [[Amānullāh Khān|Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independence|independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [[slavery]] was abolished in 1923.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1976| volume = Volume 25| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Americana]]|publisher=Americana Corporation | page = 24 }}</ref>

Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]], a [[Hazara people|Hazara]] school student.

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet [[development aid]] than any other country. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]]. In the meantime, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan. Some experts suggest that Bhutto paved the way for the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]].<ref name="Bowersox">{{cite book

Among these young men were [[Ahmad Shah Massoud|Massoud]], [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], and other members of Jawanan-e Musulman. Massoud's mission to Bhutto was to create unrest in northern Afghanistan. It served Massoud's interests, which were apparently opposition to the Soviets and independence for Afghanistan. Later, after Massoud and Hekmatyar had a terrible falling-out over Massoud's opposition to terrorist tactics and methods, Massoud overthrew from Jawanan-e Musulman. He joined [[Burhanuddin Rabbani|Rabani]]'s newly created Afghan political party, [[Jamiat-e Islami|Jamiat-i-Islami]], in exile in Pakistan. |authorlink=|year=2004|publisher=GeoVision, Inc.,|location=United States|isbn=0-9747323-1-1|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVAN9pjnRzMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the [[Saur Revolution]]. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] waged by guerrilla [[mujahideen]] against government forces countrywide. The Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |title=Pakistan And The Emergence Of Islamic Militancy In Afghanistan |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2005 |pages=108–109 |isbn=978-0-7546-4434-7}}</ref> Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&nbsp;— the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]&nbsp;— resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup.

In September 1979, [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kalinovsky |first=Artemy M. |title=A Long Goodbye: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2011 |pages=25–28 |isbn=978-0-674-05866-8}}</ref> The PDPA prohibited [[usury]], declared equality of the sexes,<ref name=autogenerated4 /> and introduced women to political life.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0028) |title=Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] |accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref>

=== Civil war ===
{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–92)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–96)}}
From 1989 until 1992, Najibullah's government tried to solve the ongoing civil war with economic and military aid, but without Soviet troops on the ground. Najibullah tried to build support for his government by portraying his government as [[Islamism|Islamic]], and in the 1990 constitution the country officially became an [[Islamic state (government)|Islamic state]] and all references of communism were removed. Nevertheless, Najibullah did not win any significant support, and with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, he was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government, led to his ousting from power in April 1992. After the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992, the post-communist [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] was established by the [[Peshawar Accord]], a peace and power-sharing agreement under which all the Afghan parties were united in April 1992, except for the Pakistani supported [[Hezb-e Islami]] of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. Hekmatyar started a bombardment campaign against the capital city Kabul, which marked the beginning of a [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–96)|new phase in the war]].<ref>Afghanistan Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments by INB, p.73</ref>

Shortly after their fall from power, the Taliban began an [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]] to regain control of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and [[Afghan National Army|Afghan troops]] led many offensives against the Taliban but failed to fully defeat them. Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world due to a lack of foreign investment, [[Corruption in Afghanistan|government corruption]], and the Taliban insurgency.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/video?id=5484891&tab=9482931&section=8865284&page=1 |publisher=[[ABC News (US)|ABC News]] |accessdate=28 September 2010 |title=Pakistan Accused of Helping Taliban |date=31 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221050959/http://abcnews.go.com/Video/video?id=5484891&tab=9482931&section=8865284&page=1 |archivedate=2013-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7910687/Wikileaks-Pakistan-accused-of-helping-Taliban-in-Afghanistan-attacks.html |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=28 September 2010 |title=Wikileaks: Pakistan accused of helping Taliban in Afghanistan attacks |date=26 July 2010 |location=London |first1=Rob |last1=Crilly |first2=Alex |last2=Spillius|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129073942/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7910687/Wikileaks-Pakistan-accused-of-helping-Taliban-in-Afghanistan-attacks.html |archivedate=2014-01-29 }}</ref>

Meanwhile, the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] was able to build some democratic structures, and the country changed its name to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture.

In the decade following 2002, over five million [[Afghan diaspora|Afghans]] were [[repatriation|repatriated]], including some who were forcefully [[deportation|deported]] from Western countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Germany begins deportations of Afghan refugees |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/jun2005/afgh-j25.shtml |publisher=wsws.org |date=25 June 2005 |accessdate=2 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222758/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/jun2005/afgh-j25.shtml |archivedate=2012-10-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Living in Fear of Deportation |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1862149,00.html |publisher=DW-World.De |date=22 January 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129193952/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1862149,00.html |archivedate=2012-01-29 }}</ref>

Afghanistan is a multiethnic society, and its historical status as a crossroads has contributed significantly to its diverse ethnic makeup. The population of the country is divided into a wide variety of [[ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the nation in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are unavailable.

The [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 Afghan presidential election]] was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout, and widespread electoral fraud.<ref name="Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped">{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Helene |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&hp |title=Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511225923/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&hp |archivedate=2011-05-11 }}</ref> The vote, along with elections for 420 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provincial council]] seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.

Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger [[Abdullah Abdullah|Abdullah]] was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he would not participate in the 7 November run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met. The next day, officials of the election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President for another five-year term.<ref name="Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped" />

In the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], among the elected officials were former mujahideen, [[Islamic fundamentalists]], warlords, communists, [[reformists]], and several Taliban associates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/rawagallery.php?mghash=dc96d38caecd6694eb17fc894bb73212&mggal=2 |title=RAWA Photo Gallery: They are Responsible for Afghanistan's Tragedy |publisher=RAWA |accessdate=11 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019075455/http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/rawagallery.php?mghash=dc96d38caecd6694eb17fc894bb73212&mggal=2 |archivedate=19 October 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no}}</ref> In the same period, Afghanistan reached to the 30th highest nation in terms of female representation in parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification |publisher=Ipu.org |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=29 December 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328105108/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |archivedate=2014-03-28 }}</ref> The last [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary election]] was held in September 2010, but due to disputes and investigation of fraud, the swearing-in ceremony took place in late January 2011.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Provinces of Afghanistan|Districts of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (''[[wilayah|wilayats]]''), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about 398 smaller provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The [[list of current governors of Afghanistan|provincial governors]] are appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]] and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&cnid=24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827204439/http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&cnid=24 |archivedate=27 August 2010 |title=Explaining Elections, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan |publisher=Iec.org.af |date=9 October 2004 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref> The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. In the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

The following is a list of all the 34 provinces in alphabetical order:

The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] is in charge of maintaining the [[foreign relations of Afghanistan]]. The state has been a member of the United Nations since 1946. It enjoys strong economic relations with a number of [[NATO]] and allied states, particularly the [[Afghanistan–United States relations|United States]], [[Afghanistan–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], [[Afghanistan–Germany relations|Germany]] and [[Afghanistan–Turkey relations|Turkey]]. In 2012, the United States designated Afghanistan as a [[major non-NATO ally]] and created the [[U.S.–Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement]]. Afghanistan also has friendly diplomatic relations with neighboring [[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations|Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan–Iran relations|Iran]], [[Foreign relations of Turkmenistan#Afghanistan|Turkmenistan]], [[Foreign relations of Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], [[Afghanistan–Tajikistan relations|Tajikistan]], and [[Afghanistan–China relations|China]], and with regional states such as [[Afghanistan–India relations|India]], [[Afghanistan–Bangladesh relations|Bangladesh]], [[Foreign relations of Nepal|Nepal]], [[Foreign relations of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Afghanistan–Russia relations|Russia]], the [[Afghanistan–United Arab Emirates relations|UAE]], Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, [[Afghanistan–Japan relations|Japan]], and [[Afghanistan–South Korea relations|South Korea]]. It continues to develop diplomatic relations with other countries around the world.

[[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) was established in 2002 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1401]] in order to help the country recover from decades of war. Today, a number of NATO member states deploy about 38,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/mounting-death-toll-afghan-troops-us-general-200602525.html|title=Mounting death toll for Afghan troops: US general|date=5 November 2014|work=Yahoo News}}</ref> Its main purpose is to [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan|train]] the [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF). The [[Afghan Armed Forces]] are under the [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]], which includes the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA) and the [[Afghan Air Force]] (AAF). The ANA is divided into 7 major [[Corps]], with the [[201st Corps (Afghanistan)|201st Selab ("Flood")]] in Kabul followed by the 203rd in Gardez, [[205th Corps|205th Atul ("Hero")]] in Kandahar, 207th in [[Herat]], 209th in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], and the 215th in [[Lashkar Gah]]. The ANA also has a [[ANA Commando Brigade|commando brigade]], which was established in 2007. The [[Afghan Defense University]] (ADU) houses various educational establishments for the Afghan Armed Forces, including the [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Law enforcement ===
{{Main|Crime in Afghanistan|Law enforcement in Afghanistan|Alcohol in Afghanistan}}
[[File:ANP trucks in Kunar.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) in [[Kunar Province]]]]
The [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS) is the nation's domestic [[intelligence agency]], which operates similar to that of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) and has between 15,000 and 30,000 employees. The nation also has about 126,000 national police officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 160,000.<ref name=Pellerindate /> The [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) is under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]] and serves as a single [[law enforcement agency]] all across the country. The [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] is the main branch of the ANP, which is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, [[Gardez]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Every province has an appointed provincial [[Chief of Police]] who is responsible for [[law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement]] throughout the province.

The police receive most of their training from Western forces under the [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan]]. According to a 2009 news report, a large proportion of police officers were illiterate and accused of demanding bribes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121559123&ps=cprs |title=For U.S., Vast Challenge To Expand Afghan Forces |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234157/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121559123&ps=cprs|archivedate=2013-12-30}}</ref> Jack Kem, deputy to the commander of NATO Training Mission Afghanistan and Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan, stated that the literacy rate in the ANP would rise to over 50% by January 2012.

All parts of Afghanistan are considered dangerous due to militant activities. Hundreds of Afghan police are [[list of Afghan security forces fatality reports in Afghanistan|killed]] in the line of duty each year. Kidnapping and robberies are also reported. The [[Afghan Border Police]] (ABP) are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed [[Durand Line]] border, which is often used by members of criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. A report in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people were involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan. Attacks on government employees may be ordered by powerful mafia groups who reside inside and outside the country. Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to neighboring countries and then to other countries. The [[Ministry of Counter Narcotics (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics]] is tasked to deal with these issues by bringing to justice major drug traffickers.<ref>[http://mcn.gov.af/en Ministry of Counter Narcotics] {{Wayback|url=http://mcn.gov.af/en|date =20140328013458}}</ref>

Afghanistan is an impoverished [[least developed country]], one of the world's poorest because of decades of war and lack of foreign investment. {{as of|2014}}, the nation's GDP stands at about $60.58 billion with an exchange rate of $20.31 billion, and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] is $1,900. The country's exports totaled $2.7 billion in 2012. Its unemployment rate was reported in 2008 at about 35%.<ref name="Factbook" /> According to a 2009 report, about 42% of the population lives on less than $1 a day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83417 |title=Afghanistan: Food still unaffordable for millions |work= |publisher=[[IRIN]] |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=11 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827210523/http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83417 |archivedate=27 August 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no}}</ref> The nation has less than $1.5 billion in [[external debt]].<ref name="Factbook" />

The Afghan economy has been growing at about 10% per year in the last decade, which is due to the infusion of over $50 billion in international aid and remittances from Afghan expats.<ref name="Factbook" /> It is also due to improvements made to the [[transport in Afghanistan|transportation system]] and agricultural production, which is the backbone of the nation's economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/programs/agriculture#Tab=Description |title=Agriculture |work= |publisher=USAID |accessdate=20 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929082220/http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/programs/agriculture|archivedate=2013-09-29}}</ref> The country is known for producing some of the finest [[pomegranate production in Afghanistan|pomegranates]], grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits, including nuts.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100104080643/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49291 Exporting Afghanistan], by P.J.

While the nation's current account deficit is largely financed with donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations. The [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Finance]] is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. For example, government revenues increased 31% to $1.7 billion from March 2010 to March 2011.

[[Da Afghanistan Bank]] serves as the central bank of the nation and the [[Afghan afghani|"Afghani"]] (AFN) is the national currency, with an exchange rate of about 47 Afghanis to [[United States dollar|1 US dollar]]. Since 2003, over 16 new banks have opened in the country, including [[Afghanistan International Bank]], [[Kabul Bank]], [[Azizi Bank]], [[Pashtany Bank]], [[Standard Chartered Bank]], and [[First Micro Finance Bank]].

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million [[Afghan diaspora|expatriates]], who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses.

Air transport in Afghanistan is provided by the national carrier, [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] (AAA), and by private companies such as [[Afghan Jet International]], [[East Horizon Airlines]], [[Kam Air]], [[Pamir Airways]], and [[Safi Airways]]. Airlines from a number of countries also provide flights in and out of the country. These include [[Air India]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Iran Aseman Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], and [[Turkish Airlines]].

The country has four international airports: [[Herat International Airport]], [[Hamid Karzai International Airport]] (formerly Kabul International Airport), [[Kandahar International Airport]], and [[Mazar-e Sharif International Airport]]. There are also around a dozen domestic airports with flights to Kabul or Herat.
