In 1959, the show started a streak of weekly ratings wins that would not be interrupted for over twelve years. The show switched to color on August 21, 1967, and expanded from a half-hour in length to one hour starting on December 1, 1975 when ''The Edge of Night'' moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In the year-to-date ratings, ''As the World Turns'' was the most-watched daytime drama from 1958 until 1978, with ten million viewers tuning in each day. At its height, core actors such as [[Helen Wagner]], [[Don MacLaughlin]], [[Don Hastings]], and [[Eileen Fulton]] became nationally known. Three of these actors – Wagner, Hastings, and Fulton – are also the three [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors#Television|longest serving actors]] in the history of American soap operas.

==Premise==
[[Image:Hugheses1980.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The original core family, the Hugheses, in the 1980s. Clockwise from top left: Kim Sullivan Hughes ([[Kathryn Hays]]), Bob Hughes ([[Don Hastings]]), Tom Hughes ([[Gregg Marx]]), Margo Montgomery Hughes ([[Hillary Bailey Smith]]), Andy Dixon ([[Scott DeFreitas]]), Frannie Hughes ([[Julianne Moore]]). Center: Chris Hughes ([[Don MacLaughlin]]) and Nancy Hughes ([[Helen Wagner]]).]]

''As the World Turns'' was the creation of [[Irna Phillips]] who, beginning in the 1930s, had been one of the foremost creators and writers of radio soap operas. As a writer, Phillips favored character development and psychological realism over [[melodrama]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Newcomb|first=Horace |title=Encyclopedia of Television, Volume 1|edition=2|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1-57958-411-X|page=1765}}</ref> and her previous creations (which included ''[[Guiding Light]]'') were especially notable for placing professionals – doctors, lawyers, and clergy – at the center of their storylines. Phillips wrote: "As the world turns, we know the bleakness of winter, the promise of spring, the fullness of summer and the harvest of autumn—the cycle of life is complete."<ref>{{cite book|last=Cox |first=Jim |title=The Daytime Serials of Television, 1946-1960|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-2429-X|page=160}}</ref>

And so it was with ''As the World Turns'', with its slow-moving psychological character studies of families headed by legal and medical professionals. The personal and professional lives of doctors and lawyers would remain central to ''As the World Turns'' throughout its run, and would eventually become standard fare on many soap operas. Whereas the 15-minute radio soaps often focused on one central, heroic character (for example, Dr. Jim Brent in Phillips' ''Road of Life''), the expanded 30-minute format of ''As the World Turns'' enabled Phillips to introduce a handful of professionals within the framework of a family saga.

One of Phillips' innovations was to introduce a sort of [[Greek chorus]] to the stories.  The primary purpose of characters such as [[Nancy Hughes]] ([[Helen Wagner]]) was to comment on the crises faced and decisions made by the town's more dynamic residents.  This technique contributed to the popularity of the show and continues to be widely used in other soap operas.{{or|date=January 2012}}

Phillips' style favored gradual evolution over radical change. Slow, conversational, and emotionally intense, the show moved at the pace of life itself – and sometimes even more slowly than that. Each new addition to the cast was done in a gradual manner, and was usually a key contact to one of the members of the Hughes family. As such, the show earned a reputation as being quite [[conservative]], though the show did showcase a [[gay]] male character in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Robin |last2=Gray|first2=Jonathan Alan |title=Battleground: A-N|volume=1|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-34168-0|page=148}}</ref><ref>Nochimson, Martha.

ISBN 0-520-07771-7.</ref> During the show's early decades, the content-related policies of its sponsor [[Procter & Gamble Productions]] may have contributed to the perception of conservatism. The soap-manufacturing giant typically balked at storylines in which [[adultery]] and other immoral behavior would go unpunished, and as late as the 1980s characters from the primary families were still generally not allowed to go through with [[abortions]].

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of As the World Turns cast members|List of As the World Turns characters}}

===Helen Wagner===
The first words spoken in ''As the World Turns'' in the first episode (aired on April 2, 1956) were "Good morning, dear," said by the character [[Nancy Hughes]], played by actress [[Helen Wagner]].<ref>[http://www.aoltv.com/2009/12/09/is-there-still-a-future-for-soap-operas/ Is There Still a Future for Soap Operas?] by Michael Maloney, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 9 Dec 2009</ref>

Wagner was acknowledged by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] for having the longest run in a single role on television, a position she held until 2010.<ref name="cnn">CNN.com: [http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/30/leisure.world.reut/index.html Fifty years on 'As the World Turns'], 30 March 2006</ref> She did not play the role without interruption - she was temporarily dropped from the series after the first six months due to conflicts with creator Irna Phillips. Wagner also left the series in 1981, when she felt that writers were not interested in the veteran players. She returned as a regular contract player in 1985 after Douglas Marland became headwriter. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

On the episode broadcast on Monday, August 30, 2010, it was revealed that Nancy had died in her sleep; the next day's episode dealt with Nancy's memorial service. Nancy Hughes's memorial aired just two weeks before the series finale. The show's producers stated in interviews that they had to revise their plans for the final episode because of Wagner's death – they had hoped that Wagner would say the final lines of the last episode just as she had said the first words of the first episode.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Crossovers==
There have been several crossovers between ''As the World Turns'' and other serials:

*1962
**The character Mitchell Dru (Geoffrey Lumb) was brought to Oakdale after the cancellation of the Procter & Gamble soap ''[[The Brighter Day]]''.  The same character (and actor) was then transferred to a new Procter & Gamble soap, ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'', shortly after its premiere in 1964.  ''Another World'' was originally conceived by creator [[Irna Phillips]] to be a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off series]] of ''As the World Turns''. Like several other characters from ''Another World'', Mitchell Dru "crossed over" for one or more performances on the first ''Another World'' spin-off, ''[[Somerset (TV series)|Somerset]]'', which premiered in March 1970.
*1965
**The character [[Lisa Grimaldi|Lisa Miller Hughes]] ([[Eileen Fulton]]) was used as the basis to create a primetime spinoff soap ''[[Our Private World]]'', (CBS's attempt to duplicate the success of rival network ABC's ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]''), with Lisa leaving Oakdale and moving to Chicago, where she married wealthy John Eldridge, but had an affair with his brother Thomas.  Though ''Our Private World'' only lasted a few months, and Fulton returned to ''As the World Turns'' in early 1966, after taking a few months off, remnants of Lisa's time on ''Our Private World'' were resurrected 26 years later, when it was revealed in 1992 that Lisa had had a son off-camera, hitherto unknown to viewers, before returning to ''As the World Turns'' in 1966.  Her son Scott Eldridge tracked her down as an adult, and remained on ''As the World Turns'' for several years.
*1999–2003
**Shortly after ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' was canceled in June 1999, the characters of Cass and Lila Winthrop ([[Stephen Schnetzer]] and [[Lisa Peluso]]), and [[Jake McKinnon|Jake]] and [[Vicky Hudson|Victoria McKinnon]] ([[Tom Eplin]] and [[Jensen Buchanan]]) crossed over to ''As the World Turns'' briefly.  Jake and Vicky intended to move to Oakdale, but Vicky was soon killed off in September 1999, then appeared as a ghost to Jake and Molly from November 2000 to February 2001.  Cass only appeared on a recurring basis through 2003 (usually whenever anyone in Oakdale needed an attorney, other than resident lawyer Tom Hughes), and Jake ([[Tom Eplin]]) remained as a regular on the series until his character was killed off in 2002.  Cindy Brooke Harrison ([[Kim Rhodes]]) also had minor appearances in 2000 and 2001.  Vicky's mother and twin sister, Donna ([[Anna Stuart]]) and Marley ([[Ellen Wheeler]], who at the time also directed episodes of ''As the World Turns''), made recurring appearances from 2000 to 2002, and left the show when they gained custody of Jake and Vicky's twin daughters after Jake's death.  There were also plans to have a now-teenage Steven Frame (Vicky's son with Jamie Frame) come to Oakdale and live with Jake, but the character was reconceived as teenage Bryant Montgomery, the son of ''As the World Turns'' couple Craig and Sierra.

Since 2005, a number of characters have crossed back and forth between ''As the World Turns'' and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'':

*2005
**''As the World Turns'': At the request of Oakdale, Illinois, District Attorney Jessica Griffin, [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]) traveled there to serve as the attorney for [[Jack Snyder]] ([[Michael Park (actor)|Michael Park]]) in a custody hearing involving his late wife Julia Larabee's son, JJ.  (April 4 – 05, 2005).

The irony in his appearance in the above-mentioned episodes, is that twenty-years before, LeBlanc left the role of Kirk McColl, the youngest son of Lisa's fifth husband, Whit McColl (Played by Wagon Train star Robert Horton, who was killed-off shortly before Fulton's return to the show). So, to many long-time fans of both ''As The World Turns'' and ''The Young and the Restless'', it was weird seeing LeBlanc as the character from the latter show. History was also made during LeBlanc's appearance on ''As the World Turns'', since both shows are made by different production companies (Bell Dramatic Serial Company for ''The Young and the Restless''; Procter and Gamble for ''As the World Turns''), although they are on the same network.

*2007
**''The Young and the Restless'': [[Amber Moore]] ([[Adrienne Frantz]]) called on her friend [[Alison Stewart (ATWT)|Alison Stewart]] ([[Marnie Schulenburg]]) to help trick [[Cane Ashby]] ([[Daniel Goddard (actor)|Daniel Goddard]]) into marriage.  After Amber drugged Cane, Alison dressed-up as him for the wedding service.  (February 22, 2007)
**''The Young and the Restless'':  [[Emily Stewart]] ([[Kelley Menighan Hensley]]) traveled from Oakdale, Illinois to Genoa City, Wisconsin, in search of information on her sister, [[Alison Stewart (ATWT)|Alison Stewart]] ([[Marnie Schulenburg]]).  Emily met with [[Amber Moore]] ([[Adrienne Frantz]]) at Crimson Lights Coffeehouse, but Amber denied knowing Alison's whereabouts.  After Emily was gone, Amber placed a call to Alison as a heads-up.  (March 27, 2007)

==President Kennedy's assassination==
[[File:JFK CBS bulletin.jpg|thumb|250px|The initial [[CBS]] News Bulletin which interrupted ''As the World Turns'' at 1:40 p.m. (EST), as Nancy ([[Helen Wagner]]) talks with Grandpa ([[Santos Ortega]])]]
On November 22, 1963, the live CBS broadcast of ''As The World Turns'' began as always at 1:30 EST. In this episode, the Hughes family were discussing plans for Thanksgiving. Ten minutes later, a "[[CBS News]] Bulletin" slide suddenly came up on the screen and [[Walter Cronkite]] gave the first report of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]].<ref name="bugliosi">{{cite book|last=Bugliosi|first=Vincent |title=Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy|date=2008-05-17|publisher=W. W.

{{cquote|''Here is a bulletin from CBS News.  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.

These details about the same as previously: President Kennedy shot today just as his motorcade left downtown Dallas.  Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and grabbed Mr. Kennedy, she called 'Oh no!', the motorcade sped on.  United Press says that the wounds for President Kennedy perhaps could be fatal.  Repeating, a bulletin from CBS News, President Kennedy has been shot by a would-be assassin in Dallas, Texas.  Stay tuned to CBS News for further details.''<ref name="bugliosi" />}}

At the end of this bulletin, CBS rejoined ''As The World Turns'', which was still in progress.  The cast, performing the episode live, was not yet aware of the rapidly developing situation.<ref name="bugliosi" />

As NBC and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the other two major U.S. TV networks, were not programming at the time (the 1:30–2:00 ET period belonging to their local affiliates), ''As The World Turns'' has the distinction of being the last regular U.S. network program broadcast for the next four days as the assassination and [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|funeral of JFK]] and the transition of power to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took center stage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chiu|first=Tony|title=CBS, the first 50 years|location=Los Angeles|publisher=General Pub. Group|year=1998|isbn=1575440830}}</ref>

==Broadcast history==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
''As the World Turns'' enjoyed a virtually uninterrupted reign as the highest-rated soap from 1958 to 1978,<ref name=cox /> tying for first place with [[NBC Daytime]]'s ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' (1973–1974, 1977–1978) and ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' (1973–1974). By the mid-1960s, it was so firmly entrenched that its strongest competition, ''[[Let's Make a Deal]],'' despite developing a devoted fan base in its own right and becoming one of daytime's most popular game shows, could not come close to matching it in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsens]].

Its strength was such that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ran hour-long drama reruns in the 1–2 p.m. (noon-1 Central) slot in the mid-1960s and NBC, after losing ''Deal'' to ABC in 1968, ran a total of eight shows, all short-lived (with the exception of ''[[Three on a Match (game show)|Three on a Match]]'', which lasted three years), against ''As the World Turns'' and ''Let's Make a Deal'' from that point until 1975.

As that year began ''Another World'' was expanded to sixty minutes, with their first hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect ''As the World Turns'', as the two shows were not in competition for anything other than the overall ratings win, CBS' afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put a dent in the ratings of both of CBS' popular afternoon game shows, ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Match Game]]''. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of ''Another World'' had brought to the network, elected to do the same thing with ''Days of our Lives'' beginning on April 21, 1975; this put ''Days of our Lives'' and ''As the World Turns'' in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring seven years after the last two fifteen-minute serials, ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[The Guiding Light]]'', expanded to thirty minutes.

CBS considered expanding ''As the World Turns'' and ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' to forty-five minute lengths (elimating the timeslot during which stations broadcast local newscasts), but eventually decided to expand ''As the World Turns'', its front-runner in the ratings battle, to a full-hour length.  CBS set a target of September 1975 to complete the expansion and needed to free up thirty minutes' worth of space on its schedule to do so. Game show ''The Price Is Right'' was relocated to 10:30 am and aired a week's worth of sixty-minute shows in September as a test for a potential permanent expansion. While ''The Price is Right's'' expansion was intended as temporary to start, the expansion of ''As the World Turns'' was to be permanent. As such, the network was required to cancel one of the other prograns on its schedule.

CBS turned its eye to ''The Edge of Night'', which at the time was the network's lowest rated program. The former hit had been moved, at Procter & Gamble's insistence, from its 3:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot to the 2:30&nbsp;p.m. slot following ''The Guiding Light'' in 1972. As a result, ''The Edge of Night'' lost a large portion of its audience. In addition to those factors working against it, the rest of CBS' drama lineup was performing well in the ratings and the network could not move the long-running serial to another time slot without risking preemption from local affiliates, which would have driven ratings even lower. An agreement was struck between CBS, Procter & Gamble, and ABC in order to get the necessary thirty minutes for the ''As the World Turns'' expansion. CBS would not renew ''The Edge of Night'' once its contract was up, and Procter & Gamble would move the serial to ABC and air it there.

However, a problem arose that would have caused a major issue had CBS elected to go ahead with a September expansion of ''As the World Turns''. The network's contract with Procter & Gamble was not due to expire until December 1975. This meant that no new episodes of ''The Edge of Night'' would air for three months, and ABC wanted to keep the series' continuity intact. CBS decided to hold off on the expansion and continue airing ''The Edge of Night'' until ABC could find a space for the serial. In November 1975, ABC announced the cancellation of the game show ''[[You Don't Say!]]'', which had been airing in the network's 4 p.m. timeslot. The final episode was scheduled to air on November 28, 1975, after which ''The Edge of Night'' would be free to leave CBS and ''As the World Turns'' would be free to expand to sixty minutes.

The first hour-long episode of ''As the World Turns'' aired on December 1, 1975. The first half of the show continued to perform well against ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' on ABC, which the network moved to the Noon timeslot within four weeks of the expansion. The second half put ''As the World Turns'' in competition with ABC's most popular game show, ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'', which had done well against ''Guiding Light'' since the network moved it to 2:00 pm at the end of 1974 and kept doing so against ''As the World Turns''. Although the expansion was not a complete success, at the end of the season the serial was again at the top of the daytime Nielsens despite a 1.4 point drop from the year before.

Although the eventual hit game ''[[Family Feud]]'' ran against ''As The World Turns'' from July 12, 1976 until April 22, 1977, it did not become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. It was only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap with ''[[All My Children]]'' that trouble really began for ''As the World Turns'' (and also ''Days of our Lives''), since ABC kept that serial's starting time at 1/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss the last half of that day's storyline (or, contrariwise, would not, if they watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the ''As The World Turns'' or ''Days of Our Lives'' activities from the episode's beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after the bottom of the hour). Further, ''All My Children's'' emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier story lines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic, almost quaint tone of ''As the World Turns'' (and, to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical ''Days''). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old ''[[One Life to Live]]'' to the 2/1 starting time, compounding the other networks' headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of ''As The World Turns'' from the top spot in the ratings at the end of the 1978-79 season. After finishing the previous season tied with ''Another World'' for #1 in the Nielsens, ''As the World Turns'' fell to fourth behind ''[[All My Children]]'', ''[[General Hospital]]'', and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''.

On February 4, 1980, CBS moved and expanded ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' to a full hour after the cancellation of  soap opera ''[[Love of Life]]''. ''The Young and the Restless'' moved from Noon/11am to 1pm/Noon (the former affiliate break timeslot) and ''As the World Turns'' was bumped up to 2pm/1pm and ''[[Guiding Light]]'' to 3pm/2pm.  On June 8, 1981, ''As the World Turns'' returned to its longtime 1:30/12:30pm start time with ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' following at 2:30/1:30pm and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' leading off the serial lineup at either Noon/11am or 12:30/11:30am (depending on affiliate preference).

''As the World Turns'' remained at 1:30/12:30pm until March 20, 1987, when CBS canceled the five-year-old ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]'' in favor of ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]].'' CBS scheduled it at 1:30/12:30, and finally settled ''As the World Turns'' at 2/1, where it remained until its final episode in September 2010. Although facing the full length of ''Another World'' and ''One Life to Live'' once again, the [[Douglas Marland]] era of 1985 to 1993 saw a resurgence in ratings, and by 1991 it was back in its once habitual top-four placing. ''As the World Turns'' would survive NBC's cancellation of its sister ''Another World'' in 1999.

==End==
In December 2009, CBS confirmed that it would not renew ''As the World Turns''. The final episode was taped on June 23, 2010 at [[JC Studios]] in Brooklyn, which aired on September 17, 2010. The final scene included Kim Hughes ([[Kathryn Hays]]) telling Bob Hughes ([[Don Hastings]]) to take as much time as he needed. Bob said the final two lines "Good night" and left the Oakdale Memorial Hospital, and the globe started spinning before the final fade-out.
