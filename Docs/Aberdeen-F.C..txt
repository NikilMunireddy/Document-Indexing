'''Aberdeen Football Club''' (also known as '''The Dons''' or '''The Reds''') are a Scottish professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland. They compete in the [[Scottish Premiership]] and have won four league titles and seven [[Scottish Cup]]s, including a record three in a row during the 1980s (the only time a team other than [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] has done this since 1882). They are also the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies, both in the same year, and have [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|never been relegated]] from the top division of the [[Scottish football league system]].

Formed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager [[Dave Halliday]]. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of [[Alex Ferguson]], they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a [[Scottish League Cup]], alongside the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]], both in 1983. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the [[Old Firm]] to win a league title, in [[1984–85 in Scottish football|1984–85]], and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, but a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the [[2013–14 Scottish League Cup]].

Aberdeen have played at [[Pittodrie Stadium]] since their inception. The ground currently has a capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|aberdeen}}<ref name="spfl.co.uk"/> and was the first [[All-seater stadium|all-seated]] and all-covered stadium in the United Kingdom. Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a [[technical area|dugout]], an invention of player and coach [[Donald Colman]]. The club's colours have been primarily red and white since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes. Aberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas, as they are the only senior team within a wide area. Aberdeen have no geographically close rivals; their nearest neighbours at the same level are in the city of [[Dundee]].

[[File:Aberdeen FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|alt=Chart of yearly table positions|League history of Aberdeen from their first league appearance in 1904]]
The current Aberdeen F.C. was formed following the merger of three city clubs, [[Aberdeen F.C. (1881)|Aberdeen]], [[Victoria United F.C.|Victoria United]] and [[Orion F.C.|Orion]], in 1903.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Webster |title=The First 100 Years of The Dons: the official history of Aberdeen Football Club 1903–2003 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |year=2003 |isbn=0-340-82344-5 |pages=69–70 }}</ref> The new club played its first match on 15 August 1903, a 1–1 draw with [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]].<ref name="milestones">{{cite web |url=http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/forcereg/milestones/0,,10284~974674,00.html |title=Milestones & Records |publisher=Aberdeen F.C. |accessdate=2 April 2008}}</ref> That first season produced a win in the [[Aberdeenshire Cup]], but only a third-place finish in the [[Northern Football League (Scotland)|Northern League]]. The club applied for membership of the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] for the following season, and were elected to the Second Division, rather than the First.<ref name="milestones" />

In 1904, the club were managed by [[Jimmy Philip]]. At the end of that first season, despite having finished seventh out of twelve teams, Aberdeen were elected to the new, expanded First Division, and have been in the top tier of Scottish football ever since, a record shared with only [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref name="overview">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotprem.premiumtv.co.uk/page/AberdeenDetail/0,,10002~932190,00.html |title=Club Overview&nbsp;– Aberdeen |publisher=[[Scottish Premier League]] |accessdate=28 March 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080411072744/http://www.scotprem.premiumtv.co.uk/page/AberdeenDetail/0,,10002~932190,00.html| archivedate= 11 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> From 1906, the club made steady progress, with a [[Scottish Cup]] semi-final appearance in [[1907–08 in Scottish football|1908]] and another in [[1910–11 in Scottish football|1911]].<ref name="milestones" /> In that season of 1910–11, Aberdeen recorded their first victories over the [[Old Firm]], and led the league for a time, but finished the season in second place.<ref name="milestones" />

Wartime affected the club as much as any other. Despite spending cuts and other economies, by 1917 the situation became untenable. Aberdeen dropped out of competitive football, along with [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]]. Senior football returned on 16 August 1919, and Aberdeen resumed with a fixture against [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]]. Philip was still in charge, and continued to oversee a team capable of isolated good results, but never quite able to sustain a challenge long enough to win a trophy. In 1923, Aberdeen were drawn against [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] in the Scottish Cup, and posted their record score—a 13–0 victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19039673.html |title=Peterhead ready to settle old scores with northern neighbours |work=[[Sunday Herald]] |publisher=Herald & Times Group |accessdate=7 September 2013|date=4 March 2001 |last=Grant |first=Michael}}</ref> Philip retired a year later, and was replaced as manager by [[Paddy Travers]].<ref name="managers">{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/managers2.sd?managerid=1429 |title=Aberdeen's managers |publisher=Soccerbase |accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref> He presided over the team's first Scottish Cup final in 1937.<ref name="milestones" />

Travers' trainer (first team coach in modern parlance) was former player Donald Colman. Colman was regarded as a brilliant and innovative thinker about football, and conceived the [[Technical area (soccer)|dug-out]], a covered area set slightly below the level of the playing surface to better aid his observations. [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] visited Pittodrie soon after its introduction, and exported the idea to the English leagues, from where it spread throughout the football-playing world.<ref name="dugout">{{cite book |first=David |last=Bauckham |title=Dugouts |publisher=New Holland Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=1-84537-478-9 |page=9 |url=http://www.pyramidpassion.co.uk/Text_page_scan_1.jpg }}</ref> Travers left to become manager of [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] in 1939.

=== Halliday to McNeill (1939–1978) ===

Travers was replaced by [[Dave Halliday]].<ref name=autogeneratedhalliday>[http://www.qosfc.com/Legends Dave Halliday and George Hamilton profiles on "Queens Legends" on the official Queen of the South FC website]</ref> Halliday went to his ex club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] to sign inside forward [[George Hamilton (footballer)|George Hamilton]]. This would be as shrewd a signing as Halliday would ever make.<ref name=autogeneratedhalliday /><ref>[http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/managersDetail/0,,10284~976431,00.html 1937–1955 Dave Halliday | Aberdeen | Football | Managers | Managers Detail<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However Halliday had barely begun his work when the [[Second World War]] halted competitive football in the United Kingdom.<ref name=autogeneratedhalliday /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWfootball.htm |title=Football and the Second World War |publisher=Spartacus |accessdate=28 March 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080324091123/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWfootball.htm| archivedate= 24 March 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Halliday's place in the Aberdeen Hall of Fame was secured after the war when he became the first manager to bring national trophies to Pittodrie. Aberdeen, now playing in red, won the [[Southern League Cup (Scotland)|Southern League Cup]] in the [[1945–46 in Scottish football|1945–46 season]] [[Southern League Cup (Scotland) 1945–46|defeating Rangers]] 3–2 at Hampden. They then reached the [[1946–47 Scottish Cup|1947 Scottish Cup]] final, defeating [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] 2–1 with the inspirational Hamilton scoring to gain the club's first major trophy.<ref name=autogeneratedhalliday /><ref name="tanked">{{cite web |url=http://www.tankedup-imaging.com/football/scottish.html |title=Scottish Premier League & Cup winners |publisher=Tanked Up Imaging |accessdate=24 March 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080428005816/http://www.tankedup-imaging.com/football/scottish.html| archivedate= 28 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> From this early success, Halliday's side reached two more Scottish Cup finals, in [[1952–53 in Scottish football|1953]] and [[1953–54 in Scottish football|1954]], although both were lost.<ref name=autogeneratedhalliday /> Halliday's team were not to be denied, however, and the following season, [[1954–55 in Scottish football|1954–55]], Aberdeen won their first Scottish League title.<ref name=autogeneratedhalliday /><ref name="tanked" /> Though league winners, the club did not participate in the first [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] competition—Scotland's place was awarded to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], who took part by special invitation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec195556.html |title=European Competitions 1955/56 |publisher=RSSSF |accessdate=29 March 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080315053719/http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec195556.html| archivedate= 15 March 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Halliday and Hamilton left at the end of that championship-winning season,<ref name=autogeneratedhalliday /> Halliday replaced by [[Davie Shaw]]. Aberdeen won the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] under his guidance, beating [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] in [[1955–56 in Scottish football|1955–56]], and reached another Scottish Cup final in [[1958–59 in Scottish football|1959]].<ref name="tanked" /> However, Shaw stepped aside for another former favourite player, [[Tommy Pearson]] in 1959. Pearson's time in charge coincided with a high turnover of players, and yielded no trophies. He retired in 1965, making way for [[Eddie Turnbull]].<ref name="managers" /> Turnbull led Aberdeen to two Scottish Cup finals against Celtic, losing in [[1966–67 in Scottish football|1967]], but gaining revenge three years later.<ref name="tanked" />

Aberdeen first played in Europe in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1967–68|1967–68 Cup Winner's Cup]], qualifying as runners-up to Celtic in the Scottish Cup final. Their first tie was a 14–1 aggregate victory over [[KR Reykjavik]], although they lost the second round tie with [[Standard Liège]] 3–2 on aggregate. As Scottish Cup holders in [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1970–71|1970–71]], Aberdeen once again qualified for the same competition, but were eliminated in the first round following a 4–4 aggregate tie with [[Budapest Honvéd FC|Honvéd]]. This tie, level after extra time and also level on [[away goals]], was decided by the first [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] in UEFA competition history, Honvéd winning the shootout 5–4 in Budapest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/forcereg/dons/0,,10284,00.html? |title=European Pedigree&nbsp;– Dons in Europe |publisher=Aberdeen F.C. |accessdate=1 April 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080422180117/http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/forcereg/dons/0,,10284,00.html| archivedate= 22 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Photograph|[[Alex Ferguson]], the most successful manager of Aberdeen, pictured at his later club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]]]

The Aberdeen side of the 1970s regularly challenged for domestic honours. However, they rarely won trophies, with the exception of the Drybrough Cup in 1971 under [[Jimmy Bonthrone]] and the [[1976 Scottish League Cup Final|League Cup in 1976]], under [[Ally MacLeod]]. During this decade, Aberdeen had five managers, Eddie Turnbull, Jimmy Bonthrone, Ally MacLeod, [[Billy McNeill]] and [[Alex Ferguson]].<ref name="managers" /> They reached two more national cup finals—the [[1978 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup in 1978]] under [[Billy McNeill]] and the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (March)|League Cup in the following season]] under the new manager Alex Ferguson.<ref name="tanked" />

=== Alex Ferguson era (1978–1986) ===

Under Ferguson's guidance, the club won three league championships, four Scottish Cups, the European Cup Winner's Cup, the European Super Cup, a League Cup, and a Drybrough Cup&nbsp;– all in the space of seven years.

Under Ferguson's guidance, players such as [[Jim Leighton]], [[Willie Miller]], [[Alex McLeish]] and [[Gordon Strachan]] became the backbone of the team. Aberdeen's second League title was won in [[1979–80 in Scottish football|1979–80]], and this initial success was built on, with [[Scottish Cup]] wins in three successive seasons from [[1981–82 in Scottish football|1982]] to [[1983–84 in Scottish football|1984]],<ref name="tanked" /> and two more league titles in [[1983–84 in Scottish football|1983–84]] and [[1984–85 in Scottish football|1984–85]].

In the [[1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup in 1983]] Aberdeen beat [[FC Sion]], [[Dinamo Tirana]] and [[Lech Poznań]] to face the German Cup winners [[Bayern Munich]]. This game was won 3–2 at Pittodrie after a goalless draw in Germany, [[John Hewitt (footballer)|John Hewitt]] with the winning goal. They then faced now defunct [[Belgium|Belgian]] club [[K. Waterschei S.V. Thor Genk|Waterschei]] in the semi-final. Aberdeen beat them 5–1 at home, and lost for the first time in the tournament, 1–0 away, resulting in an aggregate victory which sent Aberdeen to the final. On 11 May 1983, Aberdeen beat [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] 2–1 (after extra time) to win the Cup and become only the third Scottish side to win a European trophy.<ref name="milestones" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0081/page06.shtml |title=A Sporting Nation&nbsp;– The New Firm and the Dons' Cup-Winners' Cup glory in 1983 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 April 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/sports_talk/1329596.stm |title=The greatest Euro final ever? |publisher=BBC News|date=16 May 2001 |accessdate=30 March 2008 }}</ref> The club released a song, "[[European Song]]", to coincide with the appearance in the final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Aberdeen-FC-Come-You-Reds/dp/B000026Y9F |title=Aberdeen FC: Come On You Reds! |publisher=[[Amazon (website)|Amazon]] |accessdate=20 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080601093722/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Aberdeen-FC-Come-You-Reds/dp/B000026Y9F| archivedate= 1 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This was followed up with the capture of the [[European Super Cup]] in December, when [[Hamburger SV]] were beaten over two legs.<ref name="milestones" />

Aberdeen reached the semi-finals of the [[1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup]], before losing to [[F.C. Porto|Porto]] 2–0 on aggregate. In the first round of the [[1984–85 European Champion Club's Cup]] Aberdeen lost to [[East Berlin]] side [[BFC Dynamo]] in a dramatic penalty shoot-out 4–5, following a 3–3 on aggregate in regular times. Today, both clubs enjoy friendly relations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liberoguide.com/bfc-dynamo/ |title=BFC Dynamo  |website=LiberoGuide.com|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Post-Ferguson (1987–1999) ===
After Ferguson moved south of the border to manage [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in November 1986, Aberdeen struggled to compete with Celtic and a resurgent Rangers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Squad/managers/0,,10284~976493,00.html |title=Managers 1978–1995 |publisher=Aberdeen F.C. |accessdate=21 April 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430045349/http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Squad/managers/0,,10284~976493,00.html| archivedate= 30 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing [[Alex Smith (footballer born 1939)|Alex Smith]] and [[Jocky Scott]].<ref name="managers"/> A number of foreign players were signed, including Dutch internationals [[Theo Snelders]] and [[Hans Gillhaus]]. In the [[1989–90 in Scottish football|1989–90]] the club won both the [[Scottish Cup]] and the [[Scottish League Cup]]. In the [[1990–91 in Scottish football|1990–91]] they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers.<ref name="tanked"/> [[Willie Miller]] took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, he was sacked in 1995 after a bad season, and the club had to rely on a play-off victory over [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] to retain their Premier League status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot95.html |title=Scotland League Archive&nbsp;– 1994/95 |publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=19 April 2008  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430151521/http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot95.html| archivedate= 30 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Aberdeen replaced him with [[Roy Aitken]]. Despite a [[Scottish League Cup]] success beating [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in [[1995–96 in Scottish football|1995]], the club continued to struggle.<ref name="tanked" /> [[Alex Miller]] and [[Paul Hegarty]] had spells in charge in the late 1990s,<ref name="managers" /> but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt for the first time in its history, the directors turned to [[Stewart Milne]], a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, to bring business acumen to the running of the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19048932.html |title=Skovdahl helps Milne put his house in order |work=Sunday Herald|last=Grant |first=Michael |date=19 May 2000|accessdate=7 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/cynics-proved-wrong-as-prudent-milne-put-in-the-frame-for-club-role-model-1-1372950 |title=Cynics proved wrong as prudent Milne put in the frame for club role model |work=The Scotsman |publisher=Johnston Publishing |date=4 May 2002 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}</ref>

=== Late 90s/2000s (1999–2013) ===

[[File:Richard Donald stand on a Match Day.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph people dressed in red and white in a stadium stand|A display by Aberdeen fans in the Richard Donald Stand]]

Aberdeen's first (and only to date) non-Scottish manager, [[Ebbe Skovdahl]], was appointed in 1999<ref name="milestones"/> and his time in charge coincided with some of the heaviest defeats in the club's history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zkfSoKicjIsJ:www.thisisaberdeen.co.uk/displayNode.jsp%3FnodeId%3D148766%26command%3DdisplayContent%26sourceNode%3D148590%26contentPK%3D20022349%26folderPk%3D85404%26pNodeId%3D148360+Ebbe+Skovdahl&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=10&gl=uk&client=firefox-a |title=Aberdeen/Rangers scores |publisher= |work=[[Evening Express (Scotland)|Evening Express]] |accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref>  The low point of the club's history came in the [[1999–00 in Scottish football|1999–2000]] season, when they finished last in the Premier division. As the SPL was being expanded to 12 teams, there was then a three team play-off. However, as [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]]'s stadium did not meet SPL requirements, Aberdeen retained their status in the top flight.<ref name="milestones" /> Subsequent to this, and with the club in debt for the first time following the construction of a new stand at one end of the ground,<ref>{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Webster |title=The First 100 Years of The Dons: the official history of Aberdeen Football Club 1903–2003 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |year=2003 |isbn=0-340-82344-5|page=13 }}</ref> a policy of trying to live within their means has meant that the club has not approached the heights of the 1980s.

[[Steve Paterson]] was appointed to replace Skovdahl but lasted only two seasons.  Paterson's tenure with Aberdeen was marred by his abuse of alcohol. In March 2003 he failed to attend a home game against [[Dundee F.C.]] due to being too hungover after a night of binge drinking prior to the match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/exclusive-steve-paterson---being-1041785 |title=Exclusive: Steve Paterson&nbsp;– Being too hungover to attend Aberdeen match was most shameful incident of my life |publisher= |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Evening Express]] |accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>

[[Jimmy Calderwood]] took over in 2004 and Aberdeen posted more consistent results than in previous seasons.

Aberdeen started the [[2014–15 Scottish Premiership]] well by coming through the early rounds of the [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], winning 8–0 on aggregate against [[Latvia]]n side [[Daugava Riga]] and securing a 2–1 win against [[FC Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28198272|title=FK Daugava Riga 0–3 Aberdeen (agg 0–8)|date=10 July 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28331359|title=Groningen 1–2 Aberdeen (agg 1–2)|date=24 July 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|first=Liam|last=McLeod|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> Aberdeen then came up against Spanish side [[Real Sociedad]] where they eventually went out of the competition losing 5–2 on aggregate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/aberdeen-2-3-real-sociedad-agg-2-5-dons-out-1-3502973|title=Aberdeen 2–3 Real Sociedad (Agg 2–5): Dons out|date=8 August 2014|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> The club ended the season in second place, their best league position since [[1993–94 Aberdeen F.C. season|1993–94]] and were once again eligible to enter the first qualifying round of the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League]].

For the first season of the club's existence, the team played in a predominantly white strip.<ref name="strips">{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Aberdeen/Aberdeen.htm |title=Aberdeen |work=Historical Football Kits |accessdate=15 August 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070817020723/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Aberdeen/Aberdeen.htm| archivedate= 17 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This is variously reported as all-white, or as white shirts with blue shorts and socks.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jack|last=Webster|title=The First 100 Years of The Dons: the official history of Aberdeen Football Club 1903–2003|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=2003|isbn=0-340-82344-5|page=69}}</ref> This colour scheme was the direct descendant of the colours worn by the precursor [[Aberdeen F.C. (1881)|Aberdeen]] club, but lasted only one season before being replaced.<ref name="strips" />

For the [[1904–05 in Scottish football|1904–05]] season, Aberdeen adopted a black and gold striped shirt, which led to the team being nicknamed "Wasps". This strip, with only minor variations, was worn until just before the start of the [[World War|Second World War]]. The blue shorts lasted until 1911, and then were replaced with white ones. Socks were black with gold trim, either as stripes or as a solid bar at the turndown.<ref name="strips" />

}}
In March 1939, Aberdeen changed the black and gold colours to red and white, reflecting the silver and red colours of the official [[Aberdeen|City of Aberdeen]] arms.<ref name="milestones" /> The first red strips were worn with white shorts, with either red or white socks from 1939 until the [[1965–66 in Scottish football|1965–66]] season.<ref name="strips" /> In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red shorts, making the official kit all-red, similar to that of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who made a similar change at around the same time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Liverpool/Liverpool.htm |title=Liverpool&nbsp;– Historical Football Kits|publisher=Historical Football Kits |accessdate=8 January 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071217225529/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Liverpool/Liverpool.htm| archivedate= 17 December 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded. In the late 1970s an [[Admiral (sportswear)|Admiral]] strip featured five vertical white stripes on the left side of the shirt and shorts, and the early 1980s shirts—as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final—featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts of blue,<ref name="strips" /> and a one season reversion to white shorts, although the all-red scheme returned in [[1997–98 in Scottish football|1997]].<ref name="strips" /> For the 2012–13 season, Aberdeen once again reverted to wearing white shorts. In 2013–14, the all-red kit was reintroduced.

Shirt sponsorship began in [[1987–88 in Scottish football|1987]], and the initial shirt sponsor was [[JVC]].<ref name="strips" /> Since then, with the club making fewer appearances on the international stage, shirt sponsors have tended to be more local—they have included one of the local commercial radio stations, [[Northsound Radio|Northsound]].<ref name="dkkit">{{cite web |url=http://www.footballshirts.dk/static/001182/000001/004544.asp |title=Aberdeen (A) 94/96 (Large) |publisher=Football Shirts |accessdate=2 April 2008 }}</ref> With the local economy being dominated by oil companies the Club have tended to be sponsored by oil service companies. For the next 2 years Team Recruitment will be the Club's sponsor.
Change, or "away", strips have tended to be either white, often with black shorts, or a combination of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the [[World War II|pre-war]] era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks.<ref name="dkkit" /> For the [[2007–08 in Scottish football|2007–08]] season, the change strip was all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or in the event of a clash involving both red and white.<ref name="strips" />

The club did not have an official crest before 1972, but several variations on the letters AFC had from time to time featured on the shirt, usually in some kind of [[cursive]] font. In November 1972,<ref name="crest">{{cite web | url=http://www.footballcrests.com/clubs/aberdeen-fc | title=Aberdeen | work=Football Crests.com | accessdate=19 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070824163451/http://www.footballcrests.com/clubs/aberdeen-fc| archivedate= 24 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> the club unveiled an official crest or logo, designed by Aberdonian graphic designer Donald Addison.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leabharmor.net/callig_popup.php?id=66 |title=An Leabhar Mor |publisher=Leabh Armor |accessdate=2 April 2008 |language=Gaelic }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The design represented a capital letter ''A'' as the side view of a football goal, with a ball forming the crossbar of the letter. This ball was crosshatched in such a way as to depict it as being inside the net, signifying the scoring of a goal. The logo was completed by the letters ''FC'' in smaller type at a level with the ball element.<ref name="crest" /> This badge was used on the shirts from around 1978, with no significant alterations until the mid-1980s when the words "Aberdeen Football Club" were added in a circular border, and the date of the club's founding, 1903, was added under the goal element.<ref name="crest" /> The current version of the crest, which retains these elements in a unified design, was introduced at the start of the [[1997–98 in Scottish football|1997–98]] season.<ref name="crest" /> Two stars signifying the winning of the two European trophies in 1983 were introduced over the badge in the [[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06]] season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/clubNewsDetail/0,,10284~954462,00.html |title=new home kit available today |publisher=Aberdeen F.C. |accessdate=2 April 2008}}</ref>

===Rivalries===
Aberdeen have rarely played in the same division as their geographically closest rivals: [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]], [[Brechin City F.C.|Brechin City]], [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]], [[Arbroath F.C.|Arbroath]], [[Elgin City F.C.|Elgin City]] and [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]], so rivalries have tended to come from further afield. Currently, Aberdeen have a minor rivalry with [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caley Thistle]], due to the fact both Aberdeen and [[Inverness]] are the two largest settlements in the north of Scotland. This is known as the [[North derby]] and has arisen since Inverness were first promoted to the SPL in 2004.

In the early 1980s, owing to the success both domestically and in Europe of Aberdeen and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], the pair were known as the [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]]; however, Dundee United have their city neighbours [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] as close rivals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=238|title=Dundee United A&nbsp;– Z ( D )&nbsp;– scroll down for the 'Dundee F.C' entry|publisher=[[Dundee United F.C.]]|accessdate=29 January 2008}}
</ref> and the antagonism was not always reciprocated to the same degree. The same situation applies to Aberdeen's rivalry with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], in that Rangers have their own much older and well-known [[Old Firm]] rivalry with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Aberdeen's rivalry with Rangers arose after a number of incidents in matches between the two clubs in the 1980s, namely [[Willie Johnston]]'s stamp on [[John McMaster (footballer)|John McMaster]]'s neck in the [[1979–80 Scottish League Cup]] and [[Neil Simpson]]'s tackle on [[Ian Durrant]] in 1988, as well as Aberdeen's dominance in Scottish football throughout the decade. There are still often violent clashes between both sets of supporters within and outwith the stadium to this day, with major disturbances outside [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] at the most recent game between the two clubs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ibrox-mayhem-as-police-charge-brawling-1114643 |title=Ibrox mayhem as police charge brawling football thugs at subway station |author=McGivern, Mark |work=Daily Record |date=23 January 2012|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9987680.html |title=A Fight in the North; Riot police move in as hooligans force players |author=Grant, Michael |work=Sunday Herald |date=20 January 2002|accessdate=7 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=306660&root=europe&cc=5901|author= Rae, Derek |title=Rae's Say: Coming Home |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=29 January 2008 }}</ref>

Since Aberdeen's re-emergence as one of the top teams in Scotland, Aberdeen's rivalry with Celtic has increased both competitively and between supporters. There have been minor incidents at games,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Celtic fans held over ‘minute’s silence assault’|url = http://www.scotsman.com/news/celtic-fans-held-over-minute-s-silence-assault-1-3599904|website = www.scotsman.com|access-date = 30 January 2016}}</ref> mainly relating to political disturbances by Celtic supporters at games between the clubs, including the disruption of minute's silences and the display of banners showing support for the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Celtic fans' H-Block symbol investigated - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/celtic/celtic-fans-hblock-symbol-investigated-29794258.html|website = BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date = 30 January 2016}}</ref> Aberdeen fans have long held a strong opposition to Rangers and Celtic fans' songs and banners relating to [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], although often taunt either side about their affiliations.{{Fact|date=April 2016}}

===Nicknames===
Aberdeen are known as "The Dons", a name that has been in use since at least 1913. This comes from the word 'Don' meaning 'teacher', given Aberdeen's history as a university town. It may also be a reference to the River Don. Before the popular adoption of "The Dons", the team were variously known as "The Wasps" or "The Black and Golds", both names a reference to the yellow and black striped shirts of the time.<ref name='nick'>{{cite book |first=Jack|last=Webster|title=The First 100 Years of The Dons: the official history of Aberdeen Football Club 1903–2003|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=2003|isbn=0-340-82344-5|page=91}}</ref> As with many teams that play in red, Aberdeen may also be called "The Reds", and are referred to by some supporters as "The Dandy Dons" or "The Dandies".<ref>Entering the Field: New Perspectives on World Football, Gary Armstrong, Berg Publishers, 1997, ISBN 1-85973-198-8</ref> Most rival clubs call Aberdeen "The Sheep" and their supporters "The [[Sheep Shagger]]s" due to the high number of sheep in fields on the road to Aberdeen. Opposition fans often sing "you're only sheep shagging bastards" to Aberdeen fans, who embrace the taunts and reply singing "we're only sheep shagging bastards". The term was eventually accepted by the club after Aberdeen fans started singing "the sheep are on fire" at games, in reference to their good fortune on the pitch (although the song "the sheep are on fire" was originally sung by away fans as a jest to an Aberdeen fan who was set on fire by another fan on a train whilst wearing a homemade sheep costume).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/opinion/columnists/come-on-you-reds-155554n.23667944|title = Come On You Reds!|date = 13 March 2014|accessdate = |website = [[Glasgow Evening Times]]|publisher = |last = Loxton|first = Rachel}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2933858/Aberdeen-hammered-4-1-time-faced-Dundee-United-League-Cup-semi-final.html|title = Aberdeen were hammered 4–1 last time they faced Dundee United in a League Cup semi-final... but Derek McInnes insists that will not happen this time around at Hampden|date = 30 January 2015|accessdate = 4 May 2015|website = [[Mail Online]]|publisher = |last = Marjoribanks|first = Brian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://news.stv.tv/scotland/193856-millionaire-football-fan-avoids-jail-term-after-setting-fire-to-rival-supporter|title = Millionaire football fan avoids jail term after setting fire to rival supporter|date = 25 August 2010|accessdate =  14 November 2015|website = [[STV News]]}}</ref> This in turn led to merchandise being sold by the club claiming "the sheep are on fire", and led to local bakeries selling themed pies.<ref name='et'>{{cite news |title=Aberdeen FC Inspire Sheep Are On Fire Pies |publisher=Evening Express |date=5 March 2014 |url=http://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/local/video-aberdeen-fc-inspires-sheep-are-on-fire-pies-1.253580}}</ref>
