The '''Conservative Party of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Parti conservateur du Canada}}), colloquially known as the '''[[Tory|Tories]]''', is a [[political party]] in [[Canada]]. It is positioned on the right of the [[Politics of Canada|Canadian political spectrum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/decisioncanada/story.html?id=d59c723e-e997-4569-b9ea-20e2dc0d5686|title=Platform:Conservative Party|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]}}</ref> The party's leader from 2004 to 2015 was [[Stephen Harper]], who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015.

The party won two minority governments after the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], and a majority government in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]] before being defeated in the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 federal election]] by a majority Liberal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/elections/2006-results.html|title=Canadian Past Election Results|work=Canadian elections}}</ref>

[[John Lynch-Staunton]] served as interim leader of the newly created Conservative Party of Canada from 8 December 2003 until 20 March 2004, when the party [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004|elected]] Stephen Harper as its first leader.

On 19 January 2016, the party announced that a permanent leader will be chosen on 27 May 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2016/01/19/next-conservative-party-leader-will-be-chosen-may-27-2017-party-says-2/#.Vp6stPkrIgt |title=ext Conservative party leader will be chosen May 27, 2017, party says |author=The Canadian Press; no by-line.--> |date=19 January 2016 |website=National Newswatch |publisher=National Newswatch Inc. |access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref>

===National Council===
The National Council is the party's national governing body that is elected by the Conservative Party membership at its bi-annual meetings.  A National Councillor is elected for a two-year term and cannot serve for more than three consecutive terms.<ref name="conservative.ca">http://www.conservative.ca/?page_id=37</ref>

Composition of the National Council is based on the following criteria:
* four members from a province with more than 100 seats in the House of Commons
* three members from a province with 52–100 seats
* two from any province with 26–50 seats
* one member from each province with 4–25 seats
* one member from each territory
* the Party leader
* The Chair of the Conservative Fund Canada (in a non-voting role)
* the Executive Director (also in a non-voting role).<ref>http://www.conservative.ca/media/2012/06/Sept2011-Constitution-E.pdf</ref>

At present, the National Council has four members from Ontario; two each from Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec; one each from the remaining provinces and territories for a total of 19 members,<ref name="conservative.ca"/> plus the party leader and the two non-voting members for a total 22 members.

===President===
The party president is elected by National Council following their election. Since 2016, the President of the Conservative Party has been Scott Lamb, a councillor representing British Columbia. The party President is the conduit between the Party Leader and the National Council.

====Party presidents====
*[[Don Plett]] (2003-2009) ''interim until 2005''
*[[John Walsh (Canadian politician)|John Walsh]] (2009–2016)
*Scott Lamb (2016-present)

===Executive Director===
The Executive Director answers to the party President, and is responsible for the day-to-day management and operations of the party.

From February 2009 to October 2013, the Executive Director was [[Dan Hilton]].

From October to December 2013, the Acting Executive Director was Dave Forestell.

[[Dimitri Soudas]] was named the new Executive Director in December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/07/harper-loyalist-dimitri-soudas-named-executive-director-of-conservative-party-of-canada/ |title=Harper loyalist Dimitri Soudas named executive director of Conservative Party of Canada &#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  On 30 March 2014, Soudas was told to resign or be fired from the position after allegedly interfering with the nomination contest taking place in his fiancee's riding.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/dimitri-soudas-fired-as-conservative-party-executive-director-1.2592198 |title=Dimitri Soudas fired as Conservative Party executive director - Politics - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>

On 30 March 2014, [[Simon Thompson (politician)|Simon Thompson]] was named as interim Executive Director.  Thompson was previously the party's Chief Information Officer.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In July 2014, Dustin Van Vugt was brought in as the Deputy Executive Director&nbsp;– a position created specifically for him.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservatives-turn-to-dustin-van-vugt-to-replace-dimitri-soudas-1.2695409</ref>  Some media agencies, such as the CBC, suggested that this was a way for Thompson to begin handing over the work for the top job to Van Vugt, until his promotion to Executive Director could be formally ratified by the party's National Council. In October 2014, Van Vugt's position was unanimously ratified by the party's National Council, and Thompson became the Chief Operations Officer.<ref>http://www.conservative.ca/media/2014/10/october-nc-report.pdf</ref>

===Director of Political Operations===
The Director of Political Operations reports to the Executive Director, and is one of the most important positions within the party.  The person filling this role often has direct access to the party leader, due to their responsibilities for organizing the party's work on the ground and in preparing for the next election. With [[Stephen Harper]] as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader, the Director of Political Operations has frequently moved from party positions to the Prime Minister's and other Minister's Offices, and then back to the party's headquarters, depending on the identified needs.

[[Doug Finley]] was the Director of Political Operations until 2009, when Finley was appointed to the Senate and [[Jenni Byrne]], then Finley's Deputy, became the Director.

In August 2013, Byrne left the job to become the co-Deputy Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office. Fred DeLorey, then the party's Director of Communications, became the Director.

==Principles and policies==
{{About|the policies of the Conservative Party of Canada|policies of the Conservative Government|Conservatism in Canada|section=yes}}

===Constitution===
The Conservative Party is governed by a constitution.<ref>http://www.conservative.ca/media/documents/constitution-en.pdf</ref> The constitution may be amended through the same procedure as outlined for "Policy Development" below.

===Founding principles===
The "founding principles" of the Conservative Party appear in both the constitution and the policy declaration. They are the reasons that the Conservative Party was formed, and thus the only part of the constitution and policy declaration not up for possible amendment at a national convention.

===Policy development===
The policy declaration of the Conservative Party is a statement of which policies the Conservative Party membership would like its Leader to implement if and when they form government.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.conservative.ca/media/documents/Policy-Declaration-Feb-2014.pdf</ref>

Policies are directly decided by members attending a bi-annual national convention. The rules governing the passage of those policies are formally ratified by the National Council, and clarify rules such as speaking slots and voting requirements.<ref>http://www.conservative.ca/media/2013/05/Rules-for-Constitution-and-Policy-Discussions-Conservative-Party-of-Canada-2013-Convention.pdf</ref>

Policy proposals start with local [[riding association]]s, who form policy committees to discuss ideas. The riding association then puts their policies forward for discussion at a regional meeting, where they are discussed amongst a larger group of regionally based members. They are then submitted for discussion at a provincial meeting, where they are further discussed. The provincial meetings are the last level of discussions before they are placed on the agenda for the national convention’s agenda.

At the national convention, "breakout" discussion tables are formed. For example, a table may discuss several policies related to "foreign affairs" or "health care" policies. The individuals attending those breakout tables then return to their riding association delegates and encourage them to vote for the motion(s) discussed at the breakout table. During voting, individuals show their support or opposition to a proposal. If a majority agrees with the proposal, it is added to the policy declaration.

===Policy declaration===
The Conservative Party's policy declaration is divided into 23 pronouncements on policy:<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==History==

===Predecessors===
[[File:John A Macdonald (ca. 1875).jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Sir John A. Macdonald]], Prime Minister of Canada (1867–1873, 1878–1891), Canada's first Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal-Conservative Party, one of the party's predecessors.]]
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}

The Conservative Party is political heir to a series of right-of-centre parties that have existed in Canada, beginning with the [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] founded in 1854 by Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] and Sir [[George-Étienne Cartier]]. The party later became known simply as the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] after 1873. Like its historical predecessors and conservative parties in some other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] (such as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party of the United Kingdom]]), members of the present-day Conservative Party of Canada are sometimes referred to as "Tories". The modern Conservative Party of Canada is also legal heir to the heritage of the historical conservative parties by virtue of assuming the assets and liabilities of the former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] upon the merger of 2003.

[[File:Sir Robert Laird Borden, 1915.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Sir Robert Borden]], Prime Minister of Canada (1911–1920).]]
The first incarnations of the Conservative Party in Canada were quite different from the Conservative Party of today, especially on economic issues. The early Conservatives were known to espouse [[economic protectionism]] and [[British imperialism]], by emphasizing Canada's ties to the [[United Kingdom]] while vigorously opposing free trade with the [[United States]]; free trade being a policy which, at the time, had strong support from the ranks of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].<ref name="North America">{{cite web|last=Hoberg|first=George|title=Canada and North American S35 Integration|url=http://economics.ca/cgi/jab?journal=cpp&view=v26s2/CPPv26s2p035.pdf|publisher=Canadian Public Policy|accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> The Conservatives also sparred with the Liberal Party because of its connections with French Canadian nationalists including [[Henri Bourassa]] who wanted Canada to distance itself from Britain, and demanded that Canada recognize that it had two nations, [[English Canada]] and [[French Canada]], connected together through a common history. The Conservatives would go on with a popular slogan "one nation, one flag, one leader". {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

====Progressive Conservative Party of Canada====
The Conservative Party's popular support waned (particularly in western Canada) during difficult economic times from the 1920s to 1940s, as it was seen by many in the west as an eastern establishment party which ignored the needs of the citizens of [[Western Canada]]. Westerners of multiple political convictions including [[small c conservative|small-"c" conservatives]] saw the party as being uninterested in the economically unstable [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie]] regions of the west at the time and instead holding close ties with the business elite of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. As a result of western alienation both the dominant Conservative and Liberal parties were challenged in the west by the rise of a number of protest parties including the [[Progressive Party of Canada]], the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), the [[Reconstruction Party of Canada]] and the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]]. In 1921, the Conservatives were reduced to third place in number of seats in the House of Common behind the Progressives, though soon after, the Progressive Party folded. The former leader of the Progressive Party of Manitoba, [[John Bracken]] became leader of the Conservative Party in 1942 subject to several conditions, one of which was that the party be renamed the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:John G. Diefenbaker.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[John Diefenbaker]], Prime Minister of Canada (1957–1963).]]
Meanwhile, many former supporters of the Progressive Conservative Party shifted their support to either the federal CCF or to the federal Liberals. The advancement of the provincially popular western-based conservative Social Credit Party in federal politics was stalled, in part by the strategic selection of leaders from the west by the Progressive Conservative Party. PC leaders such as [[John Diefenbaker]] and [[Joe Clark]] were seen by many westerners as viable challengers to the Liberals who traditionally had relied on the electorate in Quebec and Ontario for their power base. While none of the various protest parties ever succeeded in gaining significant power federally, they were damaging to the Progressive Conservative Party throughout its history, and allowed the federal Liberals to win election after election with strong urban support bases in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. This historical tendency earned the Liberals the unofficial title often given by some political pundits of being Canada's "natural governing party". Prior to 1984, Canada was seen as having a [[dominant-party system]] led by the Liberal Party while Progressive Conservative governments therefore were considered by many of these pundits as [[caretaker government]]s, doomed to fall once the collective mood of the electorate shifted and the federal Liberal Party eventually came back to power.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:Mulroney 2011.JPG|thumb|150px|left|[[Brian Mulroney]], Prime Minister of Canada (1984–1993).]]
In 1984, the Progressive Conservative Party's electoral fortunes made a massive upturn under its new leader, [[Brian Mulroney]], an [[English language|anglophone]] [[Quebecer]] and former president of the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], who mustered a large coalition of westerners, aggravated over the [[National Energy Program]] of the Liberal government, suburban and small-town Ontarians, and soft [[Quebec nationalists]], who were angered over Quebec not having distinct status in the [[Constitution of Canada]] signed in 1982.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wooing nationalists is a risky courtship|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=7ae0209d-dfbf-4725-ad70-7175308efc93|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=9 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gunter|first=Lorne|title=Shipbuilding contract is an iceberg waiting to be hit|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/10/19/ship-building-contract-is-an-iceberg-waiting-to-be-hit/|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=The National Post|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> This led to a huge landslide victory for the Progressive Conservative Party. Progressive Conservatives abandoned [[protectionism]] which the party had held strongly to in the past and which had aggravated westerners and businesses and fully espoused [[free trade]] with the United States and integrating Canada into a globalized economy. This was accomplished with the signing of the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) of 1989 and much of the key implementation process of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which added [[Mexico]] to the Canada-U.S. free trade zone.<ref name="North America"/>

====Reform Party of Canada====
In the late 1980s and 1990s, federal conservative politics became split by the creation of a new western-based protest party, the populist and social conservative [[Reform Party of Canada]] created by [[Preston Manning]], son of [[Alberta]] Social Credit Premier [[Ernest Manning]]. It advocated deep [[decentralization]] of government power, abolition of [[official bilingualism]] and [[multiculturalism]], democratization of the [[Canadian Senate]], and suggested a potential return to [[capital punishment]], and advocated significant privatization of public services. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Westerners reportedly felt betrayed by the federal Progressive Conservative Party (PC), seeing it as catering to Quebec and urban Ontario interests over theirs. In 1989, Reform made headlines in the political scene when its first MP, [[Deborah Grey]], was elected in a [[by-election]] in Alberta, which was a shock to the PCs which had almost complete electoral dominance over the province for years. Another defining event for western conservatives was when Mulroney accepted the results of an unofficial Senate "election" held in Alberta, which resulted in the appointment of a Reformer, [[Stanley Waters]], to the Senate. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:Preston Manning in 2004.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Preston Manning]], Reform party founder and leader from 1987 to 2000.]]

By the 1990s, Mulroney had failed to bring about Senate reform as he had promised (appointing a number of Senators in 1990). As well, social conservatives were dissatisfied with Mulroney's [[social progressivism]]. Canadians in general were furious with high unemployment, high debt and deficit, unpopular implementation of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) in 1991, and the failed constitutional reforms of the [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord|Charlottetown]] accords. In 1993, support for the Progressive Conservative Party collapsed, and the party's representation in the House of Commons dropped from an absolute majority of seats to only two seats. The 1993 results were the worst electoral disaster in Canadian history, and the Progressive Conservatives never fully recovered. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 1993, federal politics became divided regionally. The Liberal Party took [[Ontario]], the [[Maritimes]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]], the separatist [[Bloc Québécois]] took [[Quebec]], while the Reform Party took [[Western Canada]] and became the dominant conservative party in Canada. The problem of the split on the right was accentuated by Canada's [[single member plurality]] electoral system, which resulted in numerous seats being won by the Liberal Party, even when the total number of votes cast for PC and Reform Party candidates was substantially in excess of the total number of votes cast for the Liberal candidate. However, this was and remains a constant issue on the political left as well for the Liberals and NDP. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Merger===

====Merger agreement====
In 2003, the [[Canadian Alliance]] (formerly the Reform Party) and Progressive Conservative parties agreed to merge into the present-day Conservative Party, with the Alliance faction conceding its populist ideals and some social conservative elements.

On 15 October 2003, after closed-door meetings were held by the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative Party, [[Stephen Harper]] (then the leader of the Canadian Alliance) and [[Peter MacKay]] (then the leader of the Progressive Conservatives) announced the "'Conservative Party Agreement-in-Principle", thereby merging their parties to create the new Conservative Party of Canada. After several months of talks between two teams of "emissaries", consisting of [[Don Mazankowski]], [[Bill Davis]] and [[Loyola Hearn]] on behalf of the PCs and [[Ray Speaker]] Senator [[Gerry St. Germain]] and [[Scott Reid (politician)|Scott Reid]] on behalf of the Alliance, the deal came to be.

On 5 December 2003 the Agreement-in-Principle was ratified by the membership of the Alliance by a margin of 96% to 4% in a national referendum conducted by postal ballot. On 6 December, the PC Party held a series of regional conventions, at which delegates ratified the Agreement-in-Principle by a margin of 90% to 10%. On 7 December, the new party was officially registered with [[Elections Canada]]. On 20 March 2004 Harper was [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004|elected leader]].

====Opposition to the merger/defections====
The merger process was opposed by some elements in both parties. In the PCs in particular, the merger process resulted in organized opposition, and in a substantial number of prominent members refusing to join the new party. The opponents of the merger were not internally united as a single internal opposition movement, and they did not announce their opposition at the same moment. [[David Orchard]] argued that his written agreement with [[Peter MacKay]], which had been signed a few months earlier at the [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2003|2003 Progressive Conservative Leadership convention]], excluded any such merger. Orchard announced his opposition to the merger before negotiations with the Canadian Alliance had been completed. The basis of Orchard's crucial support for MacKay's leadership bid was MacKay's promise in writing to Orchard not merge the Alliance and PC parties. MacKay was roundly criticized for openly lying about an existential question for the PC party. Over the course of the following year, Orchard led an unsuccessful legal challenge to the merger of the two parties. MacKay's promise to not merge the Alliance and PC's was not enforceable in court, though it would have if one dollar exchanged hands as payment for consideration.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In October and November, during the course of the PC party's process of ratifying the merger, four sitting Progressive Conservative MPs — [[André Bachand (Progressive Conservative MP)|André Bachand]], [[John Herron (New Brunswick politician)|John Herron]], former [[Tory]] leadership candidate [[Scott Brison]], and former Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]] — announced their intention not to join the new Conservative Party caucus, as did retiring PC Party president [[Bruck Easton]]. Clark and Brison argued that the party's merger with the Canadian Alliance drove it too far to the right, and away from its historical position in Canadian politics.

On 14 January 2004 former Alliance leadership candidate [[Keith Martin (politician)|Keith Martin]], left the party, and sat temporarily as an independent. He was reelected, running as a Liberal, in the 2004 election, and again in 2006 and 2008.

In the early months following the merger, MP [[Rick Borotsik]], who had been elected as Manitoba's only PC, became openly critical of the new party's leadership. Borotsik chose not to run in the 2004 general election.   Brison, at first, voted for and supported the ratification of the Alliance-PC merger, then crossed the floor to the Liberals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2003/12/10/brison_031210.html|title=MacKay slams Brison for joining the Liberals|publisher=CBC.ca|date=10 December 2003|accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Soon afterward, he was made a parliamentary secretary in [[Paul Martin]]'s Liberal government. Herron also ran as a Liberal candidate in the election, but did not join the Liberal caucus prior to the election. He lost his seat to the new Conservative Party's candidate [[Rob Moore (politician)|Rob Moore]]. Bachand and Clark sat as independent Progressive Conservatives until an election was called in the spring of 2004, and then retired from Parliament.

Three [[Canadian Senate|senators]], [[C. William Doody|William Doody]], [[Norman K. Atkins|Norman Atkins]], and [[Lowell Murray]], declined to join the new party and continued to sit in the upper house as a [[rump party|rump]] caucus of Progressive Conservatives.  In February 2005, Liberals appointed two anti-merger  Progressive Conservatives, [[Nancy Ruth]] and [[Elaine McCoy]], to the Senate.  In March 2006,  Ruth joined the new Conservative Party.

Finally, following the 2004 federal election, Conservative Senator [[Jean-Claude Rivest]] left the party to sit as an independent (choosing not to join Senators Doody, Atkins and Murray in their rump Progressive Conservative caucus). Senator Rivest cited, as his reason for this action, his concern that the new party was too right-wing and  that it was insensitive to the needs and interests of Quebec. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Leadership election, 2004===
{{main|Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004}}

In the immediate aftermath of the merger announcement, some Conservative activists hoped to recruit former Ontario Premier [[Mike Harris]] for the leadership. Harris declined the invitation, as did [[New Brunswick]] Premier [[Bernard Lord]] and [[Alberta]] Premier [[Ralph Klein]]. Outgoing Progressive Conservative leader [[Peter MacKay]] also announced he would not seek the leadership, as did former [[Democratic Representative Caucus]] leader [[Chuck Strahl]]. [[Jim Prentice]], who had been a candidate in the [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2003|2003 PC leadership contest]], entered the Conservative leadership race in mid-December but dropped out in mid-January because of an inability to raise funds so soon after his earlier leadership bid.

In the end, there were three candidates in the party’s [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004|first leadership election]]: former [[Canadian Alliance]] leader [[Stephen Harper]], former [[Magna International]] CEO [[Belinda Stronach]], and former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Ontario provincial PC]] Cabinet minister [[Tony Clement]]. Voting took place on 20 March 2004. A total of 97,397 ballots were cast.<ref>Tom Flanagan, ''Harper’s Team''. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2007, pg. 131</ref> Harper won on the first ballot with a commanding 68.9% of the vote (67,143 votes). Stronach received 22.9% (22,286 votes), and Clement received 8.2% (7,968 votes).<ref>Tom Flanagan, ''Harper's Team''. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2007, pg. 133</ref>

The vote was conducted using a weighted voting system in which all of Canada’s 308 [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] were given 100 points, regardless of the number of votes cast by party members in that riding (for a total of 30,800 points, with 15,401 points required to win). Each candidate would be awarded a number of points equivalent to the percentage of the votes they had won in that riding. For example, a candidate winning 50 votes in a riding in which the total number of votes cast was 100 would receive 50 points. A candidate would also receive 50 points for winning 500 votes in a riding where 1,000 votes were cast. In practice, there were wide differences in the number of votes cast in each riding across the country. More than 1,000 voters participated in each of the fifteen ridings with the highest voter turnout. By contrast, only eight votes were cast in each of the two ridings with the lowest levels of participation.)<ref name="Tom Flanagan 2007, p. 135">Tom Flanagan, ''Harper's Team''. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2007, pg. 135</ref> As a result, individual votes in the ridings where the greatest numbers of votes were cast were worth less than one percent as much as votes from the ridings where the fewest votes were cast.<ref name="Tom Flanagan 2007, p. 135"/>

The equal-weighting system gave Stronach a substantial advantage, because of the fact that her support was strongest in the parts of the country where the party had the fewest members, while Harper tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in ridings with larger membership numbers. Thus, the official count, which was based on points rather than on votes, gave her a much better result. Of 30,800 available points, Harper won 17,296, or 56.2%. Stronach won 10,613 points, or 34.5%. Clement won 2,887 points, or 9.4%.

The actual vote totals remained confidential when the leadership election results were announced; only the point totals were made public at the time, giving the impression of a race that was much closer than was actually the case. Three years later, Harper’s former campaign manager, [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Tom Flanagan]], published the actual vote totals, noting that, among other distortions caused by the equal-weighting system, "a vote cast in Quebec was worth 19.6 times as much as a vote cast in Alberta".<ref>Tom Flanagan, ''Harper’s Team''. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2007, pg. 134</ref>

===2004 general election===
{{See also|Conservative Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election}}

Two months after Harper's election as national Tory leader, [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader and Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] called a [[Canadian federal election, 2004|general election]] for 28 June 2004.

For the first time since the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], a Liberal government would have to deal with an opposition party that was generally seen as being able to form government. The Liberals attempted to counter this with an early election call, as this would give the Conservatives less time to consolidate their merger. During the first half of the campaign, polls showed a rise in support for the new party, leading some pollsters to predict the election of a [[minority government|minority]] Conservative government. An unpopular provincial budget by Ontario Liberal Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] hurt the federal Liberals in Ontario. The Liberals managed to narrow the gap and eventually regain momentum by targeting the Conservatives' credibility and motives, hurting their efforts to present a reasonable, responsible and moderate alternative to the governing Liberals. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Several controversial comments were made by Conservative MPs during the campaign. Early on in the campaign, Ontario MP [[Scott Reid (politician)|Scott Reid]] indicated his feelings as Tory language critic that the policy of [[official bilingualism]] was unrealistic and needed to be reformed. Alberta MP [[Rob Merrifield]] suggested as Tory health critic that women ought to have mandatory family counseling before they choose to have an abortion. BC MP [[Randy White (politician)|Randy White]] indicated his willingness near the end of the campaign to use the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] of the [[Canadian Constitution]] to override the Charter of Rights on the issue of [[same-sex marriage]], and [[Cheryl Gallant]], another Ontario MP, compared abortion to terrorism. The party was also criticized for issuing (quickly retracted) press releases accusing both Paul Martin and [[Jack Layton]] of supporting [[child pornography]].

Harper's new Conservatives emerged from the election with a larger parliamentary [[caucus]] of 99 MPs while the Liberals were reduced to a minority government of 135 MPs, twenty short of a majority.

===Founding convention: Montreal, March 2005===
In 2005, some political analysts such as former Progressive Conservative pollster [[Allan Gregg]] and ''[[Toronto Star]]'' columnist [[Chantal Hébert]] suggested that the then-subsequent election could result in a Conservative government if the public were to perceive the Tories as emerging from the party's founding convention (then scheduled for March 2005 in Montreal) with clearly defined, moderate policies with which to challenge the Liberals. The convention provided the public with an opportunity to see the Conservative Party in a new light, appearing to have reduced the focus on its controversial social conservative agenda. It retained its populist appeal by espousing tax cuts, smaller government, and more decentralization by giving the provinces more taxing powers and decision-making authority in joint federal-provincial programs. The party's law and order package was an effort to address rising homicide rates, which had gone up 12% in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/050721/d050721a.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080831051213/http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/050721/d050721a.htm|archivedate=31 August 2008 |title=Statistics Canada re spike in homicides |publisher=Statcan.ca |date=21 July 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}</ref>

===2006 general election===
On 17 May 2005 MP [[Belinda Stronach]] unexpectedly [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] from the Conservative Party to join the Liberal Party. In late August and early September 2005, the Tories released ads through Ontario's major television broadcasters that highlighted their policies towards health care, education and child support. The ads each featured Stephen Harper discussing policy with prominent members of his [[Shadow Cabinet]]. Some analysts suggested at the time that the Tories would use similar ads in the expected [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], instead of focusing their attacks on allegations of corruption in the Liberal government as they did earlier on.

An Ipsos-Reid Poll conducted after the fallout from the first report of the [[Gomery Commission]] on the sponsorship scandal showed the Tories practically tied for public support with the governing Liberal Party,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=2857|title=Grits Thrashed in Wake of Gomery Report|publisher=Ipsos-na.com|date=4 November 2005|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> and a poll from the Strategic Counsel suggested that the Conservatives were actually in the lead. However, polling two days later showed the Liberals had regained an 8-point lead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionalmanac.com/canada/polls.php|title=Canada Federal Election 2010 - Public Opinion Polls - National - Election Almanac|publisher=Electionalmanac.com|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> On 24 November 2005 [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Opposition leader]] [[Stephen Harper]] introduced a [[motion of no confidence]] which was passed on 28 November 2005. With the confirmed backing of the other two opposition parties, this resulted in an election on 23 January 2006 following a campaign spanning the Christmas season.

The Conservatives started off the first month of the campaign by making a series of policy-per-day announcements, which included a [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] reduction and a child-care allowance. This strategy was a surprise to many in the news media, as they believed the party would focus on the [[sponsorship scandal]]; instead, the Conservative strategy was to let that issue ruminate with voters. The Liberals opted to hold their major announcements after the Christmas holidays; as a result, Harper dominated media coverage for the first few weeks of the campaign and was able "to define himself, rather than to let the Liberals define him". The Conservatives' announcements played to Harper's strengths as a policy wonk,<ref name="archive1">{{cite web|url=http://andrewcoyne.com/Essays/Newspapers/Campaign_strategies.html|title=andrewcoyne.com|publisher=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2010-04-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061116022016/http://andrewcoyne.com/Essays/Newspapers/Campaign_strategies.html|archivedate=16 November 2006}}</ref> as opposed to the 2004 election and summer 2005 where he tried to overcome the perception that he was cool and aloof. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal approval numbers, which had always trailed his party's significantly, began to rise relatively rapidly.

On 27 December 2005 the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] announced it was investigating Liberal [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Finance Minister]] [[Ralph Goodale]]'s office for potentially engaging in [[insider trading]] before making an important announcement on the taxation of [[income trust]]s. The revelation of the criminal investigation and Goodale's refusal to step aside dominated news coverage for the following week, and it gained further attention when the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] announced they would also launch a probe. The income trust scandal distracted public attention from the Liberals' key policy announcements and allowed the Conservatives to refocus on their previous attacks on corruption within the Liberal party. The Tories were leading in the polls by early January 2006, and made a major breakthrough in Quebec where they displaced the Liberals as the second place party (after the Bloc Québécois). {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In response to the growing Conservative lead, the Liberals launched negative ads suggesting that Harper had a "hidden agenda", similar to the attacks made in the 2004 election. The Liberal ads did not have the same effect this time as the Conservatives had much more momentum, at one stage holding a ten-point lead. Harper's personal numbers continued to rise and polls found he was considered not only more trustworthy, but also a better potential Prime Minister than Paul Martin. In addition to the Conservatives being more disciplined, [[Newspaper endorsements in the Canadian federal election, 2006|media coverage of the Conservatives]] was also more positive than in 2004. By contrast, the Liberals found themselves increasingly criticized for running a poor campaign and making numerous gaffes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On 23 January 2006 the Conservatives won 124 seats, compared to 103 for the Liberals. The results made the Conservatives the largest party in the 308-member House of Commons, enabling them to form a minority government. On 6 February, Harper was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada, along with his [[Cabinet of Canada#Current Cabinet|Cabinet]].

===2008 general election===
On 7 September 2008 Stephen Harper asked the Governor General of Canada to dissolve parliament. The [[Canadian federal election, 2008|election took place on 14 October]]. The Conservative Party returned to government with 143 seats, up from the 127 seats they held at dissolution, but short of the 155 necessary for a majority government. This was the third minority parliament in a row, and the second for Harper. The Conservative Party pitched the election as a choice between Harper and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]' [[Stéphane Dion]], whom they portrayed as a weak and ineffective leader. The election, however, was rocked midway through by the emerging global financial crisis and this became the central issue through to the end of the campaign. Harper has been criticised for appearing unresponsive and unsympathetic to the uncertainty Canadians were feeling during the period of financial turmoil, but he countered that the Conservatives were the best party to navigate Canada through the financial crisis, and portrayed the Liberal "Green Shift" plan as reckless and detrimental to Canada's economic well-being. The Conservative Party released its platform on 7 October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/realitycheck/2008/10/the_conservative_platform.html|title=Canada Votes – Reality Check – The Conservative platform|publisher=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2010-04-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130307231204/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/realitycheck/2008/10/the_conservative_platform.html|archivedate=7 March 2013}}</ref> The platform states that it will re-introduce a bill similar to [[Bill C-61 (39th Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)|C-61]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/10/07/tech-conservatives.html|title=CBC News – Technology & Science – Conservatives pledge to reintroduce copyright reform|publisher=CBC.ca|date=7 October 2008|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>

====Policy convention: Winnipeg, November 2008====
The party’s second convention was held in Winnipeg in November 2008. This was the party's first convention since taking power in 2006, and media coverage concentrated on the fact that this time, the convention was not very policy-oriented, and showed the party to be becoming an establishment party. However, the results of voting at the convention reveal that the party’s populist side still had some life. A resolution that would have allowed the party president a director of the party’s fund was defeated because it also permitted the twelve directors of the fund to become unelected ''ex officio'' delegates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.macleans.ca/tag/cpc-conventionwatch-2008|title=Convention Watch: 2008|publisher=Blog.macleans.ca|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Some controversial policy resolutions were debated, including one to encourage provinces to utilize "both the public and private health sectors", but most of these were defeated.

==Regional conservative parties==
{{Main|Conservative parties in Canada}}
The Conservative Party, while having no provincial wings, largely works with the former federal Progressive Conservative Party's provincial affiliates. There have been calls to change the names of the provincial parties from "Progressive Conservative" to "Conservative". However, there are other small "c" conservative parties with which the federal Conservative Party has close ties, such as the [[Saskatchewan Party]] and the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] (not associated with the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada]]). The federal Conservative Party has the support of many of the provincial Conservative leaders. In Ontario, successive provincial PC Party leaders [[John Tory]], [[Bob Runciman]] and [[Tim Hudak]] have expressed open support for Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party of Canada, while former [[Mike Harris]] cabinet members [[Tony Clement]], and [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] were ministers in Harper's government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In Quebec, businessman [[Adrien D. Pouliot]] leads a new [[Conservative Party of Quebec (2009–present)|Conservative Party of Quebec]] which was formed in 2009 in the wake of the decline of the [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) which had carried the support of many provincial conservatives.

Cross-support between federal and provincial Conservatives is more tenuous in some other provinces. In Alberta, relations became strained between the federal Conservative Party and the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]]. Part of the federal Tories' loss in the 2004 election was often blamed on then Premier Klein's public musings on health care late in the campaign. Klein had also called for a [[referendum]] on [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]]. With the impending 2006 election, Klein predicted another Liberal minority, though this time the federal Conservatives won a minority government. Klein's successor [[Ed Stelmach]] tried to avoid causing similar controversies; however, Harper's surprise pledge to restrict [[bitumen]] exports drew a sharp rebuke from the Albertan government, who warned such restrictions would violate both the [[Constitution of Canada]] and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. The rise of the [[Wildrose Party]] in Alberta has caused a further rift between the federal Conservatives and the Albertan PCs, as some Conservative backbench MPs endorse Wildrose.  For the [[Alberta general election, 2012|2012 Alberta election]], Prime Minister Harper remained neutral and instructed federal cabinet members to also remain neutral while allowing Conservative backbenchers to back whomever they chose if they wish. Wildrose candidates for the concurrent [[Alberta Senate nominee election, 2012|Senate nominee election]] announced they would sit in the Conservative caucus should they be appointed to the Senate.

After the 2007 budget was announced, the Progressive Conservative governments in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland & Labrador accused the federal Conservatives of breaching the terms of the [[Atlantic Accord]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

As a result, relations worsened between the two provincial governments, leading Newfoundland & Labrador Premier [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]] to denounce the federal Conservatives, which gave rise to his ABC ([[Anything But Conservative]]) campaign in the 2008 election.
