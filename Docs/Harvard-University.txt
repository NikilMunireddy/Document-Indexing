===Colonial===
[[File:A Westerly View of the Colledges in Cambridge New England by Paul Revere.jpeg|thumb|Engraving of [[Harvard College]] by [[Paul Revere]], 1767]]
Harvard was formed in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].
It was initially called "New College" or "the college at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|New Towne]]". In 1638, the college became home for North America's first known printing press, carried by the ship ''[[John of London (ship)|John of London]]''.<ref name="FirstPrintingPress">{{cite web|title=The instrument behind New England’s first literary flowering|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/harvard’s-first-impressions/|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref><ref name="UHullMHSC">{{cite web |title=Rowley and Ezekiel Rogers, The First North American Printing Press|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/mhsc/FarHorizons/Documents/EzekielRogers.pdf|publisher=Maritime Historical Studies Centre, University of Hull|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> In 1639, the college was renamed ''[[Harvard College]]'' after deceased clergyman [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], who was an alumnus of the [[University of Cambridge]]. He had left the school [[Pound sign|£]]779 and his library of some 400 books.<ref name="JH facts">{{cite web|title=John Harvard Facts, Information. |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/John_Harvard.aspx|publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2009|quote=He bequeathed £780 (half his estate) and his library of 320 volumes to the new established college at Cambridge, Mass., which was named in his honor.}}</ref>
The charter creating the [[Harvard Corporation]] was granted in 1650.

In the early years the College trained many Puritan ministers.<ref name="GriggMancall2008">{{cite book|last1=Grigg|first1=John A.|last2=Mancall|first2=Peter C.|title=British Colonial America: People and Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6REfahE4TkwC&pg=PA47|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-025-4|page=47}}</ref> (A 1643 publication said the school's purpose was "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust".)<ref>{{cite book|first=Louis B. |last=Wright|title=The Cultural Life of the American Colonies|year=2002|page=116|isbn=978-0-486-42223-7}}</ref>
It offered a classic curriculum on the English university model{{mdashb}}many leaders in the colony had attended the [[University of Cambridge]]{{mdashb}}but conformed [[Puritanism]]. It was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches.<ref>{{cite web|author=Harvard Office of News and Public Affairs |url=http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/intro/index.html|title=Harvard guide intro|publisher=Harvard University|date=July 26, 2007|accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726133429/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/intro/index.html|archivedate=July 26, 2007}}</ref>

The leading Boston divine [[Increase Mather]] served as president from 1685 to 1701. In 1708, [[John Leverett the Younger|John Leverett]] became the first president who was not also a clergyman, which marked a turning of the college toward intellectual independence from Puritanism.

Throughout the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among [[Congregationalist#United States|Congregationalist]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.<ref name=Dorrien>Gary J.

[[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] was elected to the chair in 1805, and the liberal [[Samuel Webber]] was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, [[Arminianism|Arminian]] ideas (defined by traditionalists as [[Unitarian-Universalism|Unitarian]] ideas).<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4–5}}<ref>Peter S.

In 1846, the natural history lectures of [[Louis Agassiz]] were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' "participation in the Divine Nature" and the possibility of understanding "intellectual existences". Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the "divine plan" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of [[Common Sense Realism]] derived from Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Dugald Stewart]], whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to "soar with Plato" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by [[Ralph Cudworth]], [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] and, in a Romantic vein, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the "official philosophy" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David K.|last=Nartonis|title=Louis Agassiz and the Platonist Story of Creation at Harvard, 1795–1846|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2005|volume=66|issue=3|pages=437–449|jstor=3654189|doi=10.1353/jhi.2005.0045}}</ref>

[[Charles W. Eliot]], president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] convictions. Derived from [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stephen P.|last=Shoemaker|title=The Theological Roots of Charles W.

[[File:Harvard square harvard yard.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Harvard Yard]] as seen from [[Holyoke Center]]]]
During the 20th century, Harvard's international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Rapid enrollment growth continued as new graduate schools were begun and the undergraduate College expanded. [[Radcliffe College]], established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. Harvard became a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1900.<ref name="AAU"/>

In the early 20th century, the student body was predominately "old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians"—a group later called "WASPs" ([[White Anglo-Saxon Protestants]]).  By the 1970s it was much more diversified.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerome Karabel|title=The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwf-Ofc--toC&pg=PA23|year=2006|page=23}}</ref>

[[James Bryant Conant]] (president, 1933–1953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting ''Report'', published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.<ref>Anita Fay Kravitz, "The Harvard Report of 1945: An historical ethnography", Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 1994, 367 pages; AAT 9427558</ref>

In 1945–1960 admissions policies were opened up to bring in students from a more diverse applicant pool. No longer drawing mostly from rich alumni of select New England [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the undergraduate college was now open to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but few blacks, Hispanics or Asians.<ref>Malka A. Older. (1996). [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=217911 Preparatory schools and the admissions process]. [[The Harvard Crimson]], January 24, 1996</ref>

Harvard graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century, and
during World War II, students at [[Radcliffe College]] (which since 1879 had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women students) began attending Harvard classes alongside men,<ref>{{cite book|first=Sally|last=Schwager|chapter=Taking up the Challenge: The Origins of Radcliffe|title=Yards and Gates: Gender in Harvard and Radcliffe History|editor=Laurel Thatcher Ulrich (ed.)|location=New York|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2004|isbn=1-4039-6098-4|page=115}}</ref> The first class of women was admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1945.<ref name="First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945">{{cite report |title=First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945 |publisher=Countway Repository, Harvard University Library |url=http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782 |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}</ref>
Since the 1970s Harvard has been responsible for essentially all aspects of admission, instruction, and undergraduate life for women, and Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard in 1999.<ref>{{cite report |title=Radcliffe Enters Historic Merger With Harvard |publisher= |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/21/radcliffe-enters-historic-merger-with-harvard |accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref>

Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve [[Harvard House system|residential Houses]], nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the [[Charles River]]. The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Quadrangle]] (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed [[Radcliffe College]] students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall and library. The facilities were made possible by a gift from [[Yale University]] alumnus [[Edward Harkness]].<ref>[http://www.exeter.edu./documents/Exeter_Bulletin/FA06_Men_Behind_the_Plan.pdf Biography] in the [http://www.exeter.edu/news_and_events/news_events_2086.aspx Exeter Bulletin] {{wayback|url=http://www.exeter.edu./documents/Exeter_Bulletin/FA06_Men_Behind_the_Plan.pdf |date=20080626162608 }}</ref>

Between 2011 and 2013, Harvard University reported crime statistics for its main Cambridge campus that included 104 forcible sex offenses, 55 robberies, 83 aggravated assaults, 89 burglaries, and 43 cases of motor vehicle theft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hupd.harvard.edu/files/hupd/files/playing_it_safe_2014-15_crime_stats_cambridge_0.pdf|title=Appendix 1 — Cambridge Campus Clery Act Criminal Statistics|publisher=[[Harvard University Police Department]]|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref>

===Satellite facilities===
Apart from its major Cambridge/Allston and Longwood campuses, Harvard owns and operates
[[Arnold Arboretum]], in the [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]] area of Boston;
the [[Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection]], in [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Harvard Forest]] in [[Petersham, Massachusetts]]; the Concord Field Station in [[Estabrook Woods]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]]<ref>http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/cfs/</ref> and the [[Villa I Tatti]] research center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itatti.it/|title=Villa I Tatti: The Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies|publisher=Itatti.it|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> in [[Florence]], Italy. Harvard also operates the Harvard Shanghai Center in China.<ref>http://shanghaicenter.harvard.edu/</ref>

===Major campus expansion===
Harvard has purchased tracts of land in [[Allston, Boston, Massachusetts|Allston]], a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge, with the intent of major expansion southward.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allston.harvard.edu/|title=Harvard University Allston Initiative Home Page|publisher=Allston.harvard.edu|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge. Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a [[tram]]. Plans also call for sinking part of [[Storrow Drive]] (at Harvard's expense) for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the [[Charles River]], as well as the construction of bike paths, and buildings throughout the Allston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school, but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible.

One of the foremost driving forces for Harvard's pending expansion is its goal of increasing the scope and strength of its science and technology programs. The university plans to construct two 500,000 square foot (50,000 m²) research complexes in Allston, which would be home to several interdisciplinary programs, including the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and an enlarged [[Engineering]] department.

In addition, Harvard intends to relocate the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] and the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] to Allston. The university also plans to construct several new undergraduate and graduate student housing centers in Allston, and it is considering large-scale museums and performing arts complexes as well.

Joint programs with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] include the [[Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology]], the [[Broad Institute]], [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]], and [[edX]].

[[File:Bright Hockey Center, Harvard.JPG|thumb|The [[Cornell–Harvard hockey rivalry|Cornell–Harvard hockey rivalry match]], 2006]]
The [[Harvard Crimson]] competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Ivy League]]. Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with [[Yale University]] culminating in ''[[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|The Game]]'', although the [[Harvard–Yale Regatta]] predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale [[Track and Field]] teams come together to compete against a combined [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yale and Harvard Defeat Oxford/Cambridge Team|url=http://www.yalebulldogs.com/sports/w-track/recaps/041009aac.html|publisher=Yale University Athletics|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

Harvard's athletic rivalry with [[Yale Bulldogs|Yale]] is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual [[American football|football]] meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply "[[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|The Game]]". While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, [[Walter Camp]] (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html|title=History of American Football|publisher=Newsdial.com|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, pp. 127–128</ref>

Harvard has several athletic facilities, such as the [[Lavietes Pavilion]], a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the "MAC", serves both as the university's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports. The five-story building includes two cardio rooms, an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]], a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held, an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC offers personal trainers and specialty classes. It is home to Harvard volleyball, fencing and wrestling. The offices of several of the school's varsity coaches are also in the MAC.

[[Weld Boathouse]] and Newell Boathouse house the women's and men's rowing teams, respectively. The men's crew also uses the Red Top complex in Ledyard, Connecticut, as their training camp for the annual [[Harvard-Yale Regatta]]. The Bright Hockey Center hosts the Harvard hockey teams, and the Murr Center serves both as a home for Harvard's squash and tennis teams as well as a strength and conditioning center for all athletic sports.

{{As of|2013}}, there were 42 Division I intercollegiate [[varsity team|varsity]] sports teams for women and men at Harvard, more than at any other [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] college in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/fh/2012-13/releases/2012080853mnlh |title=Harvard : Women’s Rugby Becomes 42nd Varsity Sport at Harvard University |publisher=Gocrimson.com |date=August 9, 2012 |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer [[athletic scholarship]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/students/stu6.html|title=The Harvard Guide: Financial Aid at Harvard|publisher=Harvard University|date=September 2, 2006|accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902182731/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/students/stu6.html|archivedate=September 2, 2006}}</ref>

Older than ''The Game'' by 23 years, the Harvard-Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Today, Harvard fields top teams in several other sports, such as the [[Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey]] team (with a strong rivalry against [[Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey|Cornell]]), [[squash (sport)|squash]], and even recently won NCAA titles in Men's and Women's [[Fencing]]. Harvard also won the [[Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships]] in 2003.

Harvard's men's ice hockey team won the school's first NCAA Championship in any team sport in 1989. Harvard was also the first Ivy League institution to win a NCAA championship title in a women's sport when its women's lacrosse team won the NCAA Championship in 1990.

''[[Harvard Undergraduate Television]]'' has footage from historical games and athletic events including the 2005 pep-rally before the Harvard-Yale Game.

===Song===
Harvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are "[[Ten Thousand Men of Harvard]]" and "[[Harvardiana]]." While "[[Fair Harvard]]" is actually the [[alma mater (song)|alma mater]], "Ten Thousand Men" is better known outside the university. The [[Harvard University Band]] performs these fight songs, and other cheers, at football and hockey games. These were parodied by Harvard alumnus [[Tom Lehrer]] in his song "[[Fight Fiercely, Harvard]]," which he composed while an undergraduate.

==Literature and popular culture==

The perception of Harvard as a center of either elite achievement, or elitist privilege, has made it a frequent literary and cinematic backdrop.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} "In the grammar of film, Harvard has come to mean both tradition, and a certain amount of stuffiness," film critic Paul Sherman has said.<ref name="thomas">{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Sarah |title=‘Social Network’ taps other campuses for Harvard role |periodical=Boston.com |date=September 24, 2010 |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2010/09/harvard_at_the_movies_schools.html |quote=‘In the grammar of film, Harvard has come to mean both tradition, and a certain amount of stuffiness....
