The '''2008 Summer Olympic Games''', officially known as the '''Games of the XXIX Olympiad''' ({{zh|c=第二十九届夏季奥林匹克运动会|p=Dì Èrshíjiǔ Jiè Xiàjì Àolínpǐkè Yùndònghuì}}) and  commonly known as '''Beijing 2008''', was a major international [[multi-sport event]] that took place in [[Beijing, China]], from 8 to 24 August 2008.{{Ref label|A|a|a}} A total of 10,942 athletes from 204 [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) competed in 28 sports and 302 events (a total of one event more than the schedule of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]]). China became the [[List of Olympic Games host cities|22nd nation]] to host the [[Olympic Games]] and the 18th to hold a Summer Olympic Games. It was the third time that the [[Summer Olympic Games]] were held in [[East Asia]] and [[Asia]], after [[Tokyo]], Japan, in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and [[Seoul]], South Korea, in [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]].

The [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|equestrian]] events were held in [[Hong Kong]], making it the third time the events of the same Olympics were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs{{Ref label|B|b|b}}, while sailing was contested in [[Qingdao]], and [[association football|football]] events took place in several different cities.

Beijing [[2008 Summer Olympics bids|was awarded]] the Games over four competitors on July 13, 2001, having won a [[majority]] of votes from members of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) after two rounds of voting.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/sports/olympics-beijing-wins-bid-for-2008-olympic-games.html | work=New York Times | title=OLYMPICS; Beijing Wins Bid for 2008 Olympic Games | first=Jere | last=Longman | date=14 July 2001| accessdate= 4 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] promoted the Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transportation systems.

{{Main|Bids for the 2008 Summer Olympics}}
Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the [[List of IOC meetings|112th]] [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, [[Istanbul]], and [[Osaka]]. Prior to the session, five other cities ([[Bangkok]], [[Cairo]], [[Havana]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], and [[Seville]]) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a [[majority]] of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.<ref name="Election">{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/beijing/election_uk.asp |title = Beijing 2008: Election |publisher = [[International Olympic Committee]] |accessdate =18 December 2006| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20061205234608/http://olympic.org/uk/games/beijing/election_uk.asp| archivedate= December 5, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> Toronto's bid was their 5th failure since 1960 (failed bid for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 games).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/07/24/toronto-has-made-5-attempts-to-host-the-olympics-could-the-sixth-be-the-winner.html|title=Toronto has made 5 attempts to host the Olympics.

Members of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations who had received assistance from China in the construction of stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] to Sydney were all factors in the decision.<ref name="beijingchosen">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/sports/olympics-beijing-wins-bid-for-2008-olympic-games.html | title=OLYMPICS; Beijing Wins Bid for 2008 Olympic Games | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=14 July 2001 | accessdate=June 11, 2009 | last=Longman | first=Jere}}</ref> Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of [[2000 Summer Olympics bids|voting]] for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/sports/olympics-2000-olympics-go-to-sydney-in-surprise-setback-for-china.html | title=Olympics; 2000 Olympics Go to Sydney In Surprise Setback for China | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=24 September 1993 | accessdate=5 June 2009 | author=Riding, Alan}}</ref>

Human rights concerns expressed by [[Amnesty International]] and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, a number of IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.<ref name=beijingchosen/>

=== Costs ===
On 6 March 2009, the [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games]] reported that total spending on the games was "generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games", which was equivalent to about US$15&nbsp;billion. They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Surplus of Beijing Olympic Games exceeds 16 million USD|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90884/6608035.html|publisher=[[People's Daily Online]]|date=6 March 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref>  Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40&nbsp;billion to $44&nbsp;billion, which would make the Games "far and away the most expensive ever".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK25823820080805 | title=Beijing Games to be costliest, but no debt legacy | work=[[Reuters]] | date=August 5, 2008 | accessdate=5 June 2009 | author=Rabinovitch, Simon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.pravda.ru/sports/games/06-08-2008/106003-beijing_olympics-0/|title=Beijing Olympics to cost China 44 billion dollars|work=Pravda|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/jul/28/olympicgames2008.china1|title=The cost of the Beijing Olympics|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=July 28, 2008|accessdate=5 June 2009 }}</ref>

The 2008 Beijing Olympics caused traditional [[Hutong]] neighborhoods to be cleared for the construction of modern Olympic stadiums. In an effort to ensure success for the games, the government invested billions in building new infrastructure, although clearance to tiny, outdated neighborhoods in Beijing called hutongs resulted (Petrun). Jim Yardley, a New York Times reporter interviews Pan Jinyu, a 64-year-old local resident: "They [the government] don’t want foreigners to see this scarred old face". Feng Shuqin and her husband, Zheng Zhanlin have lived in their house for 50 years and the family has owned the property before the Communists took control in 1949. The government, trying to clear the area, has offered them to move with a compensatory sum of $175,000 USD, but the family insists the land is worth $1.4 million USD (Yardley). Michael Meyer, an American who lives in the hutongs reported that a total of 500,000 residents were relocated from their homes before the Olympics began (Meyer).

The program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games.  Nine new events were held, including two from the new [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|cycling]] discipline of [[BMX]]. Women competed in the 3000&nbsp;metre [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] for the first time.  [[Open water swimming]] events for men and women, over the distance of {{convert|10|km|mi}}, were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/08/10/2008-08-10_a_2008_summer_olympics_primer.html|title=A 2008 Summer Olympics primer|date=August 10, 2008|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> In [[fencing]], women's team foil and women's team sabre replaced men's team foil and women's team [[épée]].{{Ref label|D|d|d}} Two sports were open only to men, [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|baseball]] and [[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics|boxing]], while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, [[Softball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|softball]] and [[Synchronized swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|synchronized swimming]].

In addition to the official Olympic sports, the Beijing Organising Committee was given special dispensation by the IOC to run a [[wushu (sport)|wushu]] competition in parallel to the Games. The [[Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008]] saw 128 athletes from 43 countries participate, with medals awarded in 15 separate events; however, these were not to be added to the official medal tally since Wushu was not on the programme of the 2008 Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/preparation/n214506999.shtml|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20080808100337/http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/preparation/n214506999.shtml|archivedate=2008-08-08|title=Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008 to begin August 21|website=en.beijing2008.cn|accessdate=August 5, 2008}}</ref>

=== Closing ceremony ===
{{Main|2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony}}

The 2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony concluded the Beijing Games on August 24, 2008. It began at 8:00&nbsp;pm China Standard Time (UTC+8), and took place at the Beijing National Stadium.

The Ceremony included handover of the Games from Beijing to London. [[Guo Jinlong]], the [[Mayor of Beijing]] handed over the [[Olympic flag]] to the Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]], followed by a performance organized by the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games]] (LOCOG).  This presentation included performances by guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], and recording artist [[Leona Lewis]].  Footballer [[David Beckham]] was also featured during London's presentation.<ref>{{cite news |title=London Takes Over as Olympic Host|date=August 24, 2008|publisher=The BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7577999.stm|accessdate=January 10, 2009| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090112225853/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7577999.stm| archivedate= January 12, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref>

=== National participation changes ===
[[File:Flag of Chinese Taipei for Olympic games.svg|thumb|Flag of Chinese Taipei team.]]
Athletes from the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as [[Chinese Taipei]] (TPE) under the [[Chinese Taipei Olympic flag]] and using the [[National Banner Song]] as their official anthem. The participation of Taiwan was briefly in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next to the special administrative region of Hong Kong. A compromise on the naming was reached, and Taiwan was referred to during the games as "Chinese Taipei," rather than "China-Taipei," as the mainland China government had proposed. In addition, the [[Central African Republic at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Central African Republic]] was placed between Chinese Taipei and the Special Administrative Regions during the march of nations.<ref>{{cite news | last = Callick | first = Rowan | title = Taiwan clears Games hurdle |work=The Australian | date = August 4, 2008 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24123163-5013406,00.html | accessdate =June 15, 2009}}</ref>

South African swimmer [[Natalie du Toit]], whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified to compete at the Beijing Olympics.

Voting is conducted to determine the fourth event. In 2004, the three men's team events and the women's épée were held. Thus, in 2008, the women's foil and sabre events and men's épée were automatically selected.
