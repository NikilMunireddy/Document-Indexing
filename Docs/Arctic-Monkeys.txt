'''Arctic Monkeys''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2002 in [[High Green]], a suburb of [[Sheffield]]. The band consists of [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, lead guitar), [[Matt Helders]] (drums, vocals), [[Jamie Cook]] (lead guitar, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and [[Nick O'Malley]] (bass, backing vocals). Former band member [[Andy Nicholson]] (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.

They have released five studio albums: ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' (2006), ''[[Favourite Worst Nightmare]]'' (2007), ''[[Humbug (album)|Humbug]]'' (2009), ''[[Suck It and See]]'' (2011) and ''[[AM (Arctic Monkeys album)|AM]]'' (2013), as well as one live album, ''[[At the Apollo]]'' (2008). Their debut album is the fastest-selling album by a band in British chart history, and in 2013, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it the 30th-greatest debut album of all time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4660394.stm|title=Arctic Monkeys make chart history|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 January 2006|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-100-greatest-debut-albums-of-all-time-20130322/whatever-people-say-i-am-that-s-what-i-m-not-19691231|title=The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time. 30.

The band has won seven [[Brit Awards]]—winning both Best British Group and Best British Album three times, and have been nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.<ref>[http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/arctic-monkeys "BRITs Profile: Arctic Monkeys].

Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed.<ref name="The Question">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/oct/25/popandrock.arcticmonkeys|title=The question: Have the Arctic Monkeys changed the music business?|last=Laura|first=Barton|date=25 October 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=5 June 2006|location=London}}</ref>

The name ''Beneath the Boardwalk'' originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|Boardwalk]]. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that ''Beneath the Boardwalk'' was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this title. The group did not mind the distribution, saying "we never made those demos to make money or anything. We were giving them away free anyway – that was a better way for people to hear them."<ref name="Prefix1">{{cite web| last=Park | first=Dave | url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/arctic-monkeys/arent-fooling-around-part-1-of-2/12565/ | work=Prefix Magazine| title=Arctic Monkeys aren't fooling around (Part I)| date=21 November 2005 |accessdate=12 June 2006}}</ref> When asked about the popularity of the band's MySpace site in an interview with ''Prefix Magazine'', the band said that they were unaware what it was, and that the site had originally been created by their fans.<ref name="Prefix1" />

The band began to grow in popularity across the north of England,<ref name="M&C">{{cite news| last=Brandle | first=Lars | url=http://music.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1092341.php | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061114040456/http://music.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1092341.php | archivedate=14 November 2006 | publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]]| title=Fever rises for Arctic Monkeys| date=30 January 2006 | accessdate=8 June 2006}}</ref> receiving attention from [[BBC Radio]] and the British tabloid press. A local amateur photographer, Mark Bull, filmed the band's performances and made the music video "[[Fake Tales of San Francisco]]", releasing it on his website,<ref name="Prefix1" /> alongside the contents of ''Beneath the Boardwalk'' – a collection of the band's songs which he named after a local music venue. In May 2005, Arctic Monkeys released their first single, ''[[Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys]]'' on their own 'Bang Bang' label, featuring the songs "Fake Tales of San Francisco" and "From the Ritz to the Rubble". This release was limited to 500 CDs and 1,000 7" records, but was also available to download from the [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]]. Soon after, the band played at the Carling Stage of the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], reserved for less known or unsigned bands. Their appearance was hyped by much of the music press and the band was watched by an unusually large crowd.

Eventually, they were signed to [[Domino Records|Domino]] in June 2005. The band said they were attracted to the [[DIY ethic]] of Domino owner Laurence Bell, who ran the label from his flat and only signed bands that he liked personally.<ref>{{cite news| first=Alastair | last=McKay | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/record-labels-the-domino-effect-525404.html | work=[[The Independent]]| title=Record labels: The Domino effect| date=3 February 2006 | accessdate=5 June 2006 | location=London}}</ref> The UK's ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' reported that this was followed in October by a [[£]]1&nbsp;million publishing deal with [[EMI]] and a £725,000 contract with [[Epic Records]] for the United States.<ref>{{cite news| first=Scott | last=Colothan | url=http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?contentid=9106| publisher=[[Gigwise]]| title=Arctic Monkeys Sign £1million Publishing Deal| date=7 October 2005 | accessdate=19 October 2005}}</ref> Arctic Monkeys denied this on their website, dubbing the newspaper "The Daily Stir". However, Domino had licensed the Australian and New Zealand publishing rights to EMI and the Japanese rights to independent label Hostess.<ref name="M&C" /> Their first single with Domino, "[[I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor]]", which was recorded at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire, was released on 17 October 2005 and went straight to No.&nbsp;1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], beating [[Sugababes]] and [[Robbie Williams]]. Two weeks previous to this, it made its first appearance on the cover of ''[[NME]]''. Their second single, "[[When the Sun Goes Down (Arctic Monkeys song)|When the Sun Goes Down]]" (previously titled "Scummy"), released on 16 January 2006, also went straight to No.&nbsp;1 on the UK Singles Chart, selling 38,922 copies and taking over that position from [[Shayne Ward]]. The band's success with little marketing or advertising led some to suggest that it could signal a change in how new bands achieve recognition.<ref name="The Question" />

The band finished recording their debut album, ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'', at Chapel Studios in [[Lincolnshire]] in September 2005 with [[Jim Abbiss]] producing.

Arctic Monkeys wasted no time in recording new material, and released a five-track [[extended play|EP]] on 24 April 2006, titled ''[[Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?]]''. Due to its length, the EP was ineligible to chart as a UK single or album. Furthermore, the record's graphic language has resulted in significantly less radio airplay than previous records, although this was not a reported concern according to an insider – "since they made their name on the Internet... they don't care if they don't get radio play".<ref>{{cite news| first=Daniel | last=Kilkelly | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds30892.html | work=[[Digital Spy]]| title=Arctic Monkeys plan foul-mouthed EP| date=25 March 2006 | accessdate=25 March 2006}}</ref> The release of the EP ''Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?'' just three months after their record-breaking debut album has been criticised by some, who have seen it as "money-grabbing" and "cashing in on their success".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/22817 | work=[[NME]]| title=Arctic Monkeys defend EP release| date=18 April 2006 | accessdate=5 June 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060423011054/http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/22817| archivedate= 23 April 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The band countered that it regularly releases new music not to make money, but to avoid the "boredom" of "spending three years touring on one album".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=4408| work=[[San Diego CityBeat]]| title= Young Brains| date=31 May 2006| accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref>

Soon after the release of the EP in the UK, the band announced that Andy Nicholson would not take part in the band's forthcoming [[Arctic Monkeys tour history|North America tour]] due to fatigue from "an intensive period of touring".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/nme/23130 |work=[[NME]]|title= Arctic Monkeys lose a member|date=26 May 2006 |accessdate=5 June 2006}}</ref> On returning to the UK, Nicholson confirmed that he would leave Arctic Monkeys and start his own project. He also said that he couldn't deal with the band's fame and the success over the previous six months. In a statement on their official website, the band said: "We are sad to tell everyone that Andy is no longer with the band", also confirmed that Nick O'Malley – former bassist with The Dodgems who had drafted in as temporary bassist for the tour – would continue as bassist for the rest of their summer tour schedule.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Turner, Alex |author2=Cook, Jamie |author3=Helders, Matt | publisher=arcticmonkeys.com | url=http://www.arcticmonkeys.com | title=Andy Nicholson| date=19 June 2006 | accessdate=13 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060711035601/http://www.arcticmonkeys.com/| archivedate= 11 July 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Shortly after, Nick O'Malley was confirmed as the formal replacement for Nicholson.

Arctic Monkeys' first release without Nicholson, the single "[[Leave Before the Lights Come On]]", came on 14 August 2006. Turner said that the song was one of the last songs he wrote before their rise to fame, and suggested that "it feels very much like it could be on the album".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/23164| work=[[NME]]| title=Arctic Monkeys play gig in tiny pub| date=25 May 2006| accessdate=10 July 2006}}</ref> Peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK, the single became the band's first failure to reach No.&nbsp;1.

{{Main|Favourite Worst Nightmare}}
The band's second album, ''[[Favourite Worst Nightmare]]'', was released on 23 April 2007, a week after the release of accompanying single "[[Brianstorm]]". Like its predecessor, ''Favourite Worst Nightmare'' also quickly reached No.&nbsp;1 in the album charts. Turner described the songs as "very different from last time", adding that the sound of some tracks are "a bit full-on – a bit like "From the Ritz to the Rubble", "The View from the Afternoon", that sort of thing."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nme.com/news/nme/25655| title=Arctic Monkeys say new album is 'very different'| work=[[NME]]| date=5 January 2007| accessdate=13 January 2007}}</ref> A secret gig played at Sheffield's Leadmill on 10 February 2007, debuted seven new songs (six from ''Favourite Worst Nightmare'' and one other).<ref name="NME 20070211">{{cite web|title=Arctic Monkeys make surprise live return|work=[[NME]]|date=11 February 2007|url=http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/26370| accessdate =12 February 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070213052415/http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/26370| archivedate= 13 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Early reviews of the release were positive, and described it as "very, very fast and very, very loud."<ref name="M&C2">{{cite news| url=http://music.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1289900.php/Arctic_Monkeys_set_to_unleash_%91Favourite_Worst_Nightmare%92| title=Arctic Monkeys set to unleash 'Favourite Worst Nightmare'| publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]]| date=11 April 2007| accessdate=11 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070423150428/http://music.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1289900.php/Arctic_Monkeys_set_to_unleash_%91Favourite_Worst_Nightmare%92| archivedate= 23 April 2007| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the band continued to pick up awards from around the world, namely the 'Best New Artist in the United States' at the [[PLUG Independent Music Awards]], the "Album of the Year" awards in Japan, Ireland and the US, awards for "Best Album" and "Best Music DVD" for the short film "[[Scummy Man]]" at the 2007 NME Awards.<ref>{{cite news| last=Brandle| first=Lars| url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054313/arctic-monkeys-snatch-two-nme-trophies| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071211161449/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054313/arctic-monkeys-snatch-two-nme-trophies| archivedate=11 December 2007| title=Arctic Monkeys Snatch Two NME Trophies| date=1 March 2007| work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| accessdate=21 June 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> It ended the year by clinching the "Best British Band" and "Best British Album" at the [[2008 BRIT Awards]]. For the second year in a row, the band was nominated for the annual [[Mercury Prize]], although it failed to match its feat of 2006 after the award went to [[Klaxons]]' ''[[Myths of the Near Future (album)|Myths of the Near Future]]''.

On 29 April 2007, the day ''Favourite Worst Nightmare'' charted at No.&nbsp;1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], all 12 tracks from the album charted in the Top 200 of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. On 27 April 2007 it had a total of 18 tracks in the Top 200. "[[Fluorescent Adolescent]]" and "505" charted in the Top 75, at No.&nbsp;60 and No.&nbsp;74 respectively. The band later released "Fluorescent Adolescent" as a single, and it charted at No.&nbsp;5, after debuting the song live on The Jonathan Ross Show.

The third single from ''Favourite Worst Nightmare'', "[[Teddy Picker]]", was released on 3 December 2007. It charted at No.&nbsp;20 and remained only one week in the top 40 staying in this position, making it the lowest charting single for the band so far.

After a brief hiatus during which Alex Turner toured and recorded with his side project [[The Last Shadow Puppets]], the band recorded a total of 24 songs; 12 in the [[Rancho De La Luna]] recording sessions with [[Josh Homme]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] in early autumn, 2008, and 12 in the New York sessions with [[James Ford (musician)|James Ford]] in spring, 2009, following their January tour of New Zealand and Australia. During this tour, lead single "[[Crying Lightning]]", along with ''Humbug'' songs "Pretty Visitors", "Dangerous Animals", and "Potion Approaching" (then known as "Go-Kart"), was debuted live.

In a preview article on ClashMusic.com, writer Simon Harper claimed that the band had "completely defied any expectations or presumptions to explore the depths they can reach when stepping foot outside their accepted styles," and that "Turner is his usual eloquent self, but has definitely graduated into an incomparable writer whose themes twist and turn through stories and allegories so potent and profound it actually leaves one breathless".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/arctic-monkeys-album-first-impression|title=Arctic Monkeys Album – First Impression|last=Harper |first=Simon|date=2 June 2009|work=[[Clash Magazine|Clash]]|accessdate=21 July 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090605145940/http://www.clashmusic.com/news/arctic-monkeys-album-first-impression| archivedate= 5 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> On the same site, Alex Turner revealed that the band had listened to [[Nick Cave]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] while writing the new album, the title of which would be ''[[Humbug (album)|Humbug]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/45196 |title=Arctic Monkeys announce new album title |work=[[NME]] |date=9 June 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090612021719/http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/45196| archivedate= 12 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> ''Humbug'' was released on 19 August 2009, and, like both of its predecessors, the album went straight to No.&nbsp;1.

===Hiatus (2014–present)===
On 24 August 2014, the band announced a hiatus following their AM tour.<ref>http://www.contactmusic.com/arctic-monkeys/news/arctic-monkeys-headling-reading-festival-before-hiatus_4336923</ref>

Turner and Helders have both pursued other projects during this time. In 2016, Turner announced his second album with [[The Last Shadow Puppets]], ''[[Everything You've Come to Expect]]''. Helders played as a featured performer on Iggy Pop's ''[[Post Pop Depression]]''.

==Musical style and influences==
The band's music is known to fall under the umbrella of indie rock. A key part of their sound, and one that translates across their whole discography, is lead singer and frontman Alex Turner's intricate and often rapidly delivered lyrics, sung in a distinctive strong Sheffield accent that their music became famed for in their early years. A large part of their iconic British sound is credited to the punk poet John Cooper Clarke from whom the Arctic Monkeys even borrowed lyrics and the title from in "I Wanna Be Yours". Turner adapted Clarke's method of delivery mostly in their first album, ''Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not.'' Their early albums ''[[Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not]]'' and ''[[Favourite Worst Nightmare]]'' were rooted in [[garage rock]] and [[post-punk revival]], with Turner's sharp lyrics the focal point. On the first album Alex Turner examined human behaviour in [[nightclubs]] and in the culture of the band's hometown, [[Sheffield]]. Turner describes "Dancing Shoes" as being about "people always looking to [[wikt:pull|pull]] when they go out however much they mask it."<ref name="Own">{{cite web| url=http://www.nme.com/arcticmonkeys/ownwords| title=Arctic Monkeys' debut album in their own words| work= [[NME]]}}</ref>

These themes continued on the following album ''[[Favourite Worst Nightmare]]'' with the band still progressing as musicians. Songs such as "[[Fluorescent Adolescent]]" and "Do Me a Favour" explored failed relationships, nostalgia and growing old, while musically the band took up a more uptempo and aggressive sound.

Their third album ''Humbug'' includes strong [[stoner rock]] and [[Palm Desert Scene|desert rock]] elements, due to the influence of the album's producer and [[Queens of The Stone Age]] frontman, [[Joshua Homme]]. For ''Humbug'', the band actively sought a new sound. Homme was quoted saying, "They came to me: 'Will you take us to the weird and the strange?'"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Profile: Arctic Monkeys' Desert Journey|last = Eliscu|first = Jenny|date = 3 September 2009|journal = Rolling Stone|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>

Their fourth album ''Suck It and See'' sees the band exploring styles, mixing them with newfound maturity. Turner said: "I think the new album is a balance between our first three. There's nothing about taxi ranks or anything like that, but there's a bit of the standpoint I had on those early songs and the sense of humour, but also there's a bit of the 'Humbug' stuff which is kind of off in the corners."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/56975 |title=Arctic Monkeys: '&#39;Suck It And See' is a balance between our first three albums' |work=[[NME]] |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> Critics noted an influence from British rock bands from the 1960s, as well as [[The Smiths]], and slower, love-themed ballads featured more heavily on the album than the fast-paced, rockier songs that typifies the band's sound.

In a 2012 interview with ''NME'' magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited [[John Lennon]] as a major influence lyrically. Speaking about Lennon, Turner said; "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I really wanted to be able to write an "[[I Am the Walrus]]" type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".<ref name="lennon">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/66216 |title=Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner hails John Lennon's lyrics |work=[[NME]] |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>

According to the band, the fifth album ''AM'' is more [[hip-hop]] influenced. As Alex Turner stated in an interview with ''NME'', it's "like a [[Dr. Dre]] beat, but we've given it an [[Ike Turner]] bowl-cut and sent it galloping across the desert on a Stratocaster".<ref name="nme AM dre">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/71734 |title =Alex Turner on new Arctic Monkeys album: 'It sounds like Dr Dre' | date=30 July 2013 | accessdate= 31 July 2013 | work=[[NME]] }}</ref> He also cited [[Outkast]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Black Sabbath]] as influences for the album.<ref name="nme photo11">{{cite web| url=http://www.nme.com/photos/40-things-we-ve-learned-about-arctic-monkeys-am/314816/1/1#11 |title =40 Things We've Learned About Arctic Monkeys' 'AM' – Photo 11 | date=31 July 2013 | accessdate= 31 July 2013 | work=[[NME]] }}</ref><ref name="nme photo12">{{cite web| url=http://www.nme.com/photos/40-things-we-ve-learned-about-arctic-monkeys-am/314816/1/1#12 |title =40 Things We've Learned About Arctic Monkeys' 'AM' – Photo 12 | date=31 July 2013 | accessdate= 31 July 2013 | work=[[NME]] }}</ref>
