Des Moines is a major center of the U.S. insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. In fact, Des Moines was credited as the "number one spot for U.S. insurance companies" in a [[Business Wire]] article and named the third largest "insurance capital" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the [[Principal Financial Group]], [[Apollo Global Management|Athene]] USA insurance, the [[Meredith Corporation]], Ruan Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and [[Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield]]. Other major corporations such as [[Wells Fargo]], [[Voya Financial]], [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]], [[ACE Limited]], Marsh, [[Monsanto]] and [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]] have large operations in or near the metro area.

Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics because it is the capital of Iowa, which is home to the first [[Iowa caucuses|caucuses]] of the [[U.S. presidential primary|presidential primary]] cycle. Hence, many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated "if you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines".<ref>{{cite news | title= In the Spotlight, Ready for Its Close-Up | url= http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/travel/02journeys.html | first= Adam | last= Nagourney | authorlink= Adam Nagourney |work=The New York Times | date= December 2, 2007 | accessdate= September 12, 2009}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Des Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843–46), which was named for the [[Des Moines River]]. The French ''"des Moines"'' (pronounced {{IPA-fr|de.mwan||DesMoines1.ogg}}, formerly {{IPA-fr|de.mwɛn}}) translates literally to either "from the monks" or "of the monks".

The historian Virgil Vogel claimed that "Moingona" was derived from the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] clan name "[[Loon]]".<ref name="vogel">Vogel, Virgil (1983) ''Iowa Place Names of Indian Origin'' University of Iowa Press, Iowa City.</ref>

Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that ''Moingona'' meant "people by the portage" or something similar, a reference to the [[Des Moines Rapids]], where the earliest meetings between the Moingona and European explorers took place.<ref name="fay">{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=Jim|year=2010|title=Des Moines is Not an Insult:Thoughts on the Moingona Tribe|journal=Newsletter of the [[Iowa Archeological Society]]|location=Iowa City|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1–3}}</ref>

One popular interpretation of "Des Moines" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that "Des Moines" refers to French [[Trappists|Trappist monks]], who lived in huts on top of what is now known as [[Monks Mound]] near [[St. Louis]] some {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the Des Moines River.<ref>"[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030914/ENT/70323017 Defining 'Des Moines']", ''Des Moines Register'', September 14, 2003.</ref>

The juncture of the [[Des Moines River|Des Moines]] and [[Raccoon River|Raccoon]] rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified in [[downtown Des Moines]] by archaeologists. Discovered in December 2010, the [[Palace Site|"Palace"]] is an expansive 7,000-year-old site located at the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by the University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thegazette.com/2011/08/18/ui-archaeologists-find-7000-year-old-site-in-des-moines/ |author=Heldt, Diane |date=August 18, 2011 |title=UI archaeologists find 7,000-year-old site in Des Moines: More than 6,000 artifacts were found |newspaper=The Gazzette |location=Cedar Rapids, Iowa|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref>

At least three Late Prehistoric villages stood in or near downtown Des Moines, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] mounds were observed in downtown Des Moines by early settlers. All have been destroyed.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Schoen, Christopher M. | year = 2005 | title = A Point of Land and Prehistoric Peoples | url = | journal=Iowa Heritage Illustrated | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–9 }}</ref><ref name="DMIndians">{{cite journal|last=Whittaker|first=William E.|year=2008|title=Prehistoric and Historic Indians in Downtown Des Moines|journal=Newsletter of the [[Iowa Archeological Society]]|volume=58|issue=1|pages=8–10}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Des Moines, Iowa}}

===Origin of Fort Des Moines===
The City of Des Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain [[James Allen (Army engineer)|James Allen]] supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the [[Des Moines River|Des Moines]] and [[Raccoon River]]<nowiki/>s merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the [[U.S. War Department]] told him to name it Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] Indians, who had been transplanted to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state.<ref name="Forts">{{cite book|last=Schoen|first=Christopher M. |author2=W.E. Whittaker |author3=K.E.M. Gourley|title=Frontier Forts of Iowa: Indians, Traders, and Soldiers, 1682–1862|editor=William E. Whittaker|publisher=University of Iowa Press|location=Iowa City|year=2009|pages=161–177|chapter=Fort Des Moines No. 2, 1843–1846|isbn=978-1-58729-831-8|url=http://uipress.uiowa.edu/books/2009-fall/whittaker.htm}}</ref>

The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems. One newspaper reported: "It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous".<ref name="Forts" />
Even after official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.<ref name="DMIndians"/> Archaeological excavations have demonstrated that many fort-related features survived under what is now [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Parkway and First Street.<ref name="Forts" /><ref>Mather, David and Ginalie Swaim (2005)The Heart of the Best Part: Fort Des Moines No. 2 and the Archaeology of a City.

===Early settlement===

[[File:Flood at Fort Des Moines in 1851 - History of Iowa.jpg|thumb|right|Flood of Des Moines, 1851]]
Settlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, Fort Des Moines became the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850–1851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:

<blockquote>This is one of the strangest looking "cities" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of "brick", and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses...The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.<ref>Perkins, Arozina, 1851 letter in: (1984) Teaching in Fort Des Moines, Iowa: November 13, 1850 to March 21, 1851. In ''Women Teachers on the Frontier'', edited by P. W. Kaufman, pp. 126–143. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut.</ref></blockquote>

In May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the [[Flood of 1851]]. "The Des Moines and Raccoon rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines river. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away."<ref>Mills and Company (1866) ''Des Moines City Directory and Business Guide.'' Mills and Company, Des Moines Iowa, p. 6. Microfilm, State Historical Society Library, Iowa City.</ref> This flood provided a clean slate for the city to grow on.

===Era of growth===
On September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city, the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name "Fort Des Moines" was shortened to "Des Moines" and the state capital was moved here from [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]].
Growth was slow during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.<ref>Brigham, Johnson (1911)''Des Moines: The Pioneer of Municipal Progress and Reform of the Middle West.'' Volume 1. S. J. Clarke, Chicago.</ref>

In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the west side of the river, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sunk a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] to reach a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, there were numerous mine shafts within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, there were 23 mines in the region.<ref>James H. Lees, History of Coal Mining in Iowa, Chapter III of [https://books.google.com/books?id=1BUMAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA415&pg=PA566 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 566–569.</ref> By 1908, the coal resources of Des Moines were largely exhausted.<ref>Henry Hinds, The Coal Deposits of Iowa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1BUMAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA415&pg=PA121 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 121–127, and see map on page 102.</ref> Nonetheless, in 1912, Des Moines was home to eight locals of the [[United Mine Workers]] union representing a total of 1,410 miners.<ref>Tally Sheet, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cfAUAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA1005 Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Convention of the United Mine Workers of America] Jan 16 – February 2, 1912, Indianapolis; Volume 2, pages 180A-184A.</ref> This represents about 1.7 percent of the city's population in 1910.

By 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408 making it Iowa's largest city, and displacing the three Mississippi River ports (Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport) that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period.  Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city ever since.  In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black.<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=Iowa - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html}}</ref>

==="City Beautiful" project, decline and rebirth===

At the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a "[[City Beautiful]]" project in which large [[Beaux Arts (architecture)|Beaux Arts]] public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former [[Public Library of Des Moines|Des Moines Public Library building]] (now the home of the [[World Food Prize]]), the [[U.S. Post Office (Des Moines, Iowa)|central Post Office]] (now Polk County Administrative Building with a newer addition attached), and the [[Des Moines City Hall|City Hall]] are surviving examples of the 1900–1910 buildings. They form the [[Civic Center Historic District (Des Moines, Iowa)|Civic Center Historic District]].

The ornate riverfront balustrade that still line the Des Moines and Raccoon River were built by the federal [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in the mid-1930s. The ornamental fountains that once stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a post-industrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s.<ref>Dahl, Orin L.

Heritage Media, San Marcos, California.</ref> The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.

In 1907, the city adopted a [[city commission government]] known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. This form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a [[council-manager]] government, and further changed in 1967 so that four of the seven city council members were elected by ward rather than at-large. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960). The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009.<ref name="citypop">{{cite web|publisher=United States Census Bureau|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places in Iowa: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2009|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2009-04-19.xls|format=XLS|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> However, the growth of the outlying suburbs has been a constant and the overall metro area population is over 600,000 today.

During the [[Great Flood of 1993]], heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach.<ref>{{cite news | title= Flood-Ravaged Iowa Scrambles to Mend Levees, Protect Water Supplies and Salvage Homes | url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,367004,00.html |publisher=Fox News Channel | date= June 14, 2008 | accessdate= September 12, 2009}}</ref> The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by [[Saylorville Lake|Saylorville Reservoir]], but in both 1993 and 2008 the river overtopped the reservoir spillway.

Today, Des Moines is a member of [[ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA]]. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented "The Tomorrow Plan", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally planning growth and resource consumption to manage the local population.

The skyline of Des Moines changed during the 1970s and 1980s as several new skyscrapers were built. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story [[Financial Center]] was completed in 1973 and the 36-story [[Ruan Center]] was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story [[Des Moines Marriott Hotel]] (1981), the 25-story [[HUB Tower]] and 25-story [[Plaza Building (Des Moines, Iowa)|Plaza Building]] (1985), Iowa's tallest building, [[Principal Financial Group]]'s 45-story tower at [[801 Grand]] (1991), and the 19-story [[EMC Insurance Building]] (1997).

This time period also saw the opening of the [[Civic Center of Greater Des Moines]] (1979) which hosts Broadway shows and special events, the [[Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden]] (1979) which is a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river, the [[Iowa Events Center#Polk County Convention Complex|Polk County Convention Complex]] (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines [[skyway|skywalk]] also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is {{convert|4|mi}} long and connects many downtown buildings.<ref>[http://www.seedesmoines.com/get_around/skywalks.php Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau].

The city is in the midst of major construction in the downtown area. The new [[Science Center of Iowa]] and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the [[Iowa Events Center]] opened in 2005, while the new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect [[David Chipperfield]] of London, opened on April 8, 2006.

The [[World Food Prize]] Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed restoration of the [[Public Library of Des Moines|former Des Moines Public Library]] building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Dr. [[Norman Borlaug]]/[[World Food Prize]] Hall of Laureates.

In 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the [[Principal Riverwalk]], which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a "civic garden" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted to [[loft]] apartments and [[condominium]]s. This trend is highlighted by the success of the [[East Village (Des Moines, Iowa)|East Village]] district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.

==Government==
[[File:Des Moines City Hall.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Des Moines City Hall|Des Moines Municipal Building]]]]
Des Moines currently operates under a [[council–manager government|council–manager]] form of government. The council consists of a mayor (currently, [[Frank Cownie]]) and is elected in citywide vote, two at-large members, and four members representing each of the city's four wards.  In 2014, Jonathan Gano was appointed as the new Public Works Director.<ref>http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/des-moines/2014/12/31/jonathan-gano-des-moines-public-works/21099603</ref>  In 2015, Dana Wingert was appointed as Police Chief<ref>http://www.kcci.com/news/des-moines-officials-reach-decision-on-new-police-chief/31093674</ref> and Pam Cooksey was appointed as the new City Engineer.<ref>http://www.dmgov.org/NewsDocuments/20150127CityOfDesMoinesNamesPamelaCookseyAsCityEngineer.pdf</ref>

A plan to merge the governments of Des Moines and Polk County was rejected by voters during the November 2, 2004, election. The [[consolidated city-county]] government would have had a full-time mayor and a 15-member council that would have been divided among the city and its suburbs. Each suburb would have still retained its individual government but had the option to join the consolidated government at any time. Although a full merger was soundly rejected, many city and county departments and programs have been consolidated.

==Transportation==
[[File:I235 keynote bridge.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Edna Griffin|Edna M. Griffin]] Memorial Pedestrian Bridge over [[Interstate 235 (Iowa)|Interstate 235]]]]
Des Moines has an extensive skywalk system within its downtown core. With over four miles of enclosed walkway, it is one of the largest of such systems in the United States. The Des Moines Skywalk System has been criticized for hurting street-level business, though a recent initiative has been made to make street-level Skywalk entrances more visible.
[[File:Skywalks Spanning 7th Street.jpg|left|thumb|Skywalks connecting buildings over 8th Street in the Downtown Core of Des Moines]]
[[Interstate 235 (Iowa)|Interstate 235]] (I-235) cuts through the city, and [[Interstate 35 in Iowa|I-35]] and [[Interstate 80 in Iowa|I-80]] both pass through the Des Moines metropolitan area, as well as the city of Des Moines. On the northern side of the city of Des Moines and passing through the cities of Altoona, Clive, Johnston, Urbandale and West Des Moines, I-35 and I-80 converge into a long concurrency while I-235 takes a direct route through Des Moines, Windsor Heights, and West Des Moines before meeting up with I-35 and I-80 on the western edge of the metro.  Des Moines' freeway design makes it easy for travelers. A motorist who misses an exit at the interstate "mixmasters" at the eastern and western edges of the metro eventually ends up at the convergence of the same interstates at the opposite side of the metro. These Interstates include I-35, I-80, and I-235. I-235, which takes the brunt of most congestion, is six lanes throughout the entire length and expands to eight and ten lanes near the downtown area. The remainder of traffic congestion in the area occurs near the East and West Mixmasters on either side of Des Moines. I-35 south of the West Mixmaster is currently being widened to six lanes all the way to the [[Iowa Highway 5]] (Iowa&nbsp;5) bypass interchanges.

Due to increasing budget constraints, the city of Des Moines implemented a speeding camera program along I-235 to gain revenue through the most densely populated parts of Greater Des Moines. The East Mixmaster has also undergone a redesign with wider lanes and redesign of bridges allowing easier traffic flow in all directions along I-35, I-80, and I-235. [[U.S. Highway 65 (Iowa)|U.S. Highway 65]] (US&nbsp;65) and Iowa&nbsp;5 form a freeway loop, known as the "South Belt Freeway," to the east and south of the city, providing a route through the southern part of the metropolitan area. [[U.S. Route 6 in Iowa|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 69 in Iowa|US&nbsp;69]], [[Iowa Highway 28|Iowa&nbsp;28]], [[Iowa Highway 141|Iowa&nbsp;141]], [[Iowa Highway 163|Iowa&nbsp;163]], [[Iowa Highway 330|Iowa&nbsp;330]],and [[Iowa Highway 415|Iowa&nbsp;415]] are also important routes to and within the city.

[[File:Downtown Des Moines Skywalk Entrance.jpg|thumb|A new Des Moines Skywalk Entrance]]
There have been proposals to convert Iowa&nbsp;5 and US&nbsp;65, the "South Belt Freeway," into what would be renamed Interstate 335, giving the Des Moines Metropolitan Area an interstate running from the northeast suburb of [[Altoona, IA|Altoona]] to the southeastern suburb of [[Carlisle, IA|Carlisle]] and then connect with I-35 in the southern part of [[West Des Moines, IA|West Des Moines]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New Interstate 335 Coming to DM Area? |url=http://www.kcci.com/automotive/27825552/detail.html |publisher=KCCI News Channel 8 |accessdate=May 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120120103449/http://www.kcci.com/automotive/27825552/detail.html |archivedate=20 January 2012 }}</ref>

Des Moines's public transit system, operated by DART ([[Des Moines Area Regional Transit]]), which was the Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority until October 2006, consists entirely of buses, including regular in-city routes and express and commuter buses to outlying suburban areas. A light rail tram system has been proposed, but is years away and dependent on finding funding.

[[Burlington Trailways]], [[Jefferson Lines]], and [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] run long-distance, inter-city bus routes through Des Moines. The nearest [[Amtrak]] train station is in [[Osceola, Iowa|Osceola]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} south of Des Moines. Trains on the route that passes through [[Osceola (Amtrak station)|Osceola]], the [[California Zephyr]], go east to Chicago, Illinois, and west to [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], California. There are plans to establish regional service Between Chicago and Omaha directly serving Des Moines. There may also be connections to Osceola and Waterloo. The Rock Island perviously served Des Moines with its Rocket streamlined trains.

The [[Des Moines International Airport]] (DSM), located on Fleur Drive in the southern part of Des Moines, offers nonstop service to destinations within the United States. Currently the only international service is cargo service, but there have been discussions about adding an international terminal.

===Parks and recreation===

Des Moines has 76 city parks and three golf courses, as well as three family aquatic centers, five community centers and three swimming pools. The city has  {{convert|45|mi|km}} of trails.

The [[Principal Riverwalk]] is a riverwalk park district currently being constructed along the banks of the Des Moines River in the downtown. Primarily funded by the [[Principal Financial Group]], the Riverwalk is a multi-year jointly funded project also funded by the city and state. Upon completion, it will feature a {{convert|1.2|mi|km|adj=on}} recreational trail connecting the east and west sides of downtown via two pedestrian bridges. A landscaped promenade along the street level is planned. The Riverwalk includes the downtown Brenton Skating Plaza, open from November through March.

Gray's Lake, part of the {{convert|167|acres|0|abbr=on}} of Gray's Lake Park, features a boat rental facility, fishing pier, floating boardwalks, and a park resource center. Located just south of the downtown, the centerpiece of the park is a lighted {{convert|1.9|mi|km|adj=on}} Kruidenier Trail, encircling it entirely.

From [[downtown Des Moines]] primarily along the east bank of the Des Moines River, the Neil Smith and John Pat Dorrian Trails are {{convert|28.2|mi|km|adj=on}} paved recreational trails that connect Gray's Lake northward to the east shore of [[Saylorville Lake]], Big Creek State Park, and the recreational trails of [[Ankeny, Iowa|Ankeny]] including the [[High Trestle Trail]].<ref name="NorthSouthTrails">{{cite web|title=Neil Smith and John Pat Dorrain Trails|url=http://www.inhf.org//trails/neal-smith-john-pat-dorrian.cfm|publisher=Iowa Trails Homepage from the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation website|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}</ref>  These trails are near several recreational facilities including the Pete Crivaro Park, [[Principal Park]], the Principal Riverwalk, the [[Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden]], Union Park and its Heritage Carousel of Des Moines, Birdland Park and the Birdland Marina/Boatramp on the [[Des Moines River]], Riverview Park, McHenry Park, and River Drive Park.<ref name="Parks">{{cite web|title=Des Moines Parks and Recreation|url=http://www.dmgov.org/Departments/Parks/Pages/Parks.aspx|publisher=City of Des Moines Park and Recreation website|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}</ref>  Although outside of Des Moines, Jester Park has {{convert|1834|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land along the western shore of [[Saylorville Lake]] and can be reached from the Neil Smith Trail over the Saylorville Dam.

Just west of Gray's Lake are the {{convert|1500|acre|ha|0}} of the Des Moines Water Works Park.  The Water Works Park is located along the banks of the [[Raccoon River]] immediately upstream from where the Raccoon River empties into the Des Moines River.  The Des Moines Water Works Facility, which obtains the city's drinking water from the Raccoon River, is located entirely within the Water Works Park.  A bridge in the park crosses the Raccoon River.  The Water Works Park recreational trails link to downtown Des Moines by travelling past Gray's Lake and back across the Raccoon River via either along the Meredith Trail near Principal Park, or along the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway.  The Water Works Park trails connect westward to [[West Des Moines, Iowa|Valley Junction]] and the [[Clive Greenbelt Trail#Connections to other trails|recreational trails]] of the western suburbs: [[Windsor Heights, Iowa|Windsor Heights]], [[Urbandale, Iowa|Urbandale]], [[Clive, Iowa|Clive]], and [[Waukee, Iowa|Waukee]].  Also originating from Water Works Park, the [[Great Western Trail (Iowa)|Great Western Trail]] is an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} journey southward from Des Moines to [[Martensdale, Iowa|Martensdale]] through the Willow Creek Golf Course, Orilla, and [[Cumming, Iowa|Cumming]].  Often, the location for summer music festivals and concerts, Water Works Park was the overnight campground for thousands of bicyclists on Tuesday, July 23, 2013, during [[RAGBRAI]] XLI.<ref name="WaterWorks">{{cite web|title=Des Moines Water Works Park|url=http://www.dmww.com/parks-events/water-works-park/|publisher=[http://www.dmww.com/ Des Moines Water Works] website|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}</ref>
