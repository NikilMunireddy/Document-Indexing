''' Derry City Football Club''' ({{lang-ga|'''Cumann Peile Chathair Dhoire'''}}) is a professional [[association football|football club]] based in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. It plays in the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]]. It had spent the majority of its time in the [[League of Ireland]] in the Premier Division, the top tier of league football in the [[Republic of Ireland]], but was expelled in November 2009 when it was discovered there were secondary, unofficial contracts with players. It was reinstated a few weeks later but demoted to the First Division, the second tier.<ref Name=InvitedBackBBC>{{cite news

The club, founded in 1928, initially played in the [[IFA Premiership|Irish League]], the domestic league in Northern Ireland, and won a title in [[Irish League 1964–65|1964–65]]. In 1971, security concerns related to [[the Troubles]] meant matches could not be played at the Brandywell. The team played home fixtures {{convert|30|mi|km}} away in [[Coleraine]]. The security forces withdrew their objections to the use of the Brandywell the following year, but in the face of insistence from the Irish League that the unsustainable arrangement continue, the club withdrew from the league. After 13 years in junior football, it joined the League of Ireland's new First Division for 1985–86. Derry won the First Division title and achieved promotion to the Premier Division in 1987, and remained there until the 2009 relegation. The club won a domestic [[The Treble|treble]] in [[League of Ireland 1988–89|1988–89]], the only League of Ireland club so far to do so.

This situation lasted from September 1971 until October 1972 when, faced with dwindling crowds (most Derry fans were unwilling to travel to Coleraine due to the political situation and the longer journey) and dire finances, the club formally requested permission to return to the Brandywell. Despite a new assessment by the security forces concluding that the Brandywell was no longer any more dangerous than any other league ground and a lifting of the security ban, Derry's proposal fell by one vote at the hands of its fellow Irish League teams.<ref name=Bradley/> Continuing without a ground was seen as unsustainable and on 13 October 1972 Derry withdrew from the league amidst a perception that it was effectively forced out while a [[persecution complex|complex of victimisation and marginalisation]] developed within the nationalist community behind the club.<ref name=History/><ref name=Wilderness>{{cite book |

=== Entry into the League of Ireland ===
Derry applied to join the reorganised [[League of Ireland]] (the league in the Republic of Ireland) in 1985 with the Brandywell as its home. The move required special dispensation from the [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] and [[FIFA]], but eventually Derry was admitted to the league's new First Division for 1985, joining as semi-professionals.<ref name=History/> As its stadium was situated in a staunchly republican area once known as "[[Free Derry]]", with a history of scepticism towards the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] in the local community,<ref name=Bradley/> Derry received special permission from [[UEFA]] to steward its own games. The presence of the RUC was regarded as more likely to provoke trouble than help prevent it.<ref>"Football: Sectarianism".

Since 1989, Derry has won the Premier Division once – in 1996–97 – but has been runner-up on three occasions. It added three more FAI Cups to its tally in 1995, 2002 and 2006, was runner-up in 1994, 1997, and 2008 and has also won six further League Cups.<ref>"Honours list".

The club has been beset by financial problems and was on the verge of bankruptcy due to an unpaid tax bill in 2000.

Derry's top goalscorer that season, [[Mark Farren]], who finished with a tally of 20 goals, scored the winner against Monaghan before retiring from football for medical reasons as he sought to fight a benign tumour located in his brain. Farren ended his career as a Derry City legend and his achievements for the club resulted in his number 18 shirt being retired with him as a sign of respect for such a talented goalscorer.

[[File:Coat of arms of Derry.png|left|thumb|upright|The city's coat of arms, used by the club as a crest prior to the introduction of a unique club crest in 1986, seen in a decoration on the [[Craigavon Bridge]].]]
The club did not sport a crest on the club jersey throughout the Irish League years, nor for most of the first League of Ireland season. Instead, the [[coat of arms]] of the city appeared on club memorabilia such as scarves, hats and badges. The symbols on the arms are a skeleton, three-towered castle, red [[St. George's cross]] and sword. The sword and cross are devices of the [[City of London]], and along with an [[Harp#As a symbol|Irish harp]] embedded within the cross, demonstrate the link between the two cities – the city's official name under UK law is [[Derry-Londonderry name dispute|Londonderry]] and the city itself was developed by [[The Honourable The Irish Society]], a [[livery company]] of the City of London. The castle is thought to be an old local [[Normans|Norman]] keep built in 1305 by the [[Burke (surname)|de Burca]] [[clan]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Beattie, Sean | title=Donegal | location=Sutton  | publisher=Printing Press | year=2004 | isbn=0-7509-3825-0}}

Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Retrieved 30 April 2007</ref> This is accompanied by the [[Latin]] motto, "''Vita, veritas, victoria''", meaning "Life, truth, victory."

[[File:DerryOldCrest.png|upright|thumb|Derry City's first exclusive crest, introduced in 1986 and replaced in 1997 by the crest which lasted to 2009.]]
In April 1986 the club ran a competition in local schools to design a crest for them. The winning entry was designed by John Devlin, a [[St. Columb's College]] student, and was introduced on 5 May 1986 as Derry hosted [[Nottingham Forest]] for a friendly, with Liam Nelis and Paul Gormley (on his fifth birthday) acting as mascots. The crest depicted a simplified version of the city's [[Foyle Bridge]], which had opened 18 months previously, the traditional red and white stripes of the jersey bordered by thin black lines, the year in which the club was founded and a football in the centre representing the club as a footballing entity. The name of the club appeared in [[Impact (typeface)|Impact]] font.

With the novelty of the Foyle Bridge wearing off over time, the crest lasted until 15 July 1997, when the current one was unveiled at [[Lansdowne Road]] with the meeting of Derry City and [[Celtic F.C|Celtic]] during a pre-season friendly tournament.<ref>Mahon (1998), pp. 189–192.</ref> The modern crest also features a centred football, the year of founding and the club's name in a contemporary [[sans-serif]] font – [[Industria (typeface)|Industria Solid]]. The famous red and white stripes are present along with a red mass of colour filling the left half of the crest, separated from the right by a white stripe. Known cultural landmarks or items associated with the city are absent from the [[minimalist]] design. The crests have always been positioned over the heart on the home jerseys.

{{Main|Brandywell Stadium}}
Derry City's home ground is the municipal Brandywell Stadium, situated just south-west of the [[Bogside]] in the Brandywell area of [[Derry]]. It is often abbreviated to "the Brandywell" and is also a local [[greyhound racing]] venue, with an ovoid track encircling the pitch.

Plans of Derry City's to purchase a pitch fell through after its formation due to the tight time-scale between its foundation in 1928 and the season's beginning in 1929 and so the [[Derry City Council|Londonderry Corporation]] (now the Derry City Council) was approached for the use of the Brandywell which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. It agreed and the club still operates under the constraints of [[The Honourable The Irish Society]] charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community. In effect, the club does not have private ownership and, thus, cannot develop by its own accord, with that discretion or whether to sell being left to the Derry City Council.<ref name=History/><ref>"Derry fans make stadium plea".

[[File:126 Brandywell Stadium.JPG|thumb|left|Derry City supporters in the Brandywell]]
Derry City's first game at the Brandywell was a 2–1 loss to [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] on 22 August 1929.<ref name=History/> In 1933, the purchase of Bond's Field in the [[Waterside, Derry|Waterside]] was mentioned, but it was thought to be too far away from the fan-base which had built up on the Cityside, especially in the Brandywell area. It also had first option on Derry Celtic's old ground, [[Celtic Park (Derry)|Celtic Park]], but hesitated on a final decision and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] bought it ten years later. It also decided against buying Meenan Park for £1,500.<ref name=History/>

Because of [[Northern Ireland]]'s volatile political situation during the [[Troubles]] and security fears for Protestants and those of the unionist tradition visiting the mainly [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] city of Derry, the Brandywell has not always been the home ground of Derry City. In 1970 and 1971, Derry had to play its "home" ties against [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] at [[Windsor Park]] in [[Belfast]] – the home-ground of Linfield. From September 1971 until October 1972 Derry was forced to play all its "home" games at the [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|Showgrounds]] in mainly Protestant [[Coleraine]], over {{convert|30|mi|km}} away, as police ruled the republican Brandywell area as too unsafe for visiting unionists. The Brandywell did not see senior football for another 13 years as the [[Irish Football League]] upheld a ban on the stadium and Derry decided to leave the league as a result.<ref name=Bradley/> Only greyhound meetings and junior football were held during this time.<ref name=McGuinness/> Derry's admission to the League of Ireland in 1985 saw a return of senior games.

In December 2010 the club introduced a new credit card type season ticket system to ensure abuse of tickets could no longer occur and additionally ensuring more accurate attendance count at matches.<ref>{{cite news|title=New fool-proof Derry City season tickets issued|url=http://www.derryjournal.com/derry/New-foolproof-Derry-City-season.6652696.jp|work=Derry Journal|accessdate=11 December 2010|date=7 December 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Myperfectcous.JPG|thumb|The single cover for "[[My Perfect Cousin]]" by [[The Undertones]] features a Derry City figurine]]
Derry City have made numerous appearances in popular culture. In the world of music, the club was given exposure by Derry [[punk music|punk]] band, [[The Undertones]], which had the cover of its 1980 hit single, "[[My Perfect Cousin]]", feature a [[Subbuteo]] figure sporting the colours of Derry City. The song's video included the group's front-man, [[Feargal Sharkey]], kicking and leaping to head a ball while wearing the red and white jersey.<ref>[[Michael Bradley (musician)|Bradley, Michael]].

The club have also featured on popular television. Due to the fact that it is a club based in Northern Ireland playing in the league of the Republic of Ireland, it often receives the attention of broadcasters in both jurisdictions. In the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' shown the night before Derry's clash with [[Paris St. Germain]] in the [[2006–07 UEFA Cup]] first round, it was highlighted that [[Archie McLeod]], the grandfather of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' actor [[David Tennant]], was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had enticed him over from [[Scotland]].<ref>Barratt, Dr. Nick. "WDYTYA? Series Three: Celebrity Gallery", BBC History, 27 September 2006. {{Wayback|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_celeb_gallery_04.shtml|date =20070315004556|df=yes}}</ref> Likewise, features about the club were run by ''[[Football Focus]]'' prior to and after the same UEFA Cup game. Irish television has also featured the club. Derry City played in the first League of Ireland match ever to be shown live on television when it visited [[Tolka Park]] to play [[Shelbourne FC|Shelbourne]] during the 1996–97 season. The game was broadcast on [[RTÉ]]'s [[Network 2]] and finished 1–1 with [[Gary Beckett]] scoring for Derry.

Another medium to play host to the club has been the radio. On 20 April 2005, Derry City featured in an audio documentary ''The Blues and the Candy Stripes'' on [[RTÉ Radio 1]]'s ''Documentary on One''. The documentary was produced in the aftermath of the historic friendly game between Derry and [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] that took place on 22 February 2005 – the first between the two teams to occur since a game on 25 January 1969 during which Linfield's fans had to be evacuated from the Brandywell by police at half-time due to civil unrest and ugly scenes within the ground.<ref name=Radio>"[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/bluescandy.html The Blues and the Candy Stripes]", [[RTÉ Radio 1]], 20 April 2005. Retrieved 20 March 2012</ref> The 2005 match was organised as a kind of security test in the run-up to the likely possibility that both teams, with socially polar fan-bases, would qualify for and be drawn against one another in a near-future [[Setanta Cup]] competition.<ref name=Bradley/>

{{quote|text=Nobody owns Derry City F.C. apart from the people of Derry. Five or six years ago the club was on its knees, on the verge of going out of business. There was no sugar-daddy, no millionaire, no [[Roman Abramovich]] to save the club. It was the people and the city who saved the club. People, fans, ordinary people; they went out and banged on doors to collect money, they went around pubs with collection buckets, they did what they could to keep the club alive. Derry is a close-knit place, a small community, they care about their club and that's why we still have a club. And every bit of success we may get this season is down to them.<ref>Fitzmaurice, Aidan. "[http://en.archive.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=134217728/newsid=457048.html Derry dare to dream]", UEFA, 15 September 2006. Retrieved 21 March 2012</ref>}}

Likewise, former [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] leader and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[John Hume]], who is the club's current president,<ref name=GenInfo/> stated in 1998 of the club's relationship with the community:
{{quote|text=Derry City F.C. has been the linchpin in the life of the community in Derry since its foundation in 1928. Throughout the club's history, the Candystripes have provided a sporting outlet for young people and older supporters alike. The history of the club is intertwined with that of its city. It has seen struggle and marginalisation turn to renewal and success. The pride people have in this club reflects the pride we hold in our city. Derry City players and supporters alike are superb ambassadors for the city. Today, the club, like the city, looks to the future with great hope. For all its successes, Derry City would be nothing without the people of the city.<ref>Mahon (1998), "Foreword" by [[John Hume|Hume, John]], p. 2</ref>}}

Support for the club is quite dependent on geography and crosses social boundaries. Fans come from both working class areas, such as the Brandywell area and [[Bogside]], and more affluent regions of the city, like [[Culmore]]. The Cityside is seen as the traditional base of the club, especially the Brandywell area, although the [[Waterside, Derry|Waterside]] is also home to a smaller number of supporters.<ref name=Cronin/> The club are supported mainly by Derry's nationalist community. The connection is argued to be rooted mainly in [[geography]], as well as social, cultural and historical circumstances, as opposed to the club or its fans pushing towards the creation of a certain identity.<ref name=Cronin/> The club has a small minority of supporters of a Protestant upbringing. The city's Protestant community is largely apathetic, though some unionists and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] see the club as a symbol of Catholicism and nationalism as a result of the sectarian divide in support.<ref name=Cronin/><ref>For a more in-depth analysis and study of [[Ethnicity and football|sectarian divisions and the politico-religious alignment of certain communities of fans to certain clubs]] within domestic Irish (especially Northern Irish) football, see: {{cite book |
