'''''Holby City''''' styled as '''HOLBY CI<sup>+</sup>Y''' is a British medical drama television series that airs weekly on [[BBC One]].

The series was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the established [[BBC]] medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', and premiered on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as ''Casualty'', in the fictional city of [[Holby]], and featured occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both ''Casualty'' (which featured dedicated episodes broadcast as ''[[Casualty@Holby City]]'') and the show's 2007 [[police procedural]] spin-off ''[[HolbyBlue]]''. Its first executive producers were Young and [[Johnathan Young]], who were succeeded by [[Kathleen Hutchison]] from 2002 to 2004, [[Richard Stokes (producer)|Richard Stokes]] from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010, Belinda Campbell from 2010 to 2011, Johnathan Young from 2011 to 2013, and Oliver Kent from 2013. Since the show's initial development, it has become a weekly fixture in the schedule. Holby City airs once a week, with around 52 episodes per series.

The show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional [[Holby City Hospital]]. It began with eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of around fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Adrian Edmondson]] and [[John Michie]]

McHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmizing]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Seventeen series of ''Holby City'' have aired, and the eigtheenth began airing from 13 October 2015. The show has run for over 800 hour-long episodes. It is filmed at the [[BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and from 2004 to 2008 featured annual special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.

''Holby City'' has attracted comparisons to other medical dramas,  often unfavourable, and figures within the television and entertainment industry including [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television [[licence fee]] on the programme. The series employs a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. ''Holby City'' has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the [[British Medical Association]] denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an [[accident and emergency]] nurse at the 2008 [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.

''Holby City'' has been nominated for over 100 television awards, of which it has won ten: the 2008 [[British Academy Television Award]] for Best Continuing Drama, one BEFFTA Award, two [[Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy|Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards]], two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four [[Screen Nation]] Awards. The show's [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]] averaged 9.27&nbsp;million viewers, but apart from a rise in its [[Holby City (series 5)|fifth series]], ratings declined year-on-year until 2009, with the [[Holby City (series 11)|eleventh series]] averaging 5.44&nbsp;million viewers. The [[Holby City (series 12)|twelfth series]] saw a small rise to 5.62&nbsp;million. Later series have consistently drawn over 4 million viewers per week.

==Production==
The show began with only eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen to twenty main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]] and [[Adrian Edmondson]].

McHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the "showrunner" of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmising]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Seventeen complete series of ''Holby City'' have aired, and a eighteenth began airing in October 2015. The show has run for over 600-hour-long episodes. It is filmed in studios at the [[BBC Elstree Centre]] in Hertfordshire, with the 1960s office building Neptune House being used for multiple exteriors and interiors in the series. It has occasionally featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.

===Development===
''Holby City'' was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', which is set in the [[emergency department]] of the fictional Holby City Hospital.<ref name="digital spy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holbycity/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html|title= 'Holby City's exec producer stands down|last=Green|first=Kris|date=14 December 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=12 January 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5r17Zw9V1|archivedate=6 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FILM+of+the+season;+BABE,+Christmas+Day,+BBC1+7pm.-a060945126|title=Film of the season; Babe, Christmas Day, BBC1 7&nbsp;pm.|date=19 December 1998|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=10 October 2010|location=Glasgow, Scotland}}</ref> Young wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in ''Casualty'' once they were taken away to the hospital's surgical wards.<ref name="JT">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Life's+sweet+off+the+Street;+Exit+Coronation+Street+stage+left,+enter...-a060364526|title=Life's sweet off the Street|last=Taylor|first=Jim|date=2 January 1999|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=23 April 2010|location=Glasgow, Scotland|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5r17dHnqX |archivedate=6 July 2010}}</ref> While ''Casualty''{{'s}} scope is limited to "accident of the week" storylines about patients entering hospital, ''Holby City'' allowed the possibility of storylines about long-term care, rather than immediate life and death decisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Drama+that+gets+right+to+the+heart+of+the+matter;+Graham+Keal+finds...-a060553497|title=Drama that gets right to the heart of the matter;|last=Keal|first=Graham|date=8 January 1999|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|accessdate=23 April 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5r17mI43C|archivedate=6 July 2010}}</ref> The series was commissioned by BBC One Controller [[Peter Salmon (producer)|Peter Salmon]], and began airing on [[BBC One]] on 12 January 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4465719.stm|title=Salmon quits as head of BBC Sport|date=21 April 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/1999/jan/12/tvandradio.television1 |title=Television Tuesday |last=Smithies|first=Sandy|date=12 January 1999|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 February 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5r17jXUmJ|archivedate=6 July 2010}}</ref>

Series producer [[Richard Stokes]] believes that the series' popularity stems from the fact the hospital setting presents numerous plotline opportunities, explaining: "You have licence to create life-and-death situations every week, something you cannot do in any other set piece. The interaction of the characters can be sexy and social issues also permeate the writing. But, basically, hospital drama is successful because the viewers will forgive all the yukky bits for the wonder of a life saved."<ref name="FR"/> The focus of the series has developed since its conception, expanding to cover extra wards, including a [[gynaecology]] ward, an [[acute assessment unit]] and a [[maternity]] ward.<ref name="FR">{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article1140585.ece|title=Script and scalpel, please |last=Redwood|first=Fred|date=11 June 2003|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5r18ALLqO|archivedate=6 July 2010}}</ref> When the maternity ward and a [[Neonatal intensive-care unit|special care baby unit]] were introduced during [[Holby City (series 4)|series four]], Young explained that new wards were necessary to allow the crew to rotate sets, maximising filming potential.<ref name="malyoung">{{cite web|url=http://www.holby.tv/cgi-bin/News/fullnews.cgi?newsid1028627054,51091,|title=Holby City Hits 100|date=6 August 2002|work=Holby Gazette|accessdate=5 March 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5r18LrbKu|archivedate=6 July 2010}}</ref>

Episodes of ''Holby City'' cost around £370,000 to produce—more than the BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', at £130,000 per episode, but less than ''Casualty'' at £450,000 per episode, or ''[[Dalziel and Pascoe (TV series)|Dalziel and Pascoe]]'' at £700–800,000 per episode. As ''Holby City'' is a high-volume, year-round production, it has relatively low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, which is not the case for shorter series or one-off dramas.<ref>{{cite book |title=Soap opera |last=Hobson |first=Dorothy |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn= 978-0-7456-2655-0 |page=46|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tzqK15wsWrIC&printsec=frontcover&q= |accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref>

===Writing===
''Holby City'' storylines are planned eight months in advance.<ref name="DKIS"/> The series utilises a number of scriptwriters, who are found and scheduled by script development editor Simon Harper.<ref name="SW">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenwritinggoldmine.com/writing-for-a-medical-show-simon-harper-holby-interview.htm|title=Screenwriting For a Medical Show – Simon Harper (Holby) Interview |work=Screenwriting Goldmine|accessdate=5 March 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100415152118/http://www.screenwritinggoldmine.com/writing-for-a-medical-show-simon-harper-holby-interview.htm|archivedate=15 April 2010}}</ref> Harper receives around 20 speculative scripts a week, and also finds writers through the BBC Writers Academy, a course established in 2005 which guarantees its graduates the opportunity to work on prime time television. McHale teaches at the academy, and graduate Abi Bown went on to become a regular writer for ''Holby City''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/04_april/11/academy.shtml|title=BBC seeks next generation of tv writers for prestigious academy |date=11 April 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref> Harper also recruits writers through the BBC's Continuing Drama Shadow Scheme, open to writers from all levels of experience.<ref name="Shadow">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/writing/how_we_develop_writers.shtml|title=Continuing Drama Shadow Schemes  |work=BBC Writers Room|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 August 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110312101420/http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/writing/how_we_develop_writers.shtml|archivedate=12 March 2011}}</ref> He believes that scripts which demonstrate synthesis between guest and serial storylines are "the spine of the show", and has stated that, "Good, cracking, intelligent, ballsy dialogue is a must," explaining: "It's about getting the characters voices because the characters drive these shows. It is a love for and investment in these characters and the consistency of those characters." Harper does not require that writers are necessarily familiar with the show, and would like to attract more female scriptwriters.<ref name="SW"/>

McHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holbycity/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html|title= 'Holby City's exec producer stands down|last=Green|first=Kris|date=14 December 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=30 January 2010}}</ref> His 2006 promotion to executive producer was part of a bid by Controller of BBC Drama Production [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] to "put writers back at the heart of the process". Yorke called McHale's promotion "fantastic", explaining: "It means that for the first time you've got a writer running one of our big powerhouse BBC1 shows."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/television-drama-great-show--now-direct-it-471585.html|title=Television Drama: Great show – now direct it |last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=27 March 2006|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=5 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Following McHale's resignation, his replacement as lead writer was Justin Young, who intends to introduce a more writer-led commissioning process from [[Holby City (series 13)|series 13]] onwards, with writers creating more of the theme and story of their episodes than was previously the case.<ref name="Shadow"/>

===Medical accuracy===
To ensure accuracy in scriptwriting, the serial employs a team of researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics.<ref name="FR"/> One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in ''Holby City'' as a scrub nurse.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/public_sector/article642276.ece|title=Foreign ways |date=21 November 2006|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/news/8244539.Nurse_adds_touch_of_glamour_with_Holby_City_role/|title=Barnet Hospital nurse selected as advisor on Holby City, filmed at BBC Elstree Studios|last=Drewett|first=Zoe|date=29 June 2010|work=Borehamwood Times|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> Another adviser, a [[cardiothoracic surgery|heart surgeon]], has occasionally left [[open-heart surgery]] to advise ''Holby City'' writers over the telephone.<ref name="FR"/> The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]].

===Music===
The show's [[Holby City (series 11)|eleventh series]] saw musical montage or "songtage" segments become standard in each episode, introduced by McHale as a means of modernising the show. Although McHale initially considered commissioning original pieces, budgetary constraints limited choices to pre-existing tracks. The use of songtages was first popularised by the US medical drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', however McHale stated he was unaware of this until ''Holby City'' had already adopted the technique.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/09/television-popandrock|title=Top of the docs|last=Lawson|first=Mark|date=21 February 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=5 March 2009| location=London}}</ref> Music was generally selected by each episode's scriptwriter. If the writer was not specific about which songs should be used, the producers and director would select the music in post-production. Actors also have some input: [[Hugh Quarshie]] personally selected the music he believed his character [[Ric Griffin]] would listen to in theatre.<ref name="DKIS"/> Asked in June 2010 whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, Kyle responded: "Yes – sometimes. On a multi-strand series such as ''Holby'', they are an excellent way of telling stories visually – a moment from each – to open or close an episode or create the passing of time in a concise way for the audience." Kris Green of entertainment and media website ''[[Digital Spy]]'' suggested that the number of songs used per episode could be "very jarring", to which Kyle replied: "We plan to use music carefully in the future – maybe 'songtages', as above – and sourced music within a scene, that is music actually playing in the scene itself, for example on a radio – but less incidental."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/interviews/a223398/diana-kyle-series-producer-holby-city.html|title=Diana Kyle (Series Producer, 'Holby City')|last=Green|first=Kris|date=4 June 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

In casting the [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]] of ''Holby City'', Young—who had previously worked on the soap operas ''[[Brookside]]'' and ''[[Family Affairs]]''—selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, particularly from a soap opera background.<ref name="GK">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Drama+that+gets+right+to+the+heart+of+the+matter;+Graham+Keal+finds...-a060553497|title=Drama that gets right to the heart of the matter;|last=Keal|first=Graham|date=8 January 1999|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> French had starred in the BBC's ''EastEnders'', while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in ''Brookside''.<ref name="JT"/> Griffin had also appeared in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Coronation Street]]''.<ref name="GK"/> Young explained: "Some of the best performances on screen have come out of soaps in the past few years.

Reflecting ''Holby City''{{'s}} origins as a spin-off from ''Casualty'' and the closely related premises of the two programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled ''Casualty@Holby City'', featuring a number of characters from each of the two casts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/apr/27/broadcasting.bbc|title=Holby City walks the thin blue line|last=Plunkett|first=John|date=27 April 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Prior to the commissioning of ''Casualty@Holby City'', the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between ''Holby City''{{'s}} [[Ben Saunders (Holby City)|Ben Saunders]] ([[David Paisley]]) and ''Casualty''{{'s}} Tony Vincent ([[Lee Warburton]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2985375.stm|title=Virgin Mary complaints rejected|date=29 April 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> The first full crossover was spearheaded by ''Casualty''{{'s}} executive producer Mervyn Watson, and ''Holby City''{{'s}} McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special.<ref name="watson">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/casualty/christmas2004/interview/|title=Crossover Interview|publisher=BBC|date=December 2004|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref> A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness of [[organ donation]] and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the Organ Donor Register.

In February 2010, another crossover occurred when ''Casualty''{{'s}} [[Charlie Fairhead]] ([[Derek Thompson (actor)|Derek Thompson]]) was operated on by ''Holby City''{{'s}} Elliot Hope after suffering a heart attack. The storyline was, however, broadcast as regular ''Casualty'' and ''Holby City'' episodes, rather than under the ''Casualty@Holby City'' title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qy03r|title=Casualty, Series 24, Love Is a Battlefield|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qxzqn|title=Holby City, Series 12, Downstairs Upstairs|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> ''Casualty''{{'s}} series producer Oliver Kent commented that, while it is "fantastic" to be able to produce crossover episodes, they are logistically difficult,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s18/casualty/news/a158194/casualty-holby-city-crossover-planned.html|title='Casualty', 'Holby City' crossover planned |last=Green|first=Kris|date=5 June 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref> and it is unlikely that another ''Casualty@Holby City'' episode will be produced in the "foreseeable future". In September 2010, ''Holby City''{{'s}} nurse [[Donna Jackson]] ([[Jaye Jacobs]]) appeared in ''Casualty'', and Kent hopes that characters from the two shows will begin to crossover two or three times a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s18/casualty/news/a228848/casualty-plans-more-holby-crossovers.html|title='Casualty' plans more 'Holby' crossovers|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 June 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref>

===Other appearances===
In June 2002, cast members from ''Holby City'' and ''Casualty'' competed against the ''EastEnders'' cast for the first ''[[Sport Relief]]'' fundraiser, in a segment dubbed "Sport in the Square".

===Critical response===
''Holby City'' has attracted comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable. In November 2002, John Whiston, then head of drama at [[Granada Television#Takeover bids|Granada Television]], accused the BBC of producing "ersatz parodies" of ITV drama, commenting that: "With ''Holby City'' cloned out of ''Casualty'', the BBC has even ended up copying itself."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article828295.ece|title=ITV win Miss Marple in ratings battle |last=Snoddy|first=Raymond|date=13 November 2003|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London}}</ref> Paul Hoggart of ''[[The Times]]'' has written that the differences between the two shows are "mild", calling ''Holby City'': "''Casualty''{{'s}} cute little sister".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article871323.ece|title=Paul Hoggart: Television |last=Hoggart|first=Paul|date=3 May 2003|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London}}</ref> [[Kevin Lygo]], director of television at Channel 4, referred to ''Holby City'' as "sudsy drama", deeming it, ''Casualty'' and ''HolbyBlue'' "all decent programmes, but strikingly similar in many aspects of their tone and construction."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/kevin-lygo-on-broadcasting-446768.html|title=Kevin Lygo on Broadcasting|first=Kevin|last=Lygo|authorlink=Kevin Lygo|work=[[The Independent]]|date=30 April 2007|accessdate=7 August 2010|location=London}}</ref> ''Holby City'' has also been unfavourably compared with the American medical drama ''ER''.

On several occasions, people within the television and entertainment industry have suggested that ''Holby City'' is a waste of the television [[licence fee]], with some suggesting that it ought to be cancelled. In August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] criticised BBC programming as being "humdrum" and "formulaic", saying of ''Holby City'' and the police procedural ''[[Mersey Beat]]'': "One begins to wonder what really is the point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2194979.stm|title=TV watchdog raps 'humdrum' BBC|publisher=BBC News|date=15 August 2002|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> Then head of BBC drama [[Jane Tranter]] responded that Bolt's examples were "highly selective" as well as "hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like ''Holby City'' – week in, week out".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2198497.stm|title=BBC hits back at 'humdrum' tag|publisher=BBC News|date=16 August 2002|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told ''The Guardian'': "Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2207205.stm|title=Slanging match over BBC output|first=Torin|last=Douglas|publisher=BBC News|date=21 August 2002|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> Also in 2002, David Cox of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' criticised BBC One's 2001 Christmas schedule, for airing ''Holby City'' against a contemporary version of ''[[Othello]]''. On this basis, Cox advocated the abolition of the licence fee, explaining: "The BBC was invented in a period when the elite decided what the population should know.

''Holby City'' was praised by campaigners for the [[Royal National Institute for Deaf People]] (RNID) in October 2003, when an episode which coincided with "Learn To Sign Week" used deaf actors, and featured characters communicating through [[British Sign Language]]. RNID chief executive John Low stated: "Too often individuals have to rely on family members or friends to communicate complicated personal information to professionals. This is the reason the RNID is calling on the government to channel funding into the training of British Sign Language interpreters who could then be available to NHS staff treating deaf patients." Stokes commented: "The writer had a great story he wanted to tell – for us, that's what matters first and foremost."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3180550.stm|title=Holby signs way forward|last=Adams-Spink|first=Geoff|date=13 October 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> A 2008 report into ethnic diversity on television, commissioned by Channel 4, cited ''Holby City'' as a positive example of "diverse British programm[ing]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7511439.stm|title=TV soaps 'stereotype minorities'|date=17 July 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> Five years previously in 2003, former BBC host [[Sir Ludovic Kennedy]] complained that ethnic minorities were over-represented on television, prompting a BBC spokeswoman to explain that ''Holby City'' has more ethnic characters as it is set in an area where minorities account for up to 30% of the population.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3142568.stm|title=Row over black TV stars|date=26 September 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> According to the 2001 census, the population of Bristol – which the city of Holby is loosely based upon – is 88% white and 12% ethnic minorities.

===Realism===
The show has been criticised for its lack of realism. Former nurse Vici Hoban commented in February 2004 that there existed three stereotypes with regards to nurses: "sex object, doctor's handmaiden, or angel". She felt that media portrayal had increased these misconceptions, observing that with "the syringe-toting serial killer [[Kelly Yorke|Kelly]] in ''Holby City'', realism has never been top of TV's agenda." However, Hoban felt that the worst offender at the time was the Channel 4 medical drama ''[[No Angels (TV series)|No Angels]]'', which she described as: "so inaccurate that it makes ''Holby City'' look like a factual documentary."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1027700.ece|title=Reality check-up |last=Hoban|first=Vici|date=28 February 2008|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London}}</ref> ''No Angels'' creator [[Toby Whithouse]] defended his series, stating that ''Holby City'' presents an unfair representation of nursing, deceiving viewers into believing that nursing "is a nice, clean job full of handsome doctors." Whithouse observed that the content of ''Holby City'' is defined by the watershed, describing real nursing work in contrast as "very post-watershed".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/angels-with-dirty-faces-570181.html|title=Angels with dirty faces |last=Gilbert|first=Gerard|date=16 February 2002|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=5 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref> In November 2009, Antony Sumara, CEO of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Hospital Trust, wrote a column criticising ''Holby City'' for misrepresenting real hospital life.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8363860.stm|title=TV dramas 'misrepresent the NHS'  |last=Sumara|first=Antony|date=18 November 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref> [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' reviewed a December 2009 episode poorly, finding it "astonishing" that any patients leave Holby General alive, as the staff are "so busy looking stricken or lovelorn at each other".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/last-nights-television--holby-city-bbc1-the-many-faces-of-june-whitfield-bbc2-1852733.html|title= Last Night's Television – Holby City, BBC1; The Many Faces of June Whitfield, BBC2|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|date=30 December 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=30 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

In December 2003, ''The Times''{{'}} Libby Purves wrote a critical opinion piece, observing that ''Holby City''{{'s}} medical staff are often depicted getting drunk in clubs, but afterwards are able to function properly at work, and that as a result, alcohol "is made to look innocent".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/libby_purves/article840498.ece|title=My name is television and I'm an alcoholic |last=Purves|first=Libby|date=30 December 2003|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London}}</ref> In October 2004, Canon [[Kenyon Wright]], chair of Alcohol Focus Scotland, criticised an episode of ''Holby City'' which saw doctors downing tequila slammers, stating that it glamorised irresponsible drinking.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article501123.ece|title=Canon attacks soaps for fostering binge-drinking |last=Macaskill|first=Mark|date=31 October 2004|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London}}</ref> Similarly, in October 2007, drinks' industry body the [[Portman Group]] made an official complaint to communications regulator [[Ofcom]] about a scene in ''Holby City'' which depicted two medics drinking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work.

''Holby City'' has also been accused of medical inaccuracies. The [[British Medical Association]] denounced a January 2004 episode of the serial which portrayed [[organ donation]] being carried out despite withdrawal of consent by the patient's relatives. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: "This simply would not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1000105.ece|title=Transplant man has four kidneys |last=Hawkes|first=Nigel|date=22 January 2004|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London}}</ref> The British Medical Association later opined that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery.

[[Accident and emergency]] nurse John Hill stated: "In A&E it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received.

===Impact===
In October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an [[Accident & Emergency]] consultant at the [[Royal Sussex County Hospital]] in [[Brighton]] criticised the number of patients visiting the department for minor ailments without first contacting their [[general practitioner|GP]]. Ryan attributed this phenomenon to patients viewing ''Holby City'' and American medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', and falsely perceiving hospitals as glamorous.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article987369.ece|title=George Clooney is not at the local A&E |last=Chaudhuri|first=Anita|date=10 October 2000|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010|location=London}}</ref> A three-year Belgian research project, presented at a [[British Psychological Society]] meeting in September 2008, claimed that watching ''Holby City'' and similar medical dramas such as ''Casualty'' and ''ER'' had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, and those who watched more medical dramas were found to be up to 10% more fearful about their health, with females more affected than males. Dr Jan Van Mierlo of [[Hasselt University]] stated that further research was needed into the long-term impact of television.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7607755.stm|title=Medical TV 'feeds health fears'|date=10 September 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>

In 2008, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] strategists identified four archetypes based on TV programmes to help the party target [[swing voter]]s.

In January 2009, Jill Berry, president of the [[Girls' Schools Association]] and head teacher at the [[Dame Alice Harpur School]] in Bedford, cited medical dramas such as ''Holby City'' as an inspiring force in increasing numbers of female students deciding to pursue careers in medicine. Berry explained: "The girls see that as an exciting and dynamic way of life. They see it as making a difference to people's lives. It gives them a sense sometimes of the pressures, responsibility and adrenaline. Such TV programmes can be good, as long as they give a realistic impression."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article5500698.ece|title=Hospital dramas inspire girls to do medicine |last=Woolcock|first=Nicola|date=12 January 2009|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=5 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Similarly, consultant surgeon Andrew Raftery uses clips from ''Holby City'' as part of the [[University of Sheffield]] Outreach and Access to Medicine Scheme, to inspire pupils from under-represented social and educational backgrounds to pursue careers in medicine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/2895691.stm|title=Is there a doctor in your house?|last=Baker|first=Mike|date=29 March 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref>
