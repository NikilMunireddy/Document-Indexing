'''Huddersfield Giants''' are an English professional [[rugby league]] club from [[Huddersfield]],[[West Yorkshire]], [[George Hotel, Huddersfield|the birthplace of rugby league]],who play in the [[Super League]] competition. They play their home games at the [[John Smith's Stadium]] which is shared with [[Huddersfield Town F.C.]]. Huddersfield is also one of the original twenty-two rugby clubs that formed the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] in 1895, making them one of the world's first rugby league teams. They have won 7 [[Rugby Football League Championship|Championships]] and 6 [[Challenge Cup]]s, but have not won a major trophy since 1962, some 53 years ago.

The club, particularly amongst older supporters, is sometimes referred to as '''Fartown''', named after [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield|the ground]] and area of the town from which they came from,which they occupied up until 1992, which is located in the [[Fartown, Huddersfield|Fartown]] district of Huddersfield. The club was known as '''Huddersfield Barracudas''' from 1984–88 and '''Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants''' (after a merger with [[Sheffield Eagles (1984)|the original Sheffield Eagles]]) for the [[Super League V|2000 season]].

They play in a distinctive strip of a claret shirt with thin gold hoops, claret shorts and claret and gold hooped socks and are currently sponsored by Bond It.<ref>http://www.giantsrl.com/news/article/2942/sponsorship-boost-for-huddersfield-giants</ref> They have rivalries with [[Warrington Wolves]], [[Leeds Rhinos]], [[Bradford Bulls]], [[Halifax RLFC|Halifax]] and [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]].

==History==

===1848-1894: Foundation and early years===
The earliest record of a [[football]] match being played in the Huddersfield area is in 1848, when a team of men from [[Hepworth, West Yorkshire|Hepworth]] took on a team of men from [[Holmfirth]] near Whnuil Bank in Holmfirth. Hepworth won a close fought game which "exhibited the usual amount of confusions, bloody noses, etc" and took the prize of £5 which had been jointly donated by each side.

There appears to have been no formal structure to sport in the [[Huddersfield]] area until the opening of the Apollo Gymnasium on 3 August 1850. At this time the gymnasium was the only venue in the town where young men could take part in physical activities, it offered the opportunity to participate in [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[bowling]], [[cricket]] and many other sports.

In 1864 the Apollo Gymnasium was turned into the Gymnasium Theatre. The athletes of the gymnasium responded by forming a more organised athletics association. In an advertisement headed "Huddersfield Athletic Club" they invited "gentlemen desirous of becoming members" to a public meeting at 8 o'clock on the evening of 16 November 1864 at the Queen Hotel. The meeting went ahead, a hundred names were registered and a committee was formed. Within a month a new gymnasium was in service in a basement on Back John William Street.

On 27 January 1866 twenty members of the Huddersfield Athletic Club agreed to play a football match against twenty of the Huddersfield Rifle Corps at Rifle Field in Trinity Street. Although the result was a scoreless draw, a large crowd was attracted. In light of this, the Huddersfield Athletic Club agreed to start a football section which was to start at the beginning of December 1866. Initially the Huddersfield Athletic Club made no contribution to the support of the football club and each paying member was forced to pay a subscription of 2s 6d. As the football club grew, it became a useful recruiting tool for the Huddersfield Athletic Club. In 1869 six matches were played and by 1870 three of the club's players had been selected to represent [[Yorkshire]]. By 1872 there were so many players that a second team was formed.

The growth in popularity of the club and the need for better facilities led to the Huddersfield Athletic Club approaching St John's Cricket Club with a proposal to merge the two clubs. St John's Cricket Club had been formed in 1866 at Hillhouse and had moved to [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield|Fartown ground]]. By 1875, when amalgamation talks began, over £800 had been spent on developing the new ground. At a meeting on 27 November 1875, at the Thornhill Arms Inn the two clubs agreed to merge to form the Huddersfield Cricket and Athletics Club. The motion was passed by 55 votes to 37.

Initially the football section stayed at Rifle Field, but alterations made in the summer of 1878 meant that rugby could begin at the start of the 1878–79 season with the visit of Manchester Rangers on 2 November. The new ground would become the club's home for 114 years and would provide the club's famous "Fartown" nickname.

===1895-1920s: Northern Union and golden years===
In 1895 the club were founder members of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]], (later the [[Rugby Football League]]).

The club has seen many ups and downs in its long history, but for the first 60 years of rugby league it was one of the powerhouses of the game, with only [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] as rivals in terms of trophies won.

[[Harold Wagstaff]] was only fifteen years and one hundred and seventy-five days old when he played his first match for Huddersfield, against [[Bramley Buffaloes|Bramley]] in November 1906. At the time, he was the youngest first-team player the game had seen, he had signed on for a £5 signing-on fee.

Huddersfield beat the touring 1908–09 Kangaroos 5–3. They were impressed enough with stand-off [[Albert Rosenfeld]] to sign him up that evening along with Australian Dual Code International [[Pat Walsh (rugby league footballer)|Pat Walsh]] one of the best forwards of the Kangaroos. Rosenfeld played his first game against [[Broughton Rangers]] on 11 September 1909.

The club's golden period came around the time of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The club was able to assemble a team of players from across the [[British Empire]] who swept all before them. Known as "The Team of All Talents", they were led by [[Harold Wagstaff]] and are still regarded as one of the finest football teams to have ever played. In the five years leading up to the First World War they won 13 trophies.

Two members of the team, centre [[Harold Wagstaff]] and wing [[Albert Rosenfeld]] were honoured by inclusion in the original [[Rugby League Hall of Fame]]. They were later joined by the Cumbrian second row [[Douglas Clark (rugby league)|Douglas Clark]]. Of just seventeen players to be elected to the Hall of Fame, no fewer than three were teammates in that famous Huddersfield side. In total, Huddersfield boast five representatives in the Hall of Fame, more than any other club.

The particular fame of "The Team of All Talents" sprung from their extraordinary three quarter play. In 1911–12, Rosenfeld became the first player to score more than 50 tries in a season – a feat previously thought to be impossible. That season he scored 78. His wing partner, [[Stan Moorhouse]] scored 52. In 1912–13, Rosenfeld scored 56, and then in 1913–14 he broke his own record with 80 tries, a record which stands to this day.

On 28 February 1914, the club defeated Swinton Park by a record 119–2 (Rosenfeld contributing 7 tries) in a [[Challenge Cup]] tie at Fartown. The record would stand until 26 November 1994 when the [[Huddersfield]] club broke their own [[World Record]] by defeating [[Blackpool Borough#Blackpool Gladiators|Blackpool Gladiators]] 142–4 in a Challenge Cup tie at the [[Galpharm Stadium|McAlpine Stadium]] – centre Greg Austin scoring 9 tries on his way to 52 tries that season, a [[world record]] for a centre. In the 1914–15 season they became only the second team to win "[[All Four Cups|all four cups]]" when they lifted the Championship, the [[Challenge Cup]], the [[Rugby league county cups|Yorkshire Cup]], and the [[rugby league county leagues|Yorkshire League]]. Huddersfield's dominance prior to the First World War was such that they went unbeaten in 38 consecutive matches before the suspension of the league in 1915.

Huddersfield did not take part in the 1918–19 season. In the 1919–20 season, the first five games were won for a 43 match unbeaten run over six years which still stands as a record today. The unbeaten run consisted of 28 league matches, 8 Yorkshire Cup-ties, 5 Challenge Cup-ties and 2 League Championship play-offs. In addition, Huddersfield were drawing 8–8 in a Yorkshire Cup-tie that was abandoned because of fog and replayed.

The Yorkshire Cup and Yorkshire League trophies were already won when Huddersfield met Wigan in the Challenge Cup final which resulted in a 21–10 victory. [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] were defeated in the Championship semi-final and Hull waited at Headingley as Huddersfield strove for a clean sweep of silverware. Huddersfield were missing five players who were touring Australasia with [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and Hull won 3–2.

Albert Rosenfeld's last game for the club was on 2 April 1921, a cup-tie against Leeds.

===Post war===

In the first full season after the war, a new record transfer fee of £1,650 was set when [[Dewsbury Rams|Dewsbury]] bought [[Full-back (rugby league)|full-back]] [[Bill Davies (rugby league)|Bill Davies]] from Huddersfield.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Tony|title=Rugby League in Twentieth Century Britain: A Social and Cultural History|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=[[United Kingdom]]|page=87|url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=J6nXcpxXzWsC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

Huddersfield won the League Championship in 1949, beating Warrington 13–12 in the final at [[Maine Road]] in front of what was at the time a world record crowd of 75,194. This capitalised on a season which also brought home the Yorkshire League title.

The highest attendance at Fartown to watch a Huddersfield game was 32,912 against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] on 4 March 1950. More success followed in the 1950 season as Huddersfield retained the Yorkshire League title and reached another Championship final at [[Maine Road]]. However, on this occasion Wigan proved too strong, winning 20 points to 12. Huddersfield did, however, win the Yorkshire cup with a 16-3 victory over Castleford at Headingley.

On Saturday 17 November 1951, in an ordinary league game, Australian [[Lionel Cooper]] scored a club record ten tries, as Huddersfield defeated [[Keighley Cougars|Keighley]] 48–3 at Fartown.

By the end of the 1950s, Huddersfield had won 3 Yorkshire cup finals, in 1950–51, 1952–53 and 1957–58, and the Challenge Cup final, in 1952–53. Huddersfield beat [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] 15 – 10 in the 1953 Challenge Cup Final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].

[[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats|Wakefield Trinity]] beat Huddersfield 16–10 in the 1960 [[Rugby league county cups|Yorkshire Cup]] final at [[Headingley Stadium#Headingley Carnegie Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]] on 29 October 1960.<ref>Hoole, Les (2004). ''Wakefield Trinity RLFC – FIFTY GREAT GAMES''. Breedon Books. ISBN 1-85983-429-9</ref>

In the 1961–62 season Huddersfield were beaten by Wakefield in the Challenge Cup final but then the following week fortunes were reversed and Huddersfield won the Championship play off final at Odsal. This is the last major trophy the club collected.

In 1962, the league was split into East and West of the Pennines; Huddersfield and [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] met at Headingley, Leeds in the first final of the [[Rugby league county leagues|Eastern Division]] Championship on Saturday 10 November 1962.

Reigning Champions Huddersfield were favourites to lift the Eastern Division title, especially as Rovers were missing five first choice players with injuries. The Robins, however, set the early pace and were 10–0 up after 30 minutes. Despite a rally by Huddersfield, Rovers hung on to win 13–10.

===1970-1995: Decline and revival===

By the 1970s, the club had become a shadow of its former self, the old Fartown ground had fallen into disrepair and the club frequently finished in the lower reaches of the league. Local businessman, John Bailey, took a controlling interest in the stadium, the club and the pavilion. In 1984, in an attempt to revive the club, Huddersfield adopted the moniker 'Barracudas' and Fartown was renamed ''Arena 84''. As the crowds continued to stay away, it became clear that Bailey could not stem the decline.

Huddersfield Rugby League Club was on the point of collapse. A new board of directors took over in 1989 when and injected some much needed financial resources into the club. The 'Barracudas' and 'Arena 84' were dropped for the 1988–89 season. [[Nigel Stephenson]] was appointed as coach and Huddersfield were helped by several clubs, in particular [[Featherstone Rovers]], to put a reasonable squad together. As well as beginning to improve the playing staff, the new owners also carried out a considerable amount of work on the Fartown stadium and by the end of the 1989–90 season significant progress was being made. Average crowds topped 1,500 for the first time since the 1970s.

Shortly after the 1991–92 season had begun, [[Alex Murphy (rugby league)|Alex Murphy]] took over as coach in 1991. Huddersfield were the first ever champions of the newly formed third division in 1991–92. Promotion to the Second Division had been achieved, and there was pride once again in the famous claret and gold jersey. The expense of this achievement cost the club dearly and a new financial crisis arrived. However, along came a bright new consortium who began to shape the future of the club once again. The club left Fartown and moved to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town's]] home ground at [[Leeds Road]] in 1992.

In 1993 six teams were invited to take part in an inaugural European Clubs Championship, the six teams consisted of two from the USSR; Tiraspol and Moscow Magicians, two from France; [[AS Carcassonne]] and [[XIII Catalan]] and [[Batley Bulldogs]] and Huddersfield. Only weeks before departure the plans collapsed as both Soviet clubs pulled out due to financial difficulties, closely followed by [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]], Carcassonne who had just five players available due to a players’ strike. This left just Huddersfield and XIII Catalan to meet in the "final" in [[Barcelona]]. The lead changed hands three times before Huddersfield held on for a 23–22 victory.

Huddersfield were promoted as 3rd Division Champions in April 1993 but the receiver was called in, in May 1994. Huddersfield took a share in the new McAlpine Stadium (now known as [[John Smith's Stadium]]) in 1994. In March 1994, Huddersfield went into administration and the receivers sacked Murphy as coach.

In 1995 the first team reached the final of the Second Division premiership competition at [[Old Trafford]].

===1996-1998: Summer era===

In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural [[Super League]] season and changed from a winter to a summer season.<ref name="hadfield20-12-95">{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rugbys-pounds-87m-deal-gives-murdoch-transfer-veto-1526582.html |publisher= The Independent |title=Rugby's pounds 87m deal gives Murdoch transfer veto |author=Dave Hadfield |date=20 December 1995 |accessdate=2009-05-06 |location=London}}</ref> As the sport in Britain entered a new era it would be two years before Huddersfield rose again to the top level of the game. [[Ken Davy]] took over as chairman of Huddersfield and "Giants" was added to the team name.

[[Steve Ferres]] took over as coach. [[Garry Schofield]] joined Huddersfield for a six-figure sum. Ken Davy’s first trophy came in 1997 at Old Trafford where Huddersfield beat Hull 18–0 in the Divisional Championship at Old Trafford. In 1998, due to the collapse of [[Paris St Germain]] the club was promoted to Super League despite only finishing second in the second division. After helping the Giants into Super League, Schofield took over the coaching reins replacing [[Steve Ferres]] with Huddersfield saying that they needed a full-time coaching staff. [http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-ferres-stunned-as-schofield-steps-in-1293628.html]

However, dark days continued, the team struggled to compete, winning only a handful of games. [[Garry Schofield]] was removed as Huddersfield Giants coach after 13 games, having picked up two wins. Schofield was replaced by his assistant [[Phil Veivers]] as caretaker coach. Schofield later successfully sued the club for unfair dismissal. Interestingly, it took Huddersfield's next three coaches more than 13 games to register two wins, with the club so far off the pace in their early Super League years.

===1999-2000: Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants===

[[Mal Reilly]] then took over with Veivers back as assistant coach. Huddersfield finished bottom of Super League and Reilly was sacked at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/rugby_league/563738.stm | work=BBC News | title=Giants sued by former coach | date=13 December 1999}}</ref> In late 1999, the club merged with [[Sheffield Eagles (1984)|Sheffield Eagles]] almost purely for financial reasons. Sheffield coach [[John Kear]] took over as head coach of the merged side. They were officially known as the Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants, but more popularly as 'Shuddersfield'. The Association of Premiership Clubs blocked proposals for a separate Huddersfield team in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/attempted-revival-of-don-valley-club-hits-the-buffers-741474.html |title=Attempted revival of Don Valley club hits the buffers |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 November 1999 |first=Dave |last=Hadfield}}</ref> They played two home games in Sheffield at [[Bramall Lane]] with the others in Huddersfield, the away strip was in the Sheffield Eagles colours. In the 2000 season Huddersfield-Sheffield won only four games, three of them against rivals [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]]. This arrangement lasted only a season before the Huddersfield name was reverted to, due to rejection from both sets of fans. In the four seasons between 1998 and 2001, they lost 81 times in 99 matches, avoiding relegation for a variety of reasons. [[File:Hudds 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Huddersfield Giants in the [[2006 Challenge Cup|2006 Challenge Cup Final]]]] John Kear was sacked as coach and Veivers had a second spell as interim coach.

===2001-2004: Relegation===
Little-known Australian [[Tony Smith (Australian rugby league coach)|Tony Smith]] was appointed as coach for the 2001 season after a rigorous process. This did not seem to have any effect as the club lost the first 14 matches of the season, culminating in a 78-point embarrassment by [[Bradford Bulls]]. This low point became a pivotal day for the club, however. The club won 6 and drew one of the remaining 14 games, only finishing bottom of the table after Wakefield's appeal against a 4-point salary cap deduction was successful. [[Widnes Vikings]] won the NFP competition that year and the club was seen to be fit to play in Super League. The Giants were finally relegated after their best season in Super League.

In 2002 Huddersfield Giants remained a full-time professional team despite playing in the [[Rugby League National Leagues|Northern Ford Premiership]]. The club went unbeaten for the entire league season, drawing only one match and winning a record equalling 29 games. Along the way the team accumulated 1,156 points to equal the record for points in a league season achieved in 8 more games by [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] in 1986. The team won the [[Northern Rail Cup|Buddies Cup]], as it was then known, and also the NFP Grand Final against Leigh in October 2002, which secured promotion back to the Super League for the 2003 season.
[[File:Giants 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Huddersfield following their defeat to [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] in the [[2006 Challenge Cup|2006 Challenge Cup Final]]]]
In 2003 under Smith, the Giants established themselves as a Super League club, finishing 10th, above [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]] and [[Halifax RLFC|Halifax Blue Sox]]. After guiding the Giants back to Super League, Smith and assistant coach [[Brian McDermott (rugby league)|Brian McDermott]] moved onto Headingley to take control of the [[Leeds Rhinos]]. St Helens assistant coach and former Hull forward [[Jon Sharp]] was appointed head coach for 2004 and the team improved again, finishing 7th in the league and making their first appearance in the Challenge Cup semi-finals since 1971.

===2005-2009: Resurgence===
The beginning of the [[2005 Super League season]] saw the club make its highest-profile signing in fifty years when Australian centre [[Michael De Vere]] signed from the [[Brisbane Broncos]], becoming the club's first Australian international player since [[Pat Devery]] in the 1950s.

For the kick off of the 2006 season the club unveiled a host of new signings to strengthen the squad, including the iconic New Zealand international scrum-half [[Robbie Paul]]. After a convincing victory over [[Salford City Reds|Salford]] in the quarter final, the Giants faced [[Leeds Rhinos]] (ironically coached by Tony Smith) in the Challenge Cup semi-final at [[Odsal Stadium]], Bradford. Against all the odds, massive underdogs Huddersfield pulled out what is regarded as possibly their best performance of modern times, Stuart Donlan and [[Chris Nero]] with 2 tries apiece and [[Michael De Vere]] with a try and five goals steering them to a 30–12 victory. Huddersfield lost the [[2006 Challenge Cup|2006 Challenge Cup Final]] to eventual Super League champions [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] 42–12, but the performance heralded the best Huddersfield achievement since 1970.

{{see also|2007 Huddersfield Giants season|2009 Huddersfield Giants season}}
The start of the 2007 season saw the Giants make some exciting signings, including [[Wests Tigers]] trio, [[Jamahl Lolesi]], [[John Skandalis]] and [[Shane Elford]], as well as [[Ryan Hudson]]. The season started horrendously for the Giants in terms of results. After seven consecutive losses they found themselves marooned at the foot of the table, 5 points adrift, but ironically with the second best defence in the league. Large sections of the fans began to question the coach's ability and as a result crowds began to dwindle and morale was beginning to suffer.

By the end of May, the picture was totally different. The Giants had a [[Challenge Cup]] quarter-final to look forward to and had been on their longest ever winning streak since joining the Super League, nine games including two wins in the Challenge Cup including a 36–12 victory over [[Bradford Bulls]] in front of the [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky Television]] cameras on 18 May, the Giants first victory over the Bulls since joining the top flight.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/6658365.stm | accessdate = 18 May 2007 | work=BBC News | title=Huddersfield 36–12 Bradford | date=18 May 2007}}</ref> In addition, John Sharp was named consecutively as Coach of the Month for April<ref>[http://ichuddersfield.icnetwork.co.uk/examiner/giants/news/tm_headline=award-is-for-all-the-club%2D-says-sharp%26method=full%26objectid=18962326%26siteid=50060-name_page.html Award is for all the club, says Sharp].

''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]].'' Retrieved on 25 May 2007.</ref>

The Giants' winning run came to an unexpected end in a shock 14–12 defeat by [[Salford City Reds]] at the Willows. They had been overwhelming favourites with fans and bookies. Following the 2006 Challenge Cup Final appearance, Giants continued their progress by beating Wakefield for the 9th consecutive occasion to qualify for the play-offs for the first time and a match against [[Hull F.C.|Hull]] at the [[KC Stadium]], which was lost 22–16.

The opening 2 matches in 2008 were lost, to Leeds Rhinos and to Bradford Bulls. However the 3rd match saw Sharp's team beat Castleford Tigers 64-12. After a 48-0 loss to Catalan Dragons and a run of disappointing results, Sharp's contract was terminated by the Giants. Following Sharp's departure from the club in 2008, [[Kieron Purtill]] had a brief spell as caretaker coach alongside Paul Anderson.

Club chairman Ken Davy brought in a new head coach, [[Nathan Brown (rugby league born 1973)|Nathan Brown]], and a new set of new players for the 2009 season. New signing [[Brett Hodgson]] went on to win the [[Super League]] Man of Steel award and the Giants also picked up awards for Club of the year and Coach of the year. The Giants finishing 3rd in the league and managing to reach the final of the [[Challenge Cup]] where they lost 25–16 to league rivals [[Warrington Wolves]], the team responded to their cup defeat by finishing the season in 3rd place but lost in the play-offs twice. Firstly to [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] away from home and then at home to [[Catalans Dragons]].

===2010-present: League Leaders===
After yet another promising recruitment drive from Huddersfield Giants, they were yet again tipped to make big strides in the [[Super League]] in 2012. This season really proved as a roller-coaster ride for the "Fartown Faithful" who saw their team go from 1st in [[Super League]] to finishing 7th and yet again failing to make an impact on the play-offs. After a poor dip in form [[Ken Davy]] decided it was time for change and terminated the contracts of coach [[Nathan Brown (rugby league born 1973)|Nathan Brown]] and captain [[Kevin Brown (rugby league)|Kevin Brown]]. [[Paul Anderson (rugby league)|Paul Anderson]] was given the task of finishing the season as best as possible.

In 2013, Huddersfield Giants won the [[League Leader's Shield]], the first time they have finished top of the league in 81 years. 5 of the team were selected for the [[Super League Dream Team]], more than any other club.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/23850876 |title=Super League: Huddersfield Giants 40-0 Wakefield  |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=1 September 2012 |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref>

In 2014 the club celebrates the 100th anniversary of the legendary "''Team of all Talents'' who won [[All Four Cups]] in 1914, by playing in heritage shirts to commemorate the feat <ref>http://www.giantsrl.com/product/117364</ref>

==Stadiums==

===1878-1992: Fartown Ground===
Fartown was originally a cricket ground before being occupied by Huddersfield Giants in 1878. It hosted two Challenge Cup finals in 1908 and 1910 and hosted one football match. During the 1980s the stadium fell into disrepair as Huddersfield struggled to attract crowds. Huddersfield left Fartown in 1992 but still used it as a training ground until 2004 and it still hosts amateur games.

===1992-1994: Leeds Road===
Huddersfield ground shared with [[Huddersfield Town]] at Leeds Road from 1992 to 1994.

===1994-Present: John Smith's Stadium===
In 1994 Huddersfield took a share in the then named McAlpine Stadium with Huddersfield Town after they both moved from Leeds Road. The stadium has hosted Challenge Cup semi finals on multiple occasions.
