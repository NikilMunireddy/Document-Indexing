'''County Donegal''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|n|ɨ|ɡ|ɔː|l}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ʌ|n|ɨ|ˈ|ɡ|ɔː|l}}; {{lang-ga|Contae Dhún na nGall}}) is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is part of the [[Border Region]] and is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]]. It is named after the town of [[Donegal]] (''Dún na nGall'') in the south of the county. [[Donegal County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local council]] for the county and [[Lifford]] serves as the county town. The population of the county was 161,137 according to the 2011 census. It has also been known as (County) '''Tyrconnell''' (''Tír Chonaill''), after the historic [[Tyrconnell|territory of the same name]].

==Geography and political subdivisions==
In terms of size and area, it is the largest county in [[Ulster]] and the fourth-largest county in all of [[Ireland]]. Uniquely, County Donegal shares a small border with only one other county in the [[Republic of Ireland]] – [[County Leitrim]]. The greater part of its land border is shared with three counties of [[Northern Ireland]]: [[County Londonderry]], [[County Tyrone]] and [[County Fermanagh]]. This geographic isolation from the rest of the Republic has led to Donegal people maintaining a distinct cultural identity<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donegallibrary.ie/quicklinks/aboutdonegal/ |title=Donegal Library Services |publisher=Donegallibrary.ie |date= |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> and has been used to market the county with the [[slogan]] "Up here it's different".<ref name = "IE NW">[http://www.irelandnorthwest.ie/?id=28  Ireland Northwest].</ref> While [[Lifford]] is the [[county town]], [[Letterkenny]] is by far the largest town in the county with a population of 19,588. Letterkenny and the nearby city of [[Derry]] form the main economic axis of the northwest of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/16086 |title=Derry and Donegal Sinn Féin Councillors join forces to push North West tourism |publisher=Sinnfein.ie |date=16 February 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> Indeed, what became the City of Derry was officially part of County Donegal up until 1610.<ref name="Brian Lacy 1983">Brian Lacy (Editor), ''Archaeological Survey of County Donegal'', P. 1.

===Baronies===
[[Image:Co Donegal.jpg|thumb|Poison Glen (''Gleann Nimhe''), in North West Donegal.]]

There are eight historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in the county:
* [[Banagh]] 
* [[Boylagh]] 
* Inishowen East
* Inishowen West 
* [[Kilmacrennan]] 
* Raphoe North
* Raphoe South 
* Tirhugh

===Informal districts===
The county may be informally divided into a number of traditional districts. There are two [[Gaeltacht]] districts in the west: [[The Rosses]] ({{lang-ga|Na Rosa}}), centred on the town of [[Dungloe]] ({{lang-ga|An Clochán Liath}}), and [[Gweedore]] ({{lang-ga|Gaoth Dobhair}}). Another Gaeltacht district is located in the north-west: [[Cloughaneely]] ({{lang-ga|Cloich Chionnaola}}), centred on the town of [[Falcarragh]] ({{lang-ga|An Fál Carrach}}). The most northerly part of the island of Ireland is the location for three [[peninsula]]s of outstanding natural beauty: [[Inishowen]], [[Fanad]] and [[Rosguill]]. The main population centre of Inishowen, Ireland's largest peninsula, is [[Buncrana]]. In the east of the county lies the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|Finn Valley]] (centred on [[Ballybofey]]). The Laggan district (not to be confused with the more famous [[Lagan Valley]] in the south of [[County Antrim]]) is centred on the town of [[Raphoe]]. [[File:Derry from the International Space Station 2013-03-17.jpg|thumb|Seen from Space: County Donegal with the Ulster coastline with [[Lough Swilly]] and [[Inishowen]] west of [[Derry]] and [[County Londonderry]] with [[Lough Foyle]] east thereof.]]

According to the 1841 Census, County Donegal had a population of 296,000 people. As a result of famine and emigration, the population had reduced by 41,000 by 1851 and further reduced by 18,000 by 1861. By the time of the 1951 Census the population was only 44% of what it had been in 1841.<ref>{{cite book | last=Patterson, Edward M| year=1962 |title=The County Donegal Railways | publisher=David and Charles | location= Dawlish| pages=9–10 }}</ref> The 2006 Census, undertaken by the State's [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]], had County Donegal's population standing at 147,264. According to the [[Census of Ireland 2011|2011 Census]], the county's population had grown to 161,137.

===Physical geography===

[[File:SlieveLeague ToneMapped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Slieve League]] cliffs, the second tallest in Ireland]]
[[File:Glengesh Pass.jpg|thumb|left|Glengesh Pass, near [[Ardara, County Donegal|Ardara]]]]
[[File:Donegalmap.jpg|thumb|Map of County Donegal]]

The county is the most mountainous in [[Ulster]] consisting chiefly of two ranges of low mountains; the [[Derryveagh Mountains]] in the north and the [[Bluestack Mountains]] in the south, with [[Mount Errigal]] at {{convert|749|m|ft|0}} the highest peak. It has a deeply indented coastline forming natural [[sea lough]]s, of which both [[Lough Swilly]] and [[Lough Foyle]] are the most notable. The [[Slieve League]] cliffs are the sixth-highest sea cliffs in Europe, while [[Malin Head]] is the most northerly point on the island of Ireland.

The climate is temperate and dominated by the [[Gulf Stream]], with warm, damp summers and mild wet winters. Two permanently inhabited islands, [[Arranmore]] and [[Tory Island]], lie off the coast, along with a large number of islands with only transient inhabitants. Ireland's second longest river, the [[River Erne|Erne]], enters [[Donegal Bay]] near the town of [[Ballyshannon]]. The [[River Erne]], along with other Donegal waterways, has been dammed to produce [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. The [[River Foyle]] separates part of County Donegal from parts of both counties [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]].

===Botany===
A survey of the macroscopic marine [[algae]] of County Donegal was published in 2003.<ref>Morton, O. 2003. The marine macroalgae of County Donegal, Ireland. ''Bull. Ir. biogeog. Soc.'' 27: 3 – 164</ref> The survey was compiled using the algal records held in the [[herbaria]] of the following institutions: the [[Ulster Museum]], [[Belfast]]; [[Trinity College, Dublin]]; [[National University of Ireland, Galway]], and the [[Natural History Museum, London]].

At various times in its history, it has been known as County '''Tirconaill''', County '''Tirconnell''' or County '''Tyrconnell''' ({{lang-ga|Tír Chonaill}}). The former was used as its official name during 1922–1927.<ref>Renamed "County Tirconaill" 1922 by resolution of the county council.(''Place Name Confusion{{spaced ndash}}Donegal or Tirconaill'', The Irish Times, 24 April 1924). After historians and Gaelic scholars pointed out that the historic territory of Tirconaill did not include the whole county, the name Donegal was re-adopted in 1927 (''Back to "Donegal"'', The Irish Times, 22 November 1927).</ref> This is in reference to both the old ''[[túath]]'' of [[Tyrconnell|Tír Chonaill]] and the [[Earl of Tyrconnell|earldom]] that succeeded it.

County Donegal is famous for being the home of the once mighty Clann Dálaigh, whose most famous branch were the Clann Ó Domhnaill, better known in English as the [[O'Donnell dynasty|O'Donnell Clan]]. Until around 1600, the O'Donnells were one of Ireland's richest and most powerful ''[[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]]'' (native Irish) ruling-families. Within the Province of [[Ulster]] only the [[O'Neill dynasty|Clann Uí Néill]] (known in English as the O'Neill Clan) of modern [[County Tyrone]] were more powerful. The O'Donnells were Ulster's second most powerful ''clan'' or ruling-family from the early 13th century through to the start of the 17th century. For several centuries the O'Donnells ruled [[Tyrconnell|Tír Chonaill]], a Gaelic kingdom in West Ulster that covered almost all of modern County Donegal. The head of the O'Donnell family had the titles ''An Ó Domhnaill'' (meaning ''The O'Donnell'' in English) and ''Rí Thír Chonaill'' (meaning ''King of Tír Chonaill'' in English). Based at [[Donegal Castle]] in ''Dún na nGall'' (modern [[Donegal|Donegal Town]]), the O'Donnell ''Kings of Tír Chonaill'' were traditionally ''inaugurated'' at Doon Rock near [[Kilmacrenan]]. O'Donnell royal or ''chiefly'' power was finally ended in what was then the newly created County Donegal in September 1607, following the [[Flight of the Earls]] from near [[Rathmullan]]. The modern ''County Arms of Donegal'' (dating from the early 1970s) was influenced by the design of the old O'Donnell royal arms. The ''County Arms'' is the official [[coat of arms]] of both County Donegal and Donegal County Council.

The modern County Donegal was [[shire]]d<ref name="Connolly2002pg129">Connolly, S.J., ''Oxford Companion to Irish History'', page 129. Oxford University Press, 2002. ISBN 978-0-19-923483-7</ref> by order of the English Crown in 1585. The English authorities at [[Dublin Castle]] formed the new county by amalgamating the old Kingdom of Tír Chonaill with the old Lordship of [[Inishowen]]. However, the English authorities were unable to establish control over Tír Chonaill and Inishowen until after the [[Siege of Kinsale|Battle of Kinsale]] in 1602. Full control over the new County Donegal was only achieved after the [[Flight of the Earls]] in September 1607. It was the centre of [[O'Doherty's Rebellion]] of 1608 with the key [[Battle of Kilmacrennan]] taking place there. The county was one of those 'planted' during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] from around 1610 onwards. What became the [[Derry|City of Derry]] was officially part of County Donegal up until 1610.<ref name="Brian Lacy 1983"/>

County Donegal was one of the worst affected parts of [[Ulster]] during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the late 1840s in Ireland. Vast swathes of the county were devastated by this catastrophe, many areas becoming permanently depopulated. Vast numbers of County Donegal's people emigrated at this time, chiefly through [[Londonderry Port]].

The [[Partition of Ireland]] in the early 1920s had a massive direct impact on County Donegal. [[Partition (politics)|Partition]] cut the county off, economically and administratively, from Derry, which had acted for centuries as the county's main port, transport hub and financial centre. Derry, together with west [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], was henceforward in a new, different [[jurisdiction]] officially called [[Northern Ireland]]. Partition also meant that County Donegal was now almost entirely cut off from the rest of the jurisdiction in which it now found itself, the new [[dominion]] called the [[Irish Free State]], which in April 1949 became the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Only a few miles of the county is physically connected by land to the rest of the Republic. The existence of a border cutting Donegal off from her natural hinterlands in Derry City and West Tyrone greatly exacerbated the economic difficulties of the county after partition. The county's economy is particularly susceptible, just like that of Derry City, to the currency fluctuations of the [[Euro]] against [[Pound sterling|sterling]].

Added to all this, in the late 20th century County Donegal was adversely affected by [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. The county suffered several bombings and assassinations. In June 1987, [[Constable]] Samuel McClean, a Donegal man who was a serving member of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], was shot dead by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] at his family home near [[Drumkeen]]. In May 1991, the prominent [[Sinn Féin]] politician [[Councillor]] [[Eddie Fullerton]] was assassinated by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] at his home in [[Buncrana]]. This added further to the economic and social difficulties of the county. However, the greater economic and administrative integration following the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of April 1998 has been of benefit to the county.

It has been labelled the 'forgotten county' by its own politicians, owing to the perception that it is ignored by the [[Irish Government]], even in times of crisis.<ref name="County 'wiped off crisis HQ maps'">[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/uk-ireland/county-wiped-off-crisis-hq-maps-14774878.html County 'wiped off crisis HQ maps'].

==Irish language==
[[File:Bunbeg - R258 - geograph.org.uk - 1177841.jpg|thumb|Road signs in Irish in the [[Gweedore]] Gaeltacht.]]

Much of the county is seen as being a bastion of [[Gaelic culture]] and the [[Irish language]], the Donegal [[Gaeltacht]] being the second-largest in the country. The version of the [[Irish language]] spoken in County Donegal is [[Ulster Irish]].

Of the Gaeltacht population of 24,744,<ref name="County Donegal"/> 16% of the county's total, 17,132 say they can speak Irish.<ref>[http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&Geog_Code=02#T3_300 Donegal Gaeltacht statistics]</ref> There are three Irish-speaking parishes: [[Gweedore]], [[The Rosses]] and [[Cloughaneely]]. Other Irish-speaking areas include [[Gaeltacht an Láir]]: [[Glencolmcille]], [[Fanad]] and [[Rosguill]], the islands of [[Arranmore|Aranmore]], [[Tory Island]] and [[Inishbofin, County Donegal|Inishbofin]]. Gweedore is the largest Irish-speaking parish, with over 5,000 inhabitants. All schools in the region use Irish as the language of instruction. One of the constituent colleges of [[National University of Ireland, Galway|NUI Galway]], [[Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge]], is based in [[Gweedore]].

There are 1,005 students attending the five [[Gaelscoil]]eanna and two [[Gaelcholáiste|Gaelcholáistí]] in the rest of the county. According to the 2006 Census, there are also 7,218 people who identify as being daily Irish speakers outside the Gaeltacht in the rest of the county.

==Government and politics==
[[File:Glenveagh Castle - geograph.org.uk - 395086.jpg|thumbnail|[[Glenveagh Castle]].]]
Donegal County Council (which has officially been in existence since 1899) has responsibility for local administration, and is headquartered at the County House in [[Lifford]].  Until 2014, there were also Town Councils in [[Letterkenny]], [[Bundoran]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Buncrana]].  The Town Councils were abolished in June 2014 when the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]] was implemented<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.act.2014.0001.pdf</ref> and their functions were taken over by Donegal County Council. Elections to the County Council take place every five years. Thirty seven councillors are elected using the system of [[Proportional representation]]-Single Transferable Vote (STV). For the purpose of elections the county is divided into 5 [[Municipal district (Ireland)|Muncipal Districts]] comprising the following [[local electoral area]]s: [[Donegal]] (6), [[Glenties]] (6), [[Inishowen]] (9), [[Letterkenny]] (10) and Stranorlar (6).

For general elections, the [[Donegal (Dáil Éireann constituency)|county-wide constituency]] elects five representatives to [[Dáil Éireann]]. For elections to the [[European Parliament]], the county is part of the [[Midlands–North-West (European Parliament constituency)|Midlands–North-West]] constituency.

Voters have a reputation nationally for  being "conservative and contrarian", the county having achieved prominence for having rejected the Fiscal Treaty in 2012 and both the [[Lisbon Treaty]] votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/donegal-says-yes-2101162-May2015/|title=Even Donegal voted YES in the marriage referendum|date=23 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224234950/http://www.thejournal.ie/donegal-says-yes-2101162-May2015/|archivedate=24 February 2016}}</ref>

===Freedom of Donegal===
The Freedom of Donegal is an award that is given to people who have been recognised for outstanding achievements on behalf of the people and [[county of Donegal]]. Such people include [[Daniel O' Donnell]], [[Phil Coulter]], [[Shay Given]], [[Packie Bonner]], [[Paddy Crerand]] and the [[Clannad|Brennan family]].
In 2009 the members of the 28th [[Infantry]] [[Battalion]] of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Irish Defence Forces]] were also awarded the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the County]] from [[Donegal County Council]] ''"in recognition of their longstanding service to the County of Donegal".''

==Access==
An extensive rail network used to exist throughout the county and was mainly operated by the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee]] and the [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway|Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company]] (known as the L. & L.S.R. or the Lough Swilly Company for short). Unfortunately all these lines were laid to a 3-foot gauge where the connecting lines were all laid to the Irish standard gauge of {{RailGauge|1600mm}}.  This meant that all goods had to be transhipped at Derry and Strabane.  Like all narrow gauge railways this became a major handicap after World War 1 when road transport began to seriously erode the railways goods traffic.  By 1953 the Lough Swilly had closed its entire railway system and become a bus and road haulage concern.  The County Donegal lasted until 1960 as it had largely dieselised its passenger trains by 1951. By the late 1950s major work was required to upgrade the track and the Irish Government was unwilling to supply the necessary funds, so 'the Wee Donegal', as it was affectionally known, was closed in 1960.   The [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)]] L.t.d. (the G.N.R.) also ran a line from [[Strabane]] through The Laggan, a district in the east of the county, along the [[River Foyle]] into Derry. However, the railway network within County Donegal was completely closed by 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.derryjournal.com/news/your-community/nostalgia/closure-of-derry-road-a-great-loss-to-ireland-1-3540020||title = Closure of the 'Derry Road' a great loss to Ireland – Derry Journal|accessdate = 20 August 2013}}</ref> Today, the closest railway station to the county is [[Londonderry railway station|Waterside Station]] in the City of Derry, which is operated by [[NI Railways|Northern Ireland Railways]] (N.I.R.).

County Donegal is served by both [[Donegal Airport]], located at Carrickfinn in [[The Rosses]] in the west of the county, and by [[City of Derry Airport]], located at [[Eglinton, County Londonderry|Eglinton]] to the east. The nearest main international airport to the county is [[Belfast International Airport]] (popularly known as Aldergrove Airport), which is located to the east at [[Aldergrove, County Antrim|Aldergrove]], near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim Town]], in [[County Antrim]], {{convert|92|km|abbr=on}} from Derry City and {{convert|127|km|abbr=on}} from Letterkenny.

==Culture==
[[File:Griahan of aileach.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Iron Age]] fortress [[Grianán of Aileach|Grianán Ailigh]].]]
The variant of the [[Irish language]] spoken in Donegal shares many traits with [[Scottish Gaelic]]. The Irish spoken in the Donegal [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking area) is of the [[Ulster Irish|Ulster dialect]], while [[Inishowen]] (parts of which only became English-speaking in the early 20th century) used the East Ulster dialect. [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] is often spoken in both the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|Finn Valley]] and The Laggan district of East Donegal. Donegal Irish has a strong influence on learnt Irish across Ulster.

Like other areas on the western seaboard of Ireland, Donegal has a distinctive [[Donegal fiddle tradition|fiddle tradition]] which is of world renown. Donegal is also well known for its songs which have, like the instrumental music, a distinctive sound. Donegal musical artists such as the bands [[Clannad]], [[The Pattersons]], and [[Altan (band)|Altan]] and solo artist [[Enya]], have had international success with traditional or traditional flavoured music. Donegal music has also influenced people not originally from the county including folk and pop singers [[Paul Brady]] and [[Phil Coulter]]. Singer [[Daniel O'Donnell]] has become a popular ambassador for the county. [[Popular music]] is also common, the county's most acclaimed rock artist being the [[Ballyshannon]]-born [[Rory Gallagher]]. Other famous acts to come out of Donegal include folk-rock band [[Goats Don't Shave]], Eurovision contestant [[Mickey Joe Harte]] and indie rock group [[The Revs]] and in more recent years bands such as In Their Thousands and Mojo Gogo have featured on the front page of ''[[Hot Press]]'' magazine.

Donegal has a long literary tradition in both Irish and English. The famous Irish [[navvy]]-turned-novelist [[Patrick MacGill]], author of many books about the experiences of Irish migrant [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] labourers in [[Great Britain|Britain]] at around the start of the 20th century, such as ''The Rat Pit'' and the autobiographical ''Children of the Dead End'', is from the [[Glenties]] area. There is a literary summer school in [[Glenties]] named in his honour. The novelist and socialist politician [[Peadar O'Donnell]] hailed from [[The Rosses]] in west Donegal. The poet [[William Allingham]] was also from Ballyshannon. Modern exponents include the [[Inishowen]] playwright and poet [[Frank McGuinness]] and the playwright [[Brian Friel]]. Many of Friel's plays are set in the fictional Donegal town of [[Ballybeg]].

Authors in Donegal have been creating works, like the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'', in [[Irish language|Gaelic]] and [[Latin]] since the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Irish philosopher [[John Toland]] was born in [[Inishowen]] in 1670. He was thought of as the original [[Freethought|freethinker]] by [[George Berkeley]]. Toland was also instrumental in the spread of freemasonry throughout [[Continental Europe]]. In modern Irish Donegal has produced famous, and sometimes controversial, authors such as the brothers [[Séamus Ó Grianna]] and [[Seosamh Mac Grianna]] from [[The Rosses]] and the contemporary (and controversial) Irish-language poet [[Cathal Ó Searcaigh]] from [[Gortahork]] in Cloughaneely, and where he is known to locals as ''Gúrú na gCnoc'' ('the Guru of the Hills').

Donegal is known for the beauty of its textiles, whose unique woolen blends are made of short threads with tiny bits of color blended in for a heathered effect. Sometimes they are woven in a rustic herringbone format and other times in more of a box weave of varied colors. These weaves are known as [[donegal tweed]]s (with a small 'd') and are world renowned.

Although approximately 85% of its population is [[Roman Catholic]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} County Donegal also has a sizeable [[Ulster Protestants|Protestant]] minority. Many Donegal Protestants trace their ancestors to settlers who arrived during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in the early 17th century. The [[Church of Ireland]] is the largest Protestant denomination but is closely rivalled by a large number of [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. The areas of Donegal with the highest percentage of Protestants are The Laggan area of East Donegal around [[Raphoe]], the [[River Finn (County Donegal)|Finn Valley]] and areas around Ramelton, Milford and Dunfanaghy – where their proportion reaches up to 30–45 percent. There is also a large Protestant population between [[Donegal|Donegal Town]] and [[Ballyshannon]] in the south of the county. In absolute terms, [[Letterkenny]] has the largest number of Protestants (over 1000) and is the most Presbyterian town (among those settlements with more than 3000 people) in the [[Republic of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The [[Earagail Arts Festival]] is held within the county each July.

People from Donegal have also contributed to culture elsewhere. [[Francis Alison]] was one of the founders of the '''College of Philadelphia''', which would later become the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Marquis 1607-1896">{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607–1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | location = Chicago | year = 1963}}</ref> [[Francis Makemie]] (originally from [[Ramelton]]) founded the Presbyterian Church in America. [[David Steele (minister)|David Steele]], from Upper Creevaugh, was a prominent [[Reformed Presbyterian]], or [[Covenanter]], minister who emigrated to the United States in 1824. The Right Reverend Dr [[Charles Inglis (bishop)|Charles Inglis]], who was the first [[Church of England]] Bishop of the [[Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island|Diocese of Nova Scotia]], was the third son of The Reverend Archibald Inglis, the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] in [[Glencolumbkille]].

==Places of interest==
[[File:Glenveagh National Park (2579034038).jpg|thumb|[[Glenveagh National Park]].]]

County Donegal is a favoured destination for many travellers.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} One of the attractions is [[Glenveagh]] National Park (formerly part of the Glenveagh Estate), as yet (March 2012) the only official ''national park'' anywhere in the [[Provinces of Ireland|Province]] of [[Ulster]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The park is a 140&nbsp;km² (about 35,000&nbsp;acre) nature reserve with scenery of mountains, raised boglands, lakes and woodlands. At its heart is [[Glenveagh Castle]], a late [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] 'folly' that was originally built as a summer residence.
[[File:Fintown Railway on trackbed of CDR County Donegal Railway, Lough Finn (5951398952).jpg|thumb|Fintown Railway on the track of [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee]] next to [[Lough Finn]] near [[Fintown railway station]].]]
The Donegal [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking district) also attracts young people to County Donegal each year during the school summer holidays. The three-week-long summer Gaeltacht courses give young Irish people from other parts of the country a chance to learn the Irish language and traditional Irish cultural traditions that are still prevalent in parts of Donegal. The Donegal Gaeltacht has traditionally been a very popular destination each summer for young people from [[Northern Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Scuba diving is also very popular with a club being located in Donegal Town.

==Education==
[[Third level education|Third-level education]] within the county is provided by [[Letterkenny Institute of Technology]] (L.Y.I.T.; popularly known locally as 'the Regional'), established in the 1970s in [[Letterkenny]]. In addition, many young people from the county attend third-level institutions elsewhere in Ireland, especially in [[Derry]] and also at the [[University of Ulster at Coleraine]] (U.U.C.), the [[University of Ulster|University of Ulster at Jordanstown]] (U.U.J.), [[The Queen's University of Belfast]] ('Queen's'), and [[National University of Ireland, Galway|NUI Galway]]. Many Donegal students also attend the [[Limavady]] Campus of the [[North West Regional College]] (popularly known as Limavady Tech) and the [[Omagh College of Further Education|Omagh Campus]] of [[South West College]] (popularly known as Omagh Tech or Omagh College).

==Sport==
[[File:Clgghaothdobhair.jpg|thumb|[[Gaoth Dobhair]] GAA grounds.]]

===Gaelic football and hurling===
The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (G.A.A.) sport of [[Gaelic football]] is very popular in County Donegal. Donegal's inter-county football team have won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] title twice (in 1992 and 2012). [[Donegal senior football team|Donegal]] emerged victorious from the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] on 23 September 2012 to take the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] for only the second time, with early goals from [[Michael Murphy (Gaelic footballer)|Michael Murphy]] and [[Colm McFadden]] setting up victory of 2–11 to 0–13 over [[Mayo senior football team|Mayo]]. In 2007, Donegal won only their second national title by winning the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]]. On 24 April 2011, Donegal added their third national title when they defeated [[Laois GAA|Laois]] to capture the National Football League Division Two. There are 16 clubs in the [[Donegal Senior Football Championship]], with many others playing at a lower level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubgaa.ie/donegal/index.htm|title=Donegal Gaelic football and hurling Clubs|work=clubgaa.ie}}</ref>

[[Hurling]], handball and rounders are also played but are less widespread, as in other parts of northwestern Ireland. The Donegal county senior hurling won the [[Lory Meagher Cup 2011|Lory Meagher Cup]] in 2011 and the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] in 2013

===Rugby Union===
There are several [[Rugby union|rugby]] teams in the county. These include Ulster Qualifying League Two side [[Letterkenny RFC]], whose ground is named after [[Dave Gallaher]], the captain of the 1905 New Zealand [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] touring team, who have since become known as [[The Original All Blacks|The Originals]]. He was born in nearby [[Ramelton]].

Ulster Qualifying League Three sides include Ballyshannon RFC, Donegal Town RFC and Inishowen RFC. Finn Valley RFC and Tir Chonaill RFC both compete in the Ulster Minor League North.

===Association football===
[[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] plays in the [[League of Ireland]] and won promotion to the [[League of Ireland Premier Division|Premier Division]] in 2007 following a 6–3 aggregate win in the playoff final. They are now back alongside their arch-rivals [[Derry City F.C.]], with whom they contest Ireland's ''North-West Derby''. There are numerous other clubs in Donegal, but none has achieved the status of Finn Harps.

===Golf===
Many people travel to Donegal for the superb golf links—long sandy beaches and extensive dune systems are a feature of the county, and many links courses have been developed.
Golf is a very popular sport within the county, including world class golf courses such as Ballyliffin (Glashedy), Ballyliffin (Old), both of which are located in the Inishowen peninsula. Other courses to note are Murvagh (located outside Donegal Town) and Rosapenna (Sandy Hills) located in Downings (near [[Carrigart]]). The Glashedy Links has been ranked 6th in a recent ranking taken by Golf Digest on the best courses in Ireland. The Old links was ranked 28th, Murvagh 36th and Sandy Hills 38th.

[[File:Bundoran Strand, Co. Donegal.jpg|thumb|[[Bundoran]] is regarded as one of the best surfing spots in Ireland and Europe.]]

===Mountain Biking===
Because of Donegal's hilly and mountain landscape, [[Mountain Biking]] has become a significant and growing interest. The [[Donegal MTB Club|Donegal Mountain Bike Club]] is the newest Mountain Bike club in Donegal, and held its first race on 31 August 2011. The 'Bogman Race' was entered by more than 50 people from different backgrounds of cycling. Due to the overwhelming popularity of their first ever race, the club plans to organise more races in the near future over different seasons, and aims to make it a major tourist attraction throughout Donegal.

===Cricket===
[[Cricket]] is also played in County Donegal. This sport is chiefly confined to The Laggan district and the Finn Valley in the east of the county. The town of [[Raphoe]] and the nearby village of [[St Johnston|St. Johnston]], both in The Laggan, are the traditional strongholds of cricket within the county. The game is mainly played and followed by members of County Donegal's [[Ulster Protestant|Protestant]] community.

===Other sports===
Donegal's rugged landscape lends itself to active sports like [[climbing]], [[hillwalking]], [[surfing]] and [[Kite|kite-flying]].

Rock climbing is of very high quality and still under-developed in the county. There is a wealth of good quality climbs in the county, from granite rocks in the south to quartzite and dolerite in the north; from long mountain routes in the [[Poisoned Glen]] to boulder challenges of excellent quality in the west and in the [[Inishowen]] Peninsula. The current Donegal rock climbing guidebook contains over 2800 recorded rock climbs covering the entire county including the Donegal Sea Stacks, Malin Beg, Gola, and Cruit Islands.

Surfing on Donegal's Atlantic coast is considered to be as good as any in Ireland. The seaside resort of [[Bundoran]], located in the very south of the county, along with nearby [[Rossnowlagh]], have been 'reborn' as the centre of surfing in County Donegal. Indeed, these areas are renowned as the main surfing centres in [[Ulster]].

[[Greyhound racing in Ireland|Greyhound racing]] based in [[Lifford]] is home to the Lifford Greyhound Racing Stadium, a state of the art stadium built at a cost of €12 million and also the East Donegal [[Hare coursing|Coursing]] Club.
