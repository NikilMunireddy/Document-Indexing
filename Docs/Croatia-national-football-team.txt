The '''Croatia national football team''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija}}) represents [[Croatia]] in international [[Association football|football]]. The team is controlled by the [[Croatian Football Federation]], the nation's governing body of football. A [[FIFA]]-sanctioned national side previously represented the short-lived [[Banovina of Croatia]] and [[Independent State of Croatia]] in [[Croatia national football team games – 1940s|nineteen friendly matches]] between 1940 and 1944.<ref name="croatiamatches">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kroa-intres.html |title=Croatia International matches |accessdate=14 July 2008|author=Kramarsic, Igor/Puric, Bojan|publisher=Rec.

=== Pre-independence ===
[[Image:Croatian first team.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The first recognised Croatian team played against Switzerland in 1940.]]
Association football was first introduced to Croatia by English expatriates working on industrial projects in [[Rijeka]] and [[Županja]] in 1873. By 1907, local clubs had been established in Croatia and a modern edition of the sport's laws was translated and published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.croatia.org/crown/articles/9353/1/In-1880-local-Croatian-young-men-began-to-play-football-in-Zupanja.html |publisher=Croatian World Network|author=Bach, N.

On 3 July 1992, Croatia was re-admitted to FIFA, playing its first official matches in the modern era against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Sydney]]. This team was led by [[Stanko Poklepović]] as part of an international exhibition tour; in April 1993, [[Vlatko Marković]] was appointed as manager. Croatia finally gained admission into [[UEFA]] in June 1993, which was too late for the national team to enter the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers, as these already commenced the year before. Marković only led the team in one match, a home win against Ukraine in June 1993, before being dismissed in February 1994 and replaced by [[Miroslav Blažević]] the following month. The team's performances before Croatia's official independence were not recorded by FIFA, so they entered the World Rankings in 125th place.<ref name="tourneyhist"/><ref name="croatiaranks"/> Blažević led Croatia's [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying|qualifying campaign for Euro 1996]], beginning with the nation's first post-independence competitive victory, a 2–0 win over [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] on 4 September 1994.

In spite of the quarter-final exit, Blažević continued to lead Croatia in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1998 World Cup qualifying]] campaign, which ended successfully after an aggregate victory against Ukraine in the two-legged play-off. In the group stage of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], Croatia beat [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] but lost to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], before defeating [[Romania national football team|Romania]] to reach a quarter-final tie against Germany, then ranked second in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=m/fullranking.html#confederation=0&rank=50 |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA.com) |title=FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking |date=20 May 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2008 }}</ref> Though regarded as underdogs, Croatia won 3–0 with goals from [[Robert Jarni]], [[Goran Vlaović]] and [[Davor Šuker]], all after [[Christian Wörns]] had been sent off.

Although Blažević continued his tenure in spite of failure to qualify for Euro 2000, he resigned in October 2000 following draws against Belgium and Scotland in the first two games of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers.

Despite heavy loss of form, which also saw the team fall outside the top ten in the FIFA rankings, Croatia were placed in the top tier of teams for the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying draw]]; Croatia was previously a candidate to co-host the tournament with [[Hungary]] which would have allowed the team to qualify automatically, but UEFA eventually chose [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] as hosts instead.

In the proceeding group-stage draw for the tournament, Croatia were placed in the third tier of teams, and were eventually grouped with Ireland, Italy and defending champions Spain.

In the buildup towards the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, the team's first major competition since their 2008 run at the same event, manager Slaven Bilić formally agreed a deal to manage [[Russia]]n club [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]], thereby announcing he would resign from the national team when the tournament ended. Croatia opened their campaign with a comfortable 3–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland, with striker [[Mario Mandžukić]] scoring twice. Mandžukić continued his run at the tournament with an equaliser in the 1–1 draw against Italy, which was marred by controversial fan reactions and referee decisions from English official [[Howard Webb]]. In their last group match, Croatia suffered a 0–1 defeat to Spain. The late Spanish goal by [[Jesús Navas]], along with Italy's victory over the Republic of Ireland in the final round, forced Croatia to exit the tournament in the group stage once again. Upon his formal departure, Bilić was also praised for his long-standing service to the national side. ''[[Jutarnji List]]'' daily labelled him as Croatia's only manager to depart on such positive terms and credited him for his strong revival of the national side during his six-year tenure.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/sport/vijesti/ponosni-smo-sto-smo-imali-bas-ovakvog-slavena-bilica-clanak-422740 |publisher=Jutarnji List |title=Ponosni smo sto smo imali bas ovakvog Slavena Bilica |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=21 June 2012 }}</ref>

== Colours ==
Croatia's initial jersey was designed in 1990 by painter [[Miroslav Šutej]], who also designed the nation's [[Croatian coat of arms|coat of arms]]. Although slightly altered by manufacturer [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]] (the 1998 jersey was a white jersey with the chequers on the right side, like a flying flag) and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] since its original release, the chequered motif was adopted as a symbol of national identity and similar designs are used by all Croatian national sports teams.<ref name="nacional.hr"/>

== Stadium ==
{{main|Stadion Maksimir}}
The majority of home matches take place at the [[Stadion Maksimir]] in [[Zagreb]], which is also the home-ground of local football club [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]. The venue, built in 1912 and refurbished in 1997, is named after the surrounding neighbourhood of [[Maksimir]] and has hosted national team games since Croatia's competitive home debut against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]].<ref name="maksimirren">{{citation |url=http://www.panstadia.com/vol7/74-022.htm |publisher=''Panstadia'' | volume = 7 | number = 4 |author=McIntyre, Katie  |title=Architecture & Design – Maksimir Stadium |date= |accessdate=7 August 2008 }}</ref> The Croatian Football Federation (HNS) previously agreed on extensive plans with the government to renovate the stadium and increase its current forty-thousand seating capacity, however the proposal was eventually rejected by Zagreb Mayor [[Milan Bandić]] in 2008 due to high construction costs.<ref name="maksimirren"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=88735 |publisher=Javno |title=Maksimir Stadium – World’s Most Expensive |date=11 October 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=88773 |publisher=Javno |author=| title=Mayor: I Will Not Build Stadium at That Cost  |date=11 October 2007|accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref>

Some home matches are occasionally played at other, smaller venues around the country. The [[Poljud Stadium]] in [[Split (city)|Split]] has hosted several qualifying fixtures since 1995, the first being a 1–1 draw with Italy. In the period between 1995 and 2011, Croatia never won a competitive match at Poljud, which the local media dubbed "''Poljudsko prokletsvo''" ("the Poljud curse"). The run was finally ended after the team came from behind to beat [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] on 3 June 2011.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://arhiva.net.hr/sport/page/2008/02/06/0466006.html| publisher=Net.hr| title=Nastavljeno poljudsko prokletstvo| date=6 February 2008| accessdate=21 November 2010| language=Croatian}} ''[[Talk:Croatia national football team#Nastavljeno poljudsko prokletstvo|Translation]]''</ref> Qualifying fixtures have also been played at the [[Stadion Kantrida]] in [[Rijeka]], along with the [[Gradski vrt]] stadium in [[Osijek]] and the [[Stadion Anđelko Herjavec]] in [[Varaždin]]. However, these venues are rarely used due to their remote locations and smaller seating capacity, despite objections from local residents and some players.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/Nogomet/tabid/84/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/256786/Default.aspx| publisher=Slobodna Dalmacija| title=Vatreni poručili HNS-u: Ne želimo više igrati "manje utakmice" u Maksimiru| date=10 September 2014| accessdate=27 November 2014| language=Croatian}}</ref>

== Supporters ==
Football is Croatia's most popular [[team sport]], and the national team has developed an extensive fan-base since its official formation in 1991.<ref>Foster 2004, p. 52</ref> Following Croatia's successful 1998 World Cup campaign, three years after the [[Croatian war of independence]], there was a rapid rise in domestic and global attention for the national side. British journalist Marcus Tanner of [[Balkan Insight]] commented that the national team became a symbol of Croatian independence from [[Yugoslavia]].<ref>Bellamy, A 2003, T''he Formation of Croatian National Identity: A Centuries-old Dream'', Manchester University Press, pg. 116</ref> However, after the death of former-president [[Franjo Tuđman]], local political ties with the national team have loosened.

A large part of the team's support base consists of fans of [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]], the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the [[Prva HNL]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gfk.hr/press/nogomet.htm |publisher=Growth from Knowledge (GFK Hrvatska) |title=Za koji hrvatski nogometni klub navijate?|date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=19 August 2008|language=Croatian|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430100239/http://www.gfk.hr/press/nogomet.htm |archivedate = 30 April 2008|deadurl=yes}} ''[[Talk:Croatia national football team#Za koji hrvatski nogometni klub navijate?|Translation]]''</ref> The clubs' [[Ultras|ultra]]-style supporter groups, the [[Bad Blue Boys]] of Zagreb and [[Torcida Split|The Torcida]] from [[Split (city)|Split]], have both been associated with [[hooliganism]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=73131 |publisher=''The Malta Independent'' |author=Brincat, Henry| title= Incident brings back memories of Malta-Croatia match: Seven Hajduk fans arrested|date=|accessdate=7 August 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/may/31/sport.comment2 |publisher=''The Guardian'' | title=Is hooliganism inevitable at this World Cup?|author=Brimson, Dougie/Miles, Kevin|date=31 May 2006|accessdate=4 September 2008 | location=London}}</ref> though violence between the two groups does not occur at international games. Heavy support for the Croatian national team also comes from [[Bosnian Croats|Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina]], particularly from fans of [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar|Zrinjski Mostar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1123137,00.html |publisher=''The Observer'' |title=Football, blood and war |date=18 January 2004 |accessdate=26 August 2008 | location=London}}</ref> The official Croatia supporters' club endorsed by the Croatian Football Federation is called ''Uvijek Vjerni'' (''Always Faithful'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=hr&u=http://www.uvijekvjerni.com/o_klubu/o-klubu/&prev=/search%3Fq%3DUvijek%2BVjerni%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG |title=About the club |accessdate=4 January 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:Cro-Ger 2-0.jpg|thumb|left|210px|A Croatian crowd celebrate with flares following Croatia's victory over Germany in 2008.]] 
Fans' behaviour at international games has led to various sanctions against the national team. Croatia was penalized and threatened with expulsion from UEFA for reports of racist behaviour by travelling fans at [[Euro 2004]].<ref name="croatfans">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-409579/Croatia-threatened-Euro-2008-expulsion-UEFA.html |title=Croatia threatened with expulsion |publisher=''DailyMail'' |date=10 October 2006|accessdate=15 July 2008}}</ref> UEFA and FIFA have both penalized the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) for similar incidents in the past.

[[Image:ITA-CRO Euro 2012 (3).JPG|thumb|right|360px|Croatia supporters at UEFA Euro 2012]]
Croatia supporters often use flares during international matches, which has also caused sanctions as the use of pyrotechnics is strictly banned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL0568852720080505 |publisher=Reuters |author=Milosavljevic, Zoran|title=Crowd trouble mars Croatian derby, Cluj on verge of title |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=8 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en/sports/clanak.php?id=157889|publisher=Javno|title=Flares and Flags on Monuments in Vienna|date=20 June 2008|accessdate=8 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scotland-punished-football-chiefs-croatia-2648758 |work=Daily Record |title=Scotland to be punished by football chiefs for Croatia fans setting off flares during World Cup qualifier|date=28 October 2013 |accessdate=6 September 2015 }}</ref> 
In November 2014, the Croatian fans again attracted criticism by chanting the [[Ustaše]] slogan "Za Dom! Spremni" led by defender [[Josip Šimunić]] after beating Iceland in the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] play-offs. Croatia's [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualification|Euro 2016 qualifying]] fixture against Italy in [[Milan]] was temporarily suspended due to flares being thrown onto the field by a small section of Croatia supporters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/euro-2016-qualifying-italy-v-croatia-live-210102340--sow.html |publisher=Eurosport |author=Fraser Masefield|title=Euro 2016 Qualifying - Croatia hold Italy after match suspended due to crowd trouble |date=16 November 2014 |accessdate=27 November 2014 }}</ref> The players and manager condemned this behavior as detrimental to the national team. The incident was suspected to be a protest against the Croatian Football Federation for allegations of corruption.
In June 2015, during the home game against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], played behind closed doors in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], a [[swastika]] appeared embedded on the pitch. Croatian Football Federation called the incident an act of "sabotage" against the national team. The federation later apologized for the incident and called for a criminal investigation against the perpetrators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/13/football/nazi-swastika-croatia-football/ |title=Euro 2016: Croatia apologizes over Nazi swastika on its home pitch|first=Paul |last=Gittings|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=August 16, 2015|date=June 13, 2015}}</ref>

Maksimir Stadium was the scene of a [[Dinamo Zagreb-Red Star Belgrade riot|politically-fueled riot]] between Croat and Serb fans at a Dinamo Zagreb – [[Red Star Belgrade]] game following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 parliamentary election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsillustrated.co.za/tenner/article.php?article_id=155 |publisher=Sports Illustrated | title=10 Days When Things Got Out Of Hand |author=|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=28 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913211951/http://www.sportsillustrated.co.za/tenner/article.php?article_id=155|archivedate=13 September 2008}}</ref> However, there have been no major issues between Croatian and Serbian supporters since then. The Croatian Football Federation and the [[Football Association of Serbia]] (FSS) both agreed to play the scheduled 2014 World Cup qualifying matches between the two sides without away supporters.

The team's games are regularly broadcast live on [[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=186&tx_ttnews%5Bcat%5D=126&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1793&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=185&cHash=4d25942a86 |publisher=Hrvatska radiotelevizija |title=HRT Broadcasts via Satellite to Australia and New Zealand |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2008 }}</ref> Shortly after becoming manager, Slaven Bilić and his rock band released a single, "''Vatreno Ludilo''" (Fiery Madness), which recalled the team's progress during the 1998 World Cup and praised their present ambitions. The song reached the top position on the Croatian music charts and was widely played during Euro 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/news/newsid=745497.html |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA.com) |title=Bilic has Croatia rocking |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/rock-on-slaven-bilic/ |publisher=''The New York Times'' |title=Rock On Slaven Bilic |author=Marcus, Jeffrey | date=19 June 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2008 }}</ref> Other Croatian artists such as [[Dino Dvornik]], Connect, [[Prljavo Kazalište]] and [[Baruni]] have recorded songs in support of the team, among which are "''Malo nas je al nas ima''" (We are few, but we exist), "''Samo je jedno''" (There is but one thing [in my life]), "''Moj dom je Hrvatska''" (My Home is Croatia), "''Srce vatreno''" (Fiery Heart), and "''Hrvatska je prvak svijeta''" (Croatia are World Champions).

==Competitive record==

===FIFA World Cup===
{{Main|Croatia at the FIFA World Cup}}
Croatia qualified for and competed in three consecutive [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup finals]] between 1998 and 2006, but failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after finishing 3rd in Group 6 of their Qualification Group behind England, and Ukraine. Although they had joined both FIFA and UEFA by 1992, they were unable to enter the 1994 World Cup as qualification had started before the side was officially recognised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/94qual.html |title=World Cup 1994 qualifications |accessdate=20 August 2008|author=|publisher=Rec. Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation }}</ref> The nation's best performance came in their first World Cup where they finished third. In their following two World Cup campaigns they were eliminated after finishing third in their groups.

===UEFA European Championship===
{{Main|Croatia at the UEFA European Championship}}

Croatia's best results in UEFA Championships were quarter final finishes on their debut, in 1996, and in 2008. They did not qualify for the 2000 tournament. The [[Croatian Football Federation|HNS]] raised an unsuccessful joint bid with the [[Hungarian Football Federation]] to co-host the 2012 tournament, which was awarded instead to Poland and Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro2012/news/newsid=528963.html |author=| title=EURO joy for Poland and Ukraine |date=18 April 2007|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA.com)|work=European Championships archive }}</ref>

== Statistics ==

=== Managers ===
Before Croatia's independence distinct Croatian football federations and teams were occasionally formed separately from the official Yugoslavian organisations. Ivo Kraljević served as the manager of the initial federation, established in 1939, and organised non-sanctioned matches played by unofficial national squads up to 1956.<ref name="fedohist"/> These temporary sides, playing non-competitive fixtures, were led by seven different managers.{{#tag:ref|The following organisers led the national team as 'managers':
* 1918 to 1919 – Hugo Kinert
* 1939 to 1940 – Jozo Jakopić
* 1940 to 1943 – [[Rudolf Hitrec]]
* 1943 to 1945 – [[Bogdan Cuvaj]]
* 1956 – [[Bruno Knežević]], Leo Lemešić and [[Franjo Wölfl]]|group="note"}}

Statistically, Dražan Jerković and Vlatko Marković are the most successful managers in Croatia's history; they both recorded victories in each of their few games in charge. [[Miroslav Blažević]] holds the highest number of competitive victories, having led Croatia to their best performances at major international tournaments.

The following table provides a summary of the complete record of each Croatia manager including their results regarding [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]].

Dario Šimić was Croatia's first player to reach 100 appearances, doing so before his retirement in 2008.

The trio went on to set a new joint-record of 101 appearances for the national team on 22 March 2013 in a World Cup qualifying victory against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in Zagreb. Srna eventually surpassed his teammates and accrued 121 international caps for Croatia (as of November 2014). [[Ivica Olić]] has since also appeared 100 times for Croatia, with his 100th cap coming against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at [[San Siro]] on 16 November 2014.
    
With 45 goals scored, [[Davor Šuker]], the current president of the Croatian Football Federation, is the team's highest-scoring player. He was named Croatia's "Golden Player" at the UEFA jubilee celebration in 2004 in recognition of this achievement.<ref name="Sukerman">{{cite web |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=2/newsid=638977.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA.com)|work=European Championships archive |author=Islamović, Elvir |title=Suker: a man with the Midas touch |date=1 April 2008|accessdate=22 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080523012306/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=2/newsid=638977.html |archivedate = 23 May 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> [[Eduardo da Silva|Eduardo]] reached a distant second position with 29 goals before announcing his retirement from international football in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hns-cff.hr/?ln=hr&w=statistike|publisher=Hrvatski nogometni savez |title=Statistike – Nastupi|date=|accessdate=14 September 2010 }}</ref> [[Mladen Petrić]] holds the national team record for goals in a single match, having scored four times during Croatia's 7–0 home victory over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] on 7 October 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2008/matches/round=2241/match=83922/postmatch/report/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA.com)|work=European Championships archive |author=Islamović, Elvir |title=Petric inspires Croatian record|date=7 October 2006|accessdate=31 December 2012 }}</ref>

The national team's joint record for highest-scoring victory comes from two 7–0 results, over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] in 2006 and [[Australia national football team|Australia]] in 1998. Croatia's worst defeat is also a joint record, the [[Independent State of Croatia]] side lost 5–1 to Germany twice in the 1940s. The modern Croatian team also lost to England by the same scoreline in a 2010 World Cup qualifying fixture in London.<ref name="croatiamatches"/>
