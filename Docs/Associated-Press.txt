[[File:AP headquarters.jpg|thumb|The AP headquarters in October 2008, located at [[Manhattan West|450 West 33rd Street]], in [[New York City]].]]

The '''Associated Press''' ('''AP''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Nonprofit corporation|nonprofit]] [[news agency]] headquartered in [[New York City]], and operated as a [[cooperative]], [[unincorporated association]]. The AP is owned by its contributing [[newspaper]]s, [[Radio station|radio]], and [[Television station|television]] stations in the United States, all of which contribute stories to the AP and use material written by its staff journalists. Most of the AP staff are Union members and are represented by the [[The Newspaper Guild|Newspaper Guild]], which operates under the [[Communication Workers of America]], which operates under the [[AFL-CIO]].

As of 2007, news collected by the AP was published and republished by more than 1,700 newspapers, in addition to more than 5,000 television and radio [[broadcasting|broadcasters]]. The photograph library of the AP consists of over 10 million images. The AP operates 243 [[news bureau]]s in 120 countries. It also operates the AP Radio Network, which provides newscasts twice hourly for broadcast and [[satellite radio]] and television stations. Many newspapers and broadcasters outside the United States are AP subscribers, paying a fee to use AP material without being contributing members of the cooperative. As part of their cooperative agreement with the AP, most member news organizations grant automatic permission for the AP to distribute their [[local news]] reports. The AP employs the "[[inverted pyramid]]" formula for writing that enables the news outlets to edit a story to fit its available publication area without losing the story's essentials.

Cutbacks at rival [[United Press International]] in 1993 left the AP as the United States' primary news service, although UPI still produces and distributes stories and photos daily. Other [[English language|English-language]] news services, such as the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Reuters]] and the English-language service of [[Agence France-Presse]], are based outside the United States.

==History==
[[File:the associated press building in new york city.jpg|thumb|Logo on the former AP Building in New York City]]
Associated Press is a not-for-profit news cooperative formed in the May 1846<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyorknatives.com/on-this-day-in-nycs-history-associated-press-formed/|title=Associated Press Founded - This Day in History May 22|work=New York Natives|date=2015-05-22|accessdate=2016-03-18}}</ref> by five daily newspapers in [[New York City]] to share the cost of transmitting news of the [[Mexican–American War]] by boat, horse express and telegraph. The venture was organized by [[Moses Yale Beach]] (1800–68), second publisher of the ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'', and agreed to buy the ''Herald'', the ''Courier'', and ''Enquirer'', ''[[The Journal of Commerce]]'', and the ''Express''. Some historians{{who|date=October 2012}} believe that the ''Tribune'' joined at this time; documents show it was a member in 1849. ''[[The New York Times]]'' became a member shortly after its founding in September 1851. Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and [[price setting]] practices. An investigation completed in 1892 by [[Victor Lawson]], editor and publisher of the ''Chicago Daily News'', revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led to the demise of the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as the Associated Press. A 1900 [[Illinois Supreme Court]] decision (''Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press'')—that the AP was a [[public utility]] and operating in restraint of trade—resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

When the AP was founded, news became a salable commodity. The invention of the rotary press allowed the ''New York Tribune'' in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Spanish–American War]], there was a new incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. [[Melville Stone]], who had founded the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925–48), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after [[World War&nbsp;II]]), the Middle East. He introduced the "telegraph typewriter" or teletypewriter into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA392&dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=r81ETsS3KI3isQLY3dX5BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q&f=true |title=Wire That Photo |work=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1937 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>

In 1945, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'' that AP had been violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] by prohibiting member newspapers from selling or providing news to nonmember organizations as well as making it very difficult for nonmember newspapers to join the AP. The decision facilitated the growth of its main rival [[United Press International]], headed by [[Hugh Baillie]] from 1935 to 1955.

AP entered the broadcast field in 1941 when it began distributing news to radio stations; it created its own radio network in 1974. In 1994, it established APTV, a global video newsgathering agency. APTV merged with WorldWide Television News in 1998 to form APTN, which provides video to international broadcasters and websites. In 2004, AP moved its world headquarters from its longtime home at 50 Rockefeller Plaza to a huge building at [[Manhattan West|450 West 33rd Street]] in Manhattan—which also houses the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the studios of New York's public television station, [[WNET]]. In 2009, AP had more than 240 bureaus globally. Its mission—"to gather with economy and efficiency an accurate and impartial report of the news"—has not changed since its founding, but digital technology has made the distribution of the AP news report an interactive endeavor between AP and its 1,400 U.S. newspaper members as well as broadcasters, international subscribers, and online customers.

The AP began diversifying its news gathering capabilities and by 2007 AP was generating only about 30% of its revenue from United States newspapers. 37% came from the global broadcast customers, 15% from online ventures and 18% came from international newspapers and from photography.<ref>{{cite news |title=Down On The Wire |url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/13/media-newspapers-ap-biz-media-cx_lh_0214ap.html |quote=Last year, AP generated only about 30% of its revenue from U.S. newspapers.

===Web resource===
The AP's multi-topic structure has resulted in web portals such as [[Yahoo!]] and [[MSN]] posting its articles, often relying  on AP as their first source for news coverage of breaking news items. This and the constant updating evolving stories require has had a major impact on the AP's public image and role, giving new credence to the AP's ongoing mission of having staff for covering every area of news fully and promptly. The AP is also the news service used on the [[Wii]]'s [[News Channel (Wii)|News Channel]].<ref>{{cite news |title =Nintendo Customer Service: Wii News Channel |quote=Using the international resources of the Associated Press, the News Channel gives Wii users free access to stories in multiple categories from across the country and around the world.|url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/channelsNews.jsp |publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref> In 2007, Google announced that it was paying to receive Associated Press content, to be displayed in [[Google News]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Google News Becomes A Publisher |url =http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=PBT2QGMTUGF0AQSNDLOSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=201803549&_requestid=555255 |quote='Because the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, U.K. Press Association and the Canadian Press don't have a consumer Web site where they publish their content, they have not been able to benefit from the traffic that Google News drives to other publishers,' Josh Cohen, business product manager for Google News, explained in a blog post. |work=[[Information Week]] |date=August 31, 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> though this was interrupted from late 2009 to mid-2010, due to a licensing dispute.<ref>{{cite news |title=Google Stops Hosting New AP Content |url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-google-stops-hosting-new-ap-content |accessdate=2010-01-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112081900/http://paidcontent.org/article/419-google-stops-hosting-new-ap-content |archivedate=12 January 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Google, AP reach deal for Google News content |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-20015053-265.html |publisher=[[CNET]]|date=August 30, 2010|accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref>

==AP sports polls==
{{main|AP Poll}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
The AP is known for its polls on numerous [[college athletics|college sports]] in the [[United States]]. The AP polls ranking the top 25 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] ([[Football Bowl Subdivision]] and [[Football Championship Subdivision]]) [[college football]] and NCAA Division&nbsp;I men's and women's [[college basketball]] teams are the most well known. The AP composes the polls by collecting and compiling the top-25 votes of numerous designated [[sports journalists]]. The AP poll of [[college football]] was particularly notable for many years because it helped determine the ranking of teams at the end of the regular season for the collegiate [[Bowl Championship Series]] until the AP, citing conflict of interest, asked for the poll to be removed from the bowl series. Beginning in the 2005 season, the [[Harris Interactive College Football Poll]] took the AP's place in the bowl series formula. The AP poll is the longest serving national poll in college football having begun in 1936.  But with the creation of the BCS in 2006 and the College Football Playoffs in 2014, the AP no longer plays a part in selection of a National Champion.

==AP sports awards==

===Baseball===
The AP began its [[Major League Baseball]] Manager of the Year Award in 1959, for a manager in each league.<ref name=APManagerOfYr>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_mgy2.shtml AP Manager of the Year Award]. Baseball-Almanac.com. Retrieved 2009-09-29.

==Associated Press Television News==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
[[File:APTNheadquarter.jpg|thumb|The APTN Building in London]]
In 1994, London-based Associated Press Television (APTV) was founded to provide agency news material to television broadcasters. Other existing providers of such material at the time were [[Reuters]] Television and [[Worldwide Television News]] (WTN).

In 1998, AP purchased WTN and APTV left the Associated Press building in [[Central London]] and merged with WTN to create [[Associated Press Television News]] (APTN) in the WTN building, now the APTN building in [[Camden Town]].

==Litigation and controversies==

===Breach of contract and unfair competition===
In November 2010 the Associated Press was sued by iCopyright for [[breach of contract]] and [[unfair competition]]. It accused the AP of launching a copyright-tracking registry built upon information and [[business intelligence]] that it had misappropriated from iCopyright.<ref name="Paid Content">{{cite news | title =The Messy Falling Out Between The AP And iCopyright|  work =Paid Content| date= December 7, 2010 |url = http://paidcontent.org/article/419-the-messy-falling-out-between-the-ap-and-icopyright }}</ref>

===Christopher Newton===
[[Washington, D.C.]] bureau reporter Christopher Newton, an AP reporter since 1994, was fired by AP in September 2002 after he was accused of fabricating sources since 2000, including at least 40 people and organizations. Prior to his firing, Newton had been focused on writing about federal law-enforcement while based at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]. Some of the nonexistent agencies quoted in his stories included "Education Alliance", the "Institute for Crime and Punishment in Chicago", "Voice for the Disabled", and "People for Civil Rights".<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.slate.com/?id=2073304 |title= Fib Newton  | date=October 29, 2002 |  work =[[Slate.com]] |accessdate=2008-04-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080508022026/http://www.slate.com/?id=2073304| archivedate= 8 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Fair use controversies===
In June 2008, the AP sent numerous [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] take down demands and threatened legal action against several [[blog]]s. The AP contended that the internet blogs were violating AP's [[copyright]] by linking to AP material and using headlines and short summaries in those links. Many bloggers and experts noted that the use of the AP news fell squarely under commonly accepted internet practices and within [[fair use]] standards.<ref>{{cite  news |url = http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4381 |title=AP's Fair Use Challenge (Harvard Law) |work = Berkman Center for Internet and Society  |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate =2014-06-04}}</ref> Others noted and demonstrated that AP routinely takes similar excerpts from other sources, often without attribution or licenses.

===Copyright and intellectual property===
In August 2005, Ken Knight, a [[Louisiana]] photographer, sued the AP claiming that it had willfully and negligently violated Knight's copyright by distributing a photograph of celebrity [[Britney Spears]] to various media outlets including, but not limited to: [[truTV]] (formerly CourtTV), America Online and [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]].<ref>{{Cite court|litigants= Ken Knight v. The Associated Press|url= http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-nysdce/case_no-1:2005cv07479/case_id-272658/}}</ref> According to court documents the AP did not have a license to publish, display or relicense the photographs. The case was settled in November 2006.

In a case filed February 2005, ''McClatchey v. The Associated Press'', a [[Pennsylvania]] photographer sued the AP for [[Cropping (image)|cropping]] a picture to remove the plaintiff's embedded title and copyright notice and later distributed it to news organizations without the plaintiff's permission or credit. The parties settled.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=McClatchey v. The Associated Press |url=http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/pennsylvania/pawdce/3:2005cv00145/66017/}}</ref>

In April 2011, Patricia Ann Lopez, a [[New Mexico]] [[courtroom sketch]] artist, sued the Associated Press claiming that the AP had violated her copyrights by reselling her images without a license and had deceptively, fraudulently and wrongfully passed off the artist's work as its own.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants = Lopez v.

====Shepard Fairey====
In March 2009, the Associated Press counter-sued artist [[Shepard Fairey]] over [[Obama HOPE poster|his famous image of Barack Obama]], saying the uncredited, uncompensated use of an AP photo violated [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright laws]] and signaled a threat to [[journalism]]. Fairey had sued the AP the previous month over his artwork, titled "Obama Hope" and "Obama Progress", arguing that he did not violate copyright law because he dramatically changed the image. The artwork, based on an April 2006 picture taken for the AP by [[Mannie Garcia]], was a popular image during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] and now hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. According to the AP lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, Fairey knowingly "misappropriated The AP's rights in that image". The suit asked the court to award AP profits made off the image and damages.

===Illegal immigrant===
In April 2013, the Associated Press stated that it had dropped the term "illegal immigrant" from its [[AP Stylebook|stylebook]]. The blog stated that the term was dropped due to the term dehumanizing individuals. The Associated Press follows ABC, NBC, and CNN in not using the term. [[Jose Antonio Vargas]] commended the Associated Press for its decision.<ref>{{cite news |title=Associated Press Drops 'Illegal Immigrant' From Stylebook |author =Christina Costantini |url= http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/press-drops-illegal-immigrant-standards-book/story?id=18862824&page=2#.UWJrcBeG18F | work =ABC News |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref>

===Biased reporting===

The AP has been accused by its own journalists in the region of biased reporting on the [[Middle East]].

===Sea Slavery and Overreach===

===Collaboration with Nazi Germany===

Associated Press entered a formal cooperation with the Hitler's Nazi Germany in the 1930s, supplying American newspapers with material selected and produced by the Nazi party propaganda ministry. It was able to retain its access by entering into a mutually beneficial two-way cooperation with the Nazi regime. It ceded control of its output by signing up to the Schriftleitergesetz (editor’s law), promising not to publish any material 'calculated to weaken the strength of the Reich abroad or at home'. 

Schriftleitergesetz required Associated Press to employ reporters who worked for the Nazi party’s propaganda division. One photographer, Franz Roth, was a member of the SS propaganda division, whose photographs were personally chosen by Hitler.

Associated Press was the only western news agency able to stay open in Nazi Germany, they continued operating until Germany declared war on the USA in 1941.

Associated Press  also allowed the Nazi regime to use its photo archives for its virulently anti-semitic propaganda literature, such as 'The Sub-Human' and 'The Jews in the USA' booklets.

This arrangement also enabled the Nazis to cover up some of its crimes, allowing the Nazis to portray a war of extermination as a conventional war; which events were made visible and which remained invisible in AP’s supply of pictures followed German interests and the German narrative of the war.<ref>{{cite web|title=Revealed: how Associated Press cooperated with the Nazis|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/30/associated-press-cooperation-nazis-revealed-germany-harriet-scharnberg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Associated Press und die nationalsozialistische Bildpublizistik|url=http://www.zeithistorische-forschungen.de/1-2016/id%3D5324}}</ref>
