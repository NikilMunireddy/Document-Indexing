==Etymology==
Many counties are named after their principal town, and the expected form here would be ''Durhamshire'', however this form has never been in common use. The ceremonial county is officially named '''Durham''',<ref name=lieutenancies/> however the county has long been commonly known as ''County'' Durham and as such is the only [[Counties of England|English county]] name to be prefixed with "County" in common usage — a practice more common in [[Counties of Ireland|Ireland]]. Its unusual naming (for an English county) is explained to some extent by the relationship with the [[Bishop of Durham|Bishops of Durham]], who for centuries governed Durham as a [[county palatine]] (the [[County Palatine of Durham]]), outwith the usual structure of county administration in England. Thus "County Durham" is a shortened form of "County of Durham".

The situation regarding the formal name with regards to present-day local government is less clear. The structural change legislation<ref name="cdsc2008">[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080493_en_1 County Durham (Structural Change) Order 2008]</ref> which in 2009 created the present [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary council]] (that covers a large part — but not all — of the ceremonial county) refers to "the [[non-metropolitan county|county]] of County Durham" and named the new unitary [[non-metropolitan district|district]] "County Durham" too. However, a later amendment to that legislation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/837/article/7/made|title=The Local Government (Structural Changes) (Miscellaneous Amendments and Other Provision) Order 2009|work=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> refers to the "county of Durham"; the amendment allows for the unitary council to name itself "The Durham Council", however the council has retained the name of [[Durham County Council]] — with either option, the name does not include ''County'' Durham.

The [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom|former postal county]] was named "County Durham" to distinguish it from the [[post town]] of Durham.

==History==

===County Palatine of Durham===
{{main|County Palatine of Durham}}

The territory that became known as County Durham, originally a [[Liberty (division)|liberty]] under the control of the Bishops of Durham, had various names: the "Liberty of Durham", "Liberty of St Cuthbert's Land" "the lands of St. Cuthbert between Tyne and Tees" or "the Liberty of Haliwerfolc".<ref name="scammell">[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-8266%28196607%2981%3A320%3C449%3ATOALOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X Jean Scammell, ''The Origin and Limitations of the Liberty of Durham'' in ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 81, No. 320. (Jul., 1966), pp. 449-473.]</ref>

The bishops' special jurisdiction rested on claims that King [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]] had granted a substantial territory to [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St Cuthbert]] on his election to the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Lindisfarne]] in 684. In about 883 a cathedral housing the saint's remains was established at [[Chester-le-Street]] and [[Guthfrith, King of York]] granted the community of St Cuthbert the area between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and the [[River Wear|Wear]]. In 995 the see moved again - to Durham.

Following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], the administrative machinery of government extended only slowly into northern England. In the twelfth century a shire or county of Northumberland was formed{{by whom|date=October 2014}}, with Durham regarded as within its bounds.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0080-4401%281984%295%3A34%3C113%3ATMONAE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C W. L. Warren, ''The Myth of Norman Administrative Efficiency: The Prothero Lecture'' in ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', 5th Ser., Vol. 34. (1984), pp. 113-132]</ref> However the bishops disputed the authority of the sheriff of Northumberland and his officials. The crown regarded Durham as falling within Northumberland until the late thirteenth century. Matters came to a head in 1293 when the bishop and his steward failed to attend proceedings of ''[[quo warranto]]'' held by the justices of Northumberland. The bishop's case went before parliament, where he stated that Durham lay outside the bounds of any English shire and that ''"from time immemorial it had been widely known that the sheriff of Northumberland was not sheriff of Durham nor entered within that liberty as sheriff. . . nor made there proclamations or attachments"''.<ref>C. M. Fraser, ''Edward I of England and the Regalian Franchise of Durham'' in ''Speculum'', Vol. 31, No. 2. (Apr. 1956), pp. 329-342</ref> The arguments appear to have prevailed, as by the fourteenth century Durham was accepted as a liberty which received royal mandates direct. In effect it was a private shire, with the bishop appointing his own sheriff.<ref name="scammell"/> The area eventually became known as the "[[County Palatine]] of Durham".

[[Sadberge]] was a liberty, sometimes referred to as a county, within Northumberland. In 1189 it was purchased for the see but continued with a separate [[sheriff]], [[coroner]] and court of pleas. In the 14th century Sadberge was included in [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]] ward and was itself divided into two wards. The division into the four wards of Chester-le-Street, [[Darlington]], [[Easington District|Easington]] and Stockton existed in the 13th century, each ward having its own coroner and a three-weekly court corresponding to the [[Hundred (division)|hundred]] court. The [[diocese]] was divided into the [[archdeacon]]ries of Durham and Northumberland. The former is mentioned in 1072, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Chester-le-Street, Auckland, [[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]] and Darlington.

The term ''palatinus'' is applied to the bishop in 1293, and from the 13th century onwards the bishops frequently claimed the same rights in their lands as the king enjoyed in his kingdom.

In 1831 the county covered an area of {{convert|679530|acre|km2}}<ref name=vision_acres>Vision of Britain - [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_AREA_A&u_id=10134626&c_id=10001043&add=Y Durham (Ancient): area].

Durham]. Retrieved 2 December 2007.</ref>
The historic boundaries were used for parliamentary purposes until 1832, and for judicial and local government purposes until the coming into force of the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]], which merged most remaining exclaves with their surrounding county.

Until the 15th century the most important administrative officer in the palatinate was the [[Steward (office)|steward]]. Other officers were the sheriff, the coroners, the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] and the [[chancellor]]. The palatine exchequer was organised in the 12th century. The palatine assembly represented the whole county, and dealt chiefly with fiscal questions. The bishops council, consisting of the clergy, the sheriff and the [[baron]]s, regulated the judicial affairs, and later produced the [[Court of equity|Chancery]] and the courts of Admiralty and [[Marshalsea]].

[[Durham, England|Durham city]] was captured by a [[Normans|Norman]] army in 1069. There was a rebellion against the new Norman earl [[Robert de Comines]], who was killed. However, County Durham largely missed the [[Harrying of the North]] that was designed to subjugate such rebellions.<ref name=douglas>Douglas, D.C. ''William the Conqueror: The Norman Impact Upon England''</ref>
The best remains of the Norman period are to be found in [[Durham Cathedral]] and in [[Durham Castle|the castle]], also in some few parish churches, as at Pittington and Norton in Stockton. Of the [[Middle Ages|Early English period]] are the eastern portion of the cathedral, the churches of Darlington, Hartlepool, and St Andrew, Auckland, Sedgefield, and portions of a few other churches.

The [[prior]] of Durham ranked first among the bishop's barons. He had his own court, and almost exclusive jurisdiction over his men. There were ten palatinate barons in the 12th century, the most important being the [[Baron Hylton|Hyltons]] of [[Hylton Castle]], the Bulmers of [[Brancepeth]], the Conyers of Sockburne, the Hansards of Evenwood, and the [[Earl of Scarbrough|Lumleys]] of [[Lumley Castle]]. The Nevilles owned large estates in the county. [[Raby Castle]], their principal seat, was rebuilt by [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby]] in 1377.

[[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s [[quo warranto]] proceedings of 1293 showed twelve lords enjoying more or less extensive franchises under the bishop. The repeated efforts of [[the Crown]] to check the powers of the palatinate bishops culminated in 1536 in the Act of Resumption, which deprived the bishop of the power to pardon offences against the law or to appoint judicial officers. Moreover, indictments and legal processes were in future to run in the name of the king, and offences to be described as against the peace of the king, rather than that of the bishop. In 1596 restrictions were imposed on the powers of the chancery, and in 1646 the palatinate was formally abolished. It was revived, however, after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], and continued with much the same power until 5 July 1836, when the [[Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836]] provided that the palatine jurisdiction should in future be vested in the crown.<ref>The [[Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836]] (6 & 7 Will 4 c 19)</ref>

During the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] passed through Durham. On the outbreak of the [[English Civil War|Great Rebellion]] Durham inclined to support the cause of the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], and in 1640 the high sheriff of the palatinate guaranteed to supply the [[Scotland|Scottish]] army with provisions during their stay in the county. In 1642 the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Earl of Newcastle]] formed the western counties into an association for the kings service, but in 1644 the palatinate was again overrun by the Scottish army, and after the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] fell entirely into the hands of the parliament.

In 1614 a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was introduced in parliament for securing representation to the county and city of Durham and the borough of [[Barnard Castle]]. The movement was strongly opposed by the bishop, as an infringement of his palatinate rights, and the county was first summoned to return members to parliament in 1654. After the Restoration the county and city returned two members each. By the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] of 1832 the county returned two members for two divisions, and the boroughs of [[Gateshead]], [[South Shields]] and [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] acquired representation. The boroughs of Darlington, Stockton and [[Hartlepool]] returned one member each from 1868 until the Redistribution Act of 1885.

The economic history of the county centres round the growth of the mining industry, which at its heights employed almost the whole of the non-agricultural population, with large numbers of pit villages being founded throughout the county. [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] possessed a mine in Durham which he granted to Bishop Pudsey, and in the same century [[Coal miner|colliers]] are mentioned at Coundon, Bishopwearmouth and Sedgefield. Cockfield Fell was one of the earliest Landsale collieries in Durham. [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] granted to the inhabitants of Durham licence to export the produce of the mines, the majority being transported from the Port of Sunderland complex which was constructed in the 1850s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Among other early industries lead-mining was carried on in the western part of the county, and [[Mustard plant|mustard]] was extensively cultivated. Gateshead had a considerable [[tanning]] trade and [[shipbuilding]] was undertaken at Sunderland, which became the largest shipbuilding town in the world - constructing a third of Britain's tonnage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Post markings===
Postal Rates from 1801 were charged depending on the distance from London. Durham was allocated the code 263 the approximate mileage from London.  From about 1811, a datestamp appeared on letters showing the date the letter was posted.  In 1844 a new system was introduced and Durham was allocated the code 267.   This system was replaced in 1840 when the first postage stamps were introduced.

==Culture==
[[File:QESFC.jpg|thumb|170px|The [[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College]] in [[Darlington]]]]
The culture of coal mining found expression in the [[Durham Miners' Gala]], which was first held in 1871,<ref name=advice>Miner's Advice - [http://www.minersadvice.co.uk/yourview22_moving_on_seamlessly.htm Moving on seamlessly...].Retrieved 2 December 2007.</ref> developed around the culture of trade unionism. Coal mining continued to decline and pits closed. The [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|UK miners' strike of 1984/5]] caused many miners across the county to strike. Today no deep-coal mines exist in the county and numbers attending the Miners' Gala decreased over the period between the end of the strike and the 21st century. However recent years have seen numbers significantly increase, and more banners return to the Gala each year as former colliery communities restore or replicate former banners to march at the Gala parade.<ref name=advice/><ref name=heritage>Heritage Lottery Fund - [http://www.hlf.org.uk/English/MediaCentre/Archive/Durham+Miners+Gala.htm Durham Miners' Gala].Retrieved 2 December 2007.</ref>
