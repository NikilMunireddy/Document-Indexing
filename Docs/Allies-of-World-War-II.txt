The '''Allies of World War II''', called the '''United Nations''' from the [[Declaration by United Nations|1 January 1942 declaration]], were the countries that together opposed the [[Axis powers]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–1945). The Allies promoted the alliance as seeking to stop German, Japanese and Italian aggression.

The anti-German coalition at the start of the war (1 September 1939) consisted of [[France]], [[Poland]] and [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], soon to be joined by the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]]).<ref>Davies 2006, pp 150–151.</ref> Poland was a minor factor after [[Invasion of Poland|its defeat]] in 1939; France was a minor factor after [[Battle of France|its defeat]] in 1940. After first having [[Molotov–Ribbentrop pact|cooperated with Germany]] in [[Soviet invasion of Poland|partitioning Poland]] whilst remaining neutral in the Allied-Axis conflict, the [[Soviet Union]] perforce joined the Allies in June 1941 after being [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded by Germany]]. The [[United States]] provided war [[materiel]] and money all along, and officially joined in December 1941 [[Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor|after]] the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. As of 1942, the "Big Three" leaders of the [[United Kingdom]], the Soviet Union, and the United States controlled Allied policy; relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were [[Special Relationship|especially close]]. [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]] had already [[Second Sino-Japanese War|been at war with Japan]] since the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] of 1937, but officially joined the Allies in 1941. The Big Three and China were referred as a "[[trustee]]ship of the powerful",<ref name = Justus>{{cite book |last1=Doenecke |first1=Justus D. |last2=Stoler |first2=Mark A. |title=Debating Franklin D.

Other key Allies included British India, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia as well as Free France; there were numerous others. Together they called themselves the "United Nations" and in 1945 created the modern [[United Nations|UN]].<ref>Ian C. B. Dear and Michael Foot, eds.

==Origins and creation==
{{Main|Causes of World War II|Grand Alliance (World War II)}}
The origins of the Allied powers stem from the [[Allies of World War I]] and cooperation of the victorious powers at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]. Germany resented being forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The new Weimar republic's legitimacy became shaken. However, the 1920s were peaceful.

With the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the ensuing [[Great Depression]], political unrest in Europe soared including the rise in support of [[Revanchism|revanchist]] nationalists in Germany who blamed the severity of the economic crisis on the Treaty of Versailles. By the early 1930s, the [[Nazi Party]] led by [[Adolf Hitler]] became the dominant revanchist movement in Germany and Hitler and the Nazis gained power in 1933. The Nazi regime demanded the immediate cancellation of the Treaty of Versailles and made claims to German-populated Austria, and German-populated territories of Czechoslovakia.  The likelihood of war was high, and the question was whether it could be avoided through strategies such as [[appeasement]].

In Asia, when Japan seized [[Manchuria]] in 1931, the League of Nations condemned it for aggression against China. Japan responded by leaving the League of Nations in March 1933. After four quiet years, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] erupted in 1937 with Japanese forces invading China. The League of Nations condemned Japan's actions and initiated sanctions on Japan. The United States, in particular, was angered at Japan and sought to support China.

[[File:Poland First To Fight.jpg|thumb|upright|''Poland first to fight'' — British wartime poster supporting [[Invasion of Poland|Poland after the German invasion]], 1939]]

In March 1939, Germany took over Czechoslovakia, violating the [[Munich Agreement]] signed six months before, and demonstrating that the appeasement policy was a failure. Britain and France decided that Hitler had no intention to uphold diplomatic agreements and responded by preparing for war. On 31 March 1939, Britain formed the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]] in an effort to avert a German attack on the country. Also, the French had a long-standing [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|alliance with Poland since 1921]]. The Western powers also sought an alliance with the [[Soviet Union]], but Hitler ended the risk of a war with Stalin by signing the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi–Soviet non-aggression pact]] in August 1939. The agreement secretly divided the independent nations of eastern Europe between the two powers and assured adequate oil supplies for the German war machine. On 1 September 1939, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]]; two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany. Then, on 17 September 1939, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] from the east. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] was set up and it continued to be one of the Allies, a model followed by other occupied countries. After a quiet winter, Germany in April 1940 invaded and quickly defeated Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and France. Britain and its Empire stood alone against Hitler and Mussolini. In June 1941, Hitler broke the non-aggression agreement with Stalin and Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In December, Japan attacked the US and Britain. The main lines of World War II had formed.

====War declared====
Great Britain and other members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], most known as the [[Dominion]]s, declared war on Germany separately from 3 September 1939 with the UK first, all within one week of each other; these countries were [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[British Raj|India]] and the [[Union of South Africa]].

=====Colonies and dependencies=====

======In Africa======
{{Further|Southern Rhodesia in World War II}}
[[British West Africa]] and the British colonies in East and Southern Africa participated, mainly in the North African, East African and Middle-Eastern theatres. Two West African and one East African division served in the [[Burma Campaign]](http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/kaduna/meet-nigerian-soldiers-who-fought-in-world-war-ii/109488.html<ref>http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/kaduna/meet-nigerian-soldiers-who-fought-in-world-war-ii/109488.html</ref>)<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Army</ref>.

[[Southern Rhodesia]] was a self-governing colony, having received [[responsible government]] in 1923. It was not a sovereign dominion. It governed itself internally and controlled its own armed forces, but had no diplomatic autonomy, and, therefore, was officially at war as soon as Britain was at war. The Southern Rhodesian colonial government issued a symbolic declaration of war nevertheless on 3 September 1939, which made no difference diplomatically, but preceded the declarations of war made by all other British dominions and colonies.<ref>{{cite book|title=So Far And No Further!

======In the Americas======
These included: the [[British West Indies]], [[British Honduras]], [[British Guiana]] and the [[Falkland Islands]].

[[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] was ruled as a royal colony in 1933–49, with a governor appointed by London who made the decisions.

======In Asia======
{{Further|India in World War II|Indian Army during World War II}}
[[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] included the areas and peoples covered by later [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]] and (until 1937) [[Myanmar|Burma/Myanmar]], which later became a separate colony.

[[British Malaya]] covers the areas of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], while [[British Borneo]] covers the area of [[Brunei]], including [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] of Malaysia.

Territories controlled by the [[Colonial Office]], namely the [[Crown colony|Crown Colonies]], were controlled politically by the UK and therefore also entered hostilities with Britain's declaration of war. At the outbreak of World War II, the [[British Indian Army]] numbered 205,000 men. Later during World War II, the [[Indian Army during World War II|Indian Army]] became the largest all-volunteer force in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in size.[10] These forces included tank, artillery and airborne forces. Indian soldiers earned 30 [[Victoria Cross]]es during the Second World War. It suffered 1,500,000 civilian casualties (more than the United Kingdom), mainly from the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] caused by the fall of Burma to the Japanese<ref name="jstor.org">Gordon, Leonard A., Review of ''Prosperity and Misery in Modern Bengal: The Famine of 1943–1944'' by Greenough, Paul R., The American Historical Review, Vol. 88, No. 4  (Oct. 1983), p. 1051 <http://www.jstor.org/stable/1874145></ref> and the transfer of food to the war effort, and 87,000 military casualties (more than any Crown colony but fewer than the United Kingdom). The UK suffered 382,000 military casualties.

Protectorates included: [[Sheikhdom of Kuwait|Kuwait]] was a protectorate of the United Kingdom formally established in 1920. The [[Trucial States]] were protectorates in the Persian Gulf.

[[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] was a mandate dependency created in the peace agreements after [[World War I]] from former territory of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]]

======In Europe======
The [[Cyprus Regiment]] was formed by the British Government during the Second World War and made part of the British Army structure. It was mostly [[Greek Cypriots]] volunteers and Turkish speaking Cypriot inhabitants of Cyprus but also included other Commonwealth nationalities. On a brief visit to Cyprus in 1943, Winston Churchill praised the "soldiers of the Cyprus Regiment who have served honourably on many fields from Libya to Dunkirk". About 30,000 Cypriots served in the Cyprus Regiment. The regiment was involved in action from the very start and served at [[Dunkirk]], in the Greek Campaign ([[Battle of Greece]]) (about 600 soldiers were captured in [[Kalamata]] in 1941), North Africa ([[Operation Compass]]), France, the Middle East and Italy. Many soldiers were taken prisoner especially at the beginning of the war and were interned in various POW camps ([[Stalag]]) including Lamsdorf ([[Stalag VIII-B]]), Stalag IVC at Wistritz bei Teplitz and Stalag 4b near Most in the Czech Republic. The soldiers captured in Kalamata were transported by train to prisoner of war camps.

===China===

{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}

In the 1920s the Soviet Union provided military assistance to [[Kuomintang]], or the Nationalists and helped reorganize their party along [[Leninist]] lines: a unification of party, state, and army.  In exchange the Nationalists agreed to let members of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] join the Nationalists on an individual basis.  However, following the nominal unification of China at the end of the [[Northern Expedition]] in 1928, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] purged leftists from his party and fought against the revolting Chinese Communist Party, former [[warlord]]s, and other militarist factions.  A fragmented China provided easy opportunities for Japan to gain territories piece by piece without engaging in total war. Following the 1931 [[Mukden Incident]], the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] was established. Throughout the early to mid-1930s, Chiang's anti-communist and anti-militarist campaigns continued while he fought small, incessant conflicts against Japan, usually followed by unfavorable settlements and concessions after military defeats.

In 1936 Chiang was forced to cease his [[Nanjing decade|anti-communist military campaigns]] after [[Xian incident|his kidnap and release]] by [[Zhang Xueliang]], and reluctantly formed a [[Second United Front (China)|nominal alliance]] with the Communists, while the Communists agreed to fight under the nominal command of the Nationalists against the Japanese.  Following the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] of 7 July 1937, China and Japan became embroiled in a full-scale war.  The Soviet Union, wishing to keep China in the fight against Japan, supplied China with military assistance until 1941, when it [[Soviet-Japanese Treaty (1941)|signed a non-aggression pact with Japan]].  Continuous clashes between the Communists and Nationalists behind enemy lines cumulated in a [[New Fourth Army Incident|major military conflict]] between these two former allies that effectively ended their cooperation against the Japanese, and China had been divided between the internationally recognized  [[Nationalist Government|Nationalist China]] under the leadership of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Communist-controlled China (1927–1949)|Communist China]] under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]] until the Japanese surrendered in 1945.

====Factions====

=====Nationalists=====

Prior to the alliance of Germany and Italy to Japan, the Nationalist Government held close relations with both Germany and Italy. In the early 1930s, [[Sino-German cooperation]] between the Nationalist Government and Germany in military and industrial matters. [[Nazi Germany]] provided the largest proportion of Chinese arms imports and technical expertise. Relations between the Nationalist Government and Italy during the 1930s varied, however even after the Nationalist Government followed League of Nations sanctions against Italy for its invasion of [[Ethiopia]], the international sanctions proved unsuccessful, and relations between the Fascist government in Italy and the Nationalist Government in China returned to normal shortly afterwards.<ref name="G.

Bruce Strang 2003. Pp. 58-59" /> However, after 1936 the relationship between the Nationalist Government and Italy changed due to a Japanese diplomatic proposal to recognize the [[Italian Empire]] that included occupied Ethiopia within it in exchange for Italian recognition of [[Manchukuo]], Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]] accepted this offer by Japan, and on 23 October 1936 Japan recognized the Italian Empire and Italy recognized Manchukuo, as well as discussing increasing commercial links between Italy and Japan.<ref>G. Bruce Strang. On the fiery march: Mussolini prepares for war. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc., 2003. Pp.&nbsp;59–60.</ref>

The Nationalist Government held close relations with the [[United States]]. The United States opposed Japan's invasion of China in 1937 that it considered an illegal violation of China's [[sovereignty]], and offered the Nationalist Government diplomatic, economic, and military assistance during its war against Japan. In particular, the United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a complete halt by imposing a full embargo on all trade between the United States to Japan, Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its [[petroleum]], resulting in an economic and military crisis for Japan that could not continue its war effort with China without access to petroleum.<ref>Euan Graham.

Even though the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] had been fighting the longest among all the Allied powers, it only officially joined the Allies after the attack on Pearl Harbor, on 7 December 1941. China fought the Japanese Empire before joining the Allies In the [[Pacific Theatre of Operations|Pacific War]]. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek thought Allied victory was assured with the entrance of the United States into the war, and he declared war on Germany and the other Axis nations. However, Allied aid remained low because the [[Burma Road]] was closed and the Allies suffered a series of military defeats against Japan early on in the campaign. General [[Sun Li-jen]] led the R.O.C. forces to the relief of 7,000 British forces trapped by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]]. He then reconquered North Burma and re-established the land route to China by the [[Ledo Road]]. But the bulk of military aid did not arrive until the spring of 1945. More than 1.5 million Japanese troops were trapped in the China Theatre, troops that otherwise could have been deployed elsewhere if China had collapsed and made a separate peace.

=====Communists=====

Communist China had been tacitly supported by the [[Soviet Union]] since the 1920s, though the Soviet Union diplomatically recognised the Republic of China, [[Joseph Stalin]] supported cooperation between the Nationalists and the Communists—including pressuring the Nationalist Government to grant the Communists state and military positions in the government.<ref name="Frederic J. Fleron 2009. Pp. 236" /> This was continued into the 1930s that fell in line with the Soviet Union's subversion policy of [[popular front]]s to increase communists' influence in governments.<ref name="Frederic J.

Pp. 9" />

After the breakdown of their cooperation with the Nationalists in 1941, the Communists prospered and grew as the war against Japan dragged on, building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, land and tax reform measures favoring poor peasants; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade and fighting the Japanese at the same time.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{cite news|title=Crisis|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=13 November 1944}}</ref>

The Communist Party's position in China was boosted further upon the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in  August 1945 against the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] and the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] in China and [[Manchuria]]. Upon the intervention of the Soviet Union against [[Japan]] in [[World War II]] in 1945, Mao Zedong in April and May 1945 had planned to mobilize 150,000 to 250,000 soldiers from across China to work with forces of the Soviet Union in capturing Manchuria.<ref>Dieter Heinzig.

After Germany invaded Poland, France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939.<ref name="Speeches that Reshaped the World">Speeches that Reshaped the World.</ref> In January 1940, French Prime Minister [[Édouard Daladier]] made a major speech denouncing the actions of Germany:
{{quote|At the end of five months of war, one thing has become more and more clear. It is that Germany seeks to establish a domination of the world completely different from any known in world history.

The domination at which the Nazis aim is not limited to the displacement of the balance of power and the imposition of the supremacy of one nation. It seeks the systematic and total destruction of those conquered by Hitler and it does not treaty with the nations which it has subdued. He destroys them. He takes from them their whole political and economic existence and seeks even to deprive them of their history and culture. He wishes only to consider them as vital space and a vacant territory over which he has every right.

The human beings who constitute these nations are for him only cattle. He orders their massacre or migration. He compels them to make room for their conquerors. He does not even take the trouble to impose any war tribute on them.

France experienced several major phases of action during World War II:
* The "[[Phoney War]]" of 1939–1940, also called ''drôle de guerre'' in France, ''dziwna wojna'' in Poland (both meaning "Strange War"), or the ''"Sitzkrieg"'' ("Sitting War") in Germany.
* The [[Battle of France]] in May–June 1940, which resulted in the defeat of the Allies, the fall of the [[French Third Republic]], the [[occupation of France|German occupation of northern and western France]], and the creation of the rump state [[Vichy France]], which received diplomatic recognition from the Axis and most neutral countries including the  [[United States]].<ref name="mondediplo_May2003_WhentheUSwantedtotakeoverFrance">{{cite web |url=http://mondediplo.com/2003/05/05lacroix |title=When the US wanted to take over France‑Le Monde diplomatique‑English edition |date=May 2003 |publisher=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |accessdate=10 December 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101127123523/http://mondediplo.com/2003/05/05lacroix |archivedate= 27 November 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no }}</ref>
*The period of [[French Resistance|resistance against the occupation]] and Franco-French struggle for control of the colonies between the Vichy regime and the [[Free French]], who continued the fight on the Allies' side after the [[Appeal of 18 June]] by General [[Charles de Gaulle]], recognized by the United Kingdom as France's government-in-exile. It culminated in the [[Allied landings in North Africa]] on 11&nbsp;November 1942, when Vichy ceased to exist as an independent entity after having been invaded [[Case Anton|by both the Axis]] and the Allies simultaneously, being thereafter only the nominal government in charge during the occupation of France. Vichy forces in French North Africa switched allegiance and [[CFNL|merged with]] the Free French to participate in the campaigns [[Tunisian Campaign|of Tunisia]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|of Italy]] campaigns and the invasion [[Italian occupation of Corsica#Liberation of Corsica|of Corsica]] in 1943–44.
* The liberation of mainland France beginning with [[D-Day]] on 6&nbsp;June 1944 and [[operation Overlord|operation ''Overlord'']], and then with [[operation Dragoon|operation ''Dragoon'']] on 15&nbsp;August 1944, leading to the [[Liberation of Paris]] on 25&nbsp;August 1944 by the Free French [[2e Division Blindée]] and the installation of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] in the newly liberated capital.
* Participation of the re-established provisional French Republic's [[First Army (France)|First Army]] in the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine]] and the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]] until [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]] on 8&nbsp;May 1945.

====Colonies and dependencies====

=====In Africa=====
In Africa these included: [[French West Africa]], [[French Equatorial Africa]], the League of Nations mandates of [[French Cameroun]] and [[French Togo]], [[Madagascar]], [[French Somaliland]], and the protectorates of [[French Tunisia]] and [[French Morocco]].

[[French Algeria]] was then not a colony or dependency but a fully-fledged part of [[metropolitan France]].

=====In Asia and Oceania=====

In Asia these included: [[French Polynesia]], [[Wallis and Futuna]], [[New Caledonia]], the [[New Hebrides]], [[French Indochina]], [[French India]], the mandates of [[Greater Lebanon]] and [[French Syria]]. The French government in 1936 attempted to grant independence to its mandate of Syria in the [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence (1936)|Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence of 1936]] signed by France and Syria. However, opposition to the treaty grew in France and the treaty was not ratified. [[Syria]] had become an official republic in 1930 and was largely self-governing. In 1941, a British-led invasion supported by Free French forces expelled Vichy French forces in [[Operation Exporter|operation ''Exporter'']].

=====In the Americas=====
In the Americas these included: [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[French Guiana]] and [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]].

====Outbreak====

German invasion of the Soviet Union, [[Operation Barbarossa]], began on 22 June 1941. [[General Secretary of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]] and the government of the Soviet Union described the Soviet war effort as a war being fought by the [[Soviet people]] for their survival.<ref>Helen Rapport. Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 1999.

P. 390" />

The Soviet Union intervened against Japan and its client state in [[Manchuria]] in 1945, cooperating with the [[Nationalist Government]] of China and [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]] led by [[Chiang Kai Shek]]; though also cooperating, preferring, and encouraging the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] to take effective control of Manchuria after expelling Japanese forces.<ref>The Soviet Union and Communist China, 1945–1950: The Road to Alliance. P. 78.</ref>

====History====

In the lead up to the war between the Soviet Union and Germany, relations between the Soviet Union and Germany underwent several stages. Stalin studied Hitler, including reading ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and from it knew of Hitler's desire to destroy the Soviet Union.<ref>Kees Boterbloem. ''A History of Russia and Its Empire: From Mikhail Romanov to Vladimir Putin''. P235.</ref> In 1933, the Soviet Union had immediate concerns with the threat of a potential German invasion of the country should Germany attempt a conquest of the Baltic states, and in December of that year, Polish-Soviet negotiations began for the issuing of a joint declaration by the two countries guaranteeing the sovereignty of the Baltic states.<ref name="David L. Ransel 2005. P184">David L. Ransel, Bozena Shallcross. Polish Encounters, Russian Identity. Indiana University Press, 2005. P184.</ref> However, Poland withdrew from the negotiations following German and Finnish objections.<ref name="David L. Ransel 2005. P184" /> The Soviet Union and Germany at this time competed with each other for influence in Poland.<ref>Jan Karski. ''The Great Powers and Poland: From Versailles to Yalta''. Rowman & Littlefield, 2014. P197.</ref> The Soviet government also was concerned with the anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland and particularly [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s proposed Polish federation that would include the territories of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine within it that threatened the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union.<ref>David L. Ransel, Bozena Shallcross. ''Polish Encounters, Russian Identity''. Indiana University Press, 2005. P184.</ref>

On 20 August 1939, forces of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] under General [[Georgy Zhukov]], together with the [[People's Republic of Mongolia]] eliminated the threat of conflict in the east with a decisive victory over Japan at the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] in eastern Mongolia.

On the same day, Soviet party leader [[Joseph Stalin]] received a telegram from German Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]], suggesting that German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] fly to Moscow for diplomatic talks. (After receiving a lukewarm response throughout the spring and summer, Stalin abandoned attempts for a better diplomatic relationship with France and the United Kingdom.)<ref>Overy 1997, pp 41, 43–7.</ref>

On 23 August, Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] including secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe into defined "spheres of influence" for the two regimes, and specifically concerning the partition of the Polish state in the event of its "territorial and political rearrangement".<ref>Davies 2006, pp 148–51.</ref>

On 15 September 1939, Stalin concluded a durable ceasefire with Japan, to take effect the following day (it would be upgraded to a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|nonaggression pact]] in April 1941).<ref>Davies 2006, pp 16, 154.</ref> The day after that, 17&nbsp;September, Soviet forces [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland from the east]]. Although some fighting continued until 5&nbsp;October, the two invading armies held at least one joint [[German–Soviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk|military parade on 25 September]], and reinforced their non-military partnership with a [[German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation]] on 28&nbsp;September.

On 30 November, the Soviet Union [[Winter War|attacked Finland]], for which it was expelled from the [[League of Nations]]. In the following year of 1940, while the world's attention was focussed upon the German invasion of France and Norway,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Khudoley |first1=Konstantin K. |editor1-first= John |editor1-last= Hiden |editor1-link= |others=Vahur Made, David J.

German-Soviet treaties were brought to an end by the [[Operation Barbarossa|German surprise attack on the USSR]] on 22&nbsp;June 1941. The Soviet Union soon entered in alliance with the United Kingdom. Following the USSR, a number of other [[communist]], pro-Soviet or Soviet-controlled forces fought against the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] powers during the Second World War. They were as follows: the [[Albanian National Liberation Front]], the [[Chinese Red Army]], the [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|Greek National Liberation Front]], the [[Hukbalahap]], the [[Malayan Communist Party]], the [[People's Republic of Mongolia]], the [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Polish People's Army]], the [[Tuvan People's Republic]] (annexed by Soviet Union in 1944),<ref name="alatau">Toomas Alatalu.

====War justifications====

The United States had indirectly supported Britain's war effort against Germany up to 1941 and declared its opposition to territorial aggrandizement. Materiel support to Britain was provided while the U.S. was officially neutral via the [[Lend Lease Act]] starting in 1941.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in August 1941 promulgated the [[Atlantic Charter]] that pledged commitment to achieving "the final destruction of Nazi tyranny".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Freidel|title=Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Rendezvous with Destiny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRN2zUV5zNEC&pg=PT350|year=2009|page=350}}</ref> Signing the Atlantic Charter, and thereby joining the "United Nations" was the way a nation joined the Allies, and also became eligible for membership in the [[United Nations]] world body that formed in 1945.

The US strongly supported the Nationalist Government in China in its war with Japan, and provided military equipment, supplies, and volunteers to the Nationalist Government of China to assist in its war effort.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan G. Utley|title=Going to War with Japan, 1937–1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zCZj934XUK8C|year=2005|publisher=Fordham Univ Press}}</ref> In December 1941 Japan opened the war with its [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the US declared war on Japan, and Japan's allies Germany and Italy declared war on the US, bringing the US into World War II.

====History====

On 8 December 1941, following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States Congress declared war on Japan at the request of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. This was followed by Germany and Italy declaring war on the United States on 11&nbsp;December, bringing the country into the European theatre.

The US led Allied forces in the Pacific theatre against Japanese forces from 1941 to 1945. From 1943 to 1945, the US led and coordinated the Western Allies' war effort in Europe under the leadership of General [[Dwight Eisenhower]].

The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor followed by Japan's swift attacks on Allied locations throughout the Pacific, resulted in major US losses in the first several months in the war, including losing control of the [[Philippines]], [[Guam]], [[Wake Island]] and several Aleutian islands including [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] to Japanese forces. American naval forces attained some early successes against Japan. One was the bombing of Japanese industrial centres in the [[Doolittle Raid]]. Another was repelling a Japanese invasion of [[Port Moresby]] in [[New Guinea]] during the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].<ref>Chris Henry. The Battle of the Coral Sea. London, England, UK: Compendium Publishing; Annapolis, Maryland, USA: Naval Institute Press, 2003. P. 84.</ref> A major turning point in the Pacific War was the [[Battle of Midway]] where American naval forces were outnumbered by Japanese forces that had been sent to Midway to draw out and destroy American aircraft carriers in the Pacific and seize control of Midway that would place Japanese forces in proximity to Hawaii.<ref>Keegan, John. "The Second World War." New York: Penguin, 2005. (275)</ref> However American forces managed to sink four of Japan's six large aircraft carriers that had initiated the attack on Pearl Harbor along with other attacks on Allied forces. Afterwards the US began an offensive against Japanese-captured positions. The [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] from 1942 to 1943 was a major contention point where American and Japanese forces struggled to gain control of [[Guadalcanal]].

====Colonies and dependencies====

=====In the Americas and the Pacific=====
The United States held multiple dependencies in the Americas, such as [[Territory of Alaska|Alaska]], the [[Panama Canal Zone]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Virgin Islands of the United States|U.S. Virgin Islands]].

In the Pacific it held multiple island dependencies such as [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]], [[Midway Islands]], [[Wake Island]] and others. These dependencies were directly involved in the Pacific campaign of the war.

=====In Asia=====
[[File:FortMcKinley.jpg|thumb|200px|Philippine Scouts at [[Fort William McKinley]] firing a 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun in training.]]
The [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was a sovereign protectorate referred to as an "associated state" of the United States. From late 1941 to 1944, the Philippines was [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|occupied]] by Japanese forces, who established the [[Second Philippine Republic]] as a client state that had nominal control over the country.

==Minor affiliated state combatants==

===Australia===
{{Further|Military history of Australia during World War II}}
Australia was a sovereign Dominion under the [[Monarchy of Australia|Australian monarchy]], as per the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. At the start of the war Australia followed Britain's foreign policies, and accordingly declared war against Germany on 3 September 1939. Australian foreign policy became more independent after the [[Australian Labor Party]] formed government in October 1941, and Australia separately declared war against Finland, Hungary and
Romania on 8 December 1941 and against Japan the next day.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McKeown|first1=Deirdre|last2=Jordan|first2=Roy|title=Parliamentary involvement in declaring war and deploying forces overseas|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/bn/pol/parliamentaryinvolvement.pdf|website=Parliamentary Library|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=9 December 2015|pages=4, 8–11|date=2010}}</ref>

===Belgium===
[[File:Belgian res.jpg|thumb||Members of the Belgian resistance with a Canadian soldier in [[Bruges]], September 1944 during the [[Battle of the Scheldt]].]]
{{Main|Belgium in World War II}}

Before the war, Belgium had pursued a policy of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] and only became an Allied member after [[Battle of Belgium|being invaded]] by Germany on 10 May 1940. During the ensuing fighting, Belgian forces fought alongside French and British forces against the invaders. While the British and French were struggling against the fast German advance elsewhere on the front, the Belgian forces were pushed into a pocket to the north. Finally, on 28 May, the [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] surrendered himself and his military to the Germans, having decided the Allied cause was lost. The legal Belgian government was reformed as [[Belgian Government in Exile|a government in exile in London]]. Belgian troops and pilots continued to fight on the Allied side as the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Belgium itself was occupied, but a sizeable [[Belgian Resistance|Resistance]] was formed and was loosely coordinated by the government in exile and other Allied powers.

British and Canadian troops arrived in Belgium in September 1944 and the capital, [[Brussels]], was liberated on 6 September. Because of the [[Ardennes Offensive]], the country was only fully liberated in early 1945.

====Colonies and dependencies====
Belgium had the colony of the [[Belgian Congo]] and the League of Nations mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The Belgian Congo was not occupied and remained loyal to the Allies as an important economic asset while its deposits of uranium were useful to the Allied efforts to develop the atomic bomb. Troops from the Belgian Congo participated in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] against the Italians. The colonial ''[[Force Publique]]'' also served in other theatres including Madagascar, the Middle-East, India and Burma within British units.

===Brazil===

{{Main|Brazilian Expeditionary Force}}
[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian soldiers of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] greet civilians in the city of [[Massarosa]], Italy, September 1944.]]

Initially, [[Brazil]] maintained a position of neutrality, trading with both the Allies and the [[Axis Powers]], while Brazilian president [[Getúlio Vargas]]'s quasi-[[Fascist]] policies indicated a leaning toward the Axis powers. However, as the war progressed, trade with the Axis countries became almost impossible and the United States initiated forceful diplomatic and economic efforts to bring Brazil onto the Allied side.

At the beginning of 1942, Brazil permitted the United States to set up air bases on its territory, especially in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], strategically located at the easternmost corner of the South American continent, and on 28&nbsp;January the country severed diplomatic relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy. After that, 36 Brazilian merchant ships were sunk by the German and Italian navies, which led the Brazilian government to declare war against Germany and Italy on 22&nbsp;August 1942.

Brazil then sent a 25,700 strong [[Expeditionary warfare|Expeditionary Force]] to Europe that fought mainly on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)#Allied advance into Northern Italy|Italian front]], from September 1944 to May 1945. Also, the [[Brazilian Navy]] and [[Brazilian Air Force|Air Force]] acted in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the middle of 1942 until the end of the war. Brazil was the only [[South American]] country to send troops to fight in the European theatre in the Second World War.

===Canada===
{{Further|Declaration of war by Canada#Nazi Germany|Military history of Canada during World War II}}
Canada was a sovereign Dominion under the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarchy]], as per the Statute of Westminster 1931. In a symbolic statement of autonomous foreign policy Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] delayed parliament's vote on a declaration of war for seven days after Britain had declared war. Canada was the last member of the Commonwealth to declare war on Germany on 10 September 1939.<ref>{{cite book|author=Phillip Alfred Buckner|title=Canada and the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmXnLGX7FvEC&pg=PA105|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.P.|pages=105–6}}</ref>

===Cuba===
{{Main|Cuba in World War II}}
Because of [[Cuba]]'s geographical position at the entrance of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Havana]]'s role as the principal trading port in the [[West Indies]], and the country's natural resources, Cuba was an important participant in the [[American Theater (1939–1945)|American Theater]] of [[World War II]], and subsequently one of the greatest beneficiaries of the [[United States]]' [[Lend-Lease]] program. Cuba declared war on the [[Axis powers]] in December 1941<ref name="narod.ru">{{cite web | title=Second World War and the Cuban Air Force| work=| url=http://www.urrib2000.narod.ru/Mil1-4-e.html| accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>

===Czechoslovakia===
[[File:Legie - slavnostní nástup.jpg|thumb||[[Ludvík Svoboda]] with Czechoslovak soldiers of the [[I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|1st Czechoslovak Army Corps]] on the Eastern Front in 1943.]]

Czechoslovakia along with the United Kingdom and France attempted to resolve German irredentist claims to the Sudetenland region in 1938 with the [[Munich Agreement]], however in March 1939, Czechoslovakia was invaded by Germany and partitioned between Germany, Hungary, Poland, and a German client state of Slovakia. The [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] joined the Allies, the occupation and partition of Czechoslovakia amongst the Axis powers was not accepted by the Allied powers. Czechoslovakian military units took part in the war.

===Greece===
{{further|Military history of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation of Greece}}
[[File:Greek Army during Primavera Offensive Klisura March 1941.JPG|thumb||Greek soldiers in March 1941 during the [[Greco-Italian War]].]]

Greece was [[Greco-Italian War|invaded by Italy]] on 28&nbsp;October 1940 and subsequently joined the Allies. The Greek Army managed to stop the Italian offensive from Italy's protectorate of Albania, and Greek forces pushed Italian forces back into Albania. However, after the [[German invasion of Greece]] in April 1941, German forces managed to occupy mainland Greece and, a month later, the [[Battle of Crete|island of Crete]]. The Greek government [[Greek government in exile|went into exile]], while the country was placed under a [[Hellenic State (1941–44)|puppet government]] and divided into occupation zones run by Italy, Germany and Bulgaria. From 1942, a strong [[Greek Resistance|Resistance movement]] appeared, chiefly in the mountainous interior, where it established a "Free Greece" by mid-1943. Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Italian zone was taken over by the Germans. Axis forces left mainland Greece in October 1944, although some Aegean islands, notably Crete, remained under German occupation until the end of the war.

===Mexico===

[[Mexico]] declared war on Germany in 1942 after German submarines attacked the Mexican oil tankers ''[[SS Potrero del Llano|Potrero del Llano]]'' and ''[[Faja de Oro]]'' that were transporting crude oil to the [[United States]]. These attacks prompted [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] to declare war on the Axis powers.

Mexico formed [[Escuadrón 201]] fighter squadron as part of the [[Fuerza Aérea Expedicionaria Mexicana]] (FAEM—"Mexican Expeditionary Air Force"). The squadron was attached to the [[58th Operations Group|58th Fighter Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and carried out tactical air support missions during the liberation of the main Philippine island of [[Luzon]] in the summer of 1945.<ref>{{cite web |last = Klemen |first = L|title = 201st Mexican Fighter Squadron |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/201squadron.html |work = The Netherlands East Indies 1941–1942}}201st Mexican Fighter Squadron</ref>

Some 300,000 Mexican citizens went to the United States to work on farms and factories.  Some 15,000 US nationals of Mexican origin and Mexican residents in the US  enrolled in the US Armed Forces and fought in various fronts around the world.<ref>Plascencia de la Parra, E.

===Netherlands===
{{Main|Netherlands in World War II}}
The Netherlands became an Allied member after being invaded on 10&nbsp;May 1940 by Germany. During the [[Battle of the Netherlands|ensuing campaign]], the Netherlands were defeated and occupied by Germany. The Netherlands was liberated by Canadian, British, American and other allied forces during the campaigns of 1944 and 1945. The [[Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade|Princess Irene Brigade]], formed from escapees from the German invasion, took part in several actions in 1944 in Arromanches and in 1945 in the Netherlands. Navy vessels saw action in the British Channel, the North Sea and the Mediterranean, generally as part of Royal Navy units. Dutch airmen flying British aircraft participated in the air war over Germany.

====Colonies and dependencies====
The [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]) was the principal Dutch colony in Asia, and was attacked by Japan in 1942. During the [[Dutch East Indies Campaign]], the Netherlands played a significant role in the Allied effort to halt the Japanese advance as part of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) Command]]. The ABDA fleet finally encountered the Japanese surface fleet at the [[Battle of Java Sea]], at which Doorman gave the order to engage. During the ensuing battle the ABDA fleet suffered heavy losses, and was mostly destroyed after several naval battles around [[Java]]; the ABDA Command was later dissolved. The Japanese [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|finally occupied]] the Dutch East Indies in February–March 1942. Dutch troops, aircraft and escaped ships continued to fight on the Allied side and also mounted a [[Battle of Timor|guerrilla campaign in Timor]].

===New Zealand===
{{Further|Military history of New Zealand during World War II}}
New Zealand was a sovereign Dominion under the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|New Zealand monarchy]], as per the Statue of Westminster 1931. It quickly entered World War II, officially declaring war on Germany on 3 September 1939, just hours after Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/second-world-war/fighting-for-britain|title=Fighting for Britain – NZ and the Second World War|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage (New Zealand)|Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|date=2 September 2008}}</ref> Unlike Australia, which had felt obligated to declare war, as it also had not ratified the Statute of Westminster, New Zealand did so as a sign of allegiance to Britain, and in recognition of Britain's abandonment of its former [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement]] policy, which New Zealand had long opposed. This led to then Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage]] declaring two days later:

<blockquote>
''With gratitude for the past and confidence in the future we range ourselves without fear beside Britain. Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand. We are only a small and young nation, but we march with a union of hearts and souls to a common destiny.''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141126052232/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/pm-declares-new-zealands-support-for-britain-in-famous-radio-broadcast Ministry for Culture and Heritage, "PM Declares NZ's Support for Britain: 5 September 1939," updated 14 October 2014]</ref></blockquote>

===Norway===
[[File:Norwegian soldiers on the Narvik front.jpg|thumb|Norwegian soldiers on the [[Battles of Narvik#Land battle|Narvik front]], May 1940.]]
Because of its strategic location for control of the sea lanes in the [[North Sea]] and the [[Atlantic]], both the Allies and Germany worried about the other side gaining control of the neutral country. Germany ultimately struck first with [[Operation Weserübung|operation ''Weserübung'']] on 9 April 1940, resulting in the two-month-long [[Norwegian Campaign]], which ended in a German victory and their war-long [[occupation of Norway]].

Units of the Norwegian Armed Forces evacuated from Norway or raised abroad continued participating in the war [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile|from exile]].

The Norwegian merchant fleet, then the fourth largest in the world, was organized into [[Nortraship]] to support the Allied cause. Nortraship was the world's largest shipping company, and at its height operated more than 1000 ships.

The [[invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939, started the war in Europe, and the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. Poland fielded the third biggest army<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl/articles/view/2339 |title=Military contribution of Poland to World War II – Wojsko Polskie – Departament Wychowania i Promocji Obronności |publisher=Wojsko-polskie.pl |accessdate=15 May 2010}}</ref> among the European Allies, after the Soviet Union and United Kingdom, but before France. The country never officially surrendered to the [[Third Reich]], nor to the [[Soviet Union]], primarily because neither of the totalitarian powers requested an official surrender, and continued the war effort under the [[Polish government in exile]]. However, the [[Soviet Union]] unilaterally considered the flight to Romania of [[Ignacy Mościcki|President Ignacy Mościcki]] and [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły|Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] on 17&nbsp;September as an evidence of ''[[debellatio]]'' causing the extinction of Polish State, and consequently declared itself allowed to invade (according to Soviet position: "to protect") Eastern Poland starting from the same day.<ref>[[q:Polish September Campaign|Molotov declaration of 17&nbsp;September 1939]]</ref> It must be noted that the [[Red Army]] had invaded the [[Second Polish Republic]] several hours before Polish president fled to Romania.

[[File:Lokajski - Powstancy w Śródmieściu (1944).jpg|thumb|upright|Polish [[Home Army]] resistance fighters from the ''"Kiliński"'' Battalion during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].]]

Polish soldiers fought under their own flag but under the command of the British military. They were major contributors to the allies in the [[Western Front (World War II)|theatre of war west of Germany]] and  in the theatre of war east of Germany, with the Soviet Union. The [[Polish armed forces in the West]] created after the fall of Poland played minor roles in the [[Battle of France]], and important ones in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] and [[North African Campaign]]s.<ref name="tobruk">At the [[siege of Tobruk]]</ref>  The Polish People's Army took part in the [[Battle of Berlin]], the closing battle of the European theater of war. They occupied the city alongside the Soviet [[Red Army]].

[[Home Army]], the largest underground force in Europe, and other resistance organizations in occupied Poland provided intelligence that enabled successful operations later in the war and led to uncovering of [[Nazi war crimes]] (i.e., [[death camp]]s) to the Western Allies. Notable Polish units fought in every campaign in North Africa and Europe (outside the Balkans). The Soviet Union recognized the London-based government at first. But it broke [[diplomatic relations]] after the [[Katyn massacre]] of Polish nationals was revealed. In 1943, the Soviet Union organized the [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Polish People's Army]] under [[Zygmunt Berling]], around which it constructed the post-war [[successor state]] [[People's Republic of Poland]].

===South Africa===
{{Further|Military history of South Africa during World War II}}
South Africa was a sovereign Dominion under the [[Monarchy of South Africa|South African monarchy]], as per the Statue of Westminster 1931. South Africa held authority over the mandate of [[South-West Africa]].

===Yugoslavia===
{{Main|World War II in Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Nemacki zarobljenici u Uzicu 1941.JPG|thumb|| The Partisans and the Chetniks carried captured Germans through [[Užice]], autumn 1941.]]

[[Yugoslavia]] entered the war on the Allied side after the invasion of Axis powers on 6 April 1941. [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] was thoroughly defeated in less than two weeks and the country was occupied. The Italian-backed Croatian fascist leader [[Ante Pavelić]] declared the [[Independent State of Croatia]] before the invasion was over. [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] and much of the Yugoslavian government had left the country.  In the [[United Kingdom]], they joined numerous other governments in exile from Nazi-occupied Europe.  Beginning with the [[June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina|uprising in Herzegovina in June 1941]], there was continuous anti-Axis resistance in Yugoslavia until the end of the war.

====Resistance Factions====
[[File:Tito-Churchill.jpg|thumb||Partisan leader Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] with [[Winston Churchill]] in 1944.]]

Before the end of 1941, the anti-Axis resistance movement split between the royalist [[Chetniks]] and the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]] of [[Josip Broz Tito]] who fought both against each other during the war and against the occupying forces. The Yugoslav Partisans managed to put up considerable resistance to the Axis occupation, forming various liberated territories during the war. In August 1943, there were over 30 Axis divisions on the territory of Yugoslavia, not including the forces of the [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian puppet state]] and other quisling formations.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.znaci.net/00001/3.htm|title = Basil Davidson: PARTISAN PICTURE|date = |accessdate = 2014-07-11|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |authorlink = Basil Davidson}}</ref> In 1944, the leading Allied powers persuaded Tito's Yugoslav Partisans and the royalist Yugoslav government led by Prime Minister [[Ivan Šubašić]] to sign the [[Treaty of Vis]] that created [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].

=====Partisans=====
The Partisans were a major Yugoslav resistance movement against the Axis occupation and partition of Yugoslavia. Initially the Partisans were in rivalry with the Chetniks over control of the resistance movement. However, the Partisans were recognized by both the Eastern and Western Allies as the primary resistance movement in 1943. After that, their strength increased rapidly, from 100,000 at the beginning of 1943 to over 648,000 in September 1944. In 1945 they were transformed into [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav army]], organized in 4 field armies with 800,000<ref>{{cite book|title = Balkan Idols: Religion and Nationalism in Yugoslav States|last = Perica|first = Vjekoslav|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0-19-517429-1|location = |pages = 96}}</ref> fighters.

=====Chetniks=====
[[File:General Mihailovic with US Officers.jpg|thumb||Chetniks leader [[Draža Mihailović|General Mihailovic]] with the members of the US military mission, [[Operation Halyard]] 1944.]]

The Chetniks, the short name given to the movement titled the ''Yugoslav Army of the Fatherland'', were initially a major Allied Yugoslav resistance movement. However, due to their royalist and anti-communist views, Chetniks were considered to have begun collaborating with the Axis as a tactical move to focus on destroying their Partisan rivals. The Chetniks presented themselves as a Yugoslav movement, but were primarily a [[Serbs|Serb]] movement. They reached their peak in 1943 with 93,000 fighters.<ref>{{cite book|title = Kontrarevolucija u Srbiji – Kvislinška uprava 1941–1944 (Volume 1, in Serbo-Croatian)|last = Borković|first = Milan|publisher = Sloboda|year = 1979|isbn = |location = |pages = 9}}</ref> Their major contribution was [[Operation Halyard]] in 1944. In collaboration with the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], 413 Allied airmen shot down over Yugoslavia  were rescued and evacuated.

===Nigeria===
Many Nigerian soldiers took part in world war II, where they fought gallantly along the side of the Allies and against the Axis<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Army</ref>. Although the soldiers fought under the British flag, who was their colonial master and who trained them; Nigeria troops too saw action of world war II and some died of their injuries.

==Client states==

===British===

====Egypt====
The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] was nominally an independent state since 1922 but effectively remained in a British sphere of influence with the British Mediterranean fleet being stationed in Alexandria and British army forces being stationed in the [[Suez Canal]] zone. Egypt faced an Axis campaign led by Italian and German forces during the war. Frustration by the UK over Egypt's King Farouk's rule resulted in the [[Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942]] where British army forces surrounded the Abdeen palace, a residence of King Farouk, demanding a new government be established, that nearly forced the abdication of Farouk until he submitted to British demands.

====British Raj (India)====
{{Further|India in World War II}}

At the outbreak of World War II, the Indian army numbered 205,000 men. Later during World War II the Indian Army became the largest all-volunteer force in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in size.[10] These forces included tank, artillery and airborne forces. Indian soldiers earned 30 Victoria Crosses during the Second World War. It suffered 1,500,000 civilian casualties (more than the United Kingdom), mainly from the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] caused by the fall of Burma to the Japanese<ref name="jstor.org" /> and the transfer of food to the war effort, and 87,000 military casualties (more than any Crown colony but fewer than the United Kingdom). The UK suffered 382,000 military casualties.

====Bulgaria====
{{Main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}
After a period of neutrality, [[Bulgaria]] joined the Axis powers from 1941 to 1944.  The Orthodox church and others convinced King Boris to not allow the Bulgarian Jews to be exported to concentration camps.  The king died shortly afterwards, suspected of being poisoned after a visit to Germany.  Bulgaria abandoned the Axis and joined the Allies when the Soviet Union invaded, offering no resistance to the incoming forces.  In the 1947 peace treaties, Bulgaria gained a small area near the Black Sea from Romania, making it the only former German ally to gain territory from WWII.

====Mongolia====
[[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] fought against Japan during [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] in 1939 and the [[Soviet–Japanese War (1945)|Soviet–Japanese War]] in August 1945 to protect its independence and to liberate [[Southern Mongolia (region)|Southern Mongolia]] from Japan and [[China]]. Mongolia had been a Soviet sphere of influence since the 1920s.

====Poland (Gomułka regime)====

{{Main|Polish Armed Forces in the East}}
By 1944, Poland entered the Soviet sphere of influence with [[Władysław Gomułka]] forming a communist government. Polish forces fought alongside Soviet forces against Germany.

====Romania====
[[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] had initially been a member of the Axis powers but switched allegiance upon facing invasion by the Soviet Union.

[[File:Mussolini e Petacci a Piazzale Loreto, 1945.jpg|thumb||The dead bodies of Benito Mussolini, his mistress [[Clara Petacci]], and several Fascist leaders, hanging for public display after they were executed by Italian partisans in 1945.]]

Italy initially had been a leading member of the Axis powers, however after facing multiple military losses including the loss of [[Italian Empire|all of Italy's colonies]] to advancing Allied forces, ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] was deposed and arrested in July 1943 by order of [[King of Italy|King]] [[Victor Emmanuel III]] of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in co-operation with members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] who viewed Mussolini as having led Italy to ruin by allying with Germany in the war. Victor Emmanuel III dismantled the remaining apparatus of the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime and appointed [[Field Marshal]] [[Pietro Badoglio]] as [[Prime Minister of Italy]]. On 8 September 1943, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] with the Allies, ending Italy's war with the Allies and ending Italy's participation with the Axis powers. Expecting immediate German retaliation, Victor Emmanuel III and the Italian government relocated to southern Italy under Allied control. Germany viewed the Italian government's actions as an act of betrayal, and German forces immediately occupied all Italian territories outside of Allied control,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Josef Becker|author2=Franz Knipping|title=Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany in a Postwar World, 1945–1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3ck4Sw57nEC&pg=PA506|year=1986|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|pages=506–7}}</ref> in some cases even [[Massacre of the Acqui Division|massacring]] Italian troops.

Italy became a co-belligerent of the Allies, and the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] was created to fight against the German occupation of Northern Italy, where German paratroopers [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued Mussolini from arrest]] and he was placed in charge of a German puppet state known as the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI).

===Alliance growing===
[[File:Naciones Unidas 3.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Wartime poster for the [[United Nations]], created in 1943 by the [[United States Office of War Information|US Office of War Information]]]]

The United Nations began growing immediately after their formation. In 1942, Mexico, the Philippines and Ethiopia adhered to the declaration. The African nation had been restored in its independence by British forces after the Italian defeat on [[Amba Alagi]] in 1941, while the Philippines, still dependent on Washington but granted international diplomatic recognition, was allowed to join on 10&nbsp;June despite their occupation by Japan.

During 1943, the Declaration was signed by Iraq, Iran, Brazil, Bolivia and Colombia. A Tripartite Treaty of Alliance with Britain and USSR formalised [[Iran]]'s assistance to the Allies.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/persian/chapter01.htm#b2 |chapter=Chapter I: Experiment in Co-operation |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]| title=The Persion Corridor and Aid to Russia |series=United States Army in World War II |id=CMH Pub 8-1 |origyear=1952 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/persian/index.htm#contents |year=2000 |first=T.H.

In 1944, Liberia and France signed. The French situation was very confused. [[Free France|Free French]] forces were recognized only by Britain, while the United States considered [[Vichy France]] to be the legal government of the country until [[Operation Overlord]], while also preparing [[US occupation franc]]s. Winston Churchill urged Roosevelt to restore France to its status of a major Power after the liberation of Paris in August 1944; the Prime Minister feared that after the war, Britain could remain the sole great Power in Europe facing the Communist threat, as it was in 1940 and 1941 against Nazism.

During the early part of 1945, Peru, Chile, Paraguay, Venezuela, Uruguay, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria (these latter two French colonies had been declared independent nations by British occupation troops, despite big protests by Pétain before, and De Gaulle after) and Ecuador became signatories. [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], which were not independent nations but parts of the Soviet Union, were accepted as members of the United Nations as way to provide greater influence to Stalin, who had only Yugoslavia as a communist partner in the alliance.

===Charter of the United Nations===
{{Main|Charter of the United Nations}}

[[File:Flag of the United Nations (1945-1947).svg|thumb|The first version of the [[flag of the United Nations]], introduced in April 1945]]
The Charter of the United Nations was agreed to during the war at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]], held between April and July 1945. The Charter was signed by 50 nations on 26&nbsp;June (Poland had its place reserved and later became the 51st "original" signatory){{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, and was [[History of the United Nations#Establishment|formally ratified]] shortly after the war on 24&nbsp;October 1945.
