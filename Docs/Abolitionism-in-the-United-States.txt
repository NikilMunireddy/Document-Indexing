'''Abolitionism in the United States''' was the movement before and during the [[American Civil War]] to end [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the [[United States]].

In the Americas and western Europe, [[abolitionism]] was a movement to end the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and set slaves free. In the 17th century, English [[Quakers]] and evangelical Protestants condemned slavery as un-Christian. By that time, most slaves were Africans, but thousands of Native Americans remained enslaved.

In the 18th century, as many as six million Africans were taken to the Americas as slaves. At least a third of the newly enslaved Africans were carried on British ships. Abolition was part of the message of the [[First Great Awakening]] of the 1730s and 1740s in the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>David Brion Davis, ''The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770–1823'' (1975).</ref>

In the same period, rationalist thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] criticized slavery for violating human rights. A member of the British Parliament, [[James Edward Oglethorpe]], was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery. Founder of the [[Province of Georgia]], Oglethorpe banned slavery on humanistic grounds. He argued against it in Parliament and eventually encouraged his friends [[Granville Sharp]] and [[Hannah More]] to vigorously pursue the cause. Soon after his death in 1785, Sharp and More joined with [[William Wilberforce]] and others in forming the [[Clapham Sect]].<ref>Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 201-206</ref> Although anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, colonies and emerging nations, notably in the southern United States, continued to use and uphold traditions of slavery.

After the [[American Revolution]] established the United States, Northern states, beginning with [[Pennsylvania]] in 1780, passed legislation during the next two decades abolishing slavery, sometimes by gradual [[emancipation]]. Massachusetts ratified a [[Massachusetts Constitution|constitution]] that declared all men equal; [[freedom suits]] challenging slavery based on this principle brought an end to slavery in the state.

In other states, such as Virginia, similar declarations of rights were interpreted by the courts as not applicable to Africans. During ensuing decades, the abolitionist movement grew in Northern states, and Congress regulated the expansion of slavery as new states were admitted to the Union.

Britain banned the importation of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] in its colonies in 1807 and abolished slavery in the British Empire in 1833. The United States criminalized the international slave trade in 1808 and made slavery [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] in 1865 as a result of the [[American Civil War]].

Historian [[James M. McPherson]] defines an abolitionist "as one who before the Civil War had agitated for the immediate, unconditional and total abolition of slavery in the United States."  He does not include antislavery activists such as Abraham Lincoln or the Republican Party, which called for the gradual ending of slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=James M.

==The beginnings==
[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' inflamed public opinion in the North and in Britain against the personified evils of slavery.]]

The first attempt to end slavery in the English colonies in North America began with [[Roger Williams]] and [[Samuel Gorton]], who made slavery illegal in [[Rhode Island]] in 1652, because slavery contradicted their Protestant beliefs. However, this anti-slavery law was disregarded in 1700 when the Rhode Island colony became involved in the slave trade.<ref>Jay Coughtry (1981): ''The Notorious Triangle: Rhode Island and the African Slave Trade, 1700-1807.'' Philadelphia, Pa.</ref> In the 18th century, [[Thomas Jefferson]] and some of his contemporaries had plans to abolish slavery. Despite the fact that Jefferson was a lifelong slaveholder, he had included strong anti-slavery language in the original draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], but other delegates removed it.<ref name="ReferenceB">[[#TJFslavery|Monticello Foundation, 2012]]</ref> [[Benjamin Franklin]], also a slaveholder for most of his life, was a leading member of the [[Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery]], the first recognized organization for abolitionists in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Seymour Stanton Black|title=Benjamin Franklin: Genius of Kites, Flights,  and Voting Rights}}</ref> Following the Revolutionary War, Northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the 1777 constitution of Vermont, followed by Pennsylvania's Gradual Emancipation Act in 1780. While some of these laws were gradual, these states enacted the first abolition laws in the entire "[[New World]]".<ref name="Foner, Eric 2010 14">{{cite book | title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery | publisher=W. W. Norton & Company, Inc | author=Foner, Eric| year=2010 | location=New York | pages=14}}</ref> States with a greater economic interest in slaves, such as New York and New Jersey, passed gradual emancipation laws. By 1804, all the northern states passed laws to abolish it. Some slaves continued in servitude for two more decades, but most were freed.

In addition, individual slaveholders, particularly in the upper South, freed slaves, sometimes in their wills. Many noted they had been moved by the revolutionary ideals of the equality of men. The number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population increased from less than 1 percent to nearly 10 percent from 1790 to 1810 in the upper South as a result of these actions.

President Jefferson signed the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] on March 2, 1807. It took effect in 1808, the earliest allowed under the Constitution. In 1820, he privately supported the [[Missouri Compromise]], believing it would help to end slavery,<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]] p. 189.</ref> but his [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|views on slavery]] were complicated, and possibly contradictory.{{sfn|Cogliano|2006|p=219}} His will freed only a small fraction of [[Monticello]] plantation.<ref>Lucia Stanton (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1m1tRlh7xQC&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q&f=false "'Those Who Labor For My Happiness': Thomas Jefferson and His Slaves"], in Peter S.

In the 1850s, slavery remained legal in the 15 states of the [[American South]]. While it was fading away in the cities and border states, it remained strong in plantation areas that grew cash crops such as cotton, sugar, rice, tobacco or hemp. By the [[1860 United States Census]], the slave population in the United States had grown to four million.<ref>[http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm Introduction – Social Aspects of the Civil War], National Park Service</ref> American abolitionism was based in the North, and white Southerners alleged it fostered slave rebellion.

The white abolitionist movement in the North was led by social reformers, especially [[William Lloyd Garrison]], founder of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], and writers such as [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Black activists included former slaves such as [[Frederick Douglass]], and free blacks such as the brothers [[Charles Henry Langston]] and [[John Mercer Langston]], who helped found the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society.<ref>Leon F. Litwack and August Meier, eds., "John Mercer Langston: Principle and Politics", in ''Black Leaders of the 19th century'', University of Illinois Press, 1991, pp. 106–111</ref> Some abolitionists said that slavery was criminal and a sin; they also criticized slave owners of using black women as [[concubines]] and taking sexual advantage of them.<ref>{{cite book|author=James A. Morone|title=Hellfire Nation: The Politics Of Sin In American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnP-vMOiRREC&pg=PA154|year= 2004|publisher=Yale University Press|page=154}}</ref>

The Republican Party wanted to achieve the gradual extinction of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor was superior to slave labor. Southern leaders said the Republican policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West made them second-class citizens, and challenged their autonomy. With the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential victory]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]], seven Deep South states whose economy was based on cotton and slavery decided to secede and form a new nation. The [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1861 with the firing on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded.

In 1863, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which freed slaves held in the [[Confederate States]]. Border states, except Delaware, began their own emancipation programs. Thousands of slaves escaped to freedom behind Union Army lines, and in 1863 many men started serving as the [[United States Colored Troops]]. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] took effect in December 1865 and ended slavery throughout the United States. It also abolished slavery among the Indian tribes.

==Calls for abolition==
[[Image:Thomas Paine.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Thomas Paine]] (1737–1805), whose 1775 article "African Slavery in America" was one of the first articles in the United States which advocated abolishing slavery and freeing the slaves.]]
The first Americans who made a public protest against slavery were the [[Mennonites]] of [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown, Pennsylvania]]. Soon after, in April 1688, [[Quakers]] in the same town wrote a two-page condemnation of the practice and sent it to the governing bodies of their Quaker church, the [[Society of Friends]].<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States.'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J., p. 183.</ref>  The Quaker establishment never took action. [[The 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery]] was an unusually early, clear and forceful argument against slavery and initiated the spirit that finally led to the end of slavery in the Society of Friends (1776) and in the state of [[Pennsylvania]] (1780). The Quaker Quarterly Meeting of Chester, Pennsylvania, made its first protest in 1711. Within a few decades the entire slave trade was under attack, being opposed by such leaders as William Burling, [[Benjamin Lay]], Ralph Sandiford, William Southby, and [[John Woolman]].<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', p. 183.</ref>

Slavery was banned in the [[Province of Georgia]] soon after its founding in 1733. The colony's founder, [[James Edward Oglethorpe]], fended off repeated attempts by South Carolina merchants and land speculators to introduce slavery to the colony. In 1739, he wrote to the [[Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America|Georgia Trustees]] urging them to hold firm: "If we allow slaves we act against the very principles by which we associated together, which was to relieve the distresses. Whereas, now we should occasion the misery of thousands in Africa, by setting men upon using arts to buy and bring into perpetual slavery the poor people who now live there free." The struggle between Georgia and South Carolina led to the first debates in Parliament over the issue of slavery, occurring between 1740 and 1742.<ref>Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 128-133</ref>

The [[Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage]] was the first American abolition society, formed 14 April 1775, in Philadelphia, primarily by Quakers. The society suspended operations during the Revolutionary war and was reorganized in 1784, with [[Benjamin Franklin]] as its first president.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard S. |last=Newman |title=The Transformation of American Abolitionism: Fighting Slavery in the Early Republic |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8078-2671-5 }}</ref> [[Rhode Island]] Quakers, associated with [[Moses Brown]], were among the first in America to free slaves. [[Benjamin Rush]] was another leader, as were many Quakers. [[John Woolman]] gave up most of his business in 1756 to devote himself to campaigning against slavery along with other Quakers.<ref>John Woolman.

Extract from ''The Journal of John Woolman'', 1757, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1909, 209–217.</ref> One of the first articles advocating the emancipation of slaves and the abolition of slavery was written by [[Thomas Paine]]. Titled "African Slavery in America", it appeared on 8 March 1775 in the ''[[The Pennsylvania Journal|Postscript to the Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser]]'', more popularly known as ''The Pennsylvania Magazine'', or ''American Museum''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Paine|author2=Thomas Paul Slaughter|title=Common Sense and Related Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ls0x-NyF-HYC&pg=PA57|year= 2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=57}}</ref>

==Abolition in the North==
Beginning with Vermont in 1777, most states north of the Ohio River and the [[Mason–Dixon line]] abolished slavery. These states enacted the first abolition laws in the entire [[New World]].<ref name="Foner, Eric 2010 14"/> Slavery in Massachusetts was abolished by the judiciary. The constitution adopted in 1780 declared all men to have rights, making slavery unenforceable.

Emancipation in many free states was gradual. Enslaved people often remained slaves, but children of slaves were born free. Transition arrangements were made, partially to prevent abuses. New York and Pennsylvania still listed a few slaves in 1840 census returns, and a dozen black slaves were held in New Jersey in 1860 as "perpetual apprentices".<ref>Randall M. Miller, John David Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=idktzKdgb7YC&pg=PA471&dq=1840+census+-+new+jersey+slaves&cd=6#v=onepage&q=page%20471&f=false ''Dictionary of Afro-American Slavery''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997, p. 471.</ref><ref>[http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860a-10.pdf Population of the United States in 1860, p313] Eight Census of the United States, 1860</ref>

At the United States [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, delegates debated over slavery, finally agreeing to allow states to permit the international trade for at least 20 years. By that time, all the states had passed individual laws abolishing or severely limiting the international buying or selling of slaves.<ref>Ira Berlin and Leslie Harris (2005); Gellman (2006);</ref> Through the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, the [[Congress of the Confederation]] prohibited slavery in the territories northwest of the [[Ohio River]]. The importation of slaves into the United States was officially banned on January 1, 1808.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/opinion/30foner.html Foner, Eric. "Forgotten step towards freedom"], ''New York Times.'' December 30, 2007.</ref> No action was taken on the nation's internal domestic slave trade.

[[Image:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[John Jay]] (1745–1829), who founded the [[New York Manumission Society]] in 1785.]]
The principal organized bodies to advocate this reform were the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]] and the [[New York Manumission Society]]. The latter was headed by powerful politicians: [[John Jay]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], later Federalists, and [[Aaron Burr]], later the Democratic-Republican vice-president of the United States. New York enacted a bill in 1799 that ended slavery over time.<ref name="AIA4">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4narr3.html "Africans in America"] – PBS Series – Part 4 (2007)</ref><ref>Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009).</ref>

In 1806, [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|President Thomas Jefferson]] denounced the international slave trade and called for a law to make it a crime. He told Congress in his 1806 annual message, such a law was needed to "withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights ... which the morality, the reputation, and the best of our country have long been eager to proscribe."<ref>{{cite book|author=William Edward Burghardt Du Bois|title=The Suppression of the African Slave-trade to the United States of America, 1638-1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04mJJlND1ccC&pg=PA95|year=1904|page=95}}</ref> Congress in 1807 outlawed the international slave trade, effective January 1, 1808. The result was a reduction of more than 90 percent in the volume of the slave trade from Africa to the U.S. About 1,000 slaves a year were illegally brought into the United States.<ref>David Head, "Slave Smuggling by Foreign Privateers: The Illegal Slave Trade and the Geopolitics of the Early Republic", ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (2013), 33#3 p. 538.</ref>

==Freed by Southern owners==
After 1776, [[Quaker]] and [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] advocates helped persuade numerous slaveholders in the [[Upper South]] to free their slaves. [[Manumission]]s increased for nearly two decades. Many individual acts by slaveholders freed thousands of slaves. Slaveholders freed slaves in such numbers that the percentage of free Negroes in the [[Upper South]] increased from 1 to 10 percent, with most of that increase in [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]]. By 1810 three-quarters of blacks in Delaware were free. The most notable of men offering freedom was [[Robert Carter III]] of Virginia, who freed more than 450 people by "Deed of Gift", filed in 1791. This number was more slaves than any single American had freed before or after.<ref>Andrew Levy, ''The First Emancipator: Slavery, Religion and the Quiet Revolution of Robert Carter'', New York: Random House, 2005, p.xi</ref>  Often slaveholders came to their decisions by their own struggles in the Revolution; their wills and deeds frequently cited language about the equality of men supporting decision to set slaves free. The era's changing economy also encouraged slaveholders to release slaves. Planters were shifting from labor-intensive tobacco to mixed-crop cultivation and needed fewer slaves.<ref name="Peter Kolchin 1994, pp.78, 81">Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery, 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, pp. 78, 81–82.</ref>

The newly free black families began to thrive, together with African Americans free before the Revolution. By 1860, 91.7 percent of the blacks in Delaware were free, and 49.7 percent of the blacks in Maryland were free. Such early free families often formed the core of artisans, professionals, preachers and teachers in future generations.<ref name="Peter Kolchin 1994, pp.78, 81"/>

==Western territories==

During Congressional debate in  1820 on the proposed [[Tallmadge Amendment]], which sought to limit slavery in [[Missouri]] as it became a state, [[Rufus King]] declared that "laws or compacts imposing any such condition [slavery] upon any human being are absolutely void, because contrary to the law of nature, which is the law of God, by which he makes his ways known to man, and is paramount to all human control." The amendment failed and Missouri became a slave state. According to historian [[David Brion Davis]], this may have been the first time in the world that a political leader openly attacked slavery's perceived legality in such a radical manner.

Beginning in the 1830s, the U.S. [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] refused to allow the mails to carry abolition pamphlets to the South.<ref>Schlesinger ''Age of Jackson'', p. 190.</ref> Northern teachers suspected of abolitionism were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists. They pointed to [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] attempt in 1859 to start a slave uprising as proof that multiple Northern conspiracies were afoot to ignite slave rebellions. Although some abolitionists did call for slave revolts, no evidence of any other Brown-like conspiracy has been discovered.<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage'' (2006) p 197, 409; Stanley Harrold, ''The Abolitionists and the South, 1831–1861'' (1995) p. 62; Jane H. and William H. Pease, "Confrontation and Abolition in the 1850s" ''Journal of American History'' (1972) 58(4): 923–937.</ref> The North felt threatened as well, for as Eric Foner concludes, "Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests".<ref>Eric Foner. ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War'' (1970),  p. 9.</ref> The famous, "fiery" Abolitionist, [[Abby Kelley Foster]], from [[Massachusetts]], was considered an "ultra" abolitionist who believed in full civil rights for all black people. She held to the views that the freed slaves would colonize Liberia. Parts of the anti-slavery movement became known as "Abby Kellyism". She recruited [[Susan B Anthony]] and [[Lucy Stone]] to the movement. [[Effingham Capron]], a cotton and textile scion, who attended the Quaker meeting where Abby Kelley Foster and her family were members, became a prominent abolitionist at the local, state and national levels.<ref name="Effingham">{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20120928/NEWS/109289652/1242/mobile&TEMPLATE=MOBILE|title=An activist path: Mill owner founded Uxbridge anti-slavery society, by Susan Spence|publisher=www.telegram.com |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref> The local anti-slavery society at [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]] had more than one quarter of the town's population as members.<ref name= "Effingham" />

==Colonization and the founding of Liberia==
[[Image:HClay.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Henry Clay]] (1777–1852), one of the three founders of the [[American Colonization Society]].]]
In the early 19th century, a variety of organizations were established that advocated relocation of black people from the United States to places where they would enjoy greater freedom; some endorsed [[colony|colonization]], while others advocated emigration. During the 1820s and 1830s the [[American Colonization Society]] (A.C.S.) was the primary vehicle for proposals to "return" black Americans to freedom in Africa, regardless of whether they were native-born in the United States. It had broad support nationwide among white people, including prominent leaders such as [[Abraham Lincoln]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/slave07.htm#Free%20them|title=Lincoln on Slavery|work=udayton.edu}}</ref> [[Henry Clay]] and [[James Monroe]], who considered this preferable to emancipation. Clay said that due to
<blockquote>unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they [the blacks] never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off.<ref name=ATH>Maggie Montesinos Sale, ''The slumbering volcano: American slave ship revolts and the production of rebellious masculinity'', Duke University Press, 1997, p. 264. ISBN 0-8223-1992-6</ref></blockquote>

Many African Americans opposed colonization, and simply wanted to be given the rights of free citizens in the United States. One notable opponent of such plans was the wealthy free black abolitionist [[James Forten]] of [[Philadelphia]].

After attempts to plant small settlements on the coast of west Africa, the A.C.S. established the colony of [[Liberia]] in 1821–22. Over the next four decades, it assisted thousands of former slaves and free black people to move there from the United States. The disease environment they encountered was extreme, and most migrants died fairly quickly. Enough survived to [[History of Liberia|declare independence]] in 1847. American support for colonization waned gradually through the 1840s and 1850s, largely because of the efforts of abolitionists to promote emancipation of slaves and the granting of United States citizenship. The [[Americo-Liberian]]s established an elite who ruled Liberia continuously until the [[coup d'état|military coup]] of 1980.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/07/0721_030721_liberia.html "History Haunts War-Torn Liberia"], ''National Geographic'', July 2003</ref>

==Immigration==
Immigration of free Africans back to their continent of origin was thought of since the Revolutionary war. After [[Haiti]] became independent, the nation tried to recruit African Americans to migrate there after it re-established trade relations with the United States. The Haitian Union was a group formed to promote relations between the countries.<ref name="Nikki">Taylor, Nikki M. ''Frontiers of Freedom: Cincinnati's Black Community, 1802–1868.'' Ohio University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-8214-1579-4, pp. 50–79.</ref> In West Africa, the [[Back-to-Africa]] movement and actions of president [[James Monroe]] led to the founding of [[Liberia]], a settlement for freed Africans to live upon.
After riots against blacks in [[Cincinnati]], its black community sponsored founding of the [[Wilberforce Colony]], an initially successful settlement of African-American immigrants to Canada. The colony was one of the first such independent political entities. It lasted for a number of decades and provided a destination for about 200 black families emigrating from a number of locations in the United States.<ref name="Nikki"/>

==Religion and morality==
The [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 1820s and 1830s in religion inspired groups that undertook many types of social reform. For some that included the immediate abolition of slavery as they considered it sinful to hold slaves as well as to tolerate slavery.  "Abolitionist" had several meanings at the time. The followers of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], including [[Wendell Phillips]] and [[Frederick Douglass]], demanded the "immediate abolition of slavery", hence the name. A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, such as [[Theodore Weld]] and [[Arthur Tappan]], wanted immediate action, but were willing to support a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage.

"Antislavery men", such as [[John Quincy Adams]], did not call slavery a sin. They called it an evil feature of society as a whole. They did what they could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but were not part of any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841, John Quincy Adams represented the ''[[United States v. The Amistad|Amistad]]'' African slaves in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and argued that they should be set free.<ref>[http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm "Amistad"], Smithsonian Institution</ref> In the last years before the war, "antislavery" could refer to the Northern majority, such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], who opposed expansion of slavery or its influence, as by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] or the Fugitive Slave Act. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians.

Historian James Stewart (1976) explains the abolitionists' deep beliefs: "All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of black folks were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution."<ref>James Brewer Stewart, ''Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery'' (1976)</ref>

Slave owners were angry over the attacks on what some Southerners (including the politician [[John C. Calhoun]]<ref>[http://www.clemson.edu/welcome/history/forthill/calhoun.htm "John C. Calhoun"], Clemson University</ref>) referred to as their [[peculiar institution]] of slavery. Starting in the 1830s, Southerners developed a vehement and growing ideological defense of slavery.<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage'' (2006), pp. 186–192.</ref> Slave owners claimed that slavery was a positive good for masters and slaves alike, and that it was explicitly sanctioned by God. Biblical arguments were made in defense of slavery by religious leaders such as the Rev. Fred A. Ross and political leaders such as [[Jefferson Davis]].<ref>Mitchell Snay, "American Thought and Southern Distinctiveness: The Southern Clergy and the Sanctification of Slavery", ''Civil War History'' (1989) 35(4): 311–328; Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Eugene D. Genovese, ''The Mind of the Master Class: History and Faith in the Southern Slaveholders' Worldview'' (2005), pp. 505–27.</ref> Southern biblical interpretations contradicted those of the abolitionists; a popular one was that the [[Curse of Ham|curse on Noah's son Ham]] and his descendants in Africa was a justification for enslavement of blacks.

==Garrison and immediate emancipation==
[[Image:William garrison.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[William Lloyd Garrison]] (1805–1879), publisher of the abolitionist newspaper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' and one of the founders of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]].]]
A radical shift came in the 1830s, led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]], who demanded "immediate emancipation, gradually achieved." That is, he demanded that slave-owners repent immediately, and set up a system of emancipation. [[Theodore Weld]], an evangelical minister, and [[Robert Purvis]], a free African American, joined Garrison in 1833 to form the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (Faragher 381). The following year Weld encouraged a group of students at Lane Theological Seminary to form an anti-slavery society. After the president, [[Lyman Beecher]], tried to suppress the group, the students moved to [[Oberlin College]].

Due to its students' anti-slavery position, Oberlin soon became one of the most liberal colleges and accepted African-American students. Along with Garrison, Northcutt and Collins were proponents of immediate abolition. [[Abby Kelley Foster]] became an "ultra abolitionist" and a follower of William Lloyd Garrison. She led [[Susan B. Anthony]] as well as Elizabeth Cady Stanton into the anti-slavery cause.
[[Image:Frederick Douglass as a younger man.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frederick Douglass]] (1818–1895), a former slave whose memoirs, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'' (1845) and ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855), became bestsellers, which aided the cause of abolition.]]
After 1840, "abolition" usually referred to positions similar to Garrison's. It was largely an ideological movement led by about 3,000 people, including free blacks and [[free people of color]], many of whom, such as [[Frederick Douglass]] in New England, and [[Robert Purvis]] and [[James Forten]] in Philadelphia, played prominent leadership roles. Douglass became legally free during a two-year stay in England, as British supporters raised funds to purchase his freedom from his American owner Thomas Auld, and also helped fund his abolitionist newspapers in the United States.<ref>Marianne Ruuth (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Lx8nXxmAlcC&pg=PA118&dq=Douglass+-+england+-+not+%22as+a+color,+but+as+a+man&hl=en&ei=DkicTsr7H4yz8QOFrIDMBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Douglass%20-%20england%20-%20not%20%22as%20a%20color%2C%20but%20as%20a%20man&f=false ''Frederick Douglass''], p.&nbsp;117–118. Holloway House Publishing, 1996.</ref> Abolitionism had a strong religious base including Quakers, and people converted by the revivalist fervor of the [[Second Great Awakening]], led by [[Charles Finney]] in the North, in the 1830s. Belief in abolition contributed to the breaking away of some small denominations, such as the [[Free Methodist Church]].

[[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] abolitionists founded some colleges, most notably [[Bates College]] in [[Maine]] and [[Oberlin College]] in [[Ohio]]. The well-established colleges, such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], generally opposed abolition,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} although the movement did attract such figures as Yale president [[Noah Porter]] and Harvard president [[Thomas Hill (clergyman)|Thomas Hill]].

In the North, most opponents of slavery supported other modernizing reform movements such as the [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]], [[Public school (government funded)|public schooling]], and prison- and asylum-building. They were split on the issue of women's activism and their political role, and this contributed to a major rift in the Society. In 1839, brothers [[Arthur Tappan]] and [[Lewis Tappan]] left the Society and formed the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], which did not admit women. Other members of the Society, including [[Charles Turner Torrey]], Amos Phelps, [[Henry Stanton]], and Alanson St. Clair, in addition to disagreeing with Garrison on the women's issue, urged taking a much more activist approach to abolitionism and consequently challenged Garrison's leadership at the Society's annual meeting in January 1839. When the challenge was beaten back,<ref>{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Maria Weston|title=Right and Wrong in Massachusetts|year=1839|publisher=Dow and Jackson|location=Boston}}</ref> they left and founded the New Organization, which adopted a more activist approach to freeing slaves. Soon after, in 1840, they formed the [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]], which had as its sole platform the abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Torrey|first=E. Fuller|title=The Martyrdom of Abolitionist Charles Torrey|year=2013|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|location=Baton Rouge}}</ref> By the end of 1840, Garrison himself announced the formation of a third new organization, the [[Friends of Universal Reform]], with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers [[Maria Weston Chapman|Maria Chapman]], [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]], Oliver Johnson, and [[Bronson Alcott]] (father of [[Louisa May Alcott]]). [[File:Sketch of abolitionist Charles Turner Torrey (1813-1846).jpg|thumb|alt=Alternative text|[[Charles Turner Torrey]], c. 1840, from ''Memoir of Rev. Charles T. Torrey,'' Joseph P. Lovejoy, ed. (Boston: John P. Jewett & Co.), 1847]]

Abolitionists such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]] repeatedly condemned slavery for contradicting the principles of freedom and equality on which the country was founded. In 1854, Garrison wrote:
<blockquote>I am a believer in that portion of the Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, "that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Hence, I am an abolitionist. Hence, I cannot but regard oppression in every form – and most of all, that which turns a man into a thing – with indignation and abhorrence. Not to cherish these feelings would be recreancy to principle. They who desire me to be dumb on the subject of slavery, unless I will open my mouth in its defense, ask me to give the lie to my professions, to degrade my manhood, and to stain my soul. I will not be a liar, a poltroon, or a hypocrite, to accommodate any party, to gratify any sect, to escape any odium or peril, to save any interest, to preserve any institution, or to promote any object. Convince me that one man may rightfully make another man his slave, and I will no longer subscribe to the Declaration of Independence. Convince me that liberty is not the inalienable birthright of every human being, of whatever complexion or clime, and I will give that instrument to the consuming fire. I do not know how to espouse freedom and slavery together.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Compromise with Slavery |year=1854 |author=Wm. L.

==Black abolitionist rhetoric==
Historians and scholars have largely overlooked the work of black abolitionists, instead, focusing much of their scholarship on a few black abolitionists, such as Frederick Douglass.<ref>Levesque, George. [http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2783802?sid=21105471118013&uid=3739960&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256 "Black Abolitionists in the Age of Jackson: Catalysts in the Radicalization of American Abolitionism"], ''Journal of Black Studies'' 1.2 (1970): 187-202.</ref> Black abolitionists, though, played an undeniably large role in shaping the movement. Although it is impossible to generalize an entire rhetorical movement, black abolitionists can largely be characterized by the obstacles that they faced and the ways in which these obstacles informed their rhetoric. Black abolitionists had the distinct problem of having to confront an often hostile American public, while still acknowledging their nationality and struggle.<ref name=EncRhetoric>Thomas O. Sloane, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eslMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=black+abolitionist+rhetoric+encyclopedia&source=bl&ots=2lw_7C7bOt&sig=0-w_rS294elGncEGqyHV7vP6Dn4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4h6RVIDkJ8_voAStjoGoBA&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false "Abolitionist Rhetoric"], ''Encyclopedia of Rhetoric'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 8.</ref> As a result, many black abolitionists "intentionally adopted aspects of British, New England, and Midwestern cultures."<ref name=EncRhetoric /> Furthermore, much of abolitionist rhetoric, and black abolitionist rhetoric in particular, were influenced by the Puritan preaching heritage.<ref>Bormann, Ernest. ''Forerunners of Black Power, The Rhetoric of Abolition''. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1971. Print.</ref>

==Blackface in America==
During the stage performance of the controversial ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', white actor G. C. Germon put on blackface to represent an African-American male. The play left the white audience pitying the character, Tom, rather than seeing him as an equal. Earlier during this play, an actor breaks into a song with lyrics stereotyping mischievous, black children. This play encapsulates the controversy between [[anti-slavery]] activists and those pro slavery in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nowatzki|first1=Robert|title=Representing African Americans in transatlantic abolitionism and blackface minstrelsy|date=June 2010|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|location=UNI Internet|isbn=0807136409|pages=10–14|ref=Electronic}}</ref>

==''Uncle Tom's Cabin''==
The most influential abolitionist tract was ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), the best-selling novel and play by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Outraged by the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] (which made the escape narrative part of everyday news), Stowe emphasized the horrors that abolitionists had long claimed about slavery. Her depiction of the evil slave owner Simon Legree, a transplanted Yankee who kills the Christ-like Uncle Tom, outraged the North, helped sway British public opinion against the South and inflamed Southern slave owners who tried to refute it by showing some slave owners were humanitarian.<ref>Noel B, Gerson, ''Harriet Beecher Stowe'' (1976) p. 68.</ref> It inspired numerous [[anti-Tom novel]]s, several written and published by women.

==American Catholics==
[[Image:69th New York at church.jpg|thumb|Officers and men of the [[Irish-Catholic]] [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th New York Volunteer Regiment]] attend Catholic services in 1861.]]
[[Irish American|Irish Catholics]] in America seldom challenged the role of slavery in society as it was protected at that time by the U.S. Constitution. They viewed the abolitionists as anti-Catholic and anti-Irish. Irish Catholics were generally well received by Democrats in the South.<ref>John F. Quinn, "Expecting the Impossible? Abolitionist Appeals to the Irish in Antebellum America," ''New England Quarterly'' (2009), 82#4 pp&nbsp;667–710.</ref>

In contrast, most Irish Nationalists and Fenians supported the abolition of slavery. [[Daniel O'Connell]], the Catholic leader of the Irish in Ireland, supported abolition in the United States. He organized a petition in Ireland with 60,000 signatures urging the Irish of the United States to support abolition. [[John O'Mahony]], a founder of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] was an abolitionist and served as colonel in the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Infantry Regiment]] during the Civil War.<ref>Patrick Steward, Bryan P. McGovern, ''The Fenians: Irish Rebellion in the North Atlantic World, 1858 – 1876'', p. 51.</ref>

The Irish Catholics in America were recent immigrants; most were poor and very few owned slaves. They had to compete with free blacks for unskilled labor jobs. They saw abolitionism as the militant wing of evangelical anti-Catholic Protestantism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bryan P. McGovern|title=John Mitchel: Irish Nationalist, Southern Secessionist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qtg9jS2M9vYC&pg=PA138|year=2009|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|page=138}}</ref>

The Catholic Church in America had long ties in slaveholding Maryland and Louisiana. Despite a firm stand for the spiritual equality of black people, and the resounding condemnation of slavery by Pope Gregory XVI in his bull ''[[In supremo apostolatus]]'' issued in 1839, the American church continued in deeds, if not in public discourse, to avoid confrontation with slave-holding interests. In 1861, the Archbishop of New York wrote to Secretary of War Cameron: "That the Church is opposed to slavery&nbsp;... Her doctrine on that subject is, that it is a crime to reduce men naturally free to a condition of servitude and bondage, as slaves."  No American bishop supported extra-political abolition or interference with state's rights before the Civil War.

==German immigrants==

The secular Germans of the [[Forty-Eighters|Forty-Eighter]] immigration were largely anti-slavery. Prominent Forty-Eighters included [[Carl Schurz]] and [[Friedrich Hecker]]. German [[Lutherans]] seldom took a position on slavery, but German [[Methodists]] were anti-slavery.

==Abolitionist women==
[[File:Mott Lucretia Painting Kyle 1841.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Like many Quakers, [[Lucretia Mott]] considered slavery an evil to be opposed.]]
[[William Lloyd Garrison|William Lloyd Garrison's]] abolitionist newsletter [[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|the ''Liberator'']] noted in 1847, "...&nbsp;the Anti-Slavery cause cannot stop to estimate where the greatest indebtedness lies, but whenever the account is made up there can be no doubt that the efforts and sacrifices of the WOMEN, who helped it, will hold a most honorable and conspicuous position."<ref>{{cite book|last=Jeffrey|first=Julie Roy|title=The Great Silent Army of Abolitionism|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|page=1}}</ref> As [[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|the ''Liberator'']] states, women played a crucial role as leaders in the anti-slavery movement.

[[Grimké sisters|Angelina and Sarah Grimké]] were the first female antislavery agents, and played a variety of roles in the abolitionist movement. Though born in the South, the Grimké sisters became disillusioned with slavery and moved North to get away from it. Perhaps because of their birthplace, the Grimké sisters' critiques carried particular weight and specificity. Angelina Grimké spoke of her thrill at seeing white men do manual labor of any kind.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=The Grimké Sisters from South Carolina: Pioneers for Women's Rights and Abolition|year=2004|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|page=61}}</ref> Their perspectives as native southerners as well as women, brought a new important point of view to the abolitionist movement. In 1836, they moved to New York and began work for the [[American Anti-Slavery Society|Anti-Slavery Society]], where they met and were impressed by [[William Lloyd Garrison]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=The Grimké Sisters from South Carolina: Pioneers for Women's Rights and Abolition|year=2004|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=101–2}}</ref>  The sisters wrote many pamphlets (Angelina's "Appeal to the Christian Women of the South" was the only appeal directly to southern women to defy slavery laws) and played leadership roles at the first [[Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women]] in 1837.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=The Grimke Sisters and the Struggle Against Race Prejudice|journal=The Journal of Negro History|date=October 1963|volume=48|issue=4|pages=278 and 285}}</ref> The Grimkés later made a notable speaking tour around the north, which culminated in Angelina's February 1838 address to a Committee of the Legislature of Massachusetts.

[[Lucretia Mott]] was active in the abolitionist movement. Though well known for her women's rights advocacy, Mott also played an important role in the abolitionist movement. During four decades, she delivered sermons about abolitionism, women's rights, and a host of other issues. Mott acknowledged her [[Quakers|Quaker]] beliefs' determinative role in affecting her abolitionist sentiment. She spoke of the "duty (that) was impressed upon me at the time I consecrated myself to that Gospel which anoints 'to preach deliverance to the captive, to set at liberty them that are bruised&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Dana|title=Quaker Feminism: The Case of Lucretia Mott|journal=Pennsylvania History|date=April 1981|volume=48|issue=2|pages=149}}</ref>  Mott's advocacy took a variety of forms: she worked with the [[Free produce movement|Free Produce Society]] to boycott slave-made goods, volunteered with the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, and helped slaves escape to free territory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Lorenzo D.|title='Lucretia Mott.' by Otelia Cromwell|journal=The Journal of Negro History|date=April 1959|volume=44|issue=2|pages=186}}</ref>

[[Abby Kelley Foster]], with a strong [[Quaker]] heritage, helped lead [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Lucy Stone]] into the abolition movement. Kelley influenced future suffragists such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Lucy Stone]] by encouraging them to take on a role in political activism. She helped organize and was a key speaker at the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850. (The Seneca Falls Convention, held in 1848, was not national).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwhp.org/Resources/Biographies/KelleyFoster/1850.html |title=Abby Kelley Foster at First National Woman's Rights Convention |author= |pages= |date= |accessdate=2010-07-23 |quote= |publisher=Worcester Women's History Project }}</ref>  She was an "ultra" abolitionist who believed in immediate and complete civil rights for all slaves. Since 1841, however, she had resigned from the Quakers over disputes about not allowing anti-slavery speakers in meeting houses (including the [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]] monthly meeting where she had attended with her family), and the group disowned her.{{Sfn|Morin|1994|p=19}}{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|p=123}}<ref name="Buffum">{{cite book|last=Buffum|first=Lucille|title=Elizabeth Buffum Chase- Her Life and its Environment|publisher=W.

Radical abolitionism became known as "Abby Kelleyism."{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|pp=1--3, 41--59, 230}}{{Sfn|Morin|1994|pp=19--20}}

Other luminaries such as [[Lydia Maria Child]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Harriet Tubman]], and [[Sojourner Truth]] all played important roles in abolitionism. But even beyond these well-known women, abolitionism maintained impressive support from white middle-class and some black women. It was these women who performed many of the logistical, day-to-day tasks that made the movement successful. They raised money, wrote and distributed propaganda pieces, drafted and signed petitions, and lobbied the legislatures. Though abolitionism sowed the seeds of the women's rights movement, most women became involved in abolitionism because of a gendered religious worldview, and the idea that they had feminine, moral responsibilities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jeffrey|first=Julie Roy|title=The Great Silent Army of Abolitionism|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|page=2}}</ref>  For example, in the winter of 1831–1832, three women's petitions were written to the Virginia legislature, advocating emancipation of the state's slave population. The only precedent for such action was [[Catharine Beecher|Catharine Beecher's]] organization of a petition protesting the [[Cherokee removal]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Breen|first=Patrick H.|title=The Female Antislavery Petition Campaign of 1831–32|journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography|year=2002|volume=110|issue=3|pages=377}}</ref>   The Virginia petitions, while the first of their kind, were by no means the last. Similar backing increased leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Even as women played crucial roles in abolitionism, the movement simultaneously helped stimulate women's-rights efforts. A full 10 years before the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the [[Grimké sisters|Grimkés]] were travelling and lecturing about their experiences with slavery. As Gerda Lerner says, the Grimkés understood their actions' great impact. "In working for the liberation of the slave," Lerner writes, "Sarah and Angelina Grimké found the key to their own liberation. And the consciousness of the significance of their actions was clearly before them. 'We Abolition Women are turning the world upside down.'"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=The Grimké Sisters from South Carolina: Pioneers for Women's Rights and Abolition|year=2004|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|page=10}}</ref>

Women gained important experiences in public speaking and organizing that stood them in good stead going forward. The Grimké sisters' public speaking played a critical part in legitimizing women's place in the public sphere.

The July 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]] grew out of a partnership between [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] that blossomed while the two worked, at first, on abolitionist issues. Indeed, the two met at the [[World's Anti-Slavery Convention]] in the summer of 1840.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sklar|first=Kathryn|title=Women's Rights Emerges Within the Anti-Slavery Movement, 1830–1870: A Brief History with Documents|year=2000|publisher=St Martin's|location=Boston|page=50}}</ref>  Mott brought oratorical skills and an impressive reputation as an abolitionist to the nascent women's rights movement.

Abolitionism brought together active women and enabled them to make political and personal connections while honing communication and organizational skills. Even [[Sojourner Truth]], commonly associated with abolitionism, delivered her first documented public speech at the [[National Women's Rights Convention#1850 in Worcester|1850 National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester]]. There, she argued for women's reform activism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sklar|first=Kathryn|title=Women's Rights Emerges Within the Anti-Slavery Movement, 1830–1870: A Brief History with Documents|year=2000|publisher=St Martin's|location=Boston|page=63}}</ref>

==Progress of abolition in the United States==
{{Main|Origins of the American Civil War|Slavery in the United States}}
{{See also|Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement}}

===To 1804===
Although there were several groups that opposed slavery (such as the [[Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage]]), at the time of the founding of the Republic, there were few states which prohibited slavery outright. The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] had several provisions which accommodated slavery, although none used the word. Passed unanimously by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] forbade slavery in the [[Northwest Territory]], a vast area which had previously belonged to individual states in which slavery was legal.
[[Image:Samuel Sewall.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Samuel Sewall]] (1652–1730), judge who wrote ''The Selling of Joseph'' (1700) which denounced the spread of slavery in the American colonies.]]

American abolitionism began very early, well before the United States was founded as a nation. An early law abolishing slavery (but not temporary [[indentured servitude]]) in Rhode Island in 1652 floundered within 50 years.<ref>Lauber, Almon Wheeler, ''Indian Slavery in Colonial Times Within the Present Limits of the United States.'' New York: Columbia University, 1913. See also the Rhode Island Historical Society [http://www.rihs.org/faqatt.htm FAQ].</ref> [[Samuel Sewall]], a prominent Bostonian and one of the judges at the [[Salem Witch Trials]], wrote The Selling of Joseph<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2004september.cfm |title=The Selling of Joseph: A Memorial |first1=Samuel |last1=Sewall |authorlink=Samuel Sewall |place=Boston |publisher=Bartholomew Green and John Allen ([[Massachusetts Historical Society]]) |year=1700 |accessdate=9 December 2011}}</ref> in protest of the widening practice of outright slavery as opposed to indentured servitude in the colonies. This is the earliest-recorded anti-slavery tract published in the future United States.

In 1777, [[Vermont]], not yet a state, became the first jurisdiction in North America to prohibit slavery: slaves were not directly freed, but masters were required to remove slaves from Vermont. The first state to begin a gradual abolition of slavery was Pennsylvania, in 1780. All importation of slaves was prohibited, but none freed at first; only the slaves of masters who failed to register them with the state, along with the "future children" of enslaved mothers. Those enslaved in Pennsylvania before the 1780 law went into effect were not freed until 1847.<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/history/gradual.htm Pennsylvania's Gradual Abolition Act]</ref>

Massachusetts took a much more radical position. Its Supreme Court ruled in 1783, that a black man was, indeed, a man and therefore free under the state's constitution.

[[Image:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|250px|An animation showing when states and territories forbade or admitted slavery 1789–1861]]
[[Image:Lovejoyat1837AltonIllinoisRiot.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Wood engraving of proslavery riot in [[Alton, Illinois]] on 7 November 1837, which resulted in the murder of abolitionist [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] (1802–1837).]]
All of the other states north of [[Maryland]] began gradual abolition of slavery between 1781 and 1804, based on the Pennsylvania model.

===South===
The institution remained solid in the South, and that region's customs and social beliefs evolved into a strident defense of slavery in response to the rise of a stronger anti-slavery stance in the North. In 1835 alone, abolitionists mailed over a million pieces of anti-slavery literature to the South. In response, Southern legislators banned abolitionist literature and encouraged harassment of anyone distributing it.

===Immediate abolition===
Abolitionists included those who joined the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] or its auxiliary groups in the 1830s and 1840s as the movement fragmented.<ref>''Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery'' by James Brewer Stewart, p. 78''</ref> The fragmented anti-slavery movement included groups such as the [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]]; the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society; the American Missionary Association; and the Church Anti-Slavery Society. Historians traditionally distinguish between moderate antislavery reformers or gradualists, who concentrated on stopping the spread of slavery, and radical abolitionists or immediatists, whose demands for unconditional emancipation often merged with a concern for black civil rights. However, James Stewart advocates a more nuanced understanding of the relationship of abolition and antislavery prior to the Civil War:
<blockquote>While instructive, the distinction [between antislavery and abolition] can also be misleading, especially in assessing abolitionism's political impact. For one thing, slaveholders never bothered with such fine points. Many immediate abolitionists showed no less concern than did other white Northerners about the fate of the nation's "precious legacies of freedom." Immediatism became most difficult to distinguish from broader anti-Southern opinions once ordinary citizens began articulating these intertwining beliefs.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Brewer Stewart|title=Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3gR57ahFQBsC&pg=PA78|year=1997|publisher=Macmillan|page=78}}</ref></blockquote>

Anti-slavery advocates were outraged by the murder of [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]], a white man and editor of an abolitionist newspaper on 7 November 1837, by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois. Nearly all Northern politicians rejected the extreme positions of the abolitionists; [[Abraham Lincoln]], for example. Indeed, many Northern leaders including Lincoln, [[Stephen Douglas]] (the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee in 1860), [[John C. Fremont]] (the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee in 1856), and [[Ulysses S. Grant]] married into slave-owning Southern families without any moral qualms.

[[Image:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Lysander Spooner]] (1808–1887), an [[individualist anarchist]] who wrote ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'' (1845).]]

Antislavery as a principle was far more than just the wish to limit the extent of slavery. Most Northerners recognized that slavery existed in the South and the Constitution did not allow the federal government to intervene there. Most Northerners favored a policy of gradual and compensated emancipation. After 1849, abolitionists rejected this and demanded that slavery end immediately and everywhere. [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was the only abolitionist known to have actually planned a violent insurrection, though [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]] promoted the idea. The abolitionist movement was strengthened by the activities of free African-Americans, especially in the black church, who argued that the old Biblical justifications for slavery contradicted the [[New Testament]].

African-American activists and their writings were rarely heard outside the black community. However, they were tremendously influential to some sympathetic white people, most prominently the first white activist to reach prominence, [[William Lloyd Garrison]], who was its most effective propagandist. Garrison's efforts to recruit eloquent spokesmen led to the discovery of ex-slave [[Frederick Douglass]], who eventually became a prominent activist in his own right. Eventually, Douglass would publish his own, widely distributed abolitionist newspaper, the ''[[North Star (newspaper)|North Star]]''.

In the early 1850s, the American abolitionist movement split into two camps over the issue of the [[United States Constitution]]. This issue arose in the late 1840s after the publication of ''The Unconstitutionality of Slavery'' by [[Lysander Spooner]]. The Garrisonians, led by Garrison and [[Wendell Phillips]], publicly burned copies of the Constitution, called it a pact with slavery, and demanded its abolition and replacement. Another camp, led by [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Gerrit Smith]], and eventually Douglass, considered the Constitution to be an anti-slavery document. Using an argument based upon [[Natural Law]] and a form of [[social contract]] theory, they said that slavery existed outside the Constitution's scope of legitimate authority and therefore should be abolished.

Another split in the abolitionist movement was along class lines. The artisan republicanism of [[Robert Dale Owen]] and [[Frances Wright]] stood in stark contrast to the politics of prominent elite abolitionists such as industrialist [[Arthur Tappan]] and his evangelist brother [[Lewis Tappan|Lewis]]. While the former pair opposed slavery on a basis of solidarity of "wage slaves" with "chattel slaves", the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whiggish]] Tappans strongly rejected this view, opposing the characterization of Northern workers as "slaves" in any sense. (Lott, 129–130)
[[Image:John Brown, The Martyr.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Idealized portrait of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] being adored by an enslaved mother and child as he walks to his execution.]]
Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>Blight, David W. (2001)Passages to Freedom: The Underground Railroad in History and Memory. Smithsonian Books</ref> This was made illegal by the federal [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]]. Nevertheless, participants like [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Henry Highland Garnet]], [[Alexander Crummell]], [[Amos Noë Freeman]] and others continued with their work. Abolitionists were particularly active in [[Ohio]], where some worked directly in the Underground Railroad. Since the state shared a border with slave states, it was a popular place for slaves escaping across the [[Ohio River]] and up its tributaries, where they sought shelter among supporters who would help them move north to freedom. Two significant events in the struggle to destroy slavery were the [[Oberlin-Wellington Rescue]] and [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid on [[Harpers Ferry]]. In the South, members of the abolitionist movement or other people opposing [[slavery]] were often targets of lynch mob violence before the [[American Civil War]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE7DD1639E733A2575BC1A96F9C946692D7CF Lynching an Abolitionist in Mississippi.]</ref>

Numerous known abolitionists lived, worked, and worshipped in downtown Brooklyn, from [[Henry Ward Beecher]], who auctioned slaves into freedom from the pulpit of Plymouth Church, to [[Nathan Egelston]], a leader of the African and Foreign Antislavery Society, who also preached at Bridge Street AME and lived on Duffield Street. His fellow Duffield Street residents, Thomas and Harriet Truesdell were leading members of the Abolitionist movement. Mr. Truesdell was a founding member of the Providence Anti-slavery Society before moving to Brooklyn in 1851. Harriet Truesdell was also very active in the movement, organizing an antislavery convention in Pennsylvania Hall in Philadelphia. The Tuesdell's lived at 227 Duffield Street. Another prominent Brooklyn-based abolitionist was Rev. [[Joshua Leavitt]], trained as a lawyer at Yale who stopped practicing law in order to attend Yale Divinity School, and subsequently edited the abolitionist newspaper ''The Emancipator'' and campaigned against slavery, as well as advocating other social reforms. In 1841, Leavitt published his ''The Financial Power of Slavery'', which argued that the South was draining the national economy due to its reliance on slavery.

===1850s===

====Compromise of 1850====
{{Main|Compromise of 1850}}
The Compromise of 1850 attempted to resolve issues surrounding slavery caused by the War with Mexico and the admission to the Union of the slave [[Republic of Texas]]. The [[Compromise of 1850]] was proposed by "The Great Compromiser," [[Henry Clay]] and was passed by Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. Through the compromise, California was admitted as a free state after its state convention unanimously opposed slavery there, Texas was financially compensated for the loss of its territories, the [[slave trade]] (not slavery) was abolished in the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Fugitive Slave Law]] was passed as a concession to the South. Abolitionists were outraged because the new law required Northerners to help in the capture and return of runaway slaves.<ref>[[Fergus M. Bordewich]], ''America's Great Debate: Henry Clay, Stephen A. Douglas, and the Compromise That Preserved the Union'' (2012) [http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Great-Debate-Compromise-Preserved/dp/1439124604/  excerpt and text search]</ref>

====Republican Party====
{{main|History of the United States Republican Party}}
In 1854, Congress passed the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], which opened those territories to slavery if the local residents voted that way. The antislavery gains made in previous compromises were reversed. A firestorm of outrage brought together former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and former [[Free Soil]] Democrats to form a new party in 1854–56, the Republican Party. It included a program of rapid modernization involving the government promotion of industry, railroads, banks, free homesteads, and colleges, all to the annoyance of the South. The new party denounced the [[Slave Power]]—that is the political power of the slave owners who supposedly controlled the national government for their own benefit and to the disadvantage of the ordinary white man.<ref>Lewis Gould's ''Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans'' (2003) chapter 1</ref>

[[File:1856-Republican-party-Fremont-isms-caricature.jpg|thumb|250px|This Democratic editorial cartoon links Republican candidate John Frémont (far right) to other radical movements including [[temperance movement|temperance]], [[feminism]], [[Fourierism]], [[free love]], Catholicism, and abolition.]]

Western explorer [[John C. Frémont]] ran as the first Republican nominee for president in 1856, using the political slogan: "Free soil, free silver, free men, Frémont and victory!" Although he lost, the party showed a strong base. It dominated in Yankee areas of New England, New York and the northern Midwest, and had a strong presence in the rest of the North. It had almost no support in the South, where it was roundly denounced in 1856–60 as a divisive force that threatened civil war.<ref>Eric Foner. ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War'' (1970)</ref>

Without using the term "[[containment]]", the new Party in the mid-1850s proposed a system of containing slavery, once it gained control of the national government. Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy:
:"The federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery."<ref>{{cite book|author=James Oakes|title=Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&pg=PR12|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=12}}</ref>

Abolitionists demanded ''immediate'' emancipation not a slow-acting containment. They rejected the new party, and in turn its leaders reassured voters they were not abolitionists.

====John Brown====
[[Image:John brown abo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] (1800–1859), abolitionist who advocated armed rebellion by slaves. He slaughtered pro-slavery settlers in Kansas and in 1859 was hanged by the state of Virginia for leading an unsuccessful slave insurrection at Harpers Ferry.]]
Historian Frederick Blue called [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] "the most controversial of all 19th-century Americans."<ref>Frederick J. Blue in ''American Historical Review'' (April 2006) v. 111 p&nbsp;481–2.</ref> When Brown was hanged after his attempt to start a slave rebellion in 1859, church bells rang, minute guns were fired, large memorial meetings took place throughout the North, and famous writers such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] joined many Northerners in praising Brown.<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis'' (1976), pp. 378–379.</ref> Whereas Garrison was a pacifist, Brown resorted to violence. Historians agree he played a major role in starting the war. Some historians regard Brown as a crazed lunatic, while David S. Reynolds hails him as the man who "killed slavery, sparked the civil war, and seeded civil rights." For Ken Chowder he is "the father of American terrorism."<ref>David S. Reynolds, ''John Brown, Abolitionist: The Man Who Killed Slavery, Sparked the Civil War, and Seeded Civil Rights'' (2005); Ken Chowder, "The Father of American Terrorism." ''American Heritage'' (2000) 51(1): 81+ online at {{Wayback|date=20070808175559 |title=files.blog-city.com/files/M06/158072/b/chowder.pdf }} and [[Stephen Oates]] quoted at {{Wayback|date=20090510102805 |url=www.nps.gov/archive/hafe/jbrown/oates-text.htm }}</ref>

His famous raid in October 1859, involved a band of 22 men who seized the federal [[Harpers Ferry Armory]] at [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia]] (then part of [[Virginia]]), knowing it contained tens of thousands of weapons. Brown believed the South was on the verge of a gigantic slave uprising and that one spark would set it off. Brown's supporters [[George Luther Stearns]], [[Franklin B. Sanborn]], [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], [[Theodore Parker]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe]] and [[Gerrit Smith]] were all abolitionist members of the [[Secret Six]] who provided financial backing for Brown's raid. Brown's raid, says historian David Potter, "was meant to be of vast magnitude and to produce a revolutionary slave uprising throughout the South." The raid did not go as expected. Not a single slave revolted. Lt. Colonel [[Robert E. Lee]] of the U.S. Army was dispatched to put down the raid, and Brown was quickly captured. Brown was tried for treason against Virginia and hanged. At his trial, Brown exuded a remarkable zeal and single-mindedness that played directly to Southerners' worst fears. Few individuals did more to cause secession than John Brown, because Southerners believed he was right about an impending slave revolt. Shortly before his execution, Brown prophesied, "the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away; but with blood."<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis: 1848–1861'' (1976), chapter 14, quote from p. 367. Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing,'' pp. 472–477, and ''The Emergence of Lincoln'', vol. 2, pp. 71–97.</ref>

====American Civil War====
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|right|upright|This famous photo of [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]] was widely distributed by abolitionists.<ref>Kathleen Collins, "The Scourged Back," History of Photography 9 (January 1985): 43–45.[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE7DF1239F937A35753C1A96F9C8B63]</ref>]]
From the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], Union leaders identified slavery as the social and economic foundation of the Confederacy, and from 1862 were determined to end that support system. Meanwhile, pro-Union forces gained control of the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]] and began the process of emancipation in Maryland, Missouri and West Virginia. Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on 1 January 1863. The passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (ratified in December 1865) abolished slavery in the United States, officially freeing more than 50,000 people still enslaved in Kentucky and Delaware.<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Foner |title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery |year=2010 |location=New York |publisher=W.
