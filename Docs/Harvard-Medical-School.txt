'''Harvard Medical School''' ('''HMS''') is the graduate [[medical school]] of [[Harvard University]]. It is located in the [[Longwood Medical Area]] of the [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] neighborhood of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

The school has a large and distinguished faculty to support its missions of education, research, and clinical care. These faculty hold appointments in the basic science departments on the HMS Quadrangle, and in the clinical departments located in multiple [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-affiliated [[hospital]]s and institutions in Boston. There are approximately 2,900 full- and part-time voting faculty members consisting of assistant, associate, and full professors, and over 5,000 full or part-time, non-voting instructors.

The current dean of the medical school is Jeffrey S. Flier, an endocrinologist and the former Chief Academic Officer of the [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], who succeeded neurologist [[Joseph B. Martin]], M.D., Ph.D on September 1, 2007.<ref name="HMSdean">{{cite web|url=http://hms.harvard.edu/public/news/new-dean.html|title=Dean of Harvard's Faculty of Medicine}}</ref>

The school is the third-oldest medical school in the United States (after [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]]) and was founded by [[John Warren (surgeon)|John Warren]] on September 19, 1782, with [[Benjamin Waterhouse]], and [[Aaron Dexter]]. The first lectures were given in the basement of Harvard Hall and then in [[Holden Chapel]]. The first class, composed of two students, graduated in 1788.

It moved from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] to 49 Marlborough Street in [[Boston]] in 1810. From 1816 to 1846, the school, known as Massachusetts Medical College of Harvard University, was located on Mason Street. In 1847 the school relocated to North Grove Street, and then to Copley Square in 1883.

The school moved to its current location on Longwood Avenue in 1906, where the "Great White Quadrangle" or HMS Quad with its five white marble buildings was established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hms.harvard.edu/public/history/history.html|title=Harvard Medical School&nbsp;— History|accessdate=February 25, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countway.harvard.edu/archives/historyNotes.shtml

In 1945 the first class of women was admitted, after a special committee concluded that male students would benefit from learning to view women as equals, that the lower-paid specialties typically shunned by men would benefit from the talents of married women doctors, and that the weakest third of each entering class of men could be replaced by a superior group of women.<ref name="First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945">{{cite report |title=First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945 |publisher=Countway Repository, Harvard University Library |url=http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782 |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}</ref>

==Curriculum==
In 2015, Harvard introduced the new Pathways curriculum, an approach which combines the problem based learning approach developed at [[McMaster University Medical School]], with more student centered electives after core clerkship. Prior to 2015, Harvard had utilized the New Pathway curriculum, which was mainly centered on [[problem based learning]].

The [[Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology]] (HST) offers an alternative MD program with a stronger emphasis on biomedical research. The HST MD program is significantly smaller than the Pathways program, accepting only 30 applicants every year.<ref>http://hst.mit.edu/academics/md</ref><ref>https://hms.harvard.edu/departments/medical-education/md-programs/health-sciences-technology-hst</ref>

== Student life ==

=== Second-year show ===
Every winter, second year students at HMS write, direct, and perform a full-length musical parody of Harvard, their professors, and themselves. The year 2007 was the centennial performance as the Class of 2009 presented "Joseph Martin and the Amazing Technicolor White Coat"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondyearshow.com/
|title=Class of 2009 Second Year Show|accessdate=March 11, 2007}}</ref> to sellout crowds at Roxbury Community College on February 22, 23, and 24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focus.hms.harvard.edu/2007/030907/second_year_show.shtml|title=SECOND YEAR SHOW: New Curriculum Debuts in Second Year Show|accessdate=March 11, 2007}}</ref>

=== Societies ===
Upon matriculation, medical students at Harvard Medical School are divided into five societies named after famous alumni. Each society has a master along with several associate society masters who serve as academic advisors to students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hms.harvard.edu/pme/societies.asp|title=Medical Education at Harvard Medical School}}</ref> In the New Pathway program, students work in small group tutorials and lab sessions within their societies.  Every year, the five societies compete in "Society Olympics" for the famed "Pink Flamingo" trophy in a series of events (e.g.,&nbsp;dance-off, dodgeball, limbo contest) that test the unorthodox talents of the students in each society. The most recent champions are London (Class of 2015), London (Class of 2014) and Cannon (Class of 2013). London (HST) has won the competition most frequently.

== Partners Harvard Medical International ==
Harvard Medical School (HMS) has a medical-consulting arm, Partners Harvard Medical International (PHMI). PHMI has long-standing collaborative relationships with medical faculties at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilians University]] in [[Munich]], Germany, [[Alfaisal University]], [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]]  and the [[Lebanese American University]] (LAU) in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. Other long-standing relationships include PHMI's work with [[Asan Medical Center]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, and [[Tokyo Medical and Dental University]] in Japan. In 2007 PHMI began a 10‑year collaboration with Lebanese American University; in October 2009 LAU opened a new medical school with assistance from PHMI.<ref>[[Partners Harvard Medical International]]</ref>
