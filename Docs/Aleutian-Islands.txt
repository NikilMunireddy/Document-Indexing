The '''Aleutian Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|uː|ʃ|ən}};<ref>{{cite web|title=Aleutian Islands|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Aleutian%20Islands|website=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref>{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|Aleutian}}}} possibly from [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] ''aliat'', "[[island]]") are a chain of 14 large volcanic islands and 55 smaller ones belonging to both the United States and [[Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13935/Aleutian-Islands|title=Aleutian Islands|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> They form part of the [[Aleutian Arc]] in the Northern [[Pacific Ocean]], occupying an area of 6,821 sq mi (17,666&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and extending about {{convert|1200|mi|-2|abbr=on}} westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in [[Russia]], and mark a dividing line between the [[Bering Sea]] to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Crossing [[180th meridian|longitude 180°]], at which point east and west [[longitude]] end, the archipelago contains both the westernmost part of the United States by longitude ([[Amatignak Island]]) and the easternmost by longitude ([[Semisopochnoi Island]]). The westernmost U.S. island in real terms, however, is [[Attu Island]], west of which runs the [[International Date Line]]. While nearly all the [[archipelago]] is part of [[Alaska]] and is usually considered as being in the "[[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaskan Bush]]", at the extreme western end, the small, geologically related [[Commander Islands]] belong to [[Russia]].

The islands, with their 57 volcanoes, are in the northern part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Physiographically, they are a distinct section of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the larger [[Geography of the United States Pacific Mountain System|Pacific Mountain System]] physiographic division.

These Islands are most known for the battles and skirmishes that occurred there during the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. It was one of only two attacks on the [[United States]] during that war.

==Geography==
[[File:UnalaskaAlaska.jpg|thumb|[[Unalaska Island]] in the Aleutian Islands.]]
[[File:The Aleutian Islands 01 Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|The Aleutian Islands from 32,000 feet.]]
[[File:North-Pacific-air-routes.png|thumb|Active Aleutian volcanoes.]]

The islands, known before 1867 as the Catherine Archipelago, comprise five groups (east to west):
*the [[Fox Islands (Alaska)|Fox Islands]]
*[[Islands of Four Mountains]]
*[[Andreanof Islands|Andreanof]]
*[[Rat Islands]], and
*[[Near Islands]]

All five are located between 51° and 55° N latitude and 172° E and 163° W longitude. The largest islands in the Aleutians are [[Attu Island|Attu]] (the furthest from the mainland), and [[Unalaska Island|Unalaska]], [[Umnak]], and [[Unimak Island|Unimak]] in the Fox Islands. The largest of those is Unimak Island, with an area of 1,571.41&nbsp;mi² (4,069.9&nbsp;km²), followed by Unalaska Island, the only other Aleutian Island with an area over 1,000 square miles.

The axis of the archipelago near the mainland of Alaska has a southwest trend, but near 179° its direction changes to the northwest. This change of direction corresponds to a curve in the line of [[volcano|volcanic]] fissures that have contributed their products to the building of the islands. Such curved chains are repeated about the Pacific Ocean in the [[Kuril Islands]], the [[Japan]]ese chain, and in the [[Philippines]]. All these island arcs are at the edge of the [[Pacific Plate]] and experience much [[seismology|seismic]] activity, but are still habitable; the Aleutians lie between the Pacific and North American [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. The general elevation is greatest in the eastern islands and least in the western. The island chain is a western continuation of the [[Aleutian Range]] on the mainland.

The great majority of the islands bear evident marks of volcanic origin, and there are numerous volcanic cones on the north side of the chain, some of them active; many of the islands, however, are not wholly volcanic, but contain  crystalline or sedimentary rocks, and also amber and beds of [[lignite]]. The coasts are rocky and surf-worn, and the approaches are exceedingly dangerous, the land rising immediately from the coasts to steep, bold mountains.

These volcanic islands reach heights of {{convert|6200|ft|m}}. [[Makushin Volcano]] ({{convert|5691|ft|m}}) located on Unalaska Island, is not quite visible from within the town of [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]], though the steam rising from its cone is visible on a (rare) clear day. Residents of Unalaska need only to climb one of the smaller hills in the area, such as Pyramid Peak or Mt. Newhall, to get a good look at the snow-covered cone.  The volcanic [[Bogoslof Island|Bogoslof]] and [[Fire Island (Aleutian Islands)|Fire Island]]s, which rose from the sea in 1796 and 1883 respectively, lie about {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} west of [[Unalaska Bay]].

==Climate==
The climate of the islands is oceanic, with moderate and fairly uniform temperatures and heavy rainfall. Fogs are almost constant. Summer weather is much cooler than Southeast Alaska (around [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]), but the winter temperature of the islands and of the [[Alaska Panhandle]] is very nearly the same. During the winter time the islands are the center for the semi-permanent [[low-pressure area]] called the [[Aleutian low]].

The mean annual temperature for Unalaska, the most populated island of the group, is about 38&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (3&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]]), being about 30&nbsp;°F (−1&nbsp;°C) in January and about 52&nbsp;°F (11&nbsp;°C) in August. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded on the islands are 78&nbsp;°F (26&nbsp;°C) and 5&nbsp;°F (−15&nbsp;°C) respectively. The average annual rainfall is about {{convert|80|in|mm|-2}}, and Unalaska, with about 250 rainy days per year, is said to be one of the rainiest places within the U.S.

==Flora==
[[File:Cape Promontory Cape Lutkes, Alaska. Cape Lutkes is part of the Aleutian Islands.JPG|thumb|Cape Promontory, Cape Lutkes on [[Unimak Island]] in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.]]
The growing season lasts approximately 135 days, from early in May until late in September, but agriculture is limited to the raising of few vegetables. With the exception of some stunted [[willow]]s, the vast majority of the chain is devoid of native trees. On some of the islands, such as [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amaknak Island|Amaknak]], there are a few [[pinophyta|coniferous]] trees growing, remnants of the [[#Russian period|Russian period]].  While tall trees grow in many cold climates, Aleutian conifers&nbsp;— some estimated to be two hundred years old&nbsp;— rarely reach a height of even {{convert|10|ft|m|0}}, and many of them are still less than {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall. This is because the islands, much like the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]] and other islands of similar [[latitude]]s, experience such strong winds that taller trees are vulnerable to snapping off.

Instead of trees, the islands are covered with a luxuriant, dense growth of herbage and shrubs, including [[crowberry]], [[bluejoint]], [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], and many flowering plants. There are areas of peat bog near the coasts. Endemic plants include the endangered [[Polystichum aleuticum|Aleutian shield fern]].

==Fauna==
The Aleutians are home to many large colonies of seabirds, including [[Buldir Island (Alaska)|Buldir Island]], with 21 breeding seabird species, including the Bering Sea-endemic [[red-legged kittiwake]]. Large seabird colonies are also present at [[Kiska]], [[Gareloi Island|Gareloi]], [[Semisopochnoi Island|Semisopochnoi]], [[Bogoslof Island|Bogoslof]], and others. The islands are also frequented by vagrant Asiatic birds, including the [[common rosefinch]], [[Siberian rubythroat]], [[bluethroat]], [[lanceolated warbler]], and the first North American record of the [[intermediate egret]].<ref>[http://www.mun.ca/serg/Buldir/buldirbirds.html buldirbirds<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The habitats of the Aleutians are largely unspoiled but wildlife is affected by competition from introduced species such as cattle, [[caribou]], and [[fox]]es. Radioactivity is still present in the environment following [[nuclear weapon]] testing on [[Amchitka]] in 1971. Nearly all of the Aleutians are protected as part of the [[Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Wilderness]].<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Aleutian Islands|id=na1102}}</ref>

==Economy==
On the less mountainous islands, the raising of [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[reindeer]] was once believed to be practicable. There are [[bison]] on islands near Sand Point. Sheep raising seems to have died off with the advent of synthetic fibers which lowered the value of wool.   During the 1980s, there were some [[llama]] being raised on Unalaska. The current economy is primarily based upon [[Fishing industry|fishing]], and the presence of U.S. military. The only crop is [[potato]]. [[Chicken]]s  are raised in barns under protection from the cold.

==Transportation==
In addition to partial air service and a ferry service, the [[Alaska Marine Highway]] passes through many of the U.S. islands.

==Demographics==
The native people refer to themselves as Unangan, and are now generally known by most non-natives as the "[[Aleut people|Aleut]]". The [[Aleut language]] is one of the two main branches of the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] language family. This family is not known to be related to any others. The [[2000 United States Census|2000 U.S. Census]] recorded a population of 8,162 on the islands, of whom 4,283 were living in the main settlement of Unalaska.

Aleutians West Census Area, and Aleutians East Borough, two areas of the Aleutian Islands are the first and second most racially diverse counties in America, according to 2010 census data.<ref>http://www.randalolson.com/2014/04/29/u-s-racial-diversity-by-county/</ref>

==History==

===Prehistory===
Because of the location of the islands, stretching like a broken bridge from Asia to America, many anthropologists believe they were a route of the first human occupants of the Americas. The earliest known evidence of human occupation in the Americas is much farther south; the early human sites in Alaska have probably been submerged by rising waters during the current [[interglacial]] period. People living in the Aleutian Islands developed fine skills in hunting, fishing,  and basketry. Hunters made their weapons and watercraft. The baskets are noted for being finely woven with carefully shredded stalks of beach rye.

===Russian period===<!-- This section is linked from [[Aleutian Islands]] -->
Explorers, traders and missionaries arrived from [[Russia]] beginning in 1741.

In 1741, the Russian government sent [[Vitus Bering]], a [[Denmark|Dane]] in the service of Russia, and [[Aleksei Chirikov]], a Russian, in the ships ''Saint Peter'' and ''Saint Paul'' on a voyage of discovery in the Northern Pacific. After the ships were separated by a storm, Chirikov discovered several eastern islands of the Aleutian group, and Bering discovered several of the western islands, finally being wrecked and losing his life on the island of the Komandorskis ([[Commander Islands]]) that now bears his name ([[Bering Island]]). The survivors of Bering's party reached the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in a boat constructed from the wreckage of their ship, and reported that the islands were rich in fur-bearing animals.

Siberian fur hunters flocked to the Commander Islands and gradually moved eastward across the Aleutian Islands to the mainland. In this manner, [[Russia]] gained a foothold on the northwestern coast of North America. The Aleutian Islands consequently belonged to Russia, until that country [[Alaska purchase|transferred]] all its possessions in North America to the U.S. in 1867.

During the consolidation of the Russian-American Company there was sporadic conflict with the native population (frequently disastrous to the poorly armed and vastly outnumbered Russians). The colonies soon entered a relatively stable state based on cooperation, intermarriage, and official policies that provided social status, education, and professional training to children of mixed Aleut-Russian birth.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_9.html THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2008 — Page 9<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Within a generation, the day-to-day administration of the Russian-American colonies was largely in the hands of native-born Alaskans. Reversing the usual trend in colonization where indigenous technologies are replaced, the Russians adopted the Aleut kayak, or [[baidarka]], sea otter hunting techniques, and the working of native copper deposits. The Russians instituted public education, preservation of the Aleut language through transliteration of religious and other texts into Aleut via an adaptation of the Cyrillic alphabet, vaccination of the native population against [[smallpox]], and science-based sea mammal conservation policies that were ahead of their time.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

By 1760, the Russian merchant Andrian Tolstykh had made a detailed census in the vicinity of [[Adak Island|Adak]] and extended Russian citizenship to the Aleuts.

During his third and last voyage in 1778, Captain [[James Cook]] surveyed the eastern portion of the Aleutian archipelago, accurately determined the position of some of the more important islands, and corrected many errors of former navigators.

====Orthodox Christian heritage====
Among the first [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries to arrive in the Aleutian Islands was a party of ten [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] monks and priests, who arrived in 1793. Within two years, a monk named Herman was the only survivor of that party. He settled on [[Spruce Island (Alaska)|Spruce Island]], near [[Kodiak Island]], and often defended the rights of the Aleuts against the Russian trading companies. He is now known in the Orthodox Church as Saint [[Herman of Alaska]].

Another early Christian missionary of the Russian Orthodox Church was Father Veniaminov who arrived in [[Unalaska Island|Unalaska]] in 1824. He was named Bishop Innokentii in 1840 and moved to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. He is now known in the Orthodox Church as Saint [[Innocent of Alaska]].

The principal settlements were on Unalaska Island. The oldest was Iliuliuk (also called Unalaska), settled in 1760-1775, with a customs house and an Orthodox church.

===U.S. possession===
After the American [[Alaska purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from Russia in 1867, further development took place. New buildings included a [[Methodism|Methodist]] mission and orphanage, and the headquarters for a considerable fleet of United States [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|revenue cutters]] which patrolled the [[seal hunting|sealing]] grounds of the [[Pribilof Islands]]. The first public school in Unalaska opened in 1883.

The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] extended American citizenship to all Natives (and this law has been held to include the indigenous peoples of Alaska) in 1924. A hospital was built in Unalaska in 1933 by the U.S. [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].

====World War II====
{{main|Aleutian Islands Campaign}}

During [[World War II]], small parts of the Aleutian islands were occupied by [[Japan]]ese forces, when [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] were invaded in order to divert American forces away from the main Japanese attack at [[Midway Atoll]]. The U.S. Navy, having broken the [[Japanese naval codes]], knew that this was just a diversion, and it did not expend large amounts of effort in defending the islands. More than 90 Americans were taken to Japan as prisoners of war. Most of the civilian population (over 800) of the Aleutians and Pribilovians were interned by the United States in camps in the [[Alaska Panhandle]]. During the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]], American and Canadian forces invaded Japanese-held Attu and defeated the Japanese, and subsequently regained control of all the islands.

June 3, 2002 was celebrated as Dutch Harbor Remembrance Day. The governor of Alaska ordered state flags lowered to half-staff to honor the 78 soldiers who died during the two-day Japanese air attack in 1942. The [[Aleutian World War II National Historic Area]] Visitors Center opened that month.

===Recent developments===
The [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] became law in 1971. In 1977, the Ounalashka Corporation (from Unalaska) declared a [[dividend]]. This was the first village corporation to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders.

In 1906 a new volcanic cone rose between the islets of Bogoslof and Grewingk, near Unalaska, followed by another in 1907. These cones were nearly demolished by an explosive eruption on September 1, 1907.

==Nuclear testing==
{{main|Amchitka}}
The U.S. conducted [[Underground nuclear testing|underground tests]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s on [[Amchitka|Amchitka Island]] from 1965 to 1971 as part of the [[Vela Uniform]] program. The final detonation, the ''Cannikin'', was the largest underground [[nuclear explosion]] by the U.S.
