The '''Czechs''' or the '''Czech people'''  ({{lang-cs|Češi}}, {{IPA-cs|ˈtʃɛʃɪ|pron}}; singular masculine: ''Čech'', singular feminine: ''Češka'') are a nation and [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] ethnic group native to the [[Czech Republic]]. They share a common culture, [[History of the Czech lands|history]] and speak the [[Czech language]].

Ethnic Czechs were called Bohemians in English until the early 20th century, referring to the late [[Iron Age]] tribe of [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Boii]] and their land [[Bohemia]]. During the [[Migration Period]], [[Germanic people|Germanic]] tribes moved westwards and around the 6th century, [[West Slavs]] settled in the area and formed an independent principality in the 9th century.

Czech people and their [[Czech diaspora|descendants]] live in the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Czech American|United States]], [[Czech Canadian|Canada]], [[Italy]], the [[Czech British|United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Australian|Australia]], [[Czechs in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], among others.

==History==
[[File:Hallstatt LaTene.png|thumb|left|An overview of the Celtic [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] (yellow), the preceding [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] (green) cultures and [[Boii]]]]
[[File:West slavs 9th-10th c..png|thumb|left|West Slavs 9th–10th centuries]]
[[Image:Josef Mathauser - Praotec Čech na hoře Říp.jpg|thumb|Forefather Čech on the [[Říp Mountain]]]]

The Czech people are primarily descended from [[Western Slavs]]<ref>Bohemia and Poland. Chapter 20.pp 512-513. [in:] Timothy Reuter. The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 900 – c. 1024. 2000</ref> who [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|settled]] in [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Austria]] sometime during the 6th or 7th centuries.<ref>The exact dating of Slavic settlement is a matter of dispute amongst scholars. See Eg Curta ("The Slavs in Bohemia: A Response to my critics; 2009") who favours a 7th-century settlement versus Nada Profantova, who argues a 6th-century settlement</ref> They might have encountered a residual [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] (generically ''Suebic'') population, but the only evidence for continued "Germanic" settlement into the 6th century comes from northern and central Bohemia.<ref>Jaroslav Jirik "Bohemian Barbarians. Bohemia in late Antiquity", in ''Neglected Barbarians'' Brepols 2010</ref>

According to a popular [[mythology|myth]], the Slavic settlers come from [[Forefather Čech]] who settled at [[Říp Mountain]].

The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century. In 880, [[Prague Castle]] was constructed by [[Borivoj I, Duke of Bohemia|Prince Bořivoj]], founder of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]] and the city of [[Prague]] was established. [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia|Vratislav II]] was the first Czech king in 1085 and the Duchy was raised to a hereditary [[Monarchy|kingdom]] under [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] in 1198.

The second half of the 13th century was a period of advancing [[German diaspora|German immigration]] into [[Czech lands]]. The number of Czechs who have at least partly German ancestry today probably runs into hundreds of thousands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/27184|title=Ethnic German Minorities in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> The [[Habsburg]] Monarchy focused much of its power on religious wars against the Protestants. While these religious wars were taking place, the Czech estates revolted against Habsburg from 1546 to 1547 but were ultimately defeated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/czech-republic/history/all-about-czech-history/the-habsburg-monarchy-and-rudolph-ii/|title=The Habsburg Monarchy and Rudolph II|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>
{{Czechs}}

[[Defenestrations of Prague]] in 1618, signaled an open revolt by the Bohemian estates against the Habsburgs and started the [[Thirty Years' War]]. After the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, all Czech lands were declared hereditary property of the Habsburg family. The German language was made equal to the Czech language.

Czech patriotic authors tend to call the following period, from 1620 to 1648 until the late 18th century, the "Dark Age". It is characterized by devastation by foreign troops; [[Germanization]]; and economic and political decline. It is estimated that the population of the [[Czech lands]] declined by a third.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Czechs and the Lands of the Bohemian Crown |last= Agnew |first= Hugh |year= 2004 |publisher= Hoover Press |location= Stanford |isbn= 0-8179-4492-3|page= 72 }}</ref>

The 18th and 19th century is characterized by the [[Czech National Revival]], focusing to revive Czech culture and national identity.

Since the turn of the 20th century, Chicago is the city with the third largest Czech population, after [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/153.html Czechs and Bohemians]</ref><ref>[http://www.wieninternational.at/en/node/3586 Czech and Slovak roots in Vienna], wieninternational.at</ref>

During World War I, [[Czechoslovak Legions]] fought in France, Italy and Russia against the Central Powers and in 1918 was proclaimed independent [[Czechoslovakia]]. Czechs formed the leading class in the new state from the remnants of the [[Austria–Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy]]. After 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only democracy in central and eastern Europe.

In 1938 the [[Munich Agreement]] severed the [[Sudetenland]], with a considerable Czech minority, from Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 the [[Nazi Germany|German Nazi regime]] established the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] for ''[[Resttschechei]]'' (i.e., the remainder of the [[Czech lands]]). [[Emil Hácha]] became president of the protectorate under Nazi domination, which only allowed pro-Nazi Czech associations and tended to stress ties of the Czechs with the Bohemian [[Germans]] and other parts of the German people, in order to facilitate assimilation by [[Germanization]]. In [[Lidice]], [[Ležáky]] and [[Luká|Javoříčko]] the Nazi authorities committed [[war crime]]s against the local Czech population. On May 2, 1945, the [[Prague Uprising]] reached its peak, supported by the [[Russian Liberation Army]]. The post-war [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] and the immediate reprisals against Germans and Nazi collaborators by [[Czech resistance]] and the Czechoslovak state authorities, made Czechs – especially in the early 1950s – settle alongside Slovaks and [[Romani people]] in the former lands of the [[Sudeten Germans]], who had been deported to [[East Germany]], [[West Germany]] and [[Austria]] according to the [[Potsdam Conference]] and [[Yalta Conference]].

The [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 was followed by a wave of emigration, unseen before and stopped shortly after (estimate: 70,000 immediately, 300,000 in total),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britskelisty.cz/9808/19980821h.html|title="Day when tanks destroyed Czech dreams of Prague Spring" (''Den, kdy tanky zlikvidovaly české sny Pražského jara'') at Britské Listy (British Letters)|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> typically of highly qualified people.

Tens of thousands of Czechs had repatriated from [[Volhynia]] and [[Banat]] after World War II. Since the 1990s, the Czech Republic has been working to repatriate [[Romania]] and [[Kazakhstan]]'s ethnic Czechs.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/61781 The Czech ethnic minority in Romania], 29-12-2004 - Radio Prague</ref><ref>[http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2007/10/31/home-stretch.php Government completes 13-year program to integrate Kazakh Czechs], The Prague Post, 31 October 2007</ref>

Following the Czech Republic's entry into the European Union in May 2004, Czechs gradually gained the right to work in EU countries without a work permit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penize.cz/zamestnani/18661-prace-v-evropske-unii-jake-mame-moznosti|title=Práce v Evropské unii: jaké máme možnosti? penize.cz|date=23 February 2007|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>

==Genetics==
The population of the Czech lands has been influenced by different human migrations that wide-crossed Europe over time. In their [[Y-DNA haplogroup]]s, which are inherited along the male line, Czechs have shown a mix of Eastern and Western European traits. 34.2% of Czech males belong to [[Haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA)|R1a]], which is particularly common in a large region extending from [[South Asia]] and Southern [[Siberia]] to [[Central Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]]. Within the Czech Republic, the proportion of R1a seems to gradually increase from west to east <ref>F. Luca, F. Di Giacomo, T. Benincasa et al., "Y-Chromosomal Variation in the Czech Republic," American Journal of Physical Anthropology 132:132–139 (2007).</ref> According to a 2000 study, 35.6% of Czech males have [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|haplogroup R1b]], which is very common in Western Europe among Germanic and Celtic nations, but rare among Slavic nations.<ref>O. Semino et al, The genetic legacy of paleolithic Homo sapiens sapiens in extant Europeans: a Y chromosome perspective, ''Science'', vol. 290 (2000), pp. 1155–59.</ref>

A high frequency of mutation of the G551D gene CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), causing [[cystic fibrosis]] is found in the Czech Republic, Austria, and among the Celtic nations:  Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, Ireland and Brittany.<ref>Doc.

===The arts===

====Music====
[[File:Michna Ceska maryanska muzyka.jpg|right|250px|The collection „Česká mariánská muzyka“|right|thumb|x190px|Title page of Czech Marian Music by Adam Václav Michna (1647)]]
[[Czech music]] started develop by first significant pieces, created in the 11th century.<ref>http://www.eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/music/history/history-of-czech-music-2374 History of Czech music</ref> The great progress of Czech artificial music has begun in the end of [[Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque era]], concretely in works of [[Adam Václav Michna z Otradovic]], where the specific character of Czech music was rising up by using the influence of genuine [[traditional music|folk music]]. This tradition determined the development of Czech music and has remained the main sign in the works of great Czech composers of almost all eras – [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]] and [[Bohuslav Matěj Černohorský]] in [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]], [[Bedřich Smetana]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]] in [[Romanticism (music)|Romanticism]], [[Leoš Janáček]] and [[Bohuslav Martinů]] in [[modern classical]] or [[Miloslav Kabeláč]] in [[contemporary classical music]].

Czech musicians played also important role in the development of European music. [[Johann Stamitz|Jan Václav Antonín Stamic]] in 18th-century contributed to the creation of [[Classicism]] in music<ref>http://www.czechmusic.net/klasika/stamic_jv.htm Jan Václav Antonín Stamic (in Czech)</ref> by innovations of compositional forms and founding of [[Mannheim school]], similarly [[Anton Reicha|Antonín Rejcha]]'s experiments prefigured new compositional techniques in the 19th century.<ref>http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/reicha.php Antonín Rejcha</ref> The influence of Czech musicians has been gone later beyond the borders of [[Europe]]an continent, when [[Antonín Dvořák]] brought into life new [[United States|America]]n classical music style, using the potential of the richness of ethnic music of that country during his mission in the [[US]]. The contribution of [[Alois Hába]] to [[microtonal music]] in the 20th century must be also mentioned.

Czech music reached as far as [[Qing China]]. [[Karel Slavíček]] was a [[Jesuit]] missionary, scientist and [[sinologist]] who was introduced to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] on February 3, 1717, in [[Beijing]]. The emperor favored him and employed him as court musician. (Slavíček was a [[Spinet]] player).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinsky.cz/index.php?page=clanek&id=480&lang=cs|title=Český jezuita na čínském dvoře|date=2009-02-26|accessdate=2011-02-06|work=cinsky.cz}}</ref>

Some notable Czech musicians who came down in modern history are US-based composer and guitarist [[Ivan Král]] or rock band [[The Plastic People of the Universe]] which played an important part in the [[Prague underground (culture)|underground]] movement during the communist regime.
