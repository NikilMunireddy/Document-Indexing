'''Covent Garden''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|v|ə|n|t}}) is a district in London on the eastern fringes of the [[West End of London|West End]], between [[St. Martin's Lane]] and [[Drury Lane]].<ref name=Hibbert/> It is associated with the former fruit and vegetable market in the central square, now a popular shopping and tourist site, and the [[Royal Opera House]], which is also known as "Covent Garden". The district is divided by the main thoroughfare of [[Long Acre]], north of which is given over to independent shops centred on [[Neal's Yard]] and [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]], while the south contains the central square with its street performers and most of the elegant buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], and the [[London Transport Museum]].

Though mainly fields until the 16th century, the area was briefly settled when it became the heart of the Anglo-Saxon trading town of [[Lundenwic]].<ref name=Lund/> After the town was abandoned, part of the area was walled off by 1200 for use as [[arable land]] and orchards by [[Westminster Abbey]], and was referred to as "the garden of the Abbey and Convent". The land, now called "the Covent Garden", was seized by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and granted to the [[Earl of Bedford|Earls of Bedford]] in 1552. The [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|4th Earl]] commissioned [[Inigo Jones]] to build some fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Jones designed the [[Italianate]] arcaded square along with the church of [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]]. The design of the square was new to London, and had a significant influence on modern town planning, acting as the prototype for the laying-out of new estates as London grew.<ref name=INF/> 

A small open-air fruit and vegetable market had developed on the south side of the fashionable square by 1654. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as [[taverns]], [[theatres]], coffee-houses and [[brothels]] opened up; the gentry moved away, and rakes, wits and [[playwrights]] moved in.<ref name=SocialHistory/> By the 18th century it had become a well-known [[red-light district]], attracting notable prostitutes. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and [[Charles Fowler]]'s neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The area declined as a pleasure-ground as the market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. 

By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the [[New Covent Garden Market]] about three miles (5&nbsp;km) south-west at [[Nine Elms]]. The central building reopened as a shopping centre in 1980, and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.

Covent Garden, with the postcode [[WC postcode area|WC2]], falls within the London boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], and the parliamentary constituencies of [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]] and [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras]]. The area has been served by the [[Piccadilly line]] at [[Covent Garden tube station]] since 1907; the journey from Leicester Square, at 300 yards, is the shortest in London.

The route of [[Strand, London|the Strand]] on the southern boundary of what was to become Covent Garden was used during the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]] as part of a route to [[Silchester]], known as "Iter VII" on the [[Antonine Itinerary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/antonine-itinerary.htm |title=The Antonine Itinerary |publisher=Roman Britain Organisation |accessdate=2 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22101 |title=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 1 | author=J.S Cockburn |editor=H.P.F.

Around 1200 the first mention of an abbey garden appears in a document mentioning a walled garden owned by the [[Benedictine monk]]s of the Abbey of [[St. Peter, Westminster]].

After the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1540, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] took for himself the land belonging to Westminster Abbey, including the convent garden and seven acres to the north called Long Acre; and in 1552 his son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], granted it to [[John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford]].<ref name=Burford1/> The Russell family, who in 1694 were advanced in their [[peerage]] from Earl to [[Duke of Bedford]], held the land from 1552 to 1918.<ref name=guide>{{cite book |author=Alzina Stone Dale, Barbara Sloan-Hendershott  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kyXfTbVxYOQC&pg=PA56|title=Mystery Reader's Walking Guide: London| page= 56 |publisher=iUniverse |year=2004 |isbn=0-595-31513-5 }}</ref>

The commission had been prompted by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] taking offence at the condition of the road and houses along Long Acre, which were the responsibility of Russell and [[Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth]]. Russell and Carey complained that under the 1625 Proclamation concerning Buildings, which restricted building in and around London, they could not build new houses; the King then granted Russell, for a fee of £2,000, a licence to build as many new houses on his land as he "shall thinke fitt and convenient".<ref name=Estate>{{cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46085 |title=Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden|pages=25–34|author=F.

The Covent Garden Estate was part of [[Beecham's Pills|Beecham Estates and Pills Limited]] from 1924 to 1928, after which time it was managed by a successor company called Covent Garden Properties Company Limited, owned by the Beechams and other private investors. This new company sold some properties at Covent Garden, while becoming active in property investment in other parts of London. In 1962 the bulk of the remaining properties in the Covent Garden area, including the market, were sold to the newly established government-owned Covent Garden Authority for £3,925,000.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46089 |title=Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden|pages=48–52|author=F.

By the end of the 1960s, traffic congestion had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming unsustainable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980. An action plan was drawn up by Westminster Council in 2004 in consultation with residents and businesses to improve the area while retaining its historic character.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/environment/planning/majorprojects/thewestend/covent/ |title=Covent Garden Action Plan  |accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> The market buildings, along with several other properties in Covent Garden, were bought by a property company in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coventgardenlondonuk.com/about |title=About Us |publisher=Covent Garden London Official Guide |accessdate=28 July 2010 }}</ref>

The Royal Opera House, often referred to as simply "Covent Garden", was constructed as the "Theatre Royal" in 1732 to a design by [[Edward Shepherd]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2d12iZkgOwC&pg=PA407 |title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia| page= 407 |publisher=Merriam-Webster|year= 2000| isbn=0-87779-017-5 }}</ref> During the first hundred years or so of its history, the theatre was primarily a playhouse, with the Letters Patent granted by Charles II giving Covent Garden and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. In 1734, the first ballet was presented; a year later [[Handel]]'s first season of operas began. Many of his operas and [[oratorio]]s were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premières here.<ref>{{cite book |author=Winton Dean  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekWgum0Vr0QC&pg=PA274 |title=Handel's operas, 1726–1741| pages= 274–285 |publisher=Boydell Press|year= 2006|isbn=1-84383-268-2}}</ref> It has been the home of [[Royal Opera, London|The Royal Opera]] since 1945, and the [[Royal Ballet, London|Royal Ballet]] since 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/CollectionPersDeValois.aspx |title=Ninette de Valois Bequest and Papers |publisher=Royal Opera House Collections Online |accessdate=27 July 2010 }}</ref>

The current building is the third theatre on the site following destructive fires in 1808 and 1857. The façade, foyer and auditorium were designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry|Edward Barry]], and date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive £178 million reconstruction in the 1990s.<ref name=roh/> The Royal Opera House seats 2,268 people and consists of four tiers of boxes and balconies and the amphitheatre gallery.

The central square in Covent Garden is simply called "Covent Garden", often marketed as "Covent Garden Piazza" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London, and was originally a flat, open space or [[piazza]] with low railings.<ref name=4th>{{cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.aspx?pubid=362 |title=Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden |author=F.

By the end of the 1960s, traffic congestion was causing problems for the market, which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution. Redevelopment was considered, but protests from the Covent Garden Community Association in 1973 prompted the Home Secretary, [[Robert Carr]], to give dozens of buildings around the square listed-building status, preventing redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/Themes/1337/1120/ |title=Covent Garden |publisher=Museum of London |accessdate=2 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080516013026/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/Themes/1337/1120/ |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}</ref> The following year the market relocated to its new site, [[New Covent Garden Market]], about three miles (5&nbsp;km) south-west at [[Nine Elms]].

This building lasted nearly 120 years, under leadership including [[Colley Cibber]], [[David Garrick]], and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]. In 1791, under Sheridan's management, the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794; but that survived only 15 years, burning down in 1809.

===London Transport Museum===
{{Main|London Transport Museum}}
The London Transport Museum is in a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] iron and glass building on the east side of the market square. It was designed as a dedicated flower market by William Rogers of [[Holland, Hannen & Cubitts|William Cubitt and Company]] in 1871,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46106 |title=Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden|pages=129–150|author=F.

Previously the transport collection had been held at [[Syon Park]] and [[Clapham]]. The first parts of the collection were brought together at the beginning of the 20th century by the [[London General Omnibus Company]] (LGOC) when it began to preserve buses being retired from service. 

After the LGOC was taken over by the [[London Electric Railway]] (LER), the collection was expanded to include rail vehicles. It continued to expand after the LER became part of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] in the 1930s and as the organisation passed through various successor bodies up to [[TfL]], London's transport authority since 2000.<ref name=ltmbh>{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/about-us/a-brief-history|title=About Us|publisher=London Transport Museum|accessdate=2 May 2011}}</ref> 

The Covent Garden building has on display many examples of buses, trams, [[trolleybus]]es and rail vehicles from 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing transport network has had on the city and its population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/28.aspx |title=Collections |publisher=London Transport Museum |accessdate=26 July 2010 }}</ref>

Covent Garden, and especially the market, have appeared in a number of works. [[Eliza Doolittle]], the central character in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play, ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', and the musical adaptation by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', is a Covent Garden flower seller.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkrt0rHAQl8C&pg=PA43 |author=David S.

==Transport==
Covent Garden is served by the [[Piccadilly line]] at [[Covent Garden tube station]] on the corner of Long Acre and James Street. The station was opened by [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway]] on 11 April 1907, four months after services on the rest of the line began operating on 15 December 1906.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/modesoftransport/tube/linefacts/?line=piccadilly |title=Piccadilly line facts |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413000909/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/modesoftransport/tube/linefacts/?line=piccadilly |archivedate=13 April 2008 }}</ref> Platform access is only by lift or stairs; until improvements to the exit gates in 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.coventgarden.uk.com/getting/Covent-Garden-by-underground.html |title=Covent Garden London : Getting to Covent Garden by underground|publisher=Covent Garden London |accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> due to high passenger numbers (16 million annually), London Underground had to advise travellers to get off at Leicester Square and walk the short distance (the tube journey at less than 300 yards is London's shortest) to avoid the congestion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.timeout.com/london/big-smoke/features/2816/London-s_shortest_tube_journey.html |title=London's shortest tube journey |author=Time Out editors|publisher=Time Out London|date=17 April 2007|accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> 

Stations just outside the area include [[Charing Cross tube station]] and [[Charing Cross railway station]], [[Leicester Square tube station]], and [[Holborn tube station]]. While there is only one bus route in Covent Garden itself—the [[London Buses route RV1|RV1]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossriverpartnership.org/page.asp?id=1235 |title=Riverside bus |publisher=Cross River Partnership |accessdate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720001415/http://www.crossriverpartnership.org/page.asp?id=1235 |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> which uses Catherine Street as a terminus, just to the east of Covent Garden square—there are over thirty routes which pass close by, mostly on the Strand or [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coventgarden.uk.com/getting/Covent-Garden-by-bus.html |title=Getting to Covent Garden by bus |publisher=Covent Garden London |accessdate=26 July 2010 }}</ref>
