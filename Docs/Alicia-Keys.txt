He was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company.

Keys signed a demo deal with [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[So So Def Recordings]], where she appeared on the label's Christmas album performing "The Little Drummer Girl". She also co-wrote and recorded a song titled "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]''.<ref name="Jet"/> The song was Keys' first professional recording; however, it was never released as a single and her record contract with Columbia ended after a dispute with the label. Keys was unhappy with the label because her career had stalled during her two years under contract at Columbia due to executive indecision over her direction and major changes within the company.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Keys called [[Clive Davis]], who sensed a "special, unique" artist from her performance and signed her to [[Arista Records]], which later disbanded.<ref name="Allmusic"/><ref name="The Guardian Interview"/> Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had.
