==History==
The club was founded on 4 October 1930, with Stavros Pittas voted in as the club's first president.<ref name="AEL">{{cite web|url=http://www.aelfc.com/history.php|script-title=el:Ιστορία Συλλόγου|publisher=AEL Limassol |language=Greek}}</ref> The football section of the club competed in its first game on 6 January 1931 against PSC, winning 6–1 in Limassol.<ref name="AEL"/> The club won its national championship in 1934 though this is not credited as it is an unofficial title.<ref name="RSSSF">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/cyphist.html|title=Cyprus&nbsp;– List of Final Tables 1931–1998|publisher=RSSSF}}</ref> Later that year, AEL became one of the eight founding members of the [[Cypriot First Division]] for the [[1934–35 Cypriot First Division|1934–35]] season, the first official league of the country.<ref name="AEL"/><ref name="RSSSF"/>

Christodoulou had a dream-like first season at the helm AEL, as his side was unbeaten and had not conceded any goals through the first five games. At the end of the second round AEL finished top of the table,<ref>{{Cite web

AEL received the championship trophy during a spectacular "fiesta" evening at the Tsirion Stadium on the evening of Saturday 12 May 2012. They followed this with an open-top bus parade through Limassol. Up to 12,000 AEL fans packed the stadium to watch the fiesta and trophy presentation. The club then turned their attention to the [[2011-12 Cypriot Cup#Final|Cup Final]] of 16 May against [[Omonia Nicosia]]; and the chance to be crowned double winners for the first time in their history. However the club lost in the final 1–0 to a goal by Brazilian striker [[Andre Alves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.com.cy/Gr/news/10199|title=Κυπελλούχος η Ομόνοια |publisher=Κυπριακή Ομοσπονδία Ποδοσφαίρου |date=16 May 2012}}</ref> The following year, AEL made it to the group stage of a [[UEFA competitions|UEFA tournament]] for the first time, finishing last and picking up four points in their [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/club=52800/profile/history/index.html |title=AEL&nbsp;— History&nbsp;— UEFA.com |work=UEFA |accessdate=13 October 2014 }}</ref>

The team consisted of the following players: Antoniadis, Pareas, Frangos, Christophides, Michaelides, Kalogirou, Victor Mousteris, Anastasiadis and Williamson.

===Handball===
Another AEL sport department that currently does not exist is the handball.
The team was active for a small period of time but that did not stop the team from adding another trophy to the hundreds that AEL won in various other sports.
