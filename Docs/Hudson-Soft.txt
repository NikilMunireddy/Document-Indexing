[[File:Tokyo midtown tower cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Midtown Tower]], which included the Hudson Soft headquarters]]
'''Hudson Soft Co., Ltd''', commonly known by its brand name '''Hudson''', was a Japanese [[video game]] company that released numerous games for [[video game consoles]], [[home computers]] and [[mobile phone]]s, primarily from the 1980s to the 2000s. It was headquartered in the Midtown Tower in [[Tokyo Midtown]], [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]], [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], with an additional office in the Hudson Building in [[Sapporo]].<ref>"[http://www.hudson.co.jp/corp_eng/coinfo/outline.html Corporate overview]." Hudson Soft. Retrieved on July 12, 2010.</ref>

Hudson Soft was founded on May 18, 1973. Initially, it dealt with [[personal computer]] products, but later expanded to the development and publishing of [[video game]]s, [[mobile content]], video game peripherals and [[Record label|music recording]]. Mainly a [[video game publisher]], Hudson developed internally many of the video games it published as well as a few games published by other companies. Hudson is known for series such as ''[[Bomberman]]'', ''[[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]'', ''[[Bloody Roar]]'', and ''[[Bonk (video game series)|Bonk]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allgame.com/company.php?id=13375&tab=developed&sort=rating_desc|title=List of Hudson Soft Co.

==History==
Hudson Soft Ltd. was founded in [[Sapporo]], [[Japan]] on May 18, 1973 by brothers Yuji and Hiroshi Kudo. The founders grew up admiring [[train]]s, and named the business after their favorite, the Hudson locomotives (called the "[[4-6-4]]", and especially Japanese [[JNR Class C62|C62]]). Hudson began as a shop called '''CQ Hudson''' (CQハドソン), selling radio [[telecommunication]]s devices and [[art]] [[photograph]]s. In September 1975, Hudson Soft began selling [[personal computer]]-related products, and in March 1978 started developing and selling [[video game]] packages.<ref name="hudsonrg1">{{cite web |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/HudsonRG_Part1.pdf |title=Hudson Profile&nbsp;— Part 1 (RG)|last=McFerran |first=Damien|work=Issue 66 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Retro Gamer]] Magazine |pages=68–73|accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref>

Hudson became [[Nintendo]]'s first third-party software vendor for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] and its title for this console, ''[[Lode Runner]]'', sold 1.2 million units after its 1984 release.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.hudson.co.jp/corp/coinfo/history.html |year=2005 |title=Company history (archives) |publisher=Hudson Soft |accessdate=2012-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407151508/http://www.hudson.co.jp/corp/coinfo/history.html |archivedate=April 7, 2005 }}</ref>

The business continued developing video games on the Famicom and computer platforms ([[MSX]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[ZX Spectrum]], among others), and was reorganized as Hudson Soft Co., Ltd. in July 1985.<ref name="History"/> A caravan was held at sixty venues throughout Japan, a first for the [[video game industry]].<ref name="History"/> ''[[Bomberman (video game)|Bomberman]]'' was released in December of this year on the Famicom and was considered a "big hit" by Hudson Soft.<ref name="hudsonrg2">{{cite web |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/hudsonparttwo.pdf |title=Hudson Profile&nbsp;— Part 2 (RG)|last=McFerran |first=Damien|work=Issue 67 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Retro Gamer]] Magazine |pages=44–49|accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref>

Most importantly, Hudson held the Summer Caravan video gaming competitions where many top-level performers could compete for champion. From 1985 until 1992 (Later caravans were less popular, less periodic, and using less punishing games were more casual than the more competing games) the Caravan was a hallmark of Hudson's popularity. Many games were released with the Caravan competition in mind, with the Star Soldier series having 2 minute and 5 minute modes built into the cartridges as symbols of the competitive nature that they were inspired from. 

In July 1987, Hudson developed the "C62 System" and collaborated with [[NEC]] to develop the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] video game console. It achieved a second-best success to Famicom in Japan, but its release as the [[TurboGrafx-16]] in North America had less [[market share]] than Nintendo's new [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] or [[Sega]]'s new [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]]. Throughout 1990, Hudson Soft developed and published video games for an array of systems. In 1994, the 32-bit [[Integrated circuit|semiconductor chip]] "[[HuC62]]" was independently developed by Hudson and used in NEC's [[PC-FX]] video game console.

Hudson Soft's head office was transferred to Tokyo in 2005. The original Sapporo headquarters remained in operation as a secondary office.

Hudson Soft lost several key people starting in the mid-2000s. Co-founder Hiroshi Kudo left the company in November 2004 following financial losses.<ref name="2005 acquisition"/>  Shinichi Nakamoto, who was with the company since 1978 and creator of the ''[[Bomberman]]'' series, followed suit in 2006. Veteran [[Takahashi Meijin]] resigned in May 2011; he had joined Hudson Soft in 1982.<ref name="Takahashi Meijin">{{cite web|title=16-Shot Legend Takahashi Meijin Leaves Hudson|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/05/16_shot_legend_takahashi_meijin_leaves_hudson|accessdate=January 4, 2012|date=May 23, 2011|first=James|last=Newton}}</ref> Around 2010-2011, many employees migrated to [[Nintendo]]'s restructured [[Nd Cube]] studio which is headed by Hidetoshi Endo, himself a former Hudson Soft President.

===Relation with Konami===
The relation between Hudson Soft and Konami can be traced back at least as early as 1985, when Hudson ported Konami's arcade game ''[[Pooyan]]'' to the [[MSX]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]]. Moreover, Konami was a third party publisher for Hudson Soft's [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] in Japan. But the acquisition process of Hudson Soft by Konami would only begin in 2001.

Hudson Soft was severely hit by the collapse of its main bank [[Hokkaido Takushoku Bank|Hokkaido Takushoku]]. Seeking new financing alternatives, Hudson Soft entered the [[stock market]] for the first time in December 2000, listing on the [[Osaka Securities Exchange|NASDAQ Japan Exchange]]. This led to Konami  purchasing a stock allocation of 5.6 million shares in August 2001, becoming the company's largest shareholder. Within the terms of this purchase, Hudson acquired the Sapporo division of Konami Computer Entertainment Studio, renaming it Hudson Studio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hudson.co.jp/corp/investors/pdf/010726.pdf|title=株式会社コナミデジタルエンタテインメント|website=www.hudson.co.jp|access-date=2016-03-25}}</ref>

In April 2005, capital was increased via an allocation of 3 million shares from a third party. Konami Corporation, holding 53.99% of all Hudson stock, became Hudson's majority shareholder and parent company.<ref name="2005 acquisition">{{cite web|title=Konami Gets Hudson Soft As Subsidiary|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=5271#.UOadEnfhdIp|accessdate=January 4, 2012|date=April 11, 2005|first=Simon|last=Carless}}</ref> Hudson continued to self-publish in Japan, but working closely with Konami.

In January 2011, Hudson Soft became a wholly owned subsidiary of Konami.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-acquiring-hudson/1100-6286645/|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|website=GameSpot|access-date=2016-03-25}}</ref> On April 1, 2011, Konami liquidated Hudson Entertainment (the subsidiary of Hudson Soft in [[California]]).<ref name=":0" />

==Caravan Competition==
*1985 - ''[[Star Force]]'' for the Famicom became the first game featured for the summer competitions held within Japan.
*1986 - ''[[Star Soldier]]'' for the Famicom became the second competition game.
*1987 - ''[[Starship Hector]]'' (In Japan, simply ''Hector '87'') was the third and last Famicom game featured as the Hudson Caravan moved onto the newer PC Engine. The first three were reproduced in ''Hudson Caravan Collection'' for the Super Famicom and ''Hudson Best Collection'' for the Game Boy Advance
*1988 - ''Power League'' (''[[World Class Baseball]]'' in the USA) became the first PC Engine competition game, unusual for the competition being a sports game rather than a shooter.
*1989 - ''Gunhed'' (''[[Blazing Lazers]]'') for the PC Engine was the competition game. A small number of cartridges were produced for the competition under the name ''Gunhed Taikai (Special Edition)'' and are very rare and expensive for the most hardcore of collectors to find.
*1990 - ''[[Super Star Soldier]]'' for the PC Engine
*1991- ''[[Final Soldier]]'' for the PC Engine
*1992 - ''[[Soldier Blade]]'' for the PC Engine would be the last of the popular caravan competitions as later events were held using the more casual ''Bomberman'' and other games fittingly popular at the time. The PC Engine games from '90, '91, and '92 were re-released as the ''PC Engine Best Collection - Soldier Collection'' for the PSP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://magweasel.com/2010/07/06/caravan-summer-carnival/|title=Caravan / Summer Carnival @ Magweasel|access-date=2016-03-25}}</ref>

===Hudson Music Entertainment===
Hudson Soft's music recording label unit. Absorbed into Konami Music Entertainment on March 1, 2012.

==Video game releases==
{{Main|List of Hudson Soft games}}
Hudson Soft is responsible for series such as ''[[Bomberman]]'', ''[[Bonk (video game series)|Bonk]]'', and ''[[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]''.

Hudson also released long-running video game series in Japan. ''[[Far East of Eden]]'' was a classic RPG set in a fictional era with Japanese themes. The series was up to number 4 when Hudson was absorbed into Konami, and was considered a hit in Japan. The second version of the game was widely regarded as one of the best RPGs ever released, ranked 12th by ''[[Famitsu]]'' among all games released in Japan. Hudson Soft also created the long-running and critically acclaimed game ''[[Momotaro Dentetsu]]'', a board game with locomotive themes. The comical game had 16 installments released in Japan. Before its absorption, Hudson had re-released some of its first hit games for the [[GameCube]] in Japan, including ''Adventure Island'', ''Star Soldier'', and ''Lode Runner''.

Hudson had a long history of creating games for other publishers. The most notable of these were the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, created for Nintendo. They developed the first eight console installments and spin-offs; however, ''[[Mario Party 9]]'' and all games after that have been developed by Nintendo subsidiary [[Nd Cube]], which consists of many former Hudson employees. Hudson also developed ''[[Fuzion Frenzy 2]]'' for Microsoft, which was released for the [[Xbox 360]] in January 2007.

An even more peculiar example of Hudson developing a game for another publisher is ''[[Bomberman 64: The Second Attack]]''. Unlike the two previous game for the Nintendo 64, which were all published by Nintendo, this one was published by [[Vatical Entertainment]].
