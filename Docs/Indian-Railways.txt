'''Indian Railways ''' ([[reporting mark]] '''IR''') is an [[India]]n [[State-owned enterprise|state-owned]] enterprise, owned and operated by the [[Government of India]] through the [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Ministry of Railways]]. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising {{convert|115000|km|abbr=on}} of track over a route of {{convert|65808|km|abbr=on}} and 7,112 stations.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In 2014–2015 Indian Railways had revenues of {{INRConvert|1634.50|b}} which consists of {{INRConvert|1069.27|b}} from freight and {{INRConvert|402.80|b}} from passengers tickets.<ref name="Budget"/>

Railways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from [[Mumbai]] to [[Thane]]. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both [[Rail transport in India|long distance]] and [[Suburban rail in India|suburban rail systems]] on a [[Dual gauge|multi-gauge]] network of [[Indian gauge|broad]], [[Metre gauge|metre]] and [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow]] [[Rail gauge|gauges]]. It also owns [[locomotive]] and [[coach (rail)|coach]] production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover [[states and territories of India|twenty nine states and seven union territories]] and also provides limited international services to [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]].

Indian Railways is the world's [[List of companies by employees|seventh largest commercial or utility employer]], by number of employees, with over 1.376 million employees as of last published figures in 2013 . As for [[rolling stock]], IR holds over 245,267 [[Freight rail transport|Freight Wagons]], 66,392 [[Passenger car (rail)|Passenger Coaches]] and 10,499 [[Locomotive]]s (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives).<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/finance_budget/2014-15_Final/English%20-%20Railway%20Budget%20Speech%202014-15.pdf</ref> As of 31 March 2013, {{convert|21614|km|abbr=on}} (32.8%) of the total {{convert|65808|km|abbr=on}} route length was electrified.<ref name="indianrailways.gov.in">http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/stat_econ/IRSB_2012-13/PDF/Facts_Figures_Eng/19.pdf</ref> Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.

The history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometer of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,261|title=About Indian Railways-Evolution|publisher=Ministry of Railways website}}</ref> The East Indian Railway Company was established 1 June 1845 in London by a deed of settlement with a capital of £4,000,000, largely raised in London.<ref>[http://search.com.bd/banglapedia/HT/E_0007.htm Bangladepia]</ref> The Great Southern India Railway Co. was founded in Britain in 1853 and registered in 1859. Construction of track in [[Madras Presidency]] began in 1859 and the 80-mile link from [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichinopoly]] to [[Nagapattinam|Negapatam]] was opened in 1861. The Carnatic Railway founded in 1864, opened a [[Madras]]-[[Arakkonam]]-[[Kancheepuram|Conjeevaram]] line in 1865. The Great Southern India Railway Company was subsequently merged with the Carnatic Railway Company in 1874 to form the [[South Indian Railway Company]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/always-the-second-station/article3195520.ece|title=Always the second station|publisher=The Hindu|date=3 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|work=Herepath's Railway and Commercial Journal|page=3|title=Indian Tramway Limited|date=January 1, 1870|volume=32|issue=1595}}</ref>

A British engineer, [[Robert Maitland Brereton]], was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the [[East Indian Railway]] had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of {{convert|6400|km|abbr=on}}. Hence it became possible to travel directly from [[Bombay]] to [[Calcutta]]. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer [[Jules Verne]]'s book [[Around the World in Eighty Days]]. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that ''"it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system".''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irse.bravehost.com/IRHTML.htm |title=R.P. Saxena, Indian Railway History Timeline |publisher=Irse.bravehost.com  |accessdate=2012-12-15}}</ref>

By 1875, about £95 million were invested by British companies in India.<ref name="Rungta1970">{{cite book|author=Shyam Rungta|title=The Rise of Business Corporations in India, 1851–1900|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aMIkcVsGi_gC&pg=PA17&dq=india+railway+1900#PPA54,M1|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|isbn=978-0-521-07354-7|page=17|quote=British investment in Indian railway reaches £100m by 1875}}</ref> By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about {{convert|14500|km|abbr=on}}, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of [[Bombay]], [[Madras]] and [[Calcutta]]. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the [[Uganda Railway]]s.

In 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of [[Assam]], Rajputhana and [[Madras Presidency]] and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under [[Lord Curzon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/~mrinal/history_ir.html |title=History of Indian Railways |publisher=Irfca.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-15}}</ref> It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.

In 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of [[World War I]], the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested  in the development of [[British colonial India]].<ref name=corruption>{{cite book|last1=Sweenety|first1=Stuart|title=Financing India's Imperial Railways, 1875–1914|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1317323777|pages=186–188|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>
[[File:Fastest train of India.jpg|thumb|229x229px|Interior of Gatiman Express.]]
In 1920, with the network having expanded to {{convert|61220|km|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.login-irctc.co.in/2015/01/top-10-amazing-indian-railway-facts-one.html |title=Top Indian Railway Facts |publisher=Indian Railway}}</ref> a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.

The period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were {{convert|41000|mi|abbr=on}} of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year.<ref name="Mil_Engr_India II">{{cite book |title=The Military Engineer in India, Vol II |last=Sandes |first=Lt Col E.W.C. |authorlink= |year=1935 |publisher=The Institution of Royal Engineers |location=Chatham |isbn= |page= |url= |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> Following the [[Great Depression]], the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The [[Second World War]] severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.

Each zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.

[[Locomotive]]s in [[India]] consist of [[Electric locomotive|electric]] and [[diesel locomotive]]s.  The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used.<ref>{{cite news|first1=India's first CNG train flagged off|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/report/pix-indias-first-cng-train-flagged-off/20150115.htm}}</ref> [[Steam locomotive]]s are no longer used, except in [[restored train|heritage trains]]. In [[India]], [[locomotive]]s are classified according to their [[track gauge]], motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power, Diesel or Alternating current (Electric), and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for '''newer diesel''' locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their [[horsepower]] range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.

A locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100&nbsp;hp increments: 'A' for 100&nbsp;hp, 'B' for 200&nbsp;hp, 'C' for 300&nbsp;hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100&nbsp;hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400&nbsp;hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600&nbsp;hp loco.

''Note: This classification system does '''not''' apply to [[steam locomotives]] in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or [[Indian locomotive class WP|WP class]].''

Diesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Technology allows Railways to save Rs 20 Lakhs Diesel per Engine|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/new-technology-allows-railways-to-save-rs-20-lakhs-diesel-per-engine/|accessdate=6 September 2013}}</ref>

===Goods wagons===
The number of [[goods wagon]]s was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950–51 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012–13.<ref>[http://in.news.yahoo.com/indian-railways-joins-1-billion-tonne-club-freight-051556968.html Indian Railways joins 1 billion tonne club in freight loading - Yahoo! News India]. In.news.yahoo.com (2013-04-02). Retrieved on 2013-07-16.</ref>

However, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.

===Passenger coaches===

Indian railways has several types of passenger coaches.

The coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at [[Integral Coach Factory]], [[Rail Coach Factory]]; including the new [[Linke-Hofmann|LHB]] coaches.

Passenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.

Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities – mainly [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]], [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], [[Pune]], [[Hyderabad]] and [[Bangalore]]. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.

===Freight===
Indian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (₹686.2 billion from freight and ₹304.6 billion from passengers in 2011–12). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.

Since the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains

==Track and gauge==
Indian railways uses four gauges, the {{RailGauge|1676mm}} [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] which is wider than the {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}}; the {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}}; and two [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauges]], {{RailGauge|762mm|lk=on}} and {{RailGauge|610mm|lk=on}}. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from {{convert|75|to|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

The total length of track used by Indian Railways is about {{convert|115000|km|abbr=on}} while the total route length of the network is {{convert|65000|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Yearbook2011">{{cite book |title=India Yearbook 2011 |publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Govt. of India |isbn=978-81-230-1674-0 |author=Compiled and edited by Research, Reference and Training Division. |year=2011 |at=Table 19.1 }}</ref> About {{convert|24891|km|abbr=on}} or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.<ref name="ehitavada1">{{cite news|url=http://ehitavada.com/News_Paper_Images/2013/04/07/news_images/news_213499.jpg |title=Electriﬁcation work of Itarsi-Jabalpur—Manikpur also taken at CORE conference |work=ehitavada.com |date=2013-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131029200016/http://ehitavada.com/News_Paper_Images/2013/04/07/news_images/news_213499.jpg |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}</ref>

[[File:Narrow Gauge Train at Rajim.JPG|thumb|lefy|Narrow Gauge Train at Rajim, Chhattisgarh]]
[[Indian gauge|Broad gauge]] is the predominant [[track gauge|gauge]] used by Indian Railways. [[Indian gauge|Indian broad gauge]]—{{RailGauge|1676mm}}—is the most widely used gauge in India with {{convert|108500|km|abbr=on}} of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and {{convert|59400|km|abbr=on}} of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).

In some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge ({{RailGauge|1000mm}}) is common, although the [[Unigauge project]] is in progress to [[Gauge conversion|convert]] all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about {{convert|5000|km|abbr=on}} of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and {{convert|4100|km|abbr=on}} of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).

The Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The [[Kalka-Shimla Railway]], the [[Kangra Valley Railway]] and the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway]] are three notable [[Mountain railway|hill lines]] that use narrow gauge, but the [[Nilgiri Mountain Railway]] is a metre gauge track.<ref>{{cite web

These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.

[[File:Indian Railways Network Connectivity Map with cities and population density.png|thumb|Map of Indian Railways network with population density]]

The share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.

[[Railroad tie|Sleepers]] (ties) are made up of [[prestressed concrete]], or steel or cast iron posts, though [[teak]] sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in [[Rajasthan]].

===Research and development===
Indian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.

In August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches.  This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.<ref>[http://www.eco-business.com/news/railways-iit-madras-tie-power-ac-coaches-solar-energy/ Railways, IIT-Madras tie up to power AC coaches with solar energy | News | Eco-Business - Asia's Cleantech & Sustainable Business Community]. Eco-Business (2013-08-05). Retrieved on 2013-08-17.</ref>

Recently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains.  It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indian Railways develops Automatic Fire and Smoke Detection System|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/indian-railways-develops-automatic-fire-and-smoke-detection-system/|accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>

===Bio-Toilets on railways===
In 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and  break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat: Indian Railways aims to equip coaches with bio-toilets by 2021|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/indian-railways-aims-to-equip-coaches-with-bio-toilets-by-2021/|work=Indian Express |date=29 March 2015|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref> As part of its "Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat" ("Clean Rail-Clean India") programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.

===Locomotive factories===
In 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with [[General Electric]], which has invested {{INRConvert|2052|c|0}} for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with [[Alstom]], which has invested {{INRConvert|1293.57|c|0}}. The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each.<ref>{{cite web|title=Locomotive Factories in Bihar: In cold storage for years, two Railway projects to start soon|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/locomotive-factories-in-bihar-in-cold-storage-for-years-two-railway-projects-to-start-soon/|work=Indian Express |date=30 October 2015|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref> In November 2015, further details of the {{INRConvert|14656|c|0}} partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the [[GE Evolution series]].<ref>{{cite web|title=GE Gets $2.6 Billion Indian Railways Contract|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-help-modernize-indias-rail-system-1447080903|work=Wall Street Journal |date=9 November 2015|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rail ministry awards Rs 14,656-cr Marhowra locomotive project to GE|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/rail-ministry-awards-rs-14-656-cr-marhowra-locomotive-project-to-ge-115110900795_1.html|work=Business Standard |date=9 November 2015|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> In the same month, a {{INRConvert|20000|c|0}} partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.<ref name="Economic Times"/>

==Accommodation classes==
[[File:CC class seats in Mysore Shatabdi.JPG|thumb|right|Air-conditioned Chair Car (CC) coaches in an [[Shatabdi Express]].]]
{{Main|Indian Railways coaching stock}}
Indian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a [[pantry car]] is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.

A standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called "general") compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.

The following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.

==Problems and issues==
Indian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of {{Indian Rupee|link=Indian rupee}}30,000 [[crore]] (US$5bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. [[Operating ratio]], a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15.  Railways carry a social obligation of over {{Indian Rupee}}20,000 crore ($3.5bn).  The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 [[paise]] by the end of March 2014.  Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just {{Indian Rupee}}690 crore ($115mn) by the end of March 2014.<ref>http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/finance_budget/2014-15_Final/Budget%20Speech%202014-15%20Highlights%20_English_PDF.pdf</ref>

It was s estimated in 2014 that over {{Indian Rupees}}5 lakh crore ($85bn) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.<ref>http://www.livemint.com/r/LiveMint/Period1/2014/07/08/Photos/w_Rail_Budget_Precursor_grfx.jpg</ref>

New railway line projects are often announced during the [[Railway Budget]] annually without securing additional funding for them. Between 2004 and 2014, 99 New Line projects worth {{Indian Rupees}}60,000 crore ($10bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[Sanjay Dina Patil]], MP for [[Mumbai North East (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mumbai North East]], said in 2014 that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in prices of tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.<ref name=ncp>{{cite news|last=Kalwar|first=Pooja|title=NCP workers stage protest against Rail Budget in Mumbai|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/ncp-workers-stage-protest-against-rail-budget-in-mumbai/15436180|accessdate=4 August 2014|newspaper=[[Mid Day]]|date=9 July 2014}}</ref>
