'''Ayrshire''' ({{lang-gd|Siorrachd Inbhir Àir}}, {{IPA-gd|ʃirˠəxk iɲiˈɾʲaːɾʲ}}) is a historic [[county]] in south-west [[Scotland]], located on the shores of the [[Firth of Clyde]]. 
It is also, under the name the '''County of Ayr''', a registration county. Its principal towns include [[Ayr]], [[Kilmarnock]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]]. Like the other counties of Scotland, it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of [[North Ayrshire]], [[South Ayrshire]] and [[East Ayrshire]]. It has a population of approximately 366,800.

The electoral and valuation area named Ayrshire covers the three council areas of [[South Ayrshire]], [[East Ayrshire]] and [[North Ayrshire]], therefore including the [[Isle of Arran]], [[Great Cumbrae]] and [[Little Cumbrae]]. The three islands were part of the [[County of Bute]] until 1975 and are not always included when the term ''Ayrshire'' is applied to the region. The same area is known as ''[[Ayrshire and Arran]]'' in other contexts.

==Geography==
Ayrshire is one of the most agriculturally fertile regions of Scotland. Potatoes are grown in fields near the coast, using seaweed-based fertiliser, and in addition the region produces pork products, other root vegetables, and cattle (see below);{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and summer berries such as strawberries are grown abundantly.

Ayrshire shares with [[Dumfries and Galloway]] some rugged hill country known as the [[Galloway Hills]]. These hill lie to the west of the A713 (Ayr to [[Castle Douglas]] road) and they run south from the [[Loch Doon]] area almost to the [[Solway Firth]]. To the east of this route through the hills lie the [[Carsphairn and Scaur Hills]] which lie to the south east of Dalmellington and south of [[New Cumnock]]. Glen Afton runs deep into these hills.

[[Glasgow Prestwick International Airport]], serving [[Glasgow]], is located in Ayrshire. It has a niche in [[Rock music|rock]] history as the only place in Britain visited by [[Elvis|Elvis Presley]], on his way home from Army service in Germany in 1960.

==History==
The area that today forms Ayrshire was part of the area south of the [[Antonine Wall]] which was briefly occupied by the Romans during the reign of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] (see: [[Roman Britain#Occupation and retreat from southern Scotland]]). It was inhabited by the [[Damnonii]], who are presumed to have been [[Celtic Britons|Britons]]. Later, it formed part of the British [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] during the 11th century. In 1263, the Scots successfully drove off of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[leidang]]-army in a skirmish known as the [[Battle of Largs]].

A notable historic building in Ayrshire is [[Turnberry Castle]], which dates from the 13th century or earlier, and which may have been the birthplace of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]].

The historic [[shire]] or [[sheriffdom]] of Ayr was divided into three districts or ''bailieries'' which later made up the [[Counties of Scotland|county]] of Ayrshire. The three districts were:
*[[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] in the south. It was situated between the Doon and the wild district of Galloway in the adjoining Stewartries, an area that was little else than a vast tract of hills and mosses.<ref name=Douglas-2>{{cite book|last=Douglas |first=William Scott |year=1874 |title=In Ayrshire; a descriptive picture of the County of Ayr, with relative notes on interesting local subjects, chiefly derived during a recent personal tour |publisher=Kilmarnock M'Kie & Drennan |page=[https://archive.org/stream/inayrshiredespart100douguoft#page/2/mode/2up 2]}}</ref>
*[[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]] in the centre, which included the [[royal burgh]] of Ayr, occupied the central district between the Irwine on the north, and the Doon on the south and south-west, an area that is partly mountainous. It was subdivided into "Kyle Stewart",<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ayrshire |volume=3 |pages=74-76}}</ref> (sometimes called "Stewart Kyle"<ref name=Douglas-2/> or "Walter's Kyle"<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=David |year=1924 |title=Early burgh organization in Scotland: as illustrated in the history of Glasgow and of some neighbouring burghs |volume=2 |publisher=Maclehose, Jackson & Co.}}</ref>) and "King's Kyle," the former embracing the country between the Irvine and the Ayr; and the latter, the triangular portion between the Ayr and the Doon, which is honoured as the birthplace and youthful home of [[Robert Burns]].<ref name=Douglas-2/>
*[[Cunninghame]] in the north which included the royal burgh of Irvine was that part of the county which lay north of the Irvine water, and was in an area that is generally level and fertile.<ref name=Douglas-2/>

The area used to be heavily industrialised, with [[steel making]], [[coal mining]] and in Kilmarnock numerous examples of [[production-line]] manufacturing, most famously [[Johnnie Walker]] whisky. In more recent history, [[Digital Equipment]] had a large manufacturing plant near Ayr from about 1976 until the company was taken over by [[Compaq]] in 1998.  Some supplier companies grew up to service this site and the more distant [[IBM]] plant at [[Greenock]] in [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]].  Scotland's aviation industry has long been based in and around [[Prestwick]] and its [[Prestwick Airport|international airport]], and although aircraft manufacture ceased at the former [[British Aerospace]] plant in 1998, a significant number of aviation companies are still based on the Prestwick site. However, unemployment in the region (excluding the more rural South Ayrshire) is above the national average.

===Local Government===
[[File:MapOfAyrshire.png|thumb|right|250px|Administrative subdivisions covering Ayrshire]]
{{See also|Local government of Scotland}}
The [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]] established a uniform system of [[county council]]s in Scotland and realigned the boundaries of many of Scotland's counties. Subsequently, Ayr [[county council]] was created in 1890. In 1930 the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929]] was implemented. This re-designated the [[Burghs]] into [[large burghs]] and [[small burghs]]. This new categorisation influenced the level of autonomy that the Burghs enjoyed from the county council. The act also abolished the [[parish]] as a unit of local government in Scotland. In Ayrshire in excess of 30 parishes were consolidated into ten [[List of local government areas in Scotland 1930–75|district council]]s. The District Councils were Ayr, Cumnock, Dalmellington, Girvan, Irvine, Kilbirnie, Kilmarnock, Maybole, Newmilns and Saltcoats.

In May 1975 the county council was abolished and its functions transferred to [[Strathclyde Regional Council]]. The county area was divided between four new districts within the two-tier [[Strathclyde]] [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|region]]: [[Cumnock and Doon Valley]], [[Cunninghame]], [[Kilmarnock and Loudoun (district)|Kilmarnock and Loudoun]] and [[Kyle and Carrick]]. The Cunninghame district included the [[Isle of Arran]], [[Great Cumbrae]] and [[Little Cumbrae]], which had until then been administered as part of the [[County of Bute]].

In 1996 the two-tier system of [[regions and districts (Scotland)|regions and districts]] was abolished and Ayrshire was divided between the [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council areas]] of [[East Ayrshire]] (covering the area of the former Kilmarnock & Loudon District and Cumnock & Doon Valley District), [[North Ayrshire]] (covering the area of the former Cunninghame District Council) and [[South Ayrshire]] (covering the area of the former Kyle and Carrick District).

== Parliamentary constituencies ==
There was an [[Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayrshire constituency]] of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] from 1708 to 1801 and of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 until 1868, when the constituency was divided into [[Ayrshire North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayrshire North]] and  [[Ayrshire South (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayrshire South]].

During the whole of the 1708 to 1868 period, and until 1950, the [[burgh]]s of Ayr and Irvine were [[parliamentary burgh]]s, represented as components of [[Ayr Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayr Burghs]]. In 1832 [[Kilmarnock]] became a parliamentary burgh, to be represented as a component of [[Kilmarnock Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Kilmarnock Burghs]] until 1918. Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs were [[districts of burghs (UK Parliament)|districts of burghs]], and quite different in character from later Ayr and Kilmarnock constituencies.

From 1918 to 1983 Ayrshire and [[Buteshire]] were treated as if a single area for purposes of parliamentary representation, with their combined area being divided into different constituencies at different times. Scottish local government counties were abolished in 1975, in favour of [[Regions and districts of Scotland|regions and districts]], but the next reform of constituency boundaries was not until 1983.

Constituencies covering Ayrshire may be listed by periods as below, but the story is somewhat more complicated than the lists may imply: until 1918, Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs included burghs lying outside both Ayrshire and Buteshire; a particular constituency name may represent different boundaries in different periods; in 1974, there were boundary changes without the creation of any new constituency names.
