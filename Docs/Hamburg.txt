Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the [[Hamburg Metropolitan Region]] (including parts of the neighbouring [[States of Germany|Federal States]] of [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) has more than 5 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river [[Elbe]].

The official name reflects [[History of Hamburg|its history]] as a member of the medieval [[Hanseatic League]], as a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a [[city-state]], and one of the 16 states of Germany. Before the 1871 [[Unification of Germany]], it was a fully [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state. Prior to the constitutional changes in 1919, the stringent civic republic was ruled by a class of hereditary [[grand burgher]]s or [[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseaten]].

Hamburg is a [[transport hub]], being the 2nd largest port in Europe, and is an [[Affluency|affluent]] city in Europe. It has become a media and industrial centre, with plants and facilities belonging to ''[[Airbus]]'', ''[[Blohm + Voss]]'' and ''[[Aurubis]]''. The radio and television broadcaster ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]'' and publishers such as ''[[Gruner + Jahr]]'' and ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]-Verlag'' are pillars of the important media industry in Hamburg. Hamburg has been an important financial centre for centuries, and is the seat of the [[List of oldest banks in continuous operation|world's second oldest bank]], [[Berenberg Bank]].

The city is a notable tourist destination for both domestic and overseas visitors; it [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey|ranked 16th]] in the world for [[livability]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imercer.com/content/quality-of-living.aspx |title=2015 Quality of Living survey |publisher=Mercer.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref>

The ensemble [[Speicherstadt]] and ''Kontorhausviertel'' was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[UNESCO]] in July 2015.<ref>[https://marketing.hamburg.de/unesco-welterbe.html Media release] on the website of Hamburg Marketing, retrieved on March 19th, 2016.</ref>

==Geography==
Hamburg is on the southern point of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], between [[Continental Europe]] to the south and [[Scandinavia]] to the north, with the [[North Sea]] to the west and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the north-east. It is on the River [[Elbe]] at its confluence with the [[Alster]] and [[Bille (Elbe)|Bille]]. The city centre is around the [[Binnenalster]] ("Inner Alster") and [[Außenalster]] ("Outer Alster"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes. The island of [[Neuwerk]] and two small neighbouring islands [[Scharhörn]] and [[Nigehörn]], in the [[Wadden Sea National Parks|Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park]], are also part of Hamburg.<ref>Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park Act {{Citation |title=Gesetz über den Nationalpark Hamburgisches Wattenmeer |url=http://www.landesrecht.hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bshaprod.psml?doc.id=jlr-WattMGHArahmen&st=lr&showdoccase=1&paramfromHL=true#focuspoint|date=9 April 1990 |accessdate=26 February 2011|language=de}}</ref>

The neighbourhoods of [[Neuenfelde]], [[Cranz, Hamburg|Cranz]], Francop and [[Finkenwerder]] are part of the ''[[Altes Land]]'' (old land) region, the largest contiguous fruit-producing region in [[Central Europe]]. [[Neugraben-Fischbek]] has Hamburg's highest elevation, the [[Hasselbrack]] at {{convert|116.2|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|AMSL]].<ref>{{Citation |author=''Geologisches Landesamt Hamburg'' (Hamburg State Geological Department) |title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2007/2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Statistisches Amt für Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein |location=Hamburg |issn=1614-8045|language=de}}</ref>

===Climate===
Hamburg has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), influenced by its proximity to the coast and marine air masses that originate over the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nearby wetlands also enjoy a maritime temperate climate. Measurable snowfall is rare, generally occurring once or twice a year.

The warmest months are June, July, and August, with high temperatures of {{convert|20.1|to|22.5|C|F}}. The coldest are December, January, and February, with low temperatures of {{convert|-0.3|to|1.0|C|F}}.<ref name=WMO/>

===Origins===
[[Claudius Ptolemy]] (2nd century CE) reported the first name for the vicinity as '''Treva'''.

The name Hamburg comes from the first permanent building on the site, a [[castle]] which the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] ordered constructed in AD 808. It rose on rocky terrain in a marsh between the [[Alster|River Alster]] and the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] as a defence against [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] incursion, and acquired the name ''Hammaburg'', ''burg'' meaning castle or fort. The origin of the ''Hamma'' term remains uncertain,<ref><cite id=Verg>{{Citation |last1=Verg |first1=Erich |last2=Verg|first2=Martin|year=2007 |title=Das Abenteuer das Hamburg heißt |edition=4th |location=Hamburg |publisher=Ellert&Richter |isbn=978-3-8319-0137-1 |page=8|language=de}}

===Medieval Hamburg===
In 834, Hamburg was designated as the seat of a [[Prince-Bishop|bishopric]]. The first bishop, [[Ansgar]], became known as the Apostle of the North. Two years later, Hamburg was united with [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]] as the [[Bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]].<ref name=verg15>[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p.15</ref>

Hamburg was destroyed and occupied several times. In 845, 600 [[Viking]] ships sailed up the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] and destroyed Hamburg, at that time a town of around 500 inhabitants.<ref name="verg15"/> In 1030, King [[Mieszko II Lambert]] of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]] burned down the city. [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214. The [[Black Death]] killed at least 60% of the population in 1350.<ref>

Hamburg experienced several great fires, most notably in 1284.

[[File:Hamburg um 1600 Brook.jpg|thumb|Hamburg ca. 1600]]
[[File:Jmdavid hamburg.jpg|thumb|Hamburg in 1811]]

In 1189, by imperial charter, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I "Barbarossa"]] granted Hamburg the status of an [[Free imperial city|Imperial Free City]] and tax-free access up{{clarify|date=November 2013}} the Lower Elbe into the North Sea. In 1265, an allegedly forged letter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.<ref name=verg26>[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 26</ref> This charter, along with Hamburg's proximity to the main trade routes of the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]], quickly made it a major port in [[Northern Europe]]. Its trade alliance with [[Lübeck]] in 1241 marks the origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities. On 8 November 1266, a contract between [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and Hamburg's traders allowed them to establish a ''hanse'' in London. This was the first time in history that the word ''hanse'' was used for the trading guild of the [[Hanseatic League]].<ref name=verg30>[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 30
</ref>
In 1270, the solicitor of the [[senate of Hamburg]], ''Jordan von Boitzenburg'', wrote the first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a city in Germany in the German language, the ''Ordeelbook'' (''Ordeel'': sentence).<ref>

</ref> On 10 August 1410, civil unrest forced a compromise (German: ''Rezeß'', literally meaning: withdrawal). This is considered the first [[constitution of Hamburg]].<ref>[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 39</ref> In 1529, the city embraced [[Lutheranism]], and it received [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed]] refugees from the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]].

===Modern times===

When [[Jan van Valckenborgh]] introduced a second layer to the fortifications to protect against the [[Thirty Years War]] in the seventeenth century, he extended Hamburg and created a "New Town" (''Neustadt'') whose street names still date from the grid system of roads he introduced.<ref>[http://www.carltoepferstiftung.de/img/pdf/tourist_information_inner_pages.pdf History of the area], accessed 3 November 2012</ref>

Upon the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial City]] of Hamburg was not incorporated into a larger administrative area while retaining special privileges ([[Mediatization|mediatised]]), but became a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state with the official title of the ''Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg''. Hamburg was briefly annexed by [[Napoleon I]] to the [[First French Empire]] (1804–1814/1815). Russian forces under [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|General Bennigsen]] finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg re-assumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the [[German Confederation]] (1815–1866).

In 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the "[[Great Fire of Hamburg|Great Fire]]". The fire started on the night of 4 May and was not extinguished until 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.

After periodic political unrest, particularly in [[Revolutions of 1848|1848]], Hamburg adopted in 1860 a democratic constitution that provided for the election of the Senate, the governing body of the city-state, by adult taxpaying males. Other innovations included the separation of powers, the separation of Church and State, freedom of the press, of assembly and association. Hamburg became a member of the [[North German Confederation]] (1866–1871) and of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918), and maintained its self-ruling status during the Weimar Republic (1919–1933). The city experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade helped make it Europe's second-largest port. The [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]], with [[Albert Ballin]] as its director, became the world's largest [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] shipping company around the start of the 20th century. Shipping companies sailing to [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[East Asia]] were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for many Germans and [[Eastern Europe]]ans to emigrate to the [[United States]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves there.

A major outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1892 was badly handled by the city government, which retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in a major city of the Western world.

===Second World War===
[[File:Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945. CL3400.jpg|thumb|[[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Hamburg after the 1943 bombing]]]]
[[File:Hamburg Medienbunker 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|''[[Flak tower|Flakturm]]'' on the Heiligengeistfeld in Hamburg – one of four enormous fortress-like bunkers which were built of reinforced concrete between 1942 and 1944 and equipped with anti-aircraft artillery for air defense]]

In the [[Third Reich]] (1933–1945), Hamburg was a ''[[Administrative division of Nazi Germany|Gau]]'' from 1934 until 1945. During the [[Second World War]], Hamburg suffered a series of Allied [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|air raids]] which devastated much of the city and the harbour. On 23 July 1943, RAF firebombing created a [[firestorm]] which spread from the ''Hauptbahnhof'' (main railway station) and quickly moved south-east, completely destroying entire boroughs such as [[Hammerbrook]], [[Billbrook]] and [[Hamm, Hamburg|Hamm-south]]. Thousands of people perished in these densely populated working class boroughs. While some of the boroughs destroyed were rebuilt as residential districts after the war, others such as Hammerbrook are nowadays purely commercial districts with almost no residential population. The raids, codenamed [[Operation Gomorrah]] by the [[RAF]], killed at least 42,600 civilians; the precise number is not known.
About one million civilians were evacuated in the aftermath of the raids.

The [[Hamburg Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery]] is in the greater [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]] in the north of Hamburg.

At least 42,900 people are thought to have perished<ref name="kz-neuengamme">{{cite web|url=http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |title=Gedenkstätte Konzentrationslager Neuengamme |publisher=Kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |date= |accessdate=14 September 2013}}</ref> in the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] (about {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city in the marshlands), mostly from epidemics and in the [[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|bombing of Kriegsmarine evacuation vessels]] by the Royal Air Force at the end of the war.

Hamburg had the greatest concentration of Jews in Germany. Systematic [[Deportation#Deportation in the Holocaust|deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent]] started on 18 October 1941. These were all directed to [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe]] or to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Most deported persons perished in [[the Holocaust]]. By the end of 1942 the ''Jüdischer Religionsverband in Hamburg'' was dissolved as an independent legal entity and its remaining assets and staff were assumed by the [[Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland]] (District Northwest). On 10 June 1943 the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]] dissolved the ''Reichsvereinigung'' by a decree.<ref>Cf.

Ortwin Pelc, Kriegsende in Hamburg, Hamburg 2005</ref> After the [[Second World War]], Hamburg formed part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British Zone of Occupation]]; it became a state of the then [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949. From 1960 to 1962, [[the Beatles]] launched their career by playing in various music clubs in the city. On 16 February 1962, a [[North Sea flood of 1962|North Sea flood]] caused the Elbe to rise to an all-time high, inundating one-fifth of Hamburg and killing more than 300 people.

The [[Inner German border]] — only {{convert|50|km|mi|-1}} east of Hamburg — separated the city from most of its hinterland and reduced Hamburg's global trade. Since [[German reunification]] in 1990, and the accession of several [[Central Europe]]an and [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] into the [[European Union]] in 2004, the [[Port of Hamburg]] has restarted ambitions for regaining its position as the region's largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial and trading centre.

===Language===
{{See also|Hamburgisch dialect}}

Like elsewhere in Germany, [[Standard German]] is spoken in Hamburg, but as typical for northern Germany, the original language of Hamburg is [[Low German]], usually referred to as ''Hamborger Platt'' (German ''Hamburger Platt'') or ''[[Hamburgisch|Hamborgsch]]''. Since large-scale [[Standard language|standardization]] of the German language beginning in earnest in the 18th century, various Low German-colored dialects have developed (contact-varieties of German on Low Saxon substrates). Originally, there was a range of such [[Missingsch]] varieties, the best-known being the low-prestige ones of the working classes and the somewhat more bourgeois ''Hanseatendeutsch'' (Hanseatic German), although the term is used in appreciation.<ref>{{Citation |contribution=Die deutsche Sprache—eine Dialektlandschaft |title=Nationalatlas Bundesrepublik Deutschland |last=Bausch |first=Karl-Heinz |url=http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |year=2007 |accessdate=24 September 2008 |publisher=Leibniz-Institut für Länderkunde |location=Leipzig |isbn=3-8274-0947-0 |pages=94–95 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719043439/http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011|language=de}}</ref> All of these are now moribund due to the influences of Standard German used by education and media. However, the former importance of Low German is indicated by several songs, such as the famous [[sea shanty]] [[Hamborger Veermaster]], written in the 19th century when Low German was used more frequently. Many toponyms and street names reflect Low Saxon vocabulary, partially even in Low Saxon spelling, which is not standardised, and to some part in forms adapted to Standard German.<ref>Several places are named ...brook (Billbrook, Brooktor, Grasbrook, Hammerbrook, Hellbrook, Iserbrook) rather than Standard German ...bruch (neutr.; =brook riverscape), Bullenhusen rather than Bullenhausen, Lohbrügge rather than Lohbrücke, several localities starting with Nien... (Niendorf, Nienstedten) rather than Neuen..., or ending ...hude (Dockenhuden, Harvestehude, Winterhude) rather than ...hut[ung] (fem.; =pasture), Uhlenhorst rather than Eulenhorst, several places and water bodies are named ...bek (Barmbek, Eilbek, Fischbek, Flottbek, Goldbek, Isebek, Kirchsteinbek, Langenbek, Osterbek, Pepermölenbek, Wandsbek) rather than ...bach, several places and water bodies are called ...fleet (Alsterfleet, Bleichenfleet, Moorfleet) rather than ...fließ (=brook, stream). Further toponyms with no close Standard German correspondents appear, such as ...büttel (=inhabited place; Eimsbüttel, Fuhlsbüttel, Hummelsbüttel, Poppenbüttel, Wellingsbüttel) or Twiete (=alley wedged between buildings). Like in other parts of Northern Germany ...stedt (Bergstedt, Billstedt, Duvenstedt, Eidelstedt, Lokstedt, Mellingstedt, Nienstedten, Ohlstedt, Rahlstedt) prevails over ...stadt (=town, originally simply stead).</ref>

==Government==

The city of Hamburg is one of 16 [[States of Germany|German states]], therefore the [[Government of Hamburg|Mayor of Hamburg]]'s office corresponds more to the role of a [[Minister-President|minister-president]] than to the one of a city mayor. As a [[States of Germany#Politics|German state government]], it is responsible for public education, correctional institutions and public safety; as a municipality, it is additionally responsible for libraries, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and quarters of Hamburg}}
[[File:Hamburg Subdivisions.svg|thumb|left|250px|Boroughs of Hamburg]]

Hamburg is made up of seven boroughs (German: ''Bezirke'') and subdivided into 104 quarters (German: ''Stadtteile''). There are 181 localities (German: ''Ortsteile''). The urban organization is regulated by the Constitution of Hamburg and several laws.<ref name=constitution/><ref name=borough>Borough Administration Act {{Citation |title=Bezirksverwaltungsgesetz (BezVG)
|url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/BezVwG_HA_2006.htm |accessdate=21 September 2008 |date=6 July 2006|language=de}}</ref> Most of the quarters were former independent cities, towns or villages annexed into Hamburg proper. The last large annexation was done through the [[Greater Hamburg Act]] of 1937, when the cities [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]] and [[Hamburg-Wandsbek|Wandsbek]] were merged into the state of Hamburg.<ref name=greateract>[[Greater Hamburg Act]] {{Citation |title=Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37.htm |date=26 January 1937 |accessdate=24 September 2008|language=de}}</ref> The ''Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg'' established Hamburg as a state and a municipality.<ref name=reichconst>Reich Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg {{Citation |title=Reichsgesetz über die Verfassung und Verwaltung der Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37-1.htm |date=9 December 1937 |accessdate=24 September 2008|language=de}}</ref> Some of the boroughs and quarters have been rearranged several times.

Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (German: ''Bezirksversammlung'') and administered by a Municipal Administrator (German: ''Bezirksamtsleiter''). The boroughs are not independent municipalities: their power is limited and subordinate to the [[Mayor of Hamburg|Senate of Hamburg]]. The borough administrator is elected by the Borough Council and thereafter requires confirmation and appointment by [[Hamburg's Senate]].<ref name=borough/> The quarters have no governing bodies of their own.

Since the German premiere of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' in 1985, there have always been [[musical theatre|musicals]] running, including ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing#Stage version|Dirty Dancing]]'' and ''[[Dance of the Vampires]]''. This density, the highest in Germany, is partly due to the major musical production company ''[[Stage Entertainment]]'' being based in the city.

Hamburg is the birthplace of [[Johannes Brahms]], who spent his formative early years in the city, and the birthplace and home of the famous waltz composer [[Oscar Fetrás]], who wrote the well-known "Mondnacht auf der Alster" waltz.

Prior to the group's initial recording and widespread fame, Hamburg provided residency and performing venues for the [[The Beatles in Hamburg|Beatles]] from 1960 to 1962. Hamburg has nurtured a number of pop musicians. Identical twins [[Bill Kaulitz]] and Tom Kaulitz from the rock band [[Tokio Hotel]] live and maintain a recording studio in Hamburg, where they recorded their second and third albums, [[Zimmer 483]] and [[Humanoid]]. Singer [[Nena]] also lives in Hamburg. There are German hip hop acts, such as [[Fünf Sterne deluxe]], [[Samy Deluxe]], Beginner and [[Fettes Brot]]. There is a substantial [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[punk rock|punk]] scene, which gathers around the [[Rote Flora]], a [[squatting|squatted]] former theatre located in the Sternschanze. Hamburg is famous for an original kind of German [[alternative rock|alternative music]] called ''[[Hamburger Schule]]'' ("Hamburg School"), a term used for bands like [[Tocotronic]], [[Blumfeld]], [[Tomte (band)|Tomte]] or [[Kante (band)|Kante]].

The city was a major centre for [[heavy metal music]] in the 1980s. [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]] started in Hamburg.<ref>{{Citation |title=allmusic (((Helloween> Biography ))) |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4471|pure_url=yes}} |first=Eduardo |last=Rivadavia |publisher=allmusic |accessdate=24 September 2008}}</ref> The [[industrial rock]] band [[KMFDM]] was also formed in Hamburg, initially as a performance art project. The influences of these and other bands from the area helped establish the subgenre of [[power metal]].

Hamburg has a vibrant psychedelic trance community, with record labels such as [[Spirit Zone Records|Spirit Zone]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Spirit Zone Recordings |author=Staff |url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Spirit+Zone+Recordings |publisher=www.discogs.com |accessdate=24 September 2008}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
[[File:Scholle mit Speck.jpg|thumb|Fried [[plaice]], [[Finkenwerder]] style]]
{{Main|Cuisine of Hamburg}}

Original Hamburg dishes are ''[[Birnen, Bohnen und Speck]]'' (green beans cooked with pears and bacon),<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/07/05/43504.html |title=Birnen, Bohnen, Speck – Schmeckt vorzüglich |date=5 July 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref> ''Aalsuppe'' ([[Hamburgisch dialect|Hamburgisch]] ''Oolsupp'') is often mistaken to be German for “eel soup“ (''Aal''/''Ool'' translated ‘eel’), but the name probably comes from the Low Saxon ''allns'' {{IPA|[aˑlns]}}, meaning “all”, “everything and the kitchen sink”, not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included to meet the expectations of unsuspecting diners.<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39651.html |title=Aalsuppe – Frage des Geschmacks |date=25 June 2002|accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref> There is ''Bratkartoffeln'' (pan-fried potato slices), ''Finkenwerder Scholle'' (Low Saxon ''Finkwarder Scholl'', pan-fried plaice), ''Pannfisch'' (pan-fried fish with mustard sauce),<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39713.html |title=Maischollen – Zart gebraten |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref> ''[[Rødgrød|Rote Grütze]]'' (Low Saxon ''Rode Grütt'', related to Danish ''rødgrød'', a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish ''rødgrød med fløde'')<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendbla |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39656.html |title=Grütze – Mit kalter Milch |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref> and ''[[Labskaus]]'' (a mixture of corned beef, mashed potatoes and beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian ''lapskaus'' and [[Liverpool]]'s [[Scouse (food)|lobscouse]], all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39664.html |title=Labskaus – Essen der Matrosen |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref>

''Alsterwasser'' (in reference to the city's river, the Alster) is the local name for a type of [[shandy]], a concoction of equal parts of beer and carbonated lemonade (''Zitronenlimonade''), the lemonade being added to the beer.<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/01/52867.html |title=Alsterwasser – Bier und Limonade |date=10 August 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref>

There is the curious regional dessert pastry called [[Franzbrötchen]]. Looking rather like a flattened croissant, it is similar in preparation but includes a cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar [[streusel]]. The name may also reflect to the roll's [[croissant]]-like appearance – ''franz'' appears to be a shortening of ''französisch'', meaning "French", which would make a ''Franzbrötchen'' a “French roll.”
Ordinary bread rolls tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread variety. The local name is ''Schrippe'' (scored lengthways) for the oval kind and, for the round kind, ''Rundstück'' (“round piece” rather than mainstream German ''Brötchen'', diminutive form of ''Brot'' “bread”),<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/05/53895.html |title=Rundstück – Hamburger Brötchen |date=5 August 2002 |accessdate=6 June 2008|language=de}}</ref> a relative of Denmark's ''rundstykke''. In fact, while by no means identical, the cuisines of Hamburg and [[Denmark]], especially of [[Copenhagen]], have a lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled fish.

The American [[hamburger]] may have developed from Hamburg's ''Frikadelle'': a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than its American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground beef, soaked [[staling|stale bread]], egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not usually on a bun. The Oxford Dictionary defined a ''Hamburger steak'' in 1802: a sometimes-smoked and -salted piece of meat, that, according to some sources, came from Hamburg to America.<ref>{{Citation |last=Stradley |first=Linda |title=History of Hamburgers |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/HamburgerHistory.htm |year=2004 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}</ref> The name and food, "hamburger", has entered all English-speaking countries, and derivative words in non-English speaking countries.

There are restaurants which offer most of these dishes, especially in the [[Hafencity]], which started to be built in 2008 with {{convert|155|ha}} and 13 quarters. This district increases the city centre by about 40%, with restaurants and apartments.<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Restaurants in Hamburg |url=http://restaurant-in-hamburg.info/ |title=specialities and restaurants in Hamburg |date=11 February 2013 |accessdate=11 February 2013|language=de}}</ref>

===HafenCity===
The [[HafenCity]] is a new large urban development project in the [[Hamburg-Mitte]] district. It consists of the area of the Great Grasbrook, the northern part of the former Elbe island [[Grasbrook]], and the warehouse district on the former Elbe island Kehrwieder and Wandrahm. It is bordered to the north, separated by the customs channel to Hamburg's city center, west and south by the Elbe and to the east, bounded by the upper harbor, [[Rothenburgsort]]. The district is full of rivers and streams and is surrounded by channels, and has a total area of about 2.2&nbsp;square-kilometers.

HafenCity has 155 hectares in the area formerly belonging to the free port north of the Great Grasbrook. Residential units for up to 12,000 people are planned to be built on the site by around the mid-2020s, and jobs for up to 40,000 people, mainly in the office sector, should be created. It is the largest ongoing urban development project in Hamburg.

Construction work started in 2003, and in 2009 the first part of the urban development project was finished with the completion of the Dalmannkai / Sandtorkai neighborhood – which is the first stage of the HafenCity project. According to the person responsible for the development and commercialization of HafenCity, ''HafenCity Hamburg GmbH'', half of the master plan underlying structural construction is already completed, whereas the other half is either under construction or is in the construction preparation stages.

Many companies operating in [[E-commerce|E-Commerce]] have moved into HafenCity or started there. In addition to cruise agents such as the [http://www.1000kreuzfahrten.de/ CaptainTravel GmbH] many [[Start-up company|start-up companies]] that have no direct connection to the port or ships can be found in HafenCity.

===Tourism===

A typical Hamburg visit includes a tour of the city hall and the grand church [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|St. Michaelis]] (called the ''Michel''), and visiting the old warehouse district (''[[Speicherstadt]]'') and the [[Landungsbrücken|harbour promenade]] (''Landungsbrücken''). Sightseeing buses connect these points of interest. As Hamburg is one of the world's largest harbours many visitors take one of the harbour and/or canal boat tours (''Große Hafenrundfahrt'', ''Fleetfahrt'') which start from the ''Landungsbrücken''. Major destinations also include [[museum]]s.

The area of [[Reeperbahn]] in the quarter [[St. Pauli]] is Europe's largest red light district and home of strip clubs, brothels, bars and nightclubs. The singer and actor [[Hans Albers]] is strongly associated with St. Pauli, and wrote the neighbourhood's unofficial anthem, "Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts um Halb Eins" ("[[On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight (song)|On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight]]") in the 1940s. [[The Beatles]] had stints on the Reeperbahn early in their careers. Others prefer the laid-back neighbourhood ''Schanze'' with its street cafés, or a barbecue on one of the beaches along the river Elbe. Hamburg's famous zoo, the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]], was founded in 1907 by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] as the first zoo with moated, barless enclosures.<ref>{{Cite news |publisher=[[National Audubon Society]] |work=Audubon Magazine |title=The New Zoo |url=http://audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |author=Rene S.

In 2005, the average visitor spent two nights in Hamburg.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The majority of visitors come from Germany. Most foreigners are European, especially from the [[United Kingdom]] (171,000 overnight stays), [[Switzerland]] (about 143,000 overnight stays), [[Austria]] (about 137,000 overnight stays) and the [[Netherlands]] (about 80,000 overnight stays).

Hamburg is a major transportation hub, connected to four [[Autobahn]]en (motorways) and the most important railway junction on the route to Scandinavia.

Bridges and tunnels connect the northern and southern parts of the city, such as the [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|old Elbe Tunnel]] (''Alter Elbtunnel'') or St. Pauli Elbtunnel (official name) which opened in 1911, now is major tourist sight, and the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|Elbe Tunnel]] (''Elbtunnel'') the crossing of a [[Bundesautobahn 7|motorway]].<ref>{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/09/10/67509.html |title=Elbe ohne e – Buchstaben fallen weg |date=10 August 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref>

Hamburg's [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|license plate]] prefix was "HH" (Hansestadt Hamburg; English: Hanseatic City of Hamburg) between 1906 and 1945 and from 1956, rather than the single letter normally used for large cities since the federal registration reform in 1956, such as B for Berlin or M for Munich. "H" was Hamburg's prefix in the years between 1945 and 1947 (used by [[Hanover]] since 1956);<ref>other prefixes used between 1945 and 1956 were "MGH" (Military Government, Hamburg: 1945 only), "HG" (1947 only) and "BH" (British Zone, Hamburg) between 1948 and 1956.</ref>

====Public transport====
[[Public transport]] by rail, bus and ship is organised by the ''[[Hamburger Verkehrsverbund]]'' ("Hamburg transit authority") (HVV).  Tickets sold by one company are valid on all other HVV companies' services. The HVV was the first organisation of this kind worldwide.<ref>{{Citation |title=HVV – Mehr als ein Ziel – Historie |url=http://www.hvv.de/ueber-uns/historie/ |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Verkehrsverbund |accessdate=25 September 2008|language=de}}</ref>

Ten mass transit rail lines across the city are the backbone of public transport. The [[Hamburg S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] (heavy railway system) comprises six lines and the [[Hamburg U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] four lines – ''U-Bahn'' is short for ''Untergrundbahn'' (underground railway). Approximately {{convert|41|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of {{convert|101|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the U-Bahn is underground; most is on embankments or viaduct or at ground level. Older residents still speak of the system as ''Hochbahn'' (elevated railway), also because the operating company of the subway is the ''[[Hamburger Hochbahn]]''. The [[AKN Eisenbahn|AKN railway]] connects satellite towns in Schleswig-Holstein to the city. On some routes regional trains of Germany's major railway company [[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]] and the regional ''[[metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft|metronom]]'' trains may be used with an HVV ticket. Except at the four bigger stations of the city, [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]], [[Hamburg Dammtor station|Dammtor]], [[Hamburg-Altona station|Altona]] and [[Hamburg-Harburg station|Harburg]] regional trains do not stop inside the city. The [[tram]] network  was opened in 1865 and shut down in 1978.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

Gaps in the rail network are filled by more than 600 bus routes, operated by single-deck two-, three- and four-axle diesel buses. Hamburg has no trams or trolley-buses, but has hydrogen-fueled buses operating pilot services. The buses run frequently during working hours, with buses on some so-called MetroBus routes as often as every 2 minutes. In on special weekday night lines the intervals can be 30 minutes or longer, on normal days (Monday-Friday) the normal buses stop running at night. (MetroBuses run all around the clock, every day at the year at least every half-hour.)

There are six ferry lines along the [[River Elbe]], operated by ''[[HADAG Seetouristik und Fährdienst|HADAG]]'', that fall under the aegis of the HVV. While mainly used by citizens and dock workers, they can also be used for sightseeing tours.

The international airport at Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel, official name "[[Hamburg Airport]]" ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: HAM, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDDH) is the fifth biggest and oldest airport in Germany, having been established in 1912 and located about {{convert|5|mi|0|abbr=off}} from the city centre. About 60 airlines provide service to 125 destination airports, including some long distance destinations like [[Newark, New Jersey]] on [[United Airlines]], [[Dubai]] on [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], and [[Tehran]] on [[Iran Air]]; [[Lufthansa]] is the hub carrier, with the most flights, followed by [[Air Berlin]], and Lufthansa operates one of its biggest [[Lufthansa Technik|maintenance facilities]] at the Hamburg airport. The second airport is Hamburg-Finkenwerder ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: XFW, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDHI). It is about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city centre and is a nonpublic airport for the [[Airbus Operations GmbH|Airbus]] plant. It is the second biggest Airbus plant, after [[Toulouse]], and the third biggest aviation manufacturing plant after [[Seattle]] and Toulouse; the plant houses the final assembly lines for A318, A319, A320, A321 and [[Airbus A380|A380]] aircraft.<ref>{{Citation |title=Airbus in Germany |url=http://www.airbus.com/company/worldwide-presence/airbus-in-germany/ |author=Staff |publisher=Airbus |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref>

{{Quotation|In Hamburg it's hard to find a native Hamburger. A hurried and superficial search turns up only crayfish, people from Pinneberg, and those from Bergedorf. One accompanies the contented little kippers of a striving society; mackerels from Stade, sole from Finkenwerder, herrings from Cuxhaven swim in expectant throngs through the streets of my city and lobsters patrol the stock exchange with open claws.... The first so-called unguarded glance always lands on the bottom of the sea and falls into twilight of the aquarium. [[Heinrich Heine]] must have had the same experience when he tried, with his cultivated scorn and gifted melancholy, to find the people of Hamburg.|[[Siegfried Lenz]]||in ''Leute von Hamburg'' (People of Hamburg) ISBN 978-3-423-11538-4.<ref>{{Citation |first=Jennifer |last=Jenkins |title=Provincial modernity: local culture and liberal politics in fin-de-siècle Hamburg |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-8014-4025-4}}</ref>}}
