Defensive back

In [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], '''defensive backs''' (DBs) are the players on the defensive team who take positions somewhat back from the line of scrimmage; they are distinguished from the [[defensive line]] players and [[linebackers]], who take positions directly behind or close to the line of scrimmage.<ref>http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/defensive-back-db.aspx</ref>
The defensive backs, in turn, generally are classified into several different specialized positions:

*[[Safety (American football position)|Safety]]:
**[[Free Safety]] – most often the deepest safety
**[[Strong Safety]] – the bigger more physical safety, much like a small, quicker linebacker
*[[Halfback (Canadian football)|Defensive halfback]] (Canadian football only)
*[[Cornerback]] – which include:
**[[Nickelback (American football)|nickel back]] – the fifth defensive back in some sets, such as the Nickel formation
**[[Dimeback|dime back]] – the sixth defensive back in some sets, such as the Dime formation
**The seventh defensive back, in the exceedingly rare 'quarter' set
***known as a dollar back or a quarter back (not to be confused with the offensive player who throws the ball)
The group of defensive backs is known collectively as the '''secondary'''. They most often defend the wide receiver corps; however, at times they may also line up against a tight end or a split out running back.
