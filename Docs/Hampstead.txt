'''Hampstead''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|p|s|t|ɪ|d}} or {{IPAc-en|-|s|t|ɛ|d}}), commonly known as Hampstead Village, is an area of [[London]], [[England]], {{convert|4|mi|km|1}} north-west of [[Charing Cross]].  Part of the [[London Borough of Camden]], it is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations and for [[Hampstead Heath]], a large, hilly expanse of parkland.  It has some of the most expensive housing in the London area. The village of Hampstead has more millionaires within its boundaries than any other area of the United Kingdom.<ref name="Tel080504">Wade, David, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/advice/propertymarket/3324574/Whatever-happened-to-Hampstead-Man.html "Whatever happened to Hampstead Man?"]. ''The Daily Telegraph'', 8 May 2004 (Retrieved 3 March 2016)</ref>

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name comes from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words ''ham''  and ''stede'', which means, and is a cognate of, the Modern English "homestead".

===To 1900===

[[File:The Mount Hampstead.jpg|thumb|right|A current day view of location used for the Madox Brown painting]]
Early records of Hampstead can be found in a grant by King [[Ethelred the Unready]] to the monastery of St. Peter's at Westminster (AD 986) and it is referred to in the [[Domesday Book]] (1086)<ref>{{cite web|author=Anna Powell-Smith |url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/TQ2685/hampstead/ |title=Hampstead &#124; Domesday Book |publisher=Domesdaymap.co.uk |date= |accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> as being in the hundred of [[Ossulstone]].

The growth of Hampstead is generally traced back to the 17th century.  Trustees of the Well started advertising the medicinal qualities of the [[chalybeate]] waters (water impregnated with iron) in 1700.  Although Hampstead Wells was initially most successful and fashionable, its popularity declined in the 1800s due to competition with other fashionable London spas. The spa was demolished in 1882, although a water fountain was left behind.

Hampstead started to expand following the opening of the [[North London Railway]] in the 1860s (now the [[London Overground]] with passenger services operated by [[Transport for London]]), and expanded further after the [[Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway]] opened in 1907 (now part of [[London Underground]]'s [[Northern line]]) and provided fast travel to [[central London]].

Much luxurious housing was created during the 1870s and 1880s, in the area that is now the political ward of Frognal & Fitzjohns. Much of this housing remains to this day.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, a number of notable buildings were created including:
* [[Hampstead tube station]] (1907), the deepest station on the [[London Underground|Underground]] network
* [[Isokon building]] (1932)
* [[Hillfield Court]] (1932)
* [[2 Willow Road]] (1938)
* [[Swiss Cottage Central Library]] (1964)
* [[Royal Free Hospital]] (mid-1970s)
[[File:Keats House.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Keats House, Hampstead, where [[John Keats|Keats]] wrote his ''[[Ode to a Nightingale]]'']]

Cultural attractions in the area include the [[Freud Museum]], [[Keats House]], [[Kenwood House]], [[Fenton House]], the [[Isokon building]], [[Burgh House]] (which also houses Hampstead Museum), and the [[Camden Arts Centre]]. The large Victorian Hampstead Library and Town Hall was recently converted and extended as a creative industries centre.

On 14 August 1975 Hampstead entered the [[UK Weather Records]] with the ''Highest 155-min total'' rainfall at 169&nbsp;mm. As of November 2008 this record remains.

==Politics==
[[File:Hampstead High Street Sign.JPG|thumb|200px|Hampstead High Street sign]]
[[File:Hampstead Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Hampstead Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]
Hampstead became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889 and in 1899 the [[Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead]] was formed. The borough town hall on Haverstock Hill, which was also the location of the Register Office, can be seen in newsreel footage of many celebrity civil marriages. In 1965 the metropolitan borough was abolished and its area merged with that of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Holborn]] and the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras]] to form the modern-day [[London Borough of Camden]].
Hampstead is part of the [[Hampstead and Kilburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead and Kilburn]] constituency, formed at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. It was formerly part of the [[Hampstead and Highgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead and Highgate]] constituency. From 1992 to 2015 the member of parliament was the former actress [[Glenda Jackson]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Glenda Jackson retired at the 2015 general election and [[Tulip Siddiq]] was elected the new Labour member of parliament for Hampstead and Kilburn.

The area is also home to the left-wing Labour magazine ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' and the satirical magazine the ''Hampstead Village Voice.'' The local paid-for newspaper is the ''[[Hampstead and Highgate Express]]'',<ref>{{cite web|author=Title -- MrMrsMsMiss First name: Surname: |url=http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/ |title=Home - Hampstead Highgate Express |publisher=Hamhigh.co.uk |date= |accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> known locally as the "Ham & High". Hampstead is also covered by the borough-wide [[Camden New Journal]].

Since May 2015 the area has been represented on Camden Council by Conservative Party Councillors Tom Currie, Oliver Cooper, and Stephen Stark.

===Hampstead Liberalism===
The area has a significant tradition of educated liberal humanism, often referred to (often disparagingly) as "Hampstead Liberalism". In the 1960s, the figure of the Hampstead Liberal was notoriously satirised by [[Michael Wharton|Peter Simple]] of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' in the character of [[List of Peter Simple's characters|Lady Dutt-Pauker]], an immensely wealthy aristocratic socialist whose Hampstead mansion, Marxmount House, contained an original pair of [[Bukharin]]'s false teeth on display alongside precious Ming vases, [[constructivism (art)|neo-constructivist]] art, and the complete writings of Stalin.<ref>''The Stretchford Chronicles'', ''Michael Wharton'', (London, 1980), pages 216, 236, 284</ref> Michael Idov of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' stated that the community "was the citadel of the moneyed liberal intelligentsia, posh but not stuffy."<ref name=Idov>Idov, Michael. "[http://nymag.com/news/features/establishments/68506/ The Demon Blogger of Fleet Street]." ''[[New York Magazine]]''. 26 September 2010. Retrieved 3 August 2014.</ref> As applied to an individual, the term "Hampstead Liberal" is not synonymous with "[[champagne socialist]]" but carries some of the same connotations.

===Sites===
To the north and east of Hampstead, and separating it from [[Highgate]], is London's largest ancient parkland, [[Hampstead Heath]], which includes the well-known and legally-protected view of the London skyline from Parliament Hill. The Heath, a major place for Londoners to walk and "take the air", has three open-air public [[Hampstead Ponds|swimming ponds]]; one for men, one for women, and one for [[mixed bathing]], which were originally [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] for drinking water and the sources of the [[River Fleet]]. The bridge pictured is known locally as 'The Red Arches' or 'The Viaduct', built in fruitless anticipation of residential building on the Heath in the 19th century.

Local activities include major open-air concerts on summer Saturday evenings on the slopes below [[Kenwood House]], book and poetry readings, fun fairs on the lower reaches of the Heath, period harpsichord recitals at Fenton House, Hampstead Scientific Society and Hampstead Photographic Society.

The largest employer in Hampstead is the [[Royal Free Hospital]], Pond Street, but many small businesses based in the area have international significance. [[George Martin]]'s [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR]] recording studios, in converted church premises in Lyndhurst Road, is a current example, as [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] was, before it relocated to California.

The area has some remarkable architecture, such as the [[Isokon building]] in Lawn Road, a [[Grade I listed]] experiment in collective housing, once home to [[Agatha Christie]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ben Nicholson]] and [[Walter Gropius]]. It was recently restored by Notting Hill Housing Trust.

===Restaurants===
Hampstead has an eclectic mix of restaurants ranging from French to Thai. Notable and longstanding are La Gaffe, Gaucho Grill, Jin Kichi, Tip Top Thai, Villa Bianca and, in May 2016, Patara. After over a decade of controversy and legal action from local residents, [[McDonald's]] was finally allowed to open in Hampstead in 1992, after winning its right in court, and agreeing to a previously unprecedented re-design of the shop front, reducing the conspicuousness of its facade and logo,<ref>LETTER FROM LONDON; Hampstead Braces for a Big Mac Attack, The Washington Post | 4 November 1992 | Eugene Robinson</ref> but closed in November 2013.<ref>Wright, Paul (1 November 2013).

===Film locations===
[[File:Hampsteadheath1.jpg|256px|left|thumb|East Heath]]
Hampstead's rural feel lends itself for use on film; a notable example being ''[[The Killing of Sister George]]'' (1968) starring [[Beryl Reid]] and [[Susannah York]]. The opening sequence has Reid's character June wandering through the streets and alleyways of Hampstead, west of Heath Street, around The Mount Square. The Marquis of Granby pub, in which June drinks at the opening of the film, was actually The Holly Bush,<ref name="ML:KoSG">[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/k/killingsister.html "The Killing of Sister George film locations"]. Movie-Locations.com (Retrieved 18 June 2009)</ref> at 22 Holly Mount. Another example is ''[[The Collector (1965 film)|The Collector]]'' (1965), starring [[Terence Stamp]] and [[Samantha Eggar]], where the kidnap sequence is set in Mount Vernon.

The 1986 fantasy film [[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]], starring Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, was shot, in large part, in Hampstead Heath.

Some scenes from ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981) are shot on [[Hampstead Heath]], Well Walk and Haverstock Hill. Harry and Judith are killed in Hampstead Heath, behind The Pryors on East Heath Road. Before David kills them, Harry and Judith get out of the taxi on East Heath Road at Well Walk.

More recently [[Kenwood House]] is the set of the "''film-within-the-film''" scene of ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' (1999). Outdoor scenes in ''[[The Wedding Date]]'' (2005), starring [[Debra Messing]], feature [[Parliament Hill Fields]] on the Heath, overlooking west London. Parliament Hill also features in ''[[Notes on a Scandal (film)|Notes on a Scandal]]'' (2006) together with the nearby areas of [[Gospel Oak]] and [[Camden Town]]. ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994) features the old Hampstead Town Hall on Haverstock Hill. The cult film ''[[Scenes of a Sexual Nature]]'' (2006) was filmed entirely on Hampstead Heath, covering various picturesque locations such as the 'Floating Gardens' and [[Kenwood House]].

A musical specifically focusing on the area, ''[[Les Bicyclettes de Belsize]]'' (1968), tells the story of a young man's cycle journey around Hampstead. After crashing into a billboard poster, he falls in love with the fashion model depicted on it.

==Demography==
