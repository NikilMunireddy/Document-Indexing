The '''Arizona Diamondbacks''', often shortened as the '''D-backs''', are an American [[professional baseball]] franchise based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The club competes in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West]] division. Since the team's inception in 1998, the franchise has played home games at [[Chase Field]], formerly known as Bank One Ballpark. The [[Baseball park|ballpark]] was renamed in 2005, as a result of [[Bank One Corporation]]'s merger with [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase & Co.]] The Diamondbacks have won one [[World Series]] championship (in [[2001 World Series|2001]]), becoming the fastest [[expansion team]] in the Major Leagues to win a championship, doing it in only the fourth season since [[1998 Major League Baseball expansion|the franchise's inception]] in the [[1998 Major League Baseball season]].

==Franchise history==
{{Main|History of the Arizona Diamondbacks}}

On March 9, 1995, Arizona was [[1998 Major League Baseball expansion|awarded a franchise]] to begin play for the 1998 season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball Expansion Teams Put in Leagues|date=January 17, 1997|newspaper=Southeastern Missourian}}</ref>

Since their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five [[National League West]] titles, one National League Championship pennant, and the [[2001 World Series]].

==Logos==
The Diamondbacks' original colors were [[purple]], [[black]], [[teal (color)|teal]] and [[copper (color)|copper]].<ref name="purplesedonared">{{cite press release|title=D-backs shed their skin after unveiling new uniforms, colors on runway|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061108&content_id=1737471&vkey=pr_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari|publisher=Arizona Diamondbacks|date=November 8, 2006|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref> Their first logo was an italicized block letter "A" with a diamond pattern, and the crossbar represented by a snake's tongue. Prior to their inaugural season, they released their baseball caps. The home cap had a cream color crown with a purple visor and button. The road cap was black and had a turquoise visor and button. Their alternate cap had a turquoise crown with a purple visor and button. Depending on the cap, the "A" logo on the front of the cap had different color variations.

In the Diamondbacks' second season, they introduced a new logo which was a copper color snake in the shape of a letter "D". It was used on a solid black cap, which in the beginning, was worn as a road cap.

The franchise unveiled new uniforms and colors of Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black on November 8, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs unveil new colors, new look|url=http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/1737540/|publisher=Arizona Diamondbacks|date=November 8, 2006|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref> The [[red]] shade is named for the [[sandstone]] [[canyon]] at [[Red Rock State Park]] near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], while the [[beige]] (sand) shade is named for the [[Sonoran Desert]].<ref name="purplesedonared"/> A sleeve patch was added featuring a lowercase "d" and "b" configured to look like a snake's head.<ref name="purplesedonared"/> The team also kept the "D" logo, but was slightly altered and put on an all red cap to be used as their game cap. They also kept the "A" logo with the new colors applied to it, with a solid black cap used as the alternate cap. A similar color scheme is currently used by the [[Arizona Coyotes]] of the [[National Hockey League]].

==Media==
The primary television play-by-play voice for the team's first nine seasons of play was [[Thom Brennaman]], who also broadcasts baseball and [[college football]] games nationally for [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Television]]. Brennaman was the TV announcer for the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (along with his father [[Marty Brennaman]]) before being hired by Diamondbacks founder Jerry Colangelo in 1996, two years before the team would begin play.

In October 2006, Brennaman left the Diamondbacks to call games with his father for the Reds beginning in 2007, signing a four-year deal (his FOX duties remained unchanged).

The English language flagship radio station is [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]]. [[Greg Schulte]] is the regular radio play-by-play voice, a 25-year veteran of sports radio in the Phoenix market, also well known for his previous work on [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[Arizona State University]] (ASU) broadcasts.

[[Jeff Munn]] is a backup radio play-by-play announcer; he served as the regular public address announcer at [[Chase Field]] in the early days of the franchise. He is well-known to many Phoenix area sports fans, having also served as the public address announcer for the Suns at America West Arena (now [[Talking Stick Resort Arena]]) in the 1990s. He is also the play-by-play radio voice for ASU women's basketball.

On November 1, 2006, the team announced that the TV voice of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] since 2002, [[Daron Sutton]], would be hired as the Diamondbacks primary TV play-by-play voice. Sutton was signed to a five-year contract with a team option for three more years. Sutton is considered one of the best of the younger generation of baseball broadcasters. His signature chants include "let's get some runs" when the D-backs trail in late innings. Sutton's father is [[Major League Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher and current [[Atlanta Braves]] broadcaster [[Don Sutton]].<ref name="mlb3">{{cite web|title=Sutton to broadcast Diamondbacks games on D-backs TV network, FOX Sports Net Arizona through 2011|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061101&content_id=1729190&vkey=pr_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari|publisher=Arizona Diamondbacks|date=November 1, 2006|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}</ref>

Former Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs first baseman [[Mark Grace]] and former Major League [[knuckleball]] pitcher [[Tom Candiotti]] were the Diamondbacks primary color analysts for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Former Diamondbacks third baseman [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] also did color commentary on occasion, as did former [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] and [[NBC]] broadcast legend [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.]], a longtime Phoenix-area resident and father of [[Joe Garagiola, Jr.]], the first GM of the Diamondbacks (as head of the Maricopa County Sports Authority in the early 1990s, Garagiola, Jr. was one of the primary people involved in Phoenix obtaining a Major League Baseball franchise).

The Diamondbacks announced in July 2007<ref>{{cite press release|title=FSN Arizona to become exclusive TV home for the D-backs starting next season|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070713&content_id=2084028&vkey=pr_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari|publisher=Arizona Diamondbacks|date=July 13, 2007|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}</ref> that for the 2008 season, all regionally broadcast Diamondbacks TV games will be shown exclusively on [[Fox Sports Arizona]], and a few could possibly be shown on the national [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox MLB]] telecasts. Fox Sports Arizona (or FS Arizona) is currently seen in 2.8&nbsp;million households in Arizona and New Mexico. The previous flagship station, since the inaugural 1998 season, was [[KTVK]], a popular over-the-air independent station (and former longtime [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate) in Phoenix.

From 2009 to 2012, Mark Grace and Daron Sutton were tagged as the main broadcasters of the Diamondbacks with pre-game and postgame shows on Fox Sports Arizona, being hosted by former big-league closer [[Joe Borowski (baseball)|Joe Borowski]].

On June 21, 2012, Daron Sutton was suspended indefinitely, amid rumors of insubordination.<ref>{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=Arizona Diamondbacks SS Stephen Drew's ankle holds up|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/20120627arizona-diamondbacks-ss-stephen-drews-ankle-holds-up.html|publisher=''[[The Arizona Republic]]''|date=June 27, 2012|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref> Then on August 24, the team announced that Mark Grace had requested an indefinite leave of absence after being arrested for his second DUI in less than two years <ref>{{cite web|last=Boivin|first=Paola|title=Arizona Diamondbacks hit hard again in the public eye|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20120824arizona-diamondbacks-hit-hard-again-public-eye.html|publisher=''The Arizona Republic''|date=August 24, 2012|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref> (Grace was later indicted on four DUI counts<ref>{{cite web|last=Merrill|first=Laurie|title=Mark Grace indicted on 4 DUI counts|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20121025mark-grace-indicted-dui-counts.html|publisher=''The Arizona Republic''|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>). For the remainder of the 2012 season, Sutton was replaced by Greg Schulte (Jeff Munn replaced Schulte on the radio broadcast) and Grace was replaced by Luis Gonzalez. At the end of the 2012 season, the team announced that neither Sutton nor Grace would be returning for the 2013 season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=Diamondbacks announce Mark Grace and Daron Sutton will not return to the broadcast booth|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20121004arizona-diamondbacks-daron-sutton-mark-grace.html|publisher=''The Arizona Republic''|date=October 4, 2012|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}</ref>

On October 18, 2012, the team announced that [[Bob Brenly]] would be returning as a broadcaster, and that he would be joined by then-[[ESPN]] personality [[Steve Berthiaume]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=Arizona Diamondbacks name Steve Berthiaume, Bob Brenly as TV announcing team|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20121018arizona-diamondbacks-announcers-bob-brenly-steve-berthiaume.html|publisher=''The Arizona Republic''|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>

===Spanish broadcasts===
The flagship Spanish language radio station is [[KBMB]] AM 710 with Miguel Quintana, Richard Saenz and Oscar Soria.

Games were televised in Spanish on [[KPHE-LD|KPHE-LP]]—with Oscar Soria and Jerry Romo as the announcers—but this arrangement ended prior to the 2009 season due to the team switching fully to [[Fox Sports Arizona]] and the lack of carriage of KHPE-LP on the Cox cable system.<ref name="azc1">{{cite web|last=Piecoro|first=Nick|title=No Spanish TV broadcasts for D-Backs|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2009/01/22/20090122spt-dbackstv.html|publisher=''The Arizona Republic''|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}</ref>
