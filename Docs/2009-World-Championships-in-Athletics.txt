===Anti-doping program===
The event featured one of the most comprehensive anti-doping initiatives ever undertaken by the IAAF. A total of 1000 samples were collected from athletes and tested at labs accredited by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], and additional educational anti-doping activities were available. Diack stressed that samples are retained for future analysis, thus currently undetectable drugs could be tested for in the future, preventing athletes from flouting the anti-doping rules.<ref>[http://berlin.iaaf.org/news/kind=101/newsid=52653.html Berlin to host largest ever IAAF Anti-Doping operation].
