{{nihongo|'''Honshu'''|[[wikt:本州|本州]]|Honshū|literally "Main Island" or "Main Province"}} ({{IPA-ja|hoɴꜜɕɯᵝː||ja-Honshu.ogg}}) is the largest and most populous island of [[Japan]],<ref name="Britannica">{{Cite web|title=Honshu|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Honshu|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref> located south of [[Hokkaido]] across the [[Tsugaru Strait]], north of [[Shikoku]] across the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]], and northeast of [[Kyushu]] across the [[Kanmon Straits]]. The island separates the [[Sea of Japan]], which lies to its north and west, from the [[North Pacific Ocean]] to its south and east. It is the seventh [[list of islands by area|largest island]] in the world, and the second [[list of islands by population|most populous]] after [[Java]].<ref name="JPCensus">[http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/jichi_gyousei/c-gyousei/daityo/index.html Japan Civil Registry Database 2013]</ref><ref>See [http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/2000/final/hyodai.htm Japan Census of 2000]; The editors of [[List of islands by population]] appear to have used similar data from the relevant statistics bureaux, and totalled up the various administrative districts that make up each island, and then done the same for less populous islands. An editor of this article has not repeated that work. Therefore this plausible and eminently reasonable ranking is posted as unsourced [[Wikipedia:Common knowledge|common knowledge]].</ref>

Honshu had a population of 103 million {{As of|2005|lc=y}},{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} mostly concentrated in the coastal lowlands, notably in the [[Kantō region|Kantō plain]] where 25% of the total population resides in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As the historical center of Japanese culture and political power,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including [[Kyoto]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], and [[Kamakura]]. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the [[Taiheiyō Belt]], a [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] that spans several of the Japanese islands.

Most of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from [[Tokyo]] to [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagoya]], [[Kobe]], and [[Hiroshima]];{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} by contrast, the economy along the northwestern Sea of Japan coast is largely based on fishing and agriculture.<ref>''[[Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan]]''</ref> The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. Its climate is humid and mild.

==Geography==
The island is roughly {{convert|1300|km}} long and ranges from {{convert|50|to|230|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, and its total area is {{convert|227962.59|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}, 60% of the total area of Japan,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} making it slightly larger than Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islands by land area|url=http://islands.unep.ch/Tiarea.htm|publisher=UN SYSTEM-WIDE EARTHWATCH|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> Its land area has been increasing with [[land reclamation]] and coastal uplift in the north, but global [[sea level rise]] has diminished these effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Honshu has {{convert|5450|km|0}} of coastline.<ref name="Britannica" />

Mountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923, and the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake of March 2011]] moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as {{convert|5.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Map of Horizontal Land Movement caused by 2011/3/11 M9.0 earthquake|url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/common/000059672.pdf|date=March 19, 2011|publisher=[[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]]|accessdate=15 November 2012|language=Japanese|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="Deutsche Welle">{{cite news|title=Quake shifted Japan by over two meters|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14909967,00.html|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=March 14, 2011|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}</ref> while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano [[Mount Fuji]] at {{convert|3776|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, which makes Honshu the world's [[List of islands by highest point|7th highest island]]. There are many rivers, including the [[Shinano River]], Japan's longest. The [[Japanese Alps]] run the length of Honshu, dividing the northwestern (Sea of Japan) shore from the southeastern (Pacific or Inland Sea) shore; the climate is generally [[humid subtropical]] in the southern and coastal parts of the island and [[humid continental]] in the northern and inland portions.

===Extreme points===
The northernmost point on Honshu is the tip of the [[Shimokita Peninsula]] in [[Ōma, Aomori]]; Cape Kure lies at the southern extreme in [[Kushimoto, Wakayama]]. The island's eastern extremity is Todogasaki in [[Miyako, Iwate]], and its western one is Bishanohana in [[Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi]]. Honshu spans more than eight degrees of latitude and 11 degrees of longitude.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Bridges and tunnels===
Honshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku by tunnels or bridges. Three bridge systems have been built across the islands of the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku ([[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] and the [[Ōnaruto Bridge]]; [[Shin-Onomichi Bridge]], [[Innoshima Bridge]], [[Ikuchi Bridge]], [[Tatara Bridge]], [[Ōmishima Bridge]], [[Hakata–Ōshima Bridge]], and the [[Kurushima-Kaikyō Bridge]]; [[Shimotsui-Seto Bridge]], [[Hitsuishijima Bridge]], [[Iwakurojima Bridge]], [[Yoshima Bridge]], [[Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge]], and the [[Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge]]), the [[Seikan Tunnel]] connects Honshu with Hokkaido, and the [[Kanmonkyo Bridge]] and [[Kanmon Tunnel]] connects Honshu with Kyushu.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Administrative regions and prefectures==
The island is divided into five nominal regions and contains 34 prefectures, including metropolitan Tokyo. Administratively, some smaller islands are included within these prefectures, notably including the [[Ogasawara Islands]], [[Sado Island]], [[Izu Ōshima]], and [[Awaji Island]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The regions are: 
*'''[[Tōhoku region|Tōhoku]]''' &mdash; [[Aomori Prefecture]], [[Iwate Prefecture]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]], [[Akita Prefecture]], [[Yamagata Prefecture]], [[Fukushima Prefecture]]
*'''[[Kantō region|Kantō]]''' &mdash; [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], [[Tochigi Prefecture]], [[Gunma Prefecture]], [[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], [[Tokyo]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]
*'''[[Chūbu region|Chūbu]]''' &mdash; [[Niigata Prefecture]], [[Toyama Prefecture]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], [[Fukui Prefecture]], [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], [[Nagano Prefecture]], [[Gifu Prefecture]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], [[Aichi Prefecture]]
*'''[[Kansai]]''' &mdash; [[Mie Prefecture]], [[Shiga Prefecture]], [[Kyoto Prefecture]], [[Osaka Prefecture]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Wakayama Prefecture]]
*'''[[Chūgoku region]]''' &mdash; [[Tottori Prefecture]], [[Shimane Prefecture]], [[Okayama Prefecture]], [[Hiroshima Prefecture]], [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]]

== Natural features ==

=== Minerals ===
Yields of zinc, copper, and oil have been found on Honshu.<ref name="Hoshu">{{Cite web|url = http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/world/honshu.html|title = Honshu|date = 2012|accessdate = 2014-11-23|website = infoplease.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
Most of Japan's tea and silk is from Honshu. Fruits, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton are grown in Honshu.<ref name="Hoshu"/> [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]] is noted as an important producer of rice. The Kantō and Nōbi plains produce rice and vegetables. Yamanashi is a major fruit-growing area, and Aomori is famous for its apples.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
