The '''Indian subcontinent''' or the '''subcontinent''' is a southern [[region]] of [[Asia]], mostly situated on the [[Indian Plate]] and projecting southwards into the [[Indian Ocean]] from the [[Himalayas]]. Definitions of the extent of the Indian subcontinent differ but it usually includes the core lands of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]];<ref name=Oxford>"Indian subcontinent". ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' (ISBN 0-19-860441-6) New York: Oxford University Press, 2001; p. 929: "the part of Asia south of the Himalayas which forms a peninsula extending into the Indian Ocean, between the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Historically forming the whole territory of [[Greater India]], the region is now divided between [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]]."</ref> [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[Maldives]] are often included as well. The region is also called by a number of other names including [[South Asia]], a name that is increasingly popular in academia and the US.<ref name=sugata/><ref name=inden/><ref name=mittal/>

In dictionary entries, the term subcontinent signifies "having a certain geographical or political independence" from the rest of the continent or "a vast and more or less self-contained subdivision of a continent."<ref>''[http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/ Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]'', Merriam-Webster, 2002.

Whether called the Indian subcontinent or South Asia, the definition of the geographical extent of this region varies. [[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], it had formed the whole territory of [[Greater India]],<ref name="mittal"/><ref name="Kathleen M page 10"/> and now it generally comprises the countries of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]].<ref name=Oxford />  Prior to 1947, the three nations were historically combined and constituted [[British India]].

Historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Tablot have criticized the use of the Indian subcontinent, excluding [[Afghanistan]], as the basis of Indian history. They note that Afghanistan and even parts of Central Asia were included in a polity based in South Asia several times in history and the cultural impact of Indian civilization was felt in these areas. The use of the subcontinent is excessively influenced by the legacy of British colonialism in their view.<ref name="AsherTalbot2006">{{citation|last1=Asher|first1=Catherine B.|last2=Talbot|first2=Cynthia|title=India Before Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC|date=2006-03-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80904-7|pp=7–8}}</ref>
