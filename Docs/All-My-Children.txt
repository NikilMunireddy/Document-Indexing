'''''All My Children''''' (often<!-- Per other soap pages --> shortened to '''''AMC''''')<!-- STOP...do NOT change to 'was' --> is<!-- NOTE-remains as "is" per Wikipedia convention; see [[WP:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Lead paragraphs]]. --> an American television [[soap opera]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for 41 years, from January 5, 1970, to September 23, 2011, and on [[The Online Network]] (TOLN) from April 29, 2013, to September 2, 2013, via [[Hulu]], [[Hulu Plus]], and [[iTunes]]. Created by [[Agnes Nixon]], ''All My Children'' is set in Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, a fictional suburb of [[Philadelphia]], which is modeled on the actual Philadelphia suburb of [[Rosemont, Pennsylvania|Rosemont]]. The original series featured [[Susan Lucci]] as [[Erica Kane]], one of daytime's most popular characters.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|author =H.W.

''All My Children'' was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1975.<ref>Wakefield, D: "All Her Children", page 115. Doubleday & Company, 1976<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> The series started at a half-hour in per-installment length, then was expanded to a full hour on April 25, 1977. Earlier, the show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' premiered.

From 1970 to 1990, ''All My Children'' was recorded at ABC's TV18 at 101 West 67th St, now a 50-story apartment tower. From March 1990 to December 2009, it was taped at ABC's television studio TV23 at 320 West 66th Street in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York]]. In December 2009, the locale for taping the series moved from Manhattan to less costly [[Los Angeles, California]]. The show was then produced in Stages 1 and 2 at the Andrita Studios in [[Los Angeles, California]] from 2010 to 2011, and then at the Connecticut Film Center in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].<ref name="Soapcentral.com Relocate">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2009/0803-moving_02.php|title=Rumor no more: All My Children relocating to Los Angeles|publisher=[[SoapCentral]]|date=August 4, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://sn.soapnet.go.com/news/article/huge-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-news Huge "All My Children" and "One Life to Live" News], ''SOAPnet'', August 4, 2009</ref> ''All My Children'' started taping in high definition on January 4, 2010, and began airing in high definition on February 3, 2010.

At one point, the program's popularity positioned it as the most widely recorded television show in the United States. Also, in a departure from societal norms at the time, ''All My Children'', in the mid-1970s, had an audience that was estimated to be 30% male.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913850-5,00.html Sex and Suffering in the Afternoon], TIME</ref> The show ranked No. 1 in the [[List of US daytime soap opera ratings|daytime Nielsen ratings]] in the 1978–79 season. Throughout most of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, ''All My Children'' was the No. 2 daytime soap opera on the air. However, like the rest of the soap operas in the United States, ''All My Children'' experienced unprecedented declines in its daytime ratings during the 2000s. By the 2010s, it had become one of the least watched soap operas in daytime television.

On April 14, 2011, it was announced that ABC canceled ''All My Children'' after 41 years on the air due to low ratings.<ref name="hollywoodreporter.com">[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/abc-cancels-all-my-children-178666 ABC Cancels "All My Children", "One Life to Live"], ''Hollywood Reporter'', April 14, 2011</ref> On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of ''All My Children'' to third-party production company [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]] with the show set to continue on the internet as a series of [[webisode]]s.<ref name="ABC and Prospect Park ">{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/one-life-to-live/OLTL-licensing-announcement |title=One Life to Live announcement |publisher=ABC Network |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121021045607/http://abc.go.com/shows/one-life-to-live/OLTL-licensing-announcement |archivedate=October 21, 2012 }}</ref> The show taped its final scenes for ABC on August 30, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on September 23, 2011 with a [[cliffhanger]].

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[Agnes Nixon]], then head writer for ''[[Guiding Light|The Guiding Light]]'', first came up with the idea for ''All My Children'' in the 1960s. When writing the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]], she designed the show so it would be a light-hearted soap opera that focused on social issues and young love.<ref name="Worlds Without End">{{cite book|first1=Ron|last1=Simon|first2=Robert J.|last2=Thompson|first3=Louise|last3=Spence|first4=Jane|last4=Feuer|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Morton|title=Worlds Without End: The Art and History of the Soap Opera|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|location=New York City|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8109-3997-4|pages= 34–36}}</ref> She unsuccessfully attempted to sell the series to [[NBC]], then to [[CBS]], and once again to NBC through [[Procter & Gamble]].<ref name="The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television">{{cite book|first=Wesley|last1=Hyatt| title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television|publisher=Billboard Books |location=New York City|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8230-8315-2|pages=13–18}}</ref> When Procter & Gamble was unable to make room for the show in its lineup, Nixon put ''All My Children'' on hold.

Nixon became [[head writer]] for ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' in 1965, and decided to use a few ideas from her ''All My Children'' bible. In one specific case, she used the model of the [[Erica Kane]] character to create a brand new ''Another World'' character named [[Rachel Cory Hutchins|Rachel Davis]]. Nixon said Rachel was Erica's "precursor to the public … [What] Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they'd be satisfied ...But that dream has been elusive", Nixon said.<ref>Simon, p. 28.</ref><ref>Hyatt, p. 29.</ref>

=== Creation ===
ABC later approached her to create a show that would reflect a more contemporary tone. That program became ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and it debuted in 1968. After the show became a success, the network asked her for another program, and she obliged by reviving her ''All My Children'' bible and the Erica Kane character.

The poem, written by Nixon, that appears in the title credits' photo album reads: {{quote|The Great and the Least,<br />
The Rich and the Poor,<br />
The Weak and the Strong,<br />
In Sickness and in Health,<br />
In Joy and Sorrow,<br />
In Tragedy and Triumph,<br />
You are ALL MY CHILDREN|}}

=== 1970s ===
[[File:Ruth Warwick Phoebe Tyler 1973.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ruth Warrick as Phoebe Tyler]]
''All My Children'' debuted on January 5, 1970. [[Rosemary Prinz]] was signed on to be the "special guest star" for six months, playing the role of policial activist Amy Tyler. Prinz was well known for her role of Penny Hughes on ''As the World Turns'' in the 1950s and 1960s, and she was added to the show to give it an initial boost due to her name value. From 1970 and into the 1980s, the show was either written by Nixon herself or by her protégé, [[Wisner Washam]]. He was groomed by Nixon to eventually take over the reins in the 1980s while she focused on other endeavors, which included creating and launching ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' in 1983. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Nixon strove to create a soap opera that was topical and could illustrate social issues for the audience.<ref name="NIXON">{{cite web |title=NIXON, AGNES. U.S. Writer-Producer|work=museum.tv|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nixonagnes/nixonagnes.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713081129/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nixonagnes/nixonagnes.htm|archivedate=July 13, 2007|deadurl=no}}</ref> She wanted this and a combination of regular humor for the series. To keep the action more real, she allowed the audience to locate her fictional "Pine Valley" on a map: situated a mere hour-long train ride from New York City. Many believed Pine Valley was in New York because of a town called [[Catlin, New York|Pine Valley]] in [[western New York]]. However, it was not until the 1980s that it was finally revealed that Pine Valley is actually in Pennsylvania, near [[Philadelphia]] and also near ''[[One Life to Live]]'s'' [[Llanview]]. (Nixon reportedly modeled the town on Rosemont, an actual suburb of Philadelphia.) {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The show's first action takes place around several families and characters. [[Phoebe Tyler Wallingford|Phoebe Tyler]] ([[Ruth Warrick]]), who fashions herself as "Queen of Pine Valley," was the paradigm of a rich snob when she is introduced. A divorced mother, [[Mona Kane]] ([[Frances Heflin]]), and her spoiled daughter, [[Erica Kane|Erica]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) were also introduced. Contrasting this was the stable [[Joe Martin (All My Children character)|Martin family]], headed by patriarch Joe and later (after the death of her husband, Ted Brent) by matriarch Ruth, who became a symbolic foundation of ''All My Children''. Destined to break up the young romance of classmates [[Tara Martin]] ([[Karen Lynn Gorney]]) and Phil Brent ([[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]]), Erica learned that Phil was not the son of Ruth and Ted but, instead, the son of Ruth's sister, Amy Tyler ([[Rosemary Prinz]]) and her mother's friend, Nick Davis. In a selfish attempt to break up Phil and Tara, she told everyone the truth.

''All My Children'''s first success was its telling of young love. ABC wanted a soap opera that would bring in young viewers, and slowly the program was accomplishing that.<ref name="NIXON" /> The show's ratings did not start out strong, however. In its first year on the air, it ranked No. 17 out of 19 soap operas. Despite this, its audience was building with each passing year.

The show was unique for its use of the [[Vietnam War]]. Before ''All My Children'' debuted, no show had discussed the war in any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests against the war in the early 1970s. The character's protest speech in 1972 won [[Mary Fickett]] the first [[Emmy Award]] given to a soap opera performer. Later in the show's run, Phoebe softened.

In May 1972, the character of Erica Kane Martin became the first television character to undergo a legal abortion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Life Can Be Beautiful/Relevant|last=Astrachan|first=Anthony|date=March 23, 1975|work=New York Times Times}}</ref>
Making the abortion particularly controversial is Erica's reason for doing it, not because of her jeopardized health, but rather because she did not want to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story received much media attention, especially since it preceded the Roe vs. Wade decision by nearly a year. Within the story, Erica developed a potentially fatal infection, which was later determined to be [[toxoplasmosis]] after having the abortion, and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character's case.

Phoebe's husband Charles ([[Hugh Franklin (actor)|Hugh Franklin]]) became close to Mona (Erica's mother and his secretary at the hospital). The two fell in love and Charles divorced Phoebe, even though she tried to blackmail Mona and even faked [[paralysis]]. In the end, Phoebe was left a drunken divorcée and Mona becomes the new Mrs. Tyler. This ordeal starts the long-time Phoebe/Mona rivalry.

When Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, contemplated a facelift, she talked it over with Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, she was going to look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin ([[William Mooney]]). Margo's facelift in 1974 became one of the first major storylines on television discussing [[plastic surgery]] and its psychological effects.

In June 1976, character [[Brooke English]] showed up on her Aunt Phoebe's doorstep and soon clashed with Erica over [[Tom Cudahy]] and Mark Dalton.  In 1976, when Kitty Shea Tyler was searching for her natural mother, the show introduced [[Myrtle Fargate|Myrtle Lum Fargate]] ([[Eileen Herlie]]).

By the late 1970s, the show had risen to the top of the ratings. One reason for the rise was the arrival of teenage prostitute Donna Beck (Candice Earley). Her relationship with the handsome Dr. Chuck Tyler breathed life into the show and captivated fans. Other new additions are the arrivals of aristocratic [[Palmer Cortlandt]] (aka Peter Cooney) ([[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]]), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock ([[Elizabeth Lawrence (actress)|Elizabeth Lawrence]]), and his overprotected daughter Nina ([[Taylor Miller]]), who, to Palmer's chagrin, entrances [[Cliff Warner|Dr. Cliff Warner]] ([[Peter Bergman]]). Palmer does everything in his power to break up the couple, including telling Nina she is going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teams up with Cliff's past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne (Linda Gibboney), who confronts Cliff about fathering her son, but this is temporary; Sybil is murdered and Cliff is arrested for the crime, which actually was committed by Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert). During the murder trial, Nina is astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt ([[Gillian Spencer]]), whom she believes to be dead, is, in fact, alive and living in Pine Valley as Monique Jonville. To everyone's complete shock, Myra acknowledges that Daisy to be her daughter. ''All My Children'' also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle ([[Matthew Cowles]]) and Ray Gardner.

All My Children had always aired in color since its 1970 debut. The episodes were initially only saved for a short time on cartridge tapes and were eventually erased in order to tape other productions. Beginning in 1976, all the episodes were saved on cartridge tape and then digitally since the late 1990s. A few early episodes were saved on [[kinescope]] in black and white, one of which aired on ABC in 1997 on a special "A Daytime To Remember". But there are no known pre-1976 episodes to be still in existence on tape.

=== 1980s ===
The early '80s is considered to have been a "golden period" for the show and the "Golden Age" for [[supercouple]]s.<ref name="NIXON" /><ref name=".amazon.com">{{cite web|first=Bill and Susan|last=Hayes|title=Like Sands Through The Hourglass|publisher=NAL Hardcover|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0451216601}}</ref><ref name="soapoperadigest.com">{{cite web|first=Janet|last=Di Lauro|title=Supercouples: A Relic From the '80s or Still Alive and Kissing?|publisher=soapoperadigest.com|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=http://soapoperadigest.com/features/supercouples/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906220936/http://soapoperadigest.com/features/supercouples|archivedate=September 6, 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Younger characters, such as [[Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner]] ([[Laurence Lau]] and [[Kim Delaney]]), [[Liza Colby]] ([[Marcy Walker]]), Liza's best friend Amanda ([[Amanda Bearse]]), [[Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter]] ([[Darnell Williams]] and [[Debbi Morgan]]), and a now-grown-up [[Tad Martin (All My Children)|Tad Martin]] ([[Michael E.

The storyline involving Liza plotting to win Greg back after he leaves her for Jenny became a fan favorite, as was the Greg and Jenny and Jesse and Angie pairings.<ref name="NIXON" /><ref name="Amatangelo">{{cite news|first=Amy|last=Amatangelo|title=Daytime's ’80s 'supercouple' returns to ‘All My Children’|publisher=''[[The Boston Herald]]''|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=2008-01-20|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/general/view.bg?articleid=1067034}}</ref> Jesse and Jenny's summer in New York City became regarded as one of the greatest storylines in the history of the series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hot Plot's: AMC's Top Summer Storylines|publisher=''[[Soap Opera Digest]]''|accessdate=2007-07-07|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/all-my-children/articles/amcsummer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906220850/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/all-my-children/articles/amcsummer|archivedate=September 6, 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Meanwhile, the legend of "Tad the Cad" is born when Tad takes Liza's [[virginity]], then simultaneously begins having sex with her mother, socialite [[Marian Colby Chandler|Marian Colby]] ([[Jennifer Bassey]]), who eventually is sent to prison.

For older appeal, Jenny and Tad's natural mother Opal ([[Dorothy Lyman]]) was also added to the canvas, where she opens the Glamorama salon and spa. Opal greatly showcased ''All My Children''’s attempt at humor and satire. Also introduced in the 1980s were powerful businessman [[Adam Chandler]] and his identical twin brother [[Stuart Chandler|Stuart]] (both played by [[David Canary]]), the first arrival of members of the [[Chandler family]]. Adam became cited as one of the "most powerful male figures in television",<ref name="Jenkins">{{cite book|author1=Henry Jenkins |author2=Tara McPherson |author3=Jane Shattuc |title=Hop on Pop: The Politics and Pleasures of Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_u5Pqx1DBkgC&pg=PA61&dq=Hop+on+Pop:+The+Politics+and+Pleasures+of+Popular+Culture+Adam+Chandler|isbn=0-8223-2737-6|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|page=792 pages (specific page)}}</ref><ref name="Mansour">{{cite book|author =David Mansour|title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0740751182|isbn= 978-0-7407-5118-9|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=2005|page=560}}</ref> which was contrasted by Stuart's kind, generous, and honest personality.

Erica began to take on a larger-than-life role by the 1980s. This is evident with her writing an autobiography, "Raising Kane", and turning it into a motion picture. When her presumed half-sister Silver (Deborah Goodrich) accuses her of murdering Kent Bogard (Michael Woods, Lee Godart), her former lover and boss, she goes on the run, fleeing to the [[Hollywood Hills]]. She does all this while posing as a [[nun]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The show made its first attempt at tackling the taboo topic of homosexuality in 1983. [[Tricia Pursley]] portrayed the divorced Devon McFadden, who believes she is falling in love with her [[lesbian]] psychiatrist, Lynn Carson (portrayed by [[Donna Pescow]]).<ref name="goliath.ecnext.com">{{cite book|author =C.

Lynn however rebuffs her. Before this storyline, no other American soap opera had done a story about homosexuality.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com />

The show tackled the issue of drug use when [[Mark La Mura]]'s character, [[Mark Dalton (All My Children)|Mark Dalton]], becomes addicted to cocaine after years of casual use. His half-sister, Erica, stages an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practice a [[tough love]]-policy that has Mark admit to the addiction. The informative episode showed how to hold an intervention, and the stages to go through for a successful confrontation. On March 18, 1985, the episode of ''All My Children'' included the scene while [[Erica Kane]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) met and became friends with [[Stephen J. Cannell]], the writer, creator, and producer of drama shows ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Riptide (American TV series)|Riptide]]'', ''[[Hunter (U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'', and ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''.

Controversy was prompted in 1987 with the arrival of Cindy Parker ([[Ellen Wheeler]]), who would later fall in love with Stuart. The character was revealed to have [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, [[Skye Chandler]]. The tragedy of the attack shows the extremes of violence that occur every day to victims of the disease. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most watched episodes. ABC wanted changes at ''All My Children''. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but there sentiment that the program had lost its unique sense of humor and was simply copying other soaps with [[action/adventure]] storylines. Efforts were made to bring the show back to the glory days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

[[Felicia Minei Behr]] was hired as the new executive producer in early 1989. Having been a producer on [[Ryan's Hope]], Behr was familiar with ''All My Children'', having been an associate producer from 1970 to 1975. Among the stories featured was a baby storyline involving the characters of Adam, Brooke, Tad, and Dixie ([[Cady McClain]]). By this time, the show had also found a "hit couple" in Cecily and Nico (portrayed by [[Rosa Nevin]] and [[Maurice Benard]]), but Behr was unable to convince either to remain with the show, and the duo left at the end of 1989.

ABC was pleased with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her creation was safe in the hands of the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman's departure was particularly frustrating to Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman's departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' that she felt it was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired [[Jill Larson]]. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.

=== 1990s ===
At the time of Behr's hiring in early 1989, the show usually ranked around No. 4 in the ratings. By 1990, it had inched up to the No. 3 spot. Billy Clyde Tuggle returns to Pine Valley in 1990, after a ten-year absence (in prison). He proceeds to undo the lives of many in Pine Valley. He tells his daughter, Emily Ann Sago, that he is her natural father, devastating her with the truth that she was the product of rape. He dies tumbling over a bridge (with Tad Martin), ending the reign of one of Pine Valley's most evil and entertaining characters ever.

ABC chose [[Megan McTavish]], a former actress who had been on the writing team since 1987, to be its new head writer. She was officially promoted to that position in 1992, with Nixon serving as executive head writer. Stories such as Molly's leukemia, Ceara Connor's ([[Genie Francis]]) [[incest]], Mona's lung cancer, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in soap opera magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included the ''Who Killed Will Cortlandt?'' mystery, Willow Lake Acres (a both humorous and serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado that rocked Pine Valley. Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica's father, Eric Kane. It was revealed he had faked his own death. In a comical twist, Erica finds him working as a clown in a traveling circus.

McTavish was also instrumental in a major but still popular [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, the audience soon learns [[Kendall Hart]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is actually Erica's long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father's actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her baby up for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica's approval<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinback|first1=Sheila|title=Star of the Year 1994: AMC's Sarah Michelle Gellar|journal=Soap Opera Magazine|date=January 24, 1994}}</ref> but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being 'abandoned' at birth and comes to want payback against her mother.<ref name="Tracy">{{cite book|author =Kathleen Tracy|title=The Girl's Got Bite: The Original Unauthorized Guide to Buffy's World ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlE1_oTihcUC&pg=PA63&dq=Kendall+Hart+soap+opera|isbn=0-312-31258-X|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2003|page=384}}</ref> Though they try to make their family work at first, Kendall acts out <ref>{{cite journal|title=Editor's Choice|journal=Soap Opera Digest|date=February 15, 1994}}</ref> and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during this time in the series. The popular Gellar was proclaimed by some "as the second coming of Erica"<ref name="Tracy" /> in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993–1995 but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities. Producers ended up waiting at least six years before even contemplating to recast the role (which eventually went to [[Alicia Minshew]] in 2002).

The Santos, Dillon, Frye, and Keefer families were introduced during the 90s as well. Also, the [[Tad Martin and Dixie Cooney|Tad and Dixie]] pairing had become especially popular.<ref name="West1">{{cite news|first=Abby|last=West|title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Tad and Dixie|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=2008-01-29|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_15,00.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164527/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_15,00.html| archivedate= February 1, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The show also had other couples with great followings during this time: [[Dimitri Marick and Erica Kane|Dimitri and Erica]] ([[Michael Nader]]),<ref name="West2">{{cite news|first=Abby|last=West|title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Erica and Dimitri|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=2008-01-29|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_10,00.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164501/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_10,00.html| archivedate= February 1, 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref> Trevor ([[James Kiberd]]) and Natalie ([[Kate Collins (actress)|Kate Collins]]), and Hayley ([[Kelly Ripa]]) and Brian (Gregory Gordon, [[Matt Borlenghi]], Brian L. Greene).

By the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's storytelling received criticism for being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines and the direction of the series. After the [[O.J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]] preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and ''All My Children'' was no different. When Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer [[Lorraine Broderick]] was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.

Broderick's tenure under Behr was popular among critics and fans for returning ''All My Children'' to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Her most significant successes were Erica's drug addiction story (with the character receiving treatment at the [[Betty Ford Center]]), and also the story of [[homophobia]] over a gay high school boy and a history teacher.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com /> However, with the ratings still stagnant, ABC did not renew longtime executive producer Felicia Minei Behr's contract, and brought in [[Francesca James]] (who had previously won an Emmy award acting on the show as twins Kitty and Kelly). The storylines now included a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] arc with the popular [[Julia Santos|Noah and Julia]] ([[Keith Hamilton Cobb]] and [[Sydney Penny]]), a fantasy story for Myrtle featuring the "real" [[Santa Claus]], and finally a baby kidnapping story involving Erica.

Despite winning three consecutive Daytime Emmys for writing during her tenure on ''All My Children'', Broderick was replaced in December 1997 by her predecessor, McTavish. The first major story McTavish tackled was, "ironically", one created by Broderick, [[Bianca Montgomery]]'s [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]. The character of Bianca, Erica's young daughter, is checked into a facility to treat the disease. Apart from the anorexia story, McTavish's tales were plot-driven<ref name="sympatico.msn.ca">{{cite news|first=Nelson|last=Branco|title=The plot to save ‘All My Children’: New head writers Barbara Esensten and James Harmon Brown dish on recasting Babe, Dixie's death, and creating a diverse canvas|publisher=''[[TV Guide]]''|accessdate=2007-11-06|url=http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/The+plot+to+save+All+My+Children/TV_Guide/Soaps/Features/Articles/070823_all_my_children_NB.htm?isfa=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013233937/http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/The+plot+to+save+All+My+Children/TV_Guide/Soaps/Features/Articles/070823_all_my_children_NB.htm?isfa=1  |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}</ref> and made implausible alterations to the show's history such as the resurrection of Erica's lifetime-love, Mike Roy (Nicholas Surovy). In 1998, the show again got a new executive producer, [[Jean Dadario Burke]], taking over from [[Francesca James]]. She would become known to many speculating fans as a weak producer with little vision.

[[Cady McClain]], who had left the show as Dixie in 1996, returned to the delight of her fans, but other storylines—involving ghosts, poison tattoos, Nazi art, and a sperm switch—were all ill-received. By the start of 1999, with ''All My Children'' being voted as the "Worst of 1998" by ''Soap Opera Digest'', McTavish was once again fired. As ratings began to fall, ABC convinced Nixon to make a brief return. Many long-running actors, such as [[Michael Nader]], [[James Kiberd]], and [[Robin Mattson]], left their roles.

=== 2000s ===
Nixon decided to write a story that would rejuvenate the show and be socially relevant at the same time. This resulted in the series revealing Erica's daughter Bianca as a lesbian. Within the series, Bianca admits the truth to her mother in December 2000. Though initially controversial, the storyline was praised by fans and critics.<ref name="soapcentral.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2001/0302-gayawards.php|title=AMC's Bianca Storyline Applauded|publisher=[[SoapCentral]]|year=2001|accessdate=2007-10-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105041711/http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2001/0302-gayawards.php|archivedate=November 5, 2007|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="AfterElton.com">{{cite news|first=Karman|last=Kregloe|title=Soaps Come Clean About Gay Teens (page 3)|publisher=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]]|date=March 23, 2006|accessdate=2007-08-09|url=http://www.afterelton.com/archive/elton/TV/2006/3/soaps3.html}}</ref><ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|first=Patrick D.|last=Healy|title=

After more staff turnover, McTavish again returned as head writer. Her storylines began airing in July 2003, which included [[Bianca Montgomery#Rape debate|the controversial rape of Bianca]]. Gone upon McTavish's latest return was [[Jean Dadario Burke]] as executive producer, being replaced with [[Julie Hanan Carruthers]]. Under McTavish, ratings fluctuated back and forth. To lure back long-time viewers, McTavish created new characters and romances, as well as scripted the return of various characters who had been gone for long. She introduced [[star-crossed]] couple [[JR Chandler and Babe Carey]] upon writing JR's return to the series, scripted most of popular pairing [[Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone]]'s love story, and created fellow popular couple [[Zach Slater and Kendall Hart]]. Characters [[Julia Santos]] ([[Sydney Penny]]) and [[Janet Marlowe Dillon|Janet Dillon]] ([[Kate Collins (actress)|Kate Collins]], who was originally slated to return for a brief stint) were eventually brought back.

The most notable return was [[Cady McClain]]'s return as show heroine [[Dixie Cooney Martin]]. The news of her return spread just two weeks before she reappeared on the series.

Another prominent return to the series occurred on February 9, 2007, when [[Susan Pratt]] returned as [[Barbara Montgomery (All My Children)|Barbara Montgomery]]. Pratt made her last appearance in July of that year. That same month, McTavish was fired as head writer, reportedly due to viewer criticism about her storylines.<ref name=sympatico.msn.ca /> On May 21, 2007, [[James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten]] were announced as the new head writers of ''All My Children''.<ref name=sympatico.msn.ca /> The duo wrote for ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'', ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'' and ''[[Port Charles]]'', and created and wrote for ''[[The City (1995 TV series)|The City]]''.

On December 12, 2007, ABC revealed [[Rebecca Budig]] would be returning to the series as [[Greenlee Smythe]]; the return was one of the most widely reported in daytime television history, attracting mainstream media attention such as the ''[[Associated Press]]'' and ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]''.<ref name="TvGuide.com">{{cite news|first=Matt Webb|last=Mitovich|title=Soaps News: Budig's Back on AMC!

On November 20, 2009, Pratt was fired as head writer. Daytime Emmy-winning former head writer [[Lorraine Broderick]] was brought back to lead the writing team on an interim basis. Reportedly, Broderick returned at the request of show creator Agnes Nixon, but was not interested in remaining permanently as the team's top scribe. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

=== 2010s ===
On January 5, 2010, ''All My Children'' celebrated its 40th anniversary with an episode structured like a documentary and hosted by character [[Hayley Vaughan|Hayley Santos]]. It featured appearances by characters [[Palmer Cortlandt]], [[Nina Warner]], Maria Santos Grey, [[Brooke English]], [[Greg Nelson (All My Children)|Greg Nelson]], [[Bianca Montgomery]], [[Mateo Santos]], and Lily Montgomery. It was also the final episode for characters Joe and Ruth Martin, who retired to Florida, and the final appearance for Palmer, since actor [[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]] died a little over weeks after the episode aired. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On January 13, 2010, ABC Daytime announced the appointment of [[David Kreizman]] and [[Donna Swajeski]] as the co-head writers of ''All My Children'', replacing interim head writer [[Lorraine Broderick]], who in turn replaced [[Charles Pratt, Jr.]]. Brian Frons, head of ABC daytime, stated, "David and Donna are the perfect team to bring new ideas to ''All My Children'' while remaining true to its core by telling stories with a focus on the integrity of the show's history, its characters and families on the canvas."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/ledgerpop/article_272630079.shtml|title=New "All My Children" Writing Team Hire a Curious Choice|work=National Ledger|date=January 23, 2010|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref> Prior to his appointment on ''All My Children'', Kriezman was the head writer of ''[[Guiding Light]]'' from 2004 to the final episode on September 18, 2009, and the co-head writer of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' from 2009 to the final episode on September 17, 2010.

With the death on January 22 of [[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]] at age 89 ([[Palmer Cortlandt]] 1979–2010), the show aired a tribute episode to Palmer on Tuesday April 20, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2010/0122-mitchell_obit.php|title=James Mitchell dead at 89|publisher=[[SoapCentral]]|accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> [[Gillian Spencer]] (Daisy Murdoch Cortlandt), [[Taylor Miller]] ([[Nina Cortlandt]]), and [[Cady McClain]] ([[Dixie Cooney Martin]]) returned for the episode. On February 8, [[Walt Willey]] returned as a contract cast member in the role of [[Jackson Montgomery]], following numerous months away and dispute about his future on the show. On February 23, [[Julia Barr]] reprised the role of [[Brooke English]]; Brooke's return was timed to the retirement of [[David Canary]] ([[Adam Chandler]]) after more than 26 years on the show. Their final episode aired April 23, 2010. On July 17, 2010, [[Larry Keith]], who was on the show from 1970 to 2005 as Nick Davis, who gave [[Erica Kane]] the nickname "Princess", died. He was last seen on January 5, 2005, for the show's 35th anniversary episode.

In September 2010, Daytime Emmy winner Vincent Irizzary's character, David Hayward, was murdered. On the November 22, 2010 episode, David waltzed into the courtroom during Greenlee's trial (for which she was just sentenced to life in prison for murdering him) at the tail end of it, confirming rumors that he was going to return all along. ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' confirmed soon after that the show had planned this all along from the start. On September 16, 2010, Adam Mayfield ([[Scott Chandler (All My Children)|Scott Chandler]]) and Brittany Allen ([[Marissa Tasker]]) were announced to be leaving the show. ABC reports that they wanted to take both the characters in a different direction. On September 22, 2010, it was announced that [[Daniel Cosgrove]] (ex-Scott, ''All My Children''; ex-Bill, ''Guiding Light''; ex-Chris, ''As the World Turns'') would return to ''All My Children'' and replace Adam Mayfield (Scott) as Scott Chandler. On October 28, 2010, it was announced that [[Sarah Glendening]] (ex-Lucy, ''As the World Turns'') would be taking over the role of Marissa Tasker. Glendening debuted on December 27 and Cosgrove debuted on December 29.

In January 2011, Debbi Morgan said that she would take a leave of absence from the show. She said it was for personal reasons and on January 14, 2011, she released to the public that she has been diagnosed with [[Lyme Disease]]. She returned during the second week of February and her first episode aired on March 8, 2011. On February 10, 2011, as part of her 25th (and farewell) season, [[Oprah Winfrey]] invited ''All My Children's ''[[Susan Lucci]], [[Debbi Morgan]], [[Darnell Williams]], and [[Michael E. Knight]], along with ''[[General Hospital]]'' s [[Luke and Laura]] and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'s'' [[Katherine Chancellor|Mrs. Chancellor]] to ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. As a surprise, Winfrey shocked Lucci and the rest of the crowd by bringing back all of Erica's husbands. During February 2011, the [[TV Land]] sitcom ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'' and ''All My Children'' did a crossover event. On the 16th, and February 23, Lucci, Michael E. Knight, and Darnell Williams made a guest appearance on the show. On the 24th, [[Wendie Malick]] guest-starred.

On April 2, 2011, amid rumors of ''All My Children's'' possible cancellation, ''[[Soaps in Depth]]'' broke the news via Twitter that longtime ''All My Children'' writer [[Lorraine Broderick]] had once again been named the show's head writer, replacing [[David Kreizman]] and [[Donna Swajeski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/soapsindepthabc/status/54332677863645184|title=Twitter: soapsindepthabc: Great news kids: #AMC is NOT|publisher=Twitter.com|accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>

On April 14, 2011, ABC confirmed that it would not renew both ''All My Children'' and ''[[One Life to Live]]'' after 41 and 43 years respectively, starting with ''All My Children'' ending its run on September 23, 2011, and with ''One Life to Live'' ending its run on January 13, 2012. Reasons for both shows' cancellations cited "extensive research into what today's daytime viewers want and the changing viewing patterns of the audience".

On April 25, Cady McClain (ex-Dixie Cooney Martin) announced that she would be returning to ''All My Children'' but could not report what her storyline would be.

On July 7, 2011, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that ABC had sold the licensing rights of ''All My Children'' and ''One Life To Live'' to a TV-focused online channel being developed by TV, film and music production company [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]]. ABC confirmed this via press release; as a result of Prospect Park's acquisition of the two soaps, ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'' would be the first soap operas to transition first-run broadcasts from traditional television to [[internet television]].<ref name="AMC">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/07/07/its-official-abc-licenses-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-to-prospect-park-series-to-continue-online/97445 |title=It's Official: ABC Licenses "All My Children" and "One Life to Live" To Prospect Park; Series to Continue Online |publisher=TVBytheNumbers.com |first=Robert |last=Seidman |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110710164040/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com:80/2011/07/07/its-official-abc-licenses-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-to-prospect-park-series-to-continue-online/97445 |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}</ref> Since the deal between ABC and Prospect Park is a [[licensing agreement]], both soaps would continue to remain the property of ABC.

On September 8, 2011, the original [[Ruth Martin (All My Children)|Ruth Martin]], actress [[Mary Fickett]], died at age 83. The episode on Wednesday September 21, 2011, was dedicated to her. On September 23, 2011, the series finale aired on ABC with open-ended stories. The final week featured Dr. Joe and Ruth Martin relocating to Pine Valley to cover recently arrested David Hayward's hospital duties. The return of [[Adam Chandler]] and [[Brooke English]] coincided with the revelation that David had somehow resurrected [[Stuart Chandler]]. Jackson Montgomery dissolved his relationship with Erica after she admitted that she prefers not to remarry. Unresolved is JR Chandler's plunge into insanity as he drunkenly aims a gun at a crowd of ''All My Children'' regulars during a welcome-home party for Stuart. The screen darkened before revealing the victim, leaving the story open for an eventual continuation with Prospect Park. On April 29, 2013, the revived series moved five years into the future after the original series finale on ABC. On November 11, 2013, it was confirmed by some of its actors that the series had once again become cancelled, this time by its online revival team.<ref name="Cancellation 2013 (TVG)" /><ref name="Cancellation 2013 (HP)" />

Prospect Park initially intended for ''All My Children'' to begin its run on the internet on September 26, 2011,<ref name="AMC" /> but has since revealed that the transition could be delayed until 2012 because it had to negotiate a new [[Collective bargaining|contract]] with the [[Trade union|union]] representing the actors of ''All My Children''.<ref name="transition delayed 1">{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/07/prospect-park-grapples-with-gild-union-issues-as-it-tries-to-keep-abc-soaps-alive|title=Prospect Park Deals With Guild/Union Issues As It Eyes Q1 2012 Relaunch Of ABC Soaps|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that ''All My Children'' along with its sister soap ''[[One Life to Live]]'' would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company's new internet channel, The Online Network.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/28/idUS273846887220110928|title=New Episodes of 'All My Children' Will Premiere Online in January|publisher=Reuters|date=2011-09-28|accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported that Prospect Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch ''All My Children'' and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated ''One Life to Live''.<ref name="Soap in depth">{{cite web|url=http://abc.soapsindepth.com/2011/11/prospect-park-puts-amc-on-hold.html|title=Prospect Park Puts AMC On Hold!|publisher=Abc.soapsindepth.com|date=2011-11-10|accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref><ref name="Variety">{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118045983?refCatId=14|work=Variety|first=Jon|last=Weisman|title='All My Children' online reboot in holding pattern|date=November 10, 2011}}</ref> Reasons given for this decision were lack of funding coupled with Prospect Park not being able to sign enough cast members from ''All My Children''.<ref name="Soap in depth" /><ref name="Variety" />

On May 17, 2013, The Online Network announced that ''All My Children'' and ''One Life To Live'' would no longer air five days a week together, due to viewer ratings that reflect online viewing patterns rather than those of traditional television. Starting May 20, 2013, ''All My Children'' and ''One Life To Life'' will be presented in a new schedule, with AMC airing on Mondays and Wednesdays and OLTL airing Tuesdays and Thursdays. The recap shows ''MORE All My Children'' and ''MORE One Life To Life'' will also combine together as one show airing on Fridays. The following day on May 18, 2013, both shows were noticeably missing from the FX Canada website and schedule, and although they subsequently became available on iTunes Canada, it was later revealed that FX Canada dropped ''All My Children'' and ''One Life To Live'' due the reduction of episodes, as the carriage agreement had specifically called for the airing of four episodes per week of both shows. Due to the reduction, FX Canada stated that ''"the agreement is no longer valid"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/fx-canada-no-longer-carrying-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-however-amc-oltl-are-now-available-in-canada-on-itunes/2013/05/20/|last=Fairman|first=Michael|title=FX Canada No Longer Carrying All My Children and One Life to Live!
