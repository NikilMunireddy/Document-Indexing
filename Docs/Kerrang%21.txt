'''''Kerrang!''''' is a UK-based [[music magazine|magazine]] devoted to [[rock music]], currently published by [[Hamburg]] based [[Bauer Media Group]]. It was first published on 6 June 1981 as a one-off supplement in the ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' newspaper. Named after the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] word that derives from the sound made when playing a [[power chord]] on a  distorted electric guitar, ''Kerrang!'' was initially devoted to the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] and the rise of [[hard rock]] acts.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Paul|last=Brannigan|date=6 June 2006|title=25 Most Important Bands Of Our Lifetime|journal=Kerrang!|issue=1110|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}</ref> In the early 2000s it became the best-selling British music newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/nylpm/2002/02/kerrang-topples-nme-as-best-selling-music-weekly/|title=Kerrang topples NME as best selling music weekly|first=Pete|last=Baran|publisher=Freaky Trigger|date=15 February 2002|accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>

==History==
''Kerrang!'' was founded in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Andy R. Brown|title=Everything Louder than Everything Else|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2007|volume=8|issue=4|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14616700701412209|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref> The magazine commenced publication on 6 June 1981 and was edited by  [[Geoff Barton]], initially as a one-time supplement in the ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' newspaper, which focused on the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] phenomenon and on the rise of other [[hard rock]] acts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rockcriticsarchives.com/interviews/geoffbarton/geoffbarton.html|title=Geoff Barton, behind the wheel|first=Steven|last=Ward|accessdate=22 November 2011|publisher=Rock Critics}}</ref> [[Angus Young]] of [[AC/DC]] appeared on ''Kerrang!''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first cover. Launched as a monthly magazine, ''Kerrang!'' began to appear on a fortnightly basis later, and in 1987 it went weekly. The original owner was [[UBM plc|United Newspapers]] who then sold it to [[EMAP]] in 1991.

During the 1980s and early 1990s the magazine placed many [[thrash metal|thrash]] and [[glam metal]] acts on the cover (like [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Slayer]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Metallica]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], and [[Venom (band)|Venom]]) but later discarded them when [[grunge]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] rose to fame. Readers often criticise the magazine for repeating this process every time a new musical trend becomes popular.

''Kerrang!''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s popularity rose again with the hiring of editor Paul Rees circa 2000 when the [[nu metal]] genre, featuring bands like [[Limp Bizkit]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] were becoming more popular.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1823270.stm|title=Kerrang! overtakes NME|publisher=BBC News|date=15 February 2002|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> Rees went on to edit ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine and Ashley Bird took over as editor from 2003 to 2005. However the magazine's sales went quickly into decline in 2003 and Paul Brannigan took over as editor in May 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/203156/ABC-REPORT-FILM-MUSIC/|title=ABC report: film and music|work=[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group]]|date=20 February 2004|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

The term "[[thrash metal]]" was first referred to in the music press by ''Kerrang'' journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] while making a reference to the [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] song "[[Metal Thrashing Mad]]" in issue number 62, page 8 published on 23 February 1984.  Prior to this [[Metallica]]'s [[James Hetfield]] referred to their sound as [[power metal]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Dome | first1 = Malcolm | title = Kerrang! | chapter = Anthrax 'Fistful Of Metal' | volume = 62 | publisher = Spotlight Publications Ltd. | date = 23 February 1984 | location = London, UK | pages = 8 | accessdate = 2012-03-10}}</ref>

With the emergence of [[emo]] and [[metalcore]], ''Kerrang!'' began to heavily feature this musical trend. However, the revamp was not welcomed by all readers and many complaints were received about ''Kerrang!''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sudden emphasis on emo and metalcore music. Brannigan took the magazine into its most commercially successful period with a record ever [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK)|ABC]] for the title of 80,186 copies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/aug/17/abcs.pressandpublishing7|title=Kerrang! rocks NME's world|first=Chris|last=Tryhorn|work=The Guardian |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=17 August 2006|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

In 2008, EMAP sold its consumer magazine to current owner [[Bauer Media Group]]. Brannigan left ''Kerrang!'' in 2009 and Nichola Browne was appointed editor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/aug/17/kerrang-new-editor-nichola-browne|title=Nichola Browne to edit Kerrang!|first=Stephen|last=Brook|work=The Guardian |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=17 August 2009|accessdate=28 October 2010}}</ref> She later stepped down in April 2011. Former ''[[NME]]'' features editor and ''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' deputy editor James McMahon was appointed as editor on 6 June 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1045438&c=1|title=Kerrang! names new editor|first=Ben|last=Cardew|work=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Intent Media|date=6 June 2011|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>

{{Main|Kerrang! Awards}}
Since 1993, the magazine has held an annual awards ceremony to mark the most successful bands in the interests of their readers.

The event is presented by major music celebrities, with many others outside the industry who attend the event.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.entertainment-focus.com/news/kerrang-awards-fuelled-by-relentless-energy-drink-nominations-announced|title=Kerrang!

In 2000, [[EMAP]] launched ''Kerrang!'' as a [[Digital audio broadcasting|digital]] radio station, across the United Kingdom. This was principally a 'jukebox' station, playing a back-to-back sequence of rock and [[alternative rock|alternative music]]. On 10 June 2004, Kerrang! 105.2 was launched as a regional radio station in [[Birmingham]] with an advertising campaign by London-based creative agency ODD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrangradio.co.uk/about-kerrang-radio/|title=About Kerrang!

The radio output included interviews with those affecting popular culture and society as well as those involved with music. It stopped broadcasting on FM as of 14 June 2013 and once again became a digital station, with listeners able to tune in on DAB or the Kerrang! Radio app. With this broadcasting change came a move in Kerrang! Radio's offices from Birmingham to London. [[Absolute Radio]] is now broadcasting on its FM frequency.

==Kerrang! TV==

==The Official Kerrang! Rock Chart==

In March 2012, Kerrang announced a new rock chart for the UK which is based upon airplay across Kerrang Radio, Kerrang TV and sales figures from the [[Official Charts Company]]. Charts are announced on Saturday mornings and feature twenty tracks. The latest chart can be viewed on [http://www.kerrang.com Kerrang!] every Saturday at midday.

==International editions==
[[Emap]] launched ''Kerrang! Australia'' in the late 1990s. Unlike its weekly counterpart in the UK, the Australian edition was published monthly due to stiff competition from free local music publications. ''Kerrang!'' is also published in Spanish and German.
