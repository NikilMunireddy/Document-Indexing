===Predecessor institutions and University Charter===
Boston University traces its roots to the establishment of the Newbury Biblical Institute in [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury, Vermont]] in 1839, and was chartered with the name "Boston University" by the [[Massachusetts Legislature]] in 1869.  The University organized formal Centennial observances both in 1939 and 1969.<ref name="history">[http://www.bu.edu/visit/about/history/index.html Boston University | Visitor Center | About the University |History] {{wayback|url=http://www.bu.edu/visit/about/history/index.html |date=20060216154448 }}, retrieved May 6, 2006 {{Wayback | url=http://www.bu.edu/visit/about/history/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | date=20060216154448 }}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>

On April 24–25, 1839 a group of [[Methodist]] ministers and laymen at the Old Bromfield Street Church in Boston elected to establish a Methodist theological school.  Set up in Newbury, [[Vermont]], the school was named the Newbury Biblical Institute.

In 1847, the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] Society in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], invited the Institute to relocate to Concord and offered a disused Congregational church building with a capacity of 1200 people. Other citizens of Concord covered the remodeling costs. One stipulation of the invitation was that the Institute remain in Concord for at least 20 years. The charter issued by [[New Hampshire]] designated the school the "Methodist General Biblical Institute", but it was commonly called the "Concord Biblical Institute."

With the agreed twenty years coming to a close, the Trustees of the Concord Biblical Institute purchased {{convert|30|acre|m2}} on Aspinwall Hill in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], Massachusetts as a possible relocation site. The Institute moved in 1867 to 23 Pinkney Street in Boston and received a Massachusetts Charter as the "Boston Theological Institute."

In 1869, three Trustees of the Boston Theological Institute obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature a charter for a university by name of "Boston University." These three were successful Boston businessmen and Methodist laymen, with a history of involvement in educational enterprises and became the Founders of Boston University. They were Isaac Rich (1801–1872), Lee Claflin (1791–1871), and Jacob Sleeper (1802–1889), for whom Boston University's three [[West Campus]] dormitories are named. Lee Claflin's son, [[William Claflin|William]], was then Governor of Massachusetts and signed the University Charter on May 26, 1869 after it was passed by the Legislature.

As reported by  Kathleen Kilgore in her book, "Transformations, A History of Boston University" (see [[Boston University#Further reading|Further Reading]]), the Founders directed the inclusion in the Charter of the following provision, unusual for its time:

:No instructor in said University shall ever be required by the Trustees to profess any particular religious opinions as a test of office, and no student shall be refused admission . . . on account of the religious opinions he may entertain; provided, nonetheless, that this section shall not apply to the theological department of said University.

Every department of the new university was also open to all on an equal footing regardless of sex, race, or (with the exception of the School of Theology) religion.

===Early years (1870–1900)===
The Boston Theological Institute was absorbed into Boston University in 1871 as the [[Boston University School of Theology|BU School of Theology]].

In January 1872 Isaac Rich died, leaving the vast bulk of his estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the University was organized. Most of this bequest consisted of real estate throughout the core of the city of Boston and was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university to that time. By December, however, the [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]] had destroyed all but one of the buildings Rich had left to the University, and the insurance companies with which they had been insured were bankrupt. The value of his estate, when turned over to the University in 1882, was half what it had been in 1872. As a result, the University was unable to build its contemplated campus on Aspinwall Hill and the land was sold piecemeal as development sites. Street names in the area, including Claflin Road, Claflin Path, and University Road, are the only remaining evidence of University ownership in this area.
[[Image:688 Boylston St.jpg|thumbnail|right|688 Boylston Street, the early home of the College of Liberal Arts, the precursor to the College of Arts & Sciences]]
Following the fire, Boston University established its new facilities in buildings scattered throughout [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] and later expanded into the [[Boylston Street]] and [[Copley Square]] area before building the Charles River Campus in the 1930s.

Bowne, an important figure in the history of American religious thought, was an American Christian philosopher and theologian in the [[Methodist]] tradition. He is known for his contributions to [[personalism]], a philosophical branch of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buford|first=Tom|title=Persons in the Tradition of Boston Personalism|journal=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy|year=2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=214–218|doi=10.1353/jsp.2007.0000}}</ref>  The movement he led is often referred to as [[Personalism#Boston Personalism|Boston Personalism]].<ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy">{{cite web|title=Personalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personalism/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|date=Nov 12, 2009}}</ref>

In 1877, Boston University became the first American university to award a Ph.D. to a woman when classics scholar [[Helen Magill White]] earned hers with a thesis on "The Greek Drama."<ref name="Boston University Press"/> Then in 1878 Anna Oliver became the first woman to receive a degree in theology in the United States, but the [[Methodist Church]] would not ordain her.<ref name="Boston University Press"/> Lelia Robinson Sawtelle, who graduated from the university's law school in 1881, became the first woman admitted to the bar in Massachusetts.<ref name="Boston University Press"/> [[Solomon Carter Fuller]], who graduated from the university's School of Medicine in 1897, became the first black psychiatrist in the United States and would make significant contributions to the study of [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="Boston University Press"/>

===20th century and establishment of the Charles River campus===

[[File:Marsh Chapel.jpg|thumb|Marsh Plaza and its surrounding buildings were one of the first completed parts of the Charles River Campus.]]
Seeking to unify a geographically scattered school and enable it to participate in the development of the city, school president Lemuel Murlin arranged that the school buy the present campus along the [[Charles River]].  Between 1920 and 1928, the school bought the {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land that had been reclaimed from the river by the Riverfront Improvement Association.  Plans for a riverside quadrangle with a [[Alexander Graham Bell tower|Gothic Revival administrative tower]] modeled on the "Old Boston Stump" in [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], England were scaled back in the late 1920s when the State Metropolitan District Commission used [[eminent domain]] to seize riverfront land for [[Storrow Drive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/visit/about/history/betweenwars.html|title=Between World Wars|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=2008-04-28 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071212022404/http://www.bu.edu/visit/about/history/betweenwars.html |archivedate = December 12, 2007}}</ref>  Murlin was never able to build the new campus, but his successor, [[Daniel L. Marsh]], led a series of fundraising campaigns (interrupted by both the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]) that helped Marsh to achieve his dream and to gradually fill in the University's new campus.<ref>Healea, Christopher Daryl, "The Builder and Maker of the Greater University: A History of Daniel L. Marsh's Presidency at Boston University, 1926–1951" (Boston University, 2011).

[[File:Boston University (8609103615).jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Josep Lluís Sert|Sert]]'s buildings expanded the campus in the 1960s.]]
In 1951, [[Harold C. Case]] became the school's fifth president and under his direction the character of the campus changed significantly, as he sought to change the school into a national research university. The campus tripled in size to {{convert|45|acre|m2}}, and added 68 new buildings before Case retired in 1967. The first large dorms, Claflin, Rich and Sleeper Halls in [[West Campus]] were built, and in 1965 construction began on 700 [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], later named [[Warren Towers]], designed to house 1800 students. Between 1961 and 1966, the [[Boston University School of Law|BU Law Tower]], the [[George Sherman Union]], and the [[Mugar Memorial Library]] were constructed in the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style, a departure from the school's traditional architecture. The [[Boston University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and [[Boston University College of Communication|College of Communication]] were housed in a former stable building and auto-show room, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailyfreepress.com/media/storage/paper87/news/2006/10/17/News/Activism.Dorm.Construction.Pervade.Campus.In.1950s60s-2371894.shtml|publisher=The Daily Free Press|author=Alex Taylor|accessdate=2008-04-27|title=Activism, dorm construction pervade campus in 1950s–60s}}</ref> Besides his efforts to expand the university into a rival for Greater Boston's more prestigious academic institutions, such as [[Harvard University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (both in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] across the Charles River from the BU campus), Case involved himself in the start of the student/societal upheavals that came to characterize the 1960s. When a mini-squabble over editorial policy at [[college radio]] WBUR-FM – whose offices were under a tall radio antenna mast in front of the School of Public Relations and Communications (later College of Communications) – started growing in the spring  of 1964, Case persuaded university trustees that the university should take over the widely heard radio station (now a major outlet for [[National Public Radio]] and still a B.U.-owned broadcast facility). The trustees approved the firing of student managers and clamped down on programming and editorial policy, which had been led by the late Jim Thistle, later a major force in Boston's broadcast news milieu. The on-campus political dispute between Case's conservative administration and the suddenly active and mostly liberal student body led to other disputes over B.U. student print publications, such as the B.U. News and the Scarlet, a fraternity association newspaper.

[[File:Tribute to John Silber (from joncouture.com).jpeg|thumbnail|left|[[John Silber]]]]
The Presidency of [[John Silber]] also saw much expansion.  In the late 1970s, the [[Lahey Clinic]] vacated its building at 605 Commonwealth Avenue and moved to [[Burlington, Massachusetts]].  The vacated building was purchased by BU to house the [[Boston University School of Education|School of Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahey.org/About/LaheyHistory.asp|publisher=The Lahey Clinic|accessdate=2009-12-28|title=Lahey History}}</ref>  After arriving from the University of Texas in 1971, Silber set out to remake the university into a global center for research by recruiting star faculty. Two of his faculty "stars," [[Elie Wiesel]] and [[Derek Walcott]], won Nobel Prizes shortly after Silber recruited them.<ref name="Silberado">{{cite journal|last1=Wolfe|first1=Tom|title=Silberado|journal=Bostonia|date=February 2015|page=37|publisher=Boston University}}</ref> Two others, [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]] won Nobel Prizes before Silber recruited them.<ref name="Silberado"/>

In addition to recruiting new scholars, Silber expanded the physical campus, constructing the Photonics Center for the study of light, a new building for the School of Management, and the Life Science and Engineering Building for interdisciplinary research, among other projects.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2005/04-29/lse.html|title=Life Science and Engineering building: "cathedral to science"|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=July 6, 2010}}</ref> Campus expansion continued in the 2000s with the construction of new dormitories and the [[Agganis Arena]].

===The 21st century===

Robert Brown's presidency, which started in 2005, will seek to further the consolidation of campus infrastructure that was commenced by Case and continued by Silber.  In particular, Brown has committed Boston University to investing $1.8 billion in the completion of its ten-year strategic plan, allocating new resources to inter-college opportunities for undergraduates, improving the campus's academic and residential facilities, and recruiting new faculty for the University's largest college.  The strategy includes increasing the annual budget to $225 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/president/strategic-plan/|title=BU Strategic Plan|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=July 6, 2010}}</ref>

The cornerstone of the plan, which calls for more campus-wide collaboration, is a focus on undergraduate education, starting with an effort to encourage cross-registration among schools and colleges and to encourage undergraduate students to take full advantage of both the liberal arts and the professional programs available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/node/5671|title=President Launches $1.8 Billion Strategic Initiatives|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=July 6, 2010}}</ref>

Plans exist to strengthen the [[Boston University School of Law|School of Law]], the [[Boston University School of Management|School of Management]], and the [[Boston University College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]], including changes to the physical plant and the hiring of additional faculty. The School of Medicine plans physical improvements, including more affordable student housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2008/04/28/med-buys-site-future-student-housing |title=MED Buys Site of Future Student Housing |publisher=Boston University |accessdate=July 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080501180615/http://www.bu.edu:80/today/2008/04/28/med-buys-site-future-student-housing |archivedate=May 1, 2008 }}</ref>

The University's main Charles River Campus follows [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]] and the [[Green Line (MBTA)#B Line|Green Line]], beginning near [[Kenmore Square]] and continuing for over a mile and a half to its end near the border of Boston's [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]] neighborhood. The [[Boston University Bridge]] over the [[Charles River]] into [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] represents the dividing line between Main Campus, where most schools and classroom buildings are concentrated, and [[West Campus]], home to several athletic facilities and playing fields, the large West Campus dorm, and the new John Hancock Student Village complex.

As a result of its continual expansion, the Charles River campus contains an array of architecturally diverse buildings. The College of Arts and Sciences, Marsh Chapel (site of the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]]), and the School of Theology buildings are the university's most recognizable and were built in the late-1930s and 1940s in collegiate gothic style. A sizable amount of the campus is traditional Boston brownstone, especially at [[Bay State Road]] and South Campus where BU has acquired almost every townhouse those areas offer. The buildings are primarily dormitories but many also serve as various institutes as well as department offices. From the 1960s–1980s many contemporary buildings were constructed including the Mugar Library, BU Law School and Warren Towers, all of which were built in the [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] style of architecture. The [[Metcalf Science Center for Science and Engineering]], constructed in 1983, might more accurately be described as [[Structural Expressionism]]. [[Morse Auditorium]], adjacent, stands in stark architectural contrast, as it was constructed as a Jewish temple. The most recent additions to BU's campus are the [[Boston University Photonics Center|Photonics Center]], Life Science and Engineering Building, The Student Village (which includes the [[Fitness and Recreation Center|FitRec Center]] and [[Agganis Arena]]), and the [[Boston University School of Management|School of Management]]. All these buildings were built in brick, a few with a substantial amount of brownstone.

====Student housing====

[[File:Myles Standish Hall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Built in 1925 as the [[Myles Standish]] Hotel, this building was converted to dorm space in 1949.]]

Boston University's housing system is the nation's 10th largest among four-year colleges. BU was originally a commuter school, but the university now guarantees the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. Currently, 76 percent of the undergraduate population lives on campus. Boston University requires that all students living in dormitories be enrolled in a year-long meal plan with several combinations of meals and dining points which can be used as cash in on-campus facilities.<ref name="diningplanrequired">[http://www.bu.edu/housing/dining/plans/index.html Boston University | Office of Housing | Dining Plans and Convenience Points|Dining Plans], retrieved May 6, 2006 {{wayback|url=http://www.bu.edu/housing/dining/plans/index.html |date=20091212021154 }}</ref>

Housing at BU is an unusually diverse melange, ranging from individual 19th-century [[brownstone]] [[town house]]s and apartment buildings acquired by the school to large-scale high-rises built in the 60s and 2000s.

The large dormitories include the 1,800-student [[Warren Towers]], the largest on campus, as well as West Campus and [[Towers (Boston University)|The Towers]].  The smaller dormitory and apartment style housing are mainly located in two parts of campus: Bay State Road and the South Campus residential area. Bay State Road is a tree-lined street that runs parallel to Commonwealth Avenue and is home to the majority of BU's town houses, often called "brownstones". South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South Campus buildings are apartments.

Boston University's newest residence and principal apartment-style housing area is officially called 33 Harry Agganis Way, StuVi2 unofficially, and is part of The John Hancock Student Village project. The north-facing, 26-story building is apartment style while the south-facing, 19-story building is in an 8-bedroom dormitory style suite. In total, the building houses 960 residents.

Aside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along Commonwealth Avenue.

Boston University also provides [[Boston University Housing System#Specialty housing|specialty houses]] or specialty floors to students who have particular interests.

All large dormitories have 24/7 security and require all students to swipe and show their school identification before entering.

[[Shelton Hall (Boston University)|Shelton Hall]] is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of playwright  [[Eugene O'Neill]]. O'Neill lived in what was originally room 401 (now 419) while the building was a residential hotel. He died in a hospital on November 27, 1953, and his ghost is rumored to haunt both the room and the floor. The fourth floor is now a specialty floor called the Writers' Corridor.

====John Hancock Student Village====
[[File:Student Village II at Boston University.jpg|thumb|Student Village II with Student Village I in the background, as viewed from Nickerson Field]]
{{Main|John Hancock Student Village}}
The Student Village is a large new residential and recreational complex covering {{convert|10|acre|m2}} between Buick Street and [[Nickerson Field]], ground formerly occupied by a [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] [[Armory (military)|Armory]], which had been used by the University for indoor track and field and as a storage facility before its [[demolition]] and the start of construction. The dormitory of apartment suites at 10 Buick Street (often abbreviated to "StuVi" by students) opened to juniors and seniors in the fall of 2000. In 2002, [[John Hancock Insurance]] announced its sponsorship of the multimillion-dollar project.

The [[Agganis Arena]], named after [[Harry Agganis]], was opened to concerts and [[ice hockey|hockey]] games in January 2005. The Agganis Arena is capable of housing 6,224 spectators for [[Boston University athletics#Terrier Hockey|Terrier hockey]] games, replacing the smaller [[Walter Brown Arena]]. It can also be used for concerts and shows. In March 2005, the final element of phase II of the Student Village complex, the [[Fitness and Recreation Center|Fitness and Recreation (FitRec) Center]], was opened, drawing large crowds from the student body.  Construction on the rest of phase II, which included 19- and 26-story residential towers was finished in fall 2009.

The Florence and Chafetz Hillel House on Bay State Road is the [[Hillel House]] for the university. With four floors and a basement, the facility includes lounges, study rooms and a kosher dining hall, open during the academic year (including Passover) to students and walk-ins from the community. The first floor also includes the Granby St. Cafe as well as TVs and ping-pong, pool and foosball tables. The Hillel serves as a focal point for BU's large and active Jewish community. It hosts approximately 30 student groups, including social, cultural, and religious groups, and BU Students for Israel (BUSI), Holocaust Education, and the Center for Jewish Learning and Experience. It hosts a plethora of programs and speakers as well as Shabbat services and meals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/hillel |title=Hillel House |publisher=Bu.edu |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref>

Weld House, the former office of the president of Boston University, is the former home of [[Charles Goddard Weld]], a member of the wealthy [[Weld family]] of Massachusetts.  The adjoining Dunn House contains the Office of the Chancellor.<ref>[http://www.harvardmag.com/nd98/welds.html ''Harvard Alumni Magazine''], "The Welds of Harvard Yard" by associate editor Craig A.

In addition, BU is associated with the Photographic Resource Center located at 832 Commonwealth Avenue, which mounts several exhibitions yearly, as well as special events for student and professional photographers.

====Guest and visitor policies====
Prior to September 2007, Boston University had a restrictive visitor policy, which limited the ability of students from different dormitories to visit each other at night. This changed when a new policy approved by Brown took effect.<ref>[http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=44920&template=4 "President Approves New Guest Policy" ~ ''BU Today''] May 7, 2007 {{wayback|url=http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=44920&template=4 |date=20071213114351 }}</ref>  The new policy allows for students living on campus to swipe into any on-campus dormitory between the hours of 7&nbsp;am and 2&nbsp;am using their ID cards.  Student residents can also sign in guests with photo identification at any time, day or night.  Overnight visitors of the opposite sex are no longer required to seek a same-sex "co-host".<ref>[http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=43755&template=4&from_email=true "New Guest Policy Means More Power, More Responsibility" ~ ''BU Today''] March 2, 2007 {{wayback|url=http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=43755&template=4&from_email=true |date=20071014223108 }}</ref> However, during the week before final exams no guests are permitted in the halls overnight, and are expected to be out of the hall by 2&nbsp;am.<ref>[http://www.bu.edu/dos/documents/GuestPolicy22807.pdf BU Guest Policy] from bu.edu {{wayback|url=http://www.bu.edu/dos/documents/GuestPolicy22807.pdf |date=20090325150728 }}</ref>

====Mass transit====

Most of the buildings of the main campus are located on or near Commonwealth Avenue. The Kenmore Square area of campus (including the Boston University Bookstore, Shelton Hall and Myles Standish Hall) may be accessed using the [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] stop on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] Green Line [[Green Line "B" Branch|B]], [[Green Line "C" Branch|C]] and [[Green Line "D" Branch|D]] trains. Most of the rest of the main campus may be accessed using the B trains of the Green Line between the [[Blandford Street (MBTA station)|Blandford Street]] and [[Babcock Street (MBTA station)|Babcock Street]] stops.  The #57 Bus runs from Kenmore Square along Commonwealth Avenue, and into Allston and Brighton.

Though an article in the staff's ''BU Today'' asserted that "the GPAs of BU undergrads and the percentage of As and Bs have both risen over the last two decades", ''The New York Times'' has found BU grades rising more slowly with respect to many other schools.

In 2004, the average GPA of a BU undergraduate was 3.04,<ref>{{cite web| date=March 10, 2009| author= Rojstaczer, Stuart |url = http://gradeinflation.com/Boston.html |title= Grade Inflation Across the U.S.| work= Boston University | publisher= gradeinflation.com| accessdate = 2012-05-13}}</ref>

About 81 percent of all grades earned in either the A or B range (75% in the B range). The article went on to note that although the university attempted to curb [[grade inflation]] and inconsistency in the late 1990s, both the percentage of As and GPAs have been rising since. They attributed the grade deflation not to teachers' grading policies, but to the increasing quality of each incoming class which leads to more top grades.<ref name=BUTodayGradeDeflation>{{Cite news|first=Chris |last=Berdik |url=http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=40427&template=7 |title=Grade Deflation or Not? |work=BU Today |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2006-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014223059/http://www.bu.edu:80/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=40427&template=7 |archivedate=October 14, 2007 }}</ref>

===Special academic programs===

====Core Curriculum====
[[File:BU CAS (night).jpg|thumb|The [[collegiate gothic]] towers of the School of Theology and the College of Arts and Sciences in the center of campus at night.]]
Offered in the College of Arts and Sciences, the Core Curriculum offers an intensive [[great books]] program for any incoming freshmen who choose to participate.  Occupying two classes a semester during freshman and sophomore years, the program has four humanities sections which start with the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and work their way through [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Shakespeare]], Milton, Dante, Bach and many more.  The Social Sciences part of the program includes Hobbes, [[John Locke]], Rousseau, Adam Smith, Marx, and continues through contemporary works.  Lastly, the science aspect of the program deals with major ideas such as big bang theory, evolution, quantum mechanics and more.  Ultimately, the program seeks to combine science, math, humanities, art, and the social sciences into a cohesive program to give students insight into their world and help them become more refined writers and scholars.

====University Professors Program====
The [[University Professors Program]] (UNI) was an interdisciplinary program that allowed students to pursue a broad range of academic interests. With a student to faculty ratio of 4:1, UNI offered students a broad education in a more personalized atmosphere. Students took a common, intimate, "Core" program consisting of liberal arts courses taught by University Professors in small seminar settings. They then worked closely with an advisor to craft a course of study which led them to an interdisciplinary degree, culminating in a senior thesis.
Based upon the report of an academic review committee, a new University-wide honors program was developed and the UNI program was replaced by the University Honors College.<ref>

====Kilachand Honors College====
The University Honors College matriculated its first class in 2010. In 2011, it was renamed Arvind and Chandan Nandlal Kilachand Honors College following a $25 million donation from Rajen Kilachand; the largest donation in the history of the University. The Kilachand Honors College is a university-wide community of faculty and students dedicated to preserving, renewing, and rethinking classic ideals of liberal education: love of learning, intellectual curiosity, self-discovery, empathy, clarity of thought and expression. It rests on three pillars: an integrated, four-year curriculum; an extensive series of co-curricular events that include site-visits to leading cultural institutions as well as talks and readings by leading figures in the arts, sciences, and professions; and, finally, a "living and learning" community that offers students the personal atmosphere  of a small liberal arts college and fosters responsibility and citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/khc/about/ |title=What is Kilachand Honors College? » Kilachand Honors College &#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

===Boston University Academy===
{{Main|Boston University Academy}}

Boston University Academy is a private high school operated by Boston University.  Founded in 1993, the school sits within the university's campus and students are offered the opportunity to take university courses.

==Student life==

===Student publications===
Despite a Student Activities policy which prohibits student-run publications from receiving University funding for printing costs, student journals continue to thrive at Boston University as department-sponsored publications, edited by students under the supervision of faculty and staff advisors. The coordinator for undergraduate publications, responsible for acquainting new editors with University guidelines and directing publications staff to campus production and financial resources, has been Zachary Bos of the Core Curriculum since 2006.

Although officially and entirely independent from the University, ''[[Daily Free Press|The Daily Free Press]]'' (often referred to as ''The FreeP''), is the campus student newspaper, and the fourth largest daily newspaper in Boston. Since 1970, it has provided students with campus news, city and state news, sports coverage, editorials, arts and entertainment, and special feature stories. ''The Daily Free Press'' is published every regular instruction day of the University year and is available in BU dorms, classroom buildings and commercial locations frequented by students.

The ''Boston Political Review'' is BU's premier on-campus political magazine.  Founded in the spring of 2014, the BPR publishes an online edition every month, with a range of subjects including national, global, and local politics as well as sections on lobbying, social issues, and economics. The BPR prints their highlighted articles and new material once every semester in a free print magazine that is distributed around campus. Their mission is to offer Boston University students, alumni, staff, and faculty the chance to read a balanced political magazine that offers arguments from all points of view on the political spectrum.<ref>{{cite web |url=bostonpoliticalreview.org |website=Boston Political Review}}</ref>

Founded in spring 2009, THE BU BUZZ is Boston University's lifestyle magazine on news and happenings on and off campus. Sections include  Campus, City, Arts, Food, Music, Fashion, Sports, and Abroad. In the Spring of 2013, the Buzz rebranded as an online magazine, ceasing its bi-annual publication to allow for weekly and daily updated articles, including the addition of new sections and new interactive features. In the Fall of 2013, the staff, run entirely by students, looks to incorporate a broadcast segment. Unlike other BU publications, the Buzz has emerged as Boston University campus brand, hosting press events, public relations groups and looking to apply magazine 3.0 tactics to the journalism community.

BU's ''The Quad'' is an independent, student-run online magazine started in the fall of 2009. The magazine features articles and columns on topics including campus news, television, food, politics, and music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buquad.com/ |title=The Quad, BU's independent online magazine |publisher=buquad.com |accessdate=2010-05-31}}</ref>

''Synapse'' is the Boston University Undergraduate Science Magazine and is published online every semester. The "Science" focus is on many disciplines ranging from life sciences to physical sciences, engineering to mathematics, and finance to economics. The magazine is peer and faculty reviewed, and is advertised with routine, campus-wide distribution of pamphlets highlighting featured articles. ''Synapse'' was first published in the spring of 2009 and continues to publish articles each semester.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/synapse |title=BU Synapse Website |publisher=Bu.edu |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref>

''The Brownstone Journal'' is the longest-running campus publication, having been publishing undergraduate research, scholarly articles and essays, and literary work in translation, since 1982. The Brownstone is currently sponsored by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, but was originally a departmental publication of the University Professors Program. The staff operates from their offices in the former yearbook space in the basement of 10 Lenox Street, beneath the editorial offices of ''Bostonia''.

The literary arts magazine ''[[Clarion (journal)|Clarion]]'' has been printed since 1998. The first issue, titled "?", was published by the group Students for Literary Awareness with the sponsorship of the Department of English; subsequent issues have been issued by the BU Literary Society. ''Burn Magazine'' is a younger literary magazine, published biannually.

The inaugural issue of Boston University's newest literary magazine, Coup d'État, was published in January 2014 by the Boston University Literary Society, with the support of the Department of English. It is published biannually, taking submissions both students of BU and nationally.<ref>http://www.bu.edu/studentactivities/2014/02/10/bu-literary-society-launches-inaugural-issue/</ref>

In 2006, the first issue of ''Pusteblume'' journal of translation was published by a group of former and current students of a co-curricular poetry seminar run by Professor George Kalogeris of the Core Curriculum. The journal, jointly sponsored by the Department of Romance Languages, the Department of Modern Languages and Comparative Literatures, and the Core Curriculum, publishes literature in translation and articles concerning translation.

''The Journal of the Core Curriculum'' has been published continuously since 1992 by the College of Arts and Sciences Core Curriculum. Produced by a student editorial staff with the guidance of a faculty advisor, the very interdisciplinary Core Journal publishes academic prose, literary imitations, fictitious encounters between figures from the 'great works', original poetry and creative writing, essays, artwork, translations, and even—in Vol. XVI, Spring 2007—original musical compositions. ''The Back Bay Review'' is a student-run journal of critical writing.

''Arché'' is an annual journal of undergraduate work in philosophy, whose first issue was released in the summer of 2007. It is sponsored by the Department of Philosophy and published by the Undergraduate Philosophy Association.

''The International Relations Review'' began in 2009 as a subsidiary publication of The Boston University International Affairs Association. Entirely student-run, ''The IR Review'' is an independent scholarly journal publishing articles from all areas in international affairs. The goal of ''The IRR'' is to unite the many talents and experiences within BU's vast department of international relations.

Even more independent, ''The Student Underground'', focuses on alternative political and cultural activity. Since 1997, issues have been published roughly monthly by a "not-for-profit collective" composed mostly of BU students. In 2007, the paper began operating under the name ''The Boston Underground''; the original editorial focus on campus issues has over the years weakened as the founding editors graduated from BU or left Boston altogether.

''The Sam Adams Review'' was a short-lived monthly student newspaper "providing news for the American Spirit," geared toward a conservative readership. Its staff was not officially recognized as a registered student activity group but, like the Underground, was entirely student-run.

''[[Boink]]'' was launched in February 2005 by a group of undergrads led by Alecia Oleyourryk, who was then a senior at the College of Communications. The magazine features BU students posing nude, as well as articles on sexuality. At the time of its first issue, the Dean of Students issued a statement explaining that "the University does not endorse, nor welcome, the prospective publication Boink." The magazine was then, and remains, unaffiliated with the University.

In September 2005, the student paper ''The Source'' began to appear weekly, and was characterized by a predominance of arts and entertainment coverage. No new issues were printed after November 2006, and it appears the publisher Greenline Media is now defunct.

BU Culture Shock is the official blog of the [[Howard Thurman#Honors and Legacy|Howard Thurman Center]], Boston University's multicultural center. It is dedicated to free expression and open discussion. Culture Shock is notable for its coverage of the 2011 Boston University Union election, inviting contributions from candidates along with other students.

===Community Service Center===
The Boston University Community Service Center (CSC) is almost entirely student-run. Each semester, the CSC runs 13 volunteer programs related to issues of local, national, or global concern, including hunger, children, elders, disabilities, homelessness and affordable housing, human rights, AIDS awareness, gender issues, and the environment.

The CSC also runs two immensely popular one-week programs.  During the First Year Student Outreach Project (FYSOP), upperclassmen lead groups of freshmen in volunteer activities throughout Boston before the start of first semester.  For Alternative Spring Break (ASB), hundreds of students travel by 12-passenger van, bus, and airplane to locations throughout the country to do service projects in various areas of need. Before registration moved online, students camped out the day before to get spots on trips. Starting in 2010, registration process moved online.<ref name="bu.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/csc/ |title=Community Service Center » Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref> For the ASB 2012 program, its registration site [http://dailyfreepress.com/2012/01/30/asb-registration-site-crashes-due-to-heavy-traffic-spots-filled-rapidly/ crashed] due to overwhelming traffic. When registration resumed later that day, spots on all trips filled within minutes, according to ''The Daily Free Press.''

The CSC boasts the most student involvement of any organization on campus.<ref name="bu.edu"/>

===Graduate workshops===
Willing Suspension Productions provides graduate English students the opportunity to present rare Early modern drama before a Boston audience.  The program was founded in 1993 and produces one play per year.

===ROTC===
The [[ROTC|Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) at BU traces its origins back to August 16, 1919 when the U.S. War Department stood up the Students' Army Training Corps at Boston University, the predecessor to the current Army ROTC program.<ref name="rotc">{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/dme/ |title=Boston University – Division of Military Education |publisher=Bu.edu |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref> Today, BU is one of twenty five colleges and universities in the country to host all three ROTC programs – Army, Navy, and Air Force. Students wishing to be commissioned into the Marine Corps study as Navy Midshipmen.

===Honor Societies===
[[Alpha Phi Sigma]] - Nu Mu Chapter

Alpha Phi Sigma, the national criminal justice honor society, recognizes academic excellence in undergraduate and graduate criminal justice students, as well as Juris Doctor (JD) students, inducting new members twice yearly.
