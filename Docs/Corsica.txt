'''Corsica''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|s|ɪ|k|ə|}}; {{lang-fr|link=no|Corse}} {{IPA-fr|kɔʁs|}}; [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Corsica'' {{IPA-it|ˈkɔrsika|}}) is an island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] belonging to [[France]]. It is located west of the [[Italian Peninsula]], southeast of the French [[mainland]], and north of the [[Italy|Italian]] island of [[Sardinia]]. Mountains make up two-thirds of the island, forming a single chain.

Corsica is one of the 18 [[regions of France]], although it is designated as a [[territorial collectivity]] (''collectivité territoriale'') by law. As a territorial collectivity, Corsica enjoys some greater powers than other French regions but is commonly referred to as a region and is almost always listed among them.

The island formed a single [[Departments of France|department]] until it was split in 1975 into two departments: [[Haute-Corse]] (Upper Corsica) and [[Corse-du-Sud]] (Southern Corsica), with its regional capital in [[Ajaccio]], the prefecture city of Corse-du-Sud. [[Bastia]], the prefecture city of Haute-Corse, is the second-largest settlement in Corsica.

After being ruled by the [[Republic of Genoa]] since 1284, Corsica was briefly an independent [[Corsican Republic]] from 1755 until it was [[French conquest of Corsica|annexed]] by France in 1769. Due to Corsica's historical ties with the Italian peninsula, the island retains to this day many elements of the [[culture of Italy]]. The native [[Corsican language]], whose northern variant is closely related to the [[Italian language]], is recognised as a regional language by the French government. This Mediterranean island was ruled by various nations over the course of history but had several brief periods of independence.

[[Napoleon]] was born in 1769 in the Corsican capital of Ajaccio. His ancestral home, [[Maison Bonaparte]], is today used as a museum.

==History==

===Prehistory and ancient age===
{{Main|Prehistory of Corsica|History of Corsica|Medieval Corsica}}
[[File:Corse-04812-église de Aregno.jpg|thumb|The medieval influence of [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] in Corsica can be seen in the Romanesque-Pisan style of the [[Church of the Trinity and Saint John|Church of Aregno]]]]
The origin of the name Corsica is subject to much debate and remains a mystery. To the [[Ancient Greeks]] it was known as ''Kalliste'', ''Corsis'', ''Cyrnos'', ''Cernealis'', or ''Cirné''. Of these ''Cyrnos'', ''Cernealis'', or ''Cirné'' derive from a corruption of the most ancient  Greek name of the island, "Σειρηνούσσαι" (meaning ''of the Sirens''), the very same Sirens mentioned in Homer's Odyssey.  The claim that latter Greek names are based on the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word for 'peninsula' ('''kir''') are highly unlikely.

Corsica has been occupied continuously since the [[Mesolithic]] era. It acquired an indigenous population that was influential in the [[Mediterranean]] during its long prehistory.

After a brief occupation by the [[Carthaginians]], [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|colonization by the ancient Greeks]], and an only slightly longer occupation by the [[Etruscans]], it was incorporated by the [[Roman Republic]] at the end of the [[First Punic War]] and, with [[Sardinia]], in 260 BC became [[Corsica et Sardinia|a province]] of the [[Roman Republic]].<ref name=be41>Bertarelli (1929), p.41</ref> The Romans, who built a colony in [[Aléria]], considered Corsica as one of the most backward regions of the Roman world. The island produced sheep, honey, resin and wax, and exported many slaves, not well considered because of their fierce and rebellious character.<ref name=be41/> Moreover, it was known for its cheap wines, exported to Rome, and was used as place of relegation, one of the most famous exiles being the Roman philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Ettore|title=Storia della Sardegna e della Corsica durante il periodo romano|date=1999|publisher=Ilisso|location=Nuoro|isbn=88-85098-92-4|pages=76–77|language=Italian}}</ref> Administratively, the island was divided in ''[[Pagus#Roman usage|pagi]]'', which in the Middle Ages became the ''[[Pieve|pievi]]'', the basic administrative units of the island until 1768.<ref name=be41/>  During the diffusion of Christianity, which arrived quite early from Rome and the Tuscan harbors, Corsica was home to many martyrs and saints: among them, the most important are [[Devota|Saint Devota]] and [[Julia of Corsica|Saint Julia]], both patrons of the island. Corsica was integrated by [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] (r. 284-305) in [[Roman Italy]].

===Middle Ages and Modern Age===
In the 5th century, the western half of the Roman Empire collapsed, and the island was invaded by the [[Vandals]] and the [[Ostrogoths]].<ref name=be41/> Briefly recovered by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], it soon became part of the Kingdom of the [[Lombards]]: this made it a dependency of the [[March of Tuscany]], which used it as outpost against the [[Saracens]].<ref name=be42>Bertarelli (1929), p.42</ref> [[Pepin the Short]], king of the [[Franks]] and [[Charlemagne]]'s father, expelled the Lombards and nominally granted Corsica to [[Pope Stephen II]].<ref name=be42/>
In the first quarter of the 11th century, Pisa and Genoa together freed the island from the Arab danger.<ref name=be42/> After that, the island came under the influence of the [[republic of Pisa]].<ref name=be42/> To this period belong the many polychrome churches which adorn the island,  and in that time Corsica experienced a massive immigration from Tuscany, which gave to the island its present toponymy and rendered the language spoken in the northern two-thirds of the island very close to the [[Tuscan Language]].<ref name=be42/> Due to that, then began also the traditional division of Corsica in two parts, along the main chain of mountains roughly going from [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] to [[Porto Vecchio]]: the eastern ''Banda di dentro'', or ''Cismonte'', more populated, evolved and open to the commerce with Italy, and the western ''Banda di fuori'', or ''Pomonte'', almost deserted, wild and remote.<ref name=be42/>
[[File:Genoise tower in corsica.jpg|thumb|The [[Barbary pirates|North African pirates]] frequently attacked Corsica, resulting in many [[Genoese tower]]s being erected.]]
The crushing defeat experienced by Pisa in 1284 in the [[Battle of Meloria (1284)|Battle of Meloria]] against [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] had among its consequences the end of the Pisan rule and the beginning of the Genoese influence:<ref name=be42/> this was contested at the beginning by the [[Kingdom of Aragon|King of Aragon]], who in 1296 had received from the Pope the investiture over [[Sardinia]] and Corsica.<ref name=be43>Bertarelli (1929), p.43</ref> A popular revolution against this and the feudal lords, led by [[Sambucuccio d'Alando]], got the aid of Genoa. After that, the ''Cismonte'' was ruled as a league of [[comuni]] and churches, after the Italian experience.<ref name=be43/> The following 150 years were a period of conflict, when the Genoese rule was contested by Aragon, the local lords, the comuni and the Pope: finally, in 1450 Genoa ceded the administration of the island to its main bank, the [[Bank of Saint George]], which brought peace.<ref name=be45>Bertarelli (1929), p.45</ref>

In the 16th century, the island entered into the fight between Spain and France for the supremacy in Italy.<ref name=be45/>  In 1553, a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman]] fleet [[Invasion of Corsica (1553)|occupied Corsica]], but the reaction of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and Genoa, led by [[Andrea Doria]], reestablished the Genoese supremacy on the island, confirmed by the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambresis]].<ref name=be46>Bertarelli (1929), p.46</ref> The unlucky protagonist of this episode was [[History of Corsica#Sampiero Corso|Sampiero di Bastelica]], who would later come to be considered a hero of the island. Their power reinstated, the Genoese did not allow the Corsican nobility to share in the government of the island, and oppressed the inhabitants with a heavy tax burden: on the other hand, they introduced on a large scale the chestnut tree, improving the diet of the population, and built a chain of [[Genoese towers in Corsica|towers]] along the coast to defend Corsica from the attacks of the [[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa.<ref>"[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-03-01/features/1992061173_1_maquis-corsica-french-resistance/2 Ancient Corsica beckons with deserted beaches and historic structures]". ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. 1 March 1992</ref>
The period of peace lasted until 1729, when the refusal to pay the taxes by a peasant sparked the general insurrection of the island against Genoa.<ref name=be48>Bertarelli (1929), p.48</ref>

===The rise and annexation of the Corsican Republic===
{{main|Corsican Republic}}
{{refimprove|date=April 2016}}
[[File:Ajaccio Plage.jpg|thumb|left|Seafront boulevard in [[Ajaccio]], the island's capital and [[Napoleon I]]'s birthplace]]

In 1729 the Corsican Revolution for independence began, first led by [[Luigi Giafferi]] and [[Giacinto Paoli]], and later by the son of the latter, [[Pasquale Paoli]]. After 26 years of struggle against the [[Republic of Genoa]] (plus an ephemeral attempt to proclaim in 1736 an independent Kingdom of Corsica under the German adventurer [[Theodore of Corsica|Theodor von Neuhoff]]), the independent [[Corsican Republic]] was proclaimed in 1755 under the leadership of Pasquale Paoli and remained sovereign until 1769, when the island was [[French conquest of Corsica|conquered by France]]. The first [[Corsican Constitution]] was written in Italian (the language of culture in Corsica until the middle of the 19th century) by Paoli.

The [[Corsican Republic]] was unable to eject the Genoese from the major coastal fortresses (Calvi and Bonifacio). After the Corsican conquest of [[Capraia]], a small island of the [[Tuscan Archipelago]], in 1767, the [[Republic of Genoa]], exhausted by 40 years of fight, decided to sell the island to France which, after [[France in the Seven Years War|its defeat in the Seven Years' War]], was trying to reinforce its position in the Mediterranean, and in 1768 with the [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]] the republic ceded all its rights on the island. After an initial successful resistance culminating with the victory at [[Borgo, Haute-Corse|Borgo]], the Corsican republic was crushed by a large French army led by the [[Noël Jourda de Vaux|Count of Vaux]] at the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]]. This marked the end of Corsican sovereignty. Despite triggering the [[Corsican Crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], whose government gave secret aid, no foreign military support came for the Corsicans. However, nationalist feelings still ran high. Despite the conquest, Corsica was not incorporated into the French state until 1789.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, Pasquale Paoli was able to return to Corsica from exile in Britain. In 1794 he invited British forces under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] to intervene to free Corsica from French rule. Anglo-Corsican forces drove the French from the island and established an [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]]. Following Spain's entry into the war the British decided to withdraw from Corsica in 1796. Corsica then returned to French rule.

===Corsica in the 19th century===
Despite being the birthplace of the Emperor, who had supported Paoli in his youth, the island was neglected by Napoleon's government.<ref>Howard, John E., ''Letters and Documents of Napoleon: Vol. 1 Rise to Power''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1961.</ref> In 1814, near the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Corsica was briefly occupied again by British troops. The [[Treaty of Bastia]] gave the British crown sovereignty over the island, but it was later repudiated by [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]] who insisted that the island should be returned to a [[Bourbon Restoration|restored French monarchy]].

After the restoration, the island was further neglected by the French state. Despite the presence of a middle class in Bastia and Ajaccio, Corsica remained an otherwise primitive place, whose economy consisted mainly of a subsistence agriculture, and whose population constituted a pastoral society, dominated by [[clan]]s and the rules of [[feud|vendetta]]. The code of vendetta required Corsicans to seek deadly revenge for offences against their family's honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no fewer than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=udhEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA196&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Wanderings in Corsica: its history and its heroes]''". Ferdinand Gregorovius (1855). p.196.</ref> In this period was born the myth, created by writers like [[Prosper Mérimée|Mérimée]] and [[Gregorovius]], of Corsica as an [[Arcadia (utopia)|archadian society]], inhabited by fierce and loyal people.
During the first half of the century, the people of Corsica belonged still to the Italian cultural world: the bourgeoisie sent children to [[University of Pisa|Pisa]] to study, official acts were redacted in Italian and most of the books were printed in Italian.<ref name=ra1124/> Moreover, many islanders sympathised with [[risorgimento|the national struggle]] which was taking place in nearby Italy in those years: several political refugees from the peninsula, like [[Niccolò Tommaseo]] spent years in the island, while some Corsicans like count [[Leonetto Cipriani]] took active part in the fights for Italian independence.

Despite all that, during those years the Corsicans began to feel a stronger and stronger attraction to France. The reasons for that are manifold: the knowledge of the French language, which thanks to the mandatory primary school started to penetrate among the local youth, the high prestige of the French culture, the awareness of being part of a big, powerful state, the possibility of well-paid jobs as civil servants, both in the island, in the mainland and in the colonies, the prospect of serving the French army during the wars for the conquest of the colonial empire, the introduction of [[steamboat]]s, which reduced the travel time between mainland France from the island drastically, and - last but not least - Napoleon himself, whose existence alone constituted an indissoluble link between France and Corsica. Thanks to all these factors by around 1870 Corsica had landed in the French cultural world.<ref name=ra1124>Ravis-Giordani (1991), p. 112-4</ref>

===Modern Corsica===
[[File:Monument-Solaro.jpg|thumb|Monument to the [[French Resistance]] during WWII in [[Solaro, Haute-Corse|Solaro]] (plaine orientale).]]
Corsica paid a high price for the French victory in the First World War: agriculture was disrupted by the years-long absence of almost all of the young workers, and the percentage of dead or wounded Corsicans in the conflict was double that of those from metropolitan France. Moreover, the protectionist policies of the French government, started in the 1880s and never stopped, had ruined the Corsican export of wine and olive oil, and forced many young Corsicans to emigrate to mainland France or to the Americas. As reaction to these conditions, a nationalist movement was born in the 1920s around the newspaper ''A Muvra'', having as its objective the autonomy of the island from France. In the 1930s, many exponents of this movement became [[Italian irredentism|irredentist]], seeing as the only solution to the problems of the island annexation to fascist Italy, which under [[Benito Mussolini]] had become one of the main goals of Italy's imperialist policy.

After the collapse of France to the German [[Wehrmacht]] in 1940, Corsica came under the rule of the [[Vichy French]] regime, which was collaborating with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Azéma|first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Wieviorka|first2=Olivier|title=Vichy, 1940-44|date=1997|publisher=Perrin|location=Paris|pages=231–33|language=French}}</ref> In November 1942 the island, following the [[Operation Torch|Anglo-American landings in North Africa]] was [[Italian occupation of Corsica|occupied by Italian and German forces]]. After the [[Italian armistice]] in September 1943, Italian and [[Free French Forces]] pushed the Germans out of the island, making Corsica the first French Department to be freed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Paletti|first1=C.|title=Un'operazione riuscita: Corsica settembre 1943|date=1999|publisher=Ufficio Storico Stato maggiore Esercito|location=Rome|language=Italian}}</ref> Subsequently, the US military established 17 airfields, nicknamed "USS Corsica", which served as bases for attacks on targets in German-occupied Italy.
[[File:Brando-Lavasina hameau-1.jpg|thumb|[[Brando, Haute-Corse|Brando]] in the [[Haute-Corse]] department]]

During the [[May 1958 crisis]], French paratroopers landed on Corsica on 24 May, garrisoning the French island in a bloodless action called "Operation Corse."<ref name="JMO">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article818845.ece |title=Jacques Massu obituary |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>

Between the late fifties and the seventies, the project of building a nuclear polygon in the mines of Argentella, the immigration of 18,000 former settlers from Algeria ("[[Pieds-Noirs]]") in the eastern plains, and continuing chemical pollution (''Fanghi Rossi'') from mainland Italy increased tensions between the autochthonous inhabitants and the French government. Tensions escalated until an armed police assault on a pieds-noirs-owned wine cellar in [[Aleria]], occupied by Corsican nationalists on 23 August 1975. This marked the beginning of the armed nationalist struggle against the French government. Ever since, [[Corsican nationalism]] has been a feature of the island's politics, with calls for greater autonomy and protection for Corsican culture and the [[Corsican language]]. Periodic flare-ups of raids and killings culminated in the assassination of Prefect [[Claude Érignac]] in 1998.

In 2013, Corsica hosted the first three stages of the 100th [[2013 Tour de France|Tour de France]], which passed through the island for the first time in the event's 110-year history.

==Geography==
[[File:Corsica-calvi-panorama.jpg|thumb|right|600px|The Bay of [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]: Corsica is the most mountainous Mediterranean island.]]
[[File:Speloncato general view.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Speloncato]]]]
Corsica was formed approximately 250 million years ago with the uplift of a granite backbone on the western side. About 50 million years ago sedimentary rock was pressed against this granite, forming the schists of the eastern side. It is the most mountainous island in the Mediterranean, a "mountain in the sea".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mouillot|first=F.|title=Mediterranean Island Landscapes: Natural and Cultural Approaches|year=2008|publisher=Springer|pages=223–225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij4qWj3dXRoC&pg=PA224&lpg=PA223|chapter=Corsica}}</ref>

It is also the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean, after [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Cyprus]].

It is {{convert|183|km}} long at longest, {{convert|83|km}} wide at widest, has {{convert|1000|km}} of coastline, more than 200 beaches, and is very mountainous, with [[Monte Cinto]] as the highest peak at {{convert|2706|m}} and 20 other summits of more than {{convert|2000|m}}. Mountains comprise two-thirds of the island, forming a single chain. Forests make up 20% of the island.

Approximately {{convert|3500|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the total surface area of {{convert|8680|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is dedicated to nature reserves ([[Parc naturel régional de Corse]]), mainly in the interior.<ref name=walk9>{{cite book|first=Gillian|last=Price|title=Walking on Corsica: Long-Distance and Short Walks|publisher=Cicerone Press Limited|isbn=1-85284-387-X|page=9}}</ref> Corsica contains the [[GR20]], one of Europe's most notable [[hiking trail]]s.

The island is {{convert|90|km}} from [[Tuscany]] in Italy and {{convert|170|km}} from the [[Côte d'Azur]] in France. It is separated from [[Sardinia]] to the south by the [[Strait of Bonifacio]], a minimum of {{convert|11|km}} wide.<ref name=walk9/>

===Major communities===
{{Main|Communes of the Haute-Corse department|Communes of the Corse-du-Sud department}}
In 2005 the population of Corsica was settled in approximately 360 communities.<ref>{{cite web|first=William|last=Keyser|title=Corsican Villages and Towns|publisher=Corsica Isula|year=2005|format=PDF|accessdate=29 April 2008|url=http://www.corsica-isula.com/downloads/Corsican_Villages_and_Towns.pdf}}</ref>

===Zones by altitude===
The island is divided into three major ecological zones by altitude.<ref>{{cite book|title=The ungovernable rock: a history of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom and its role in Britain's Mediterranean strategy during the Revolutionary War, 1793–1797|first=Desmond|last=Gregory|year=1985|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=London|isbn=0-8386-3225-4|page=16}}</ref> Below {{convert|600|m}} is the coastal zone, which features a [[Mediterranean climate]], with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The natural vegetation is Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and shrubs. The coastal lowlands are part of the [[Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests]] [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]], in which forests and woodlands of [[evergreen]] [[sclerophyll]] [[oak]]s predominate, chiefly [[holm oak]] (''Quercus ilex'') and [[cork oak]] (''Quercus suber''). Much of the coastal lowlands have been cleared for agriculture, grazing and logging, which have reduced the forests considerably.

There is considerable birdlife in Corsica. In some cases Corsica is a delimited part of the species range. For example, the subspecies of [[hooded crow]], ''[[Corvus cornix]]'' ssp ''cornix'' occurs in Corsica, but no further south.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=26307 ''Hooded Crow: Corvus cornix'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed, N. Stromberg]</ref>

From {{convert|600|to|1800|m}} is a temperate [[montane zone]]. The mountains are cooler and wetter, and home to the [[Corsican montane broadleaf and mixed forests]] ecoregion, which supports diverse forests of [[oak]], [[pine]], and broadleaf deciduous trees, with vegetation more typical of northern Europe. The population lives predominantly below {{convert|900|m}}, with only shepherds and hikers at {{convert|600|to|900|m}}.

From {{convert|1800|to|2700|m}} is a high [[alpine zone]]. Vegetation is sparse. This zone is uninhabited.

===Zones by region===
{{empty section|date=March 2014}}

===Parc Naturel Régional de Corse===
The island has a natural park ([[Parc Naturel Régional de Corse]], Parcu di Corsica), which protects rare animal and plant species. The Park was created in 1972 and includes the Golfe de Porto, the [[Scandola Nature Reserve]] (a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]), and some of the highest mountains on the island. Scandola cannot be reached on foot, but people can gain access by boat from the village of Galéria and Porto (Ota). Two endangered subspecies of hoofed mammals, the [[mouflon]] (''Ovis aries musimon'') and [[Corsican red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus corsicanus'') inhabit the park. The Corsican red deer was re-introduced after it was extinct due to over hunting. This Corsican subspecies was the same that survived on Sardinia, so it's [[Endemism|endemic]]. There are other species endemic to Corsica especially in the upper mountain ranges, i.e. [[Corsican nuthatch]], [[Corsican fire salamander]] and [[Corsican brook salamander]] and many plant subspecies.

===Extinct animals===
Corsica, like all the other Mediterranean islands, was home to indigenous animals of the [[Pleistocene]], some endemic to it and some to it and [[Sardinia]] (as Sardinia was joined to Corsica for much of the Pleistocene). After the proliferation of humans in the [[Mesolithic]], these began to disappear, partly from extinction of the species, and partly from eradication only in Corsica. However, it is now known that many species managed to survive the Mesolithic, and many were still present well into recorded history.<ref>{{cite book|title=Extinctions in Near Time: Causes, Contexts, and Consequences|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-46092-0|first=R.D.E.|last=MacPhee|author2=Hans-Dieter Sues|page=179}}</ref>

The globally extinct species are the ''[[Sardinian dhole]]'', ''[[Megaloceros cazioti]]'', ''[[Corsican giant shrew]]'', ''[[Tyrrhenian mole]]'', ''[[Sardinian pika]]'', ''[[Corsican-Sardinian vole]]'', ''[[Corsican-Sardinian wood mouse]]'', ''[[Bubo insularis]]'' and ''[[Athene angelis]]''. Birds were especially hard-hit. Some that were eradicated from the vicinity are ''[[White-tailed eagle|Haliaeetos albicilla]]'' and ''[[Eastern imperial eagle|Aquila heliaca]]''.

==Demographics==

[[File:Feliceto St-Nicolas Fb.jpg|thumb|Saint-Nicolas church in Feliceto]]
Corsica has a population of 322,120 inhabitants (Jan. 2013 estimate).<ref name=pop />

At the 2011 census, 56.3% of the inhabitants of Corsica were natives of Corsica, 28.6% were natives of [[Metropolitan France#Mainland France|Continental France]], 0.3% were natives of [[Overseas France]], and 14.8% were natives of foreign countries.<ref name=immig>{{cite web|url=http://insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?reg_id=99&ref_id=fd-rp19682011&page=fichiers_detail/rp19682011/telechargement.htm |title=Fichier Données harmonisées des recensements de la population de 1968 à 2011|author=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=2014-10-25|language=fr}}</ref>

The majority of the foreign immigrants in Corsica come from the [[Maghreb]] (particularly [[Moroccan people|Moroccans]], who made up 33.5% of all immigrants in Corsica at the 2011 census), and from Southern Europe (particularly [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], 22.7% of immigrants on the island), and [[Italian people|Italians]] (13.7%).<ref name=immig1>{{cite web|url=http://insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=IMG1B&millesime=2011&niveau=1&typgeo=REG&codgeo=94 |title=IMG1B – Les immigrés par sexe, âge et pays de naissance|author=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=2014-10-25|language=fr}}</ref>

==Culture==

===Languages===
{{Main|Corsican language|Ligurian (Romance language)}}
[[File:Dialetti corsi.png|thumb|right|200px|Chart of the dialects of the [[Corsican language]], which also extends into northern [[Sardinia]].]]
[[Italian language|Italian]] was the official language of Corsica until the 9th of May of [[1859]],<ref>Abalain, Hervé, (2007) ''Le français et les langues historiques de la France'', Éditions Jean-Paul Gisserot, p.113</ref> when it was substituted by [[French language|French]], starting a process of linguistic homologation which invested{{clarify|what does that mean? word choice?|date=May 2016}} Italian as well as the local Corsican languages. [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (''Corsu''), a [[minority language]] that is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] (''Toscano''), has a better prospect of survival than most of other [[Languages in France|French regional languages]]: Corsican is in fact, after [[French language|French]] (''Français''), the most widely spoken language on the island. However, since the annexation of the island by France in the 18th century, Corsican has been under heavy pressure from French, and today it is estimated that only 10% of Corsica's population speak the language natively, with only 50% having some sort of proficiency in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html |title=Euromosaic-Index1 |publisher=Uoc.edu |accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>

The language is divided into two main varieties: ''Cismuntanu'' and ''Ultramuntanu'', spoken respectively northeast and southwest of the Girolata - [[Porto Vecchio]] line. This division was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in Corsica during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the ''Cismuntanu'' became very similar to the Tuscan dialects, being part of the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language group]], while the ''Ultramuntanu'' could keep its original characteristics which make it much more similar to a [[Southern Romance languages|Southern Romance language]] like [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (''Sardu'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Italia dialettale|first=Giulio|last=Bertoni|year=1916|publisher=Hoepli|location=Milano|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Il linguaggio d'Italia|first=Giacomo|last= Devoto|authorlink=Giacomo Devoto|year= 1974|publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milano|language=Italian}}</ref> Therefore, due to the differences between the main dialectal varieties, many linguists classify Corsican as an Italo-Dalmatian language,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Romance Languages|first=Martin |last= Harris|first2= Nigel|last2= Vincent|year= 1997|isbn=0-415-16417-6|publisher=Routlegde|location=London}}</ref> while others consider it a Southern Romance one.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nordhoff, Sebastian; Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin, eds. |year=2013 |chapter=Italo-Dalmatian |title=Glottolog 2.2 |url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1286}}</ref>

It should also be noted that fewer and fewer people speak a [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian dialect]], known as ''bunifazzinu'',<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dialetti-liguri_%28Enciclopedia-dell%27Italiano%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani - Dialetti liguri]</ref> in what has long been a [[language island]], [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]]. In [[Cargèse]], a village established by Greek immigrants in the 17th century, [[Greek language|Greek]] (''Ελληνικά'') was the traditional language:<ref>[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/Work/cargese.talk.mell.pdf How Greek were the Greeks of Corsica? - Nick Nicholas]</ref> whereas it has long disappeared from spoken conversation, [[ancient Greek]] is still the liturgical language and the village has many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] parishes.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Corsica}}
From the mountains to the plains and sea, many ingredients play a role. Game such as wild boar (''Cingale'', ''Singhjari'') is popular. There also is seafood and river fish such as trout. Delicacies such as ''figatellu'' (also named as ''ficateddu''), made with liver, ''coppa'', ham (''prizuttu''), ''lonzu'' are made from Corsican pork (''porcu nustrale''). Characteristic among the cheeses is ''[[brocciu]]'' (similar to ricotta), which is used as a fresh ingredient in many dishes, from first courses (''[[Strozzapreti#Corsican Strozzapreti|sturzapreti]]'') to cakes (''[[fiadone]]''). Other cheeses, like ''casgiu merzu'' ("rotten cheese", the Corsican counterpart of the [[Sardinia]]n ''[[casu marzu]]''), ''casgiu veghju'' are made from goat or sheep milk. Chestnuts are the main ingredient in the making of ''pulenta castagnina'' and cakes (''[[falculelle]]''). A variety of alcohol also exists ranging from ''aquavita'' (brandy), red and white [[Corsica wine|Corsican wines]] (''Vinu Corsu''), muscat wine (plain or sparkling), and the famous "Cap Corse" apéritif produced by Mattei. The herbs which are part of [[Maquis shrubland|Maquis]] ({{lang-co|machja}}) and the chestnuts and oak nuts of the Corsican forests are eaten by local animals, resulting in the noticeable taste in the food there.

===Art===
{{See also|Music of Corsica}}
Corsica has produced a number of known artists: [[Alizée|Alizee]], [[Martha Angelici]] (opera singer), [[A Filetta]] (polyphonic chant group), [[:fr:Canta U Populu Corsu|Canta U Populu Corsu]] (band), [[Laetitia Casta]] (model/actress), [[Baptiste Giabiconi]] (model/singer), [[:fr:Julien de Casabianca-Caumer|Julien de Casabianca]] (cineast), [[Jérôme Ferrari]] (writer), [[Patrick Fiori]] (singer), [[Petru Guelfucci]] (singer), [[José Luccioni]] (opera singer), [[Gaston Micheletti]] (opera singer), [[I Muvrini]] (band), [[Jenifer (singer)|Jenifer]] (singer), [[François Lanzi]] (painter), [[Ange Leccia]] (visual art), [[Henri Padovani]] (musician, original guitarist from the Police), [[Thierry de Peretti]] (cineast), [[Marie-Claude Pietragalla]] (dancer), [[Jean-Paul Poletti]] (singer), [[Robin Renucci]] (comedian), [[Tino Rossi]] (singer), [[César Vezzani]] (opera singer).

===Sport===

[[AC Ajaccio]] and [[SC Bastia]] are the two main football teams, which have played the [[Ligue 1]] frequently since the 1960s and contest the [[Corsica derby]]. Since 2015, Gazélec Ajaccio, the city's second team, has began playing in the Ligue 1. The [[Tour de Corse]] is a rally held since 1956, which was a round of the [[World Rally Championship]] from 1973 to 2008 and later the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] and [[European Rally Championship]].

==Administration==
[[File:Map of Corsica.svg|thumb|right|160px|Map of Corsica]]
Before 1975, Corsica was a ''[[départment]]'' of the [[regions of France|French region]] of [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]. In 1975 two new départements, [[Haute-Corse]] and [[Corse-du-Sud]], were created by splitting the hitherto united departement of Corsica.

On 2 March 1982, a law was passed that gave Corsica the status of ''[[territorial collectivity]]'' (''collectivité territoriale''), abolishing the Corsican Regional Council which had existed before. Unlike the regional councils, the Corsican Assembly has executive powers over the island.

In 1992, three institutions were formed in the territorial collectivity of Corsica:
* The [[Executive Council of Corsica]], which exercises the type of executive functions held in other French regions by the presidents of the Regional Councils. It ensures the stability and consistency needed to manage the affairs of the territory;
* The [[Corsican Assembly]], a deliberative, [[unicameral]] [[legislature|legislative body]] with greater powers than the regional councils on the mainland;
* The [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council of Corsica]], an advisory body.

A [[Corsican autonomy referendum, 2003|local referendum]] held in 2003, aimed at abolishing the two ''départements'' to leave a territorial collectivity with extended powers, was voted down by a narrow margin. However, the issue of [[Corsican nationalism|Corsican autonomy]] and greater powers for the [[Corsican Assembly]] continues to hold sway over Corsican politics.

==Economy==
[[File:Propriano 1.jpg|thumb|225px|Corsica's coastline is a major driver for tourism – coastline by the town of [[Propriano]]]]
Corsica is the least economically developed region in [[Metropolitan France]].<ref name=eurostat>{{cite web|title= GDP per inhabitant in 2006 ranged from 25% of the EU27 average in Nord-Est in Romania to 336% in Inner London| publisher=Eurostat| url= http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PGP_PRD_CAT_PREREL/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2009/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2009_MONTH_02/1-19022009-EN-AP.PDF}}</ref> Tourism plays a big part in the Corsican economy. The island's climate, mountains, and coastlines make it popular among tourists. The island has not had the same level of intensive development as other parts of the Mediterranean and is thus mainly unspoiled. Tourism is particularly concentrated in the area around Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio in the south of the island and Calvi in the northwest.

In 1584 the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] governor ordered all farmers and landowners to plant four trees yearly; a [[chestnut]], [[olive]], [[ficus|fig]], and [[mulberry]] tree. Many communities owe their origin and former richness to the ensuing chestnut woods.<ref name = terracorsa>[http://www.terracorsa.info/chestnut/chestnut.html The Chestnut Tree] in terracorsa.</ref> Chestnut bread keeps fresh for as long as two weeks.<ref name = grocer>[http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/books/grocersencyclopedia/ency.html ''The Grocer's Encyclopedia – Encyclopedia of Foods and Beverages'']. By Artemas Ward. New York. 1911.</ref> Corsica produces gourmet cheese, wine, sausages, and honey for sale in mainland France and for export. Corsican honey, of which there are six official varieties, is certified as to its origin ([[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]) by the French National Institute of Origin and Quality ([[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine]] – INAO).

Corsica's main exports are granite and marble, tannic acid, cork, cheese, wine, citrus fruit, olive oil and cigarettes.<ref>[http://www.french-at-a-touch.com/French_Regions/Corsica/corsica_8.htm]</ref>

==Transport==

===Airports===
Corsica has four international airports: 
*[[Ajaccio Napoleon Bonaparte Airport]] 
*[[Bastia – Poretta Airport]] 
*[[Calvi – Sainte-Catherine Airport ]]
*[[Figari–Sud Corse Airport]] (near Bonifacio and Porto Vecchio in the south)

All airports are served by regional French airline [[Air Corsica]], as well as Air France which mainly offers connections to [[Orly Airport|Paris-Orly]]. Budget carriers such as [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]] offer seasonal connections to different cities in Europe.

===Railway===
The island has {{convert|232|km|0|abbr=off}} of [[metre gauge railway]]. The main line runs between [[Bastia]] and [[Ajaccio]] and there is a branch line from [[Ponte Leccia]] to [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]. [[Chemins de Fer de la Corse]] (CFC) is the name of the regional rail network serving the French island of Corsica. For a list of stations, see [[Railway stations in Corsica]]. The railroad retains the air of a friendly local railroad and is an excellent way to get around the island, for both the inhabitants and tourists.<ref>For a detailed description of the railroad system see Simms, Wilfrid S., "The Railways of Corsica" (1997)(ISBN 0952888122).</ref>

There is a third line along the east coast that is not in use due to heavy damage during [[World War II]]. There has been talk of restoration, but no progress has occurred.

===Seaports===
[[File:Celebrity Silhouette Ajaccio 2015.jpg|thumb|Port of [[Ajaccio]]]]
Corsica is very well connected to the European mainland (Italy and France) by various car ferry lines. The island's busiest seaport is [[Bastia]] which welcomed more than 2.5 million passengers in 2012 <ref>{{citation | url = http://ec.europa.eu/transport/facts-fundings/statistics/doc/2012/pocketbook2012.pdf | title = EU transport in figures - Statistical Pocketbook 2012 | newspaper = [[European Commission]]}}</ref>
Second busiest seaport is [[Ajaccio]], followed by [[L'Île-Rousse]] and [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]. [[Propriano]] and [[Porto Vecchio]] in the south also have smaller ferry docks and are seasonally served from France (Marseille), while [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio's]] harbour is only frequented by smaller car ferries from the neighbouring island of [[Sardinia]].

The ferry companies serving Corsica are [[Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries]] (from Savona, Livorno and Piombino in Italy; Toulon and Nice in France), [[SNCM]] (from Marseille, Toulon and Nice in France), CMN - La Méridionale (from Marseille in France) and [[Moby Lines]] (from Livorno and Genoa in Italy).<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.corsica-ferries.co.uk | title = Corsica Ferries - Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.sncm.fr | title = SNCM - Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.lameridionale.fr/ | title = Compagnie méridionale de navigation (CMN) - Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.mobylines.com | title = Moby Lines - Official Website}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2012}}
There are several groups and two [[Corsican nationalism|nationalist]] parties (the [[autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] ''Femu a Corsica'' and the [[separatism|separatist]] ''Corsica Libera'') active on the island calling for some degree of Corsican [[self-governance|autonomy]] from France or even full independence. Generally speaking, regionalist proposals focus on the promotion of the [[Corsican language]], more power for local governments, and some exemptions from national taxes in addition to those already applying to Corsica.

The French government is opposed to full independence but has at times shown support for some level of autonomy. There is support on the island for proposals of greater autonomy, but polls show that a large majority of Corsicans are opposed to full independence.<ref>{{citation | url = http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/politique/20081001.OBS3635/89-des-corses-opposes-a-l-independance-de-l-ile.html | title = 89 % des corses opposés à l’indépendance de l’île | trans_title = 89% Corsicans are opposed to Corsican independence | newspaper = [[Nouvel Observateur]] | language = French}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rue89.com/rue89-politique/2012/08/06/quoi-pensent-les-corses-quand-ils-pensent-la-corse-234434 Enquête: la Corse vue par les Corses - Rue89, Le nouvel observateur]</ref>

In 1972, the Italian company Montedison dumped toxic waste off the Corsican coast, creating what looked like red mud in waters around the island with the poisoning of the sea, the most visible effects being [[cetaceans]] found dead on the shores. At that time the Corsican people felt that the French government did not support them since it did not complain to Italy to make this situation change. To stop the poisoning, one ship carrying toxic waste from Italy was bombed.<ref name=Blackwood>{{cite book|last=Blackwood|first=Robert J.|title=The State, the Activists and the Islanders: Language Policy on Corsica|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=140208384X|pages=164|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_State_the_Activists_and_the_Islander.html?id=zu1F5l4KwGcC}}</ref>

[[File:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Corsican nationalism|Corsican nationalists]] have used means such as the removal of French names on road signs.]]
Nationalist organisations started to seek money, acting like the [[Mafia]], to fund violence. Some groups that claim to support [[Corsican nationalism|Corsican independence]], such as the [[National Liberation Front of Corsica]], have carried out a violent campaign since the 1970s that includes [[bombing]]s and assassinations, usually targeting buildings and officials representing the French government or Corsicans themselves for political reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|title=France Moves to Crush Corsican Separatists|journal=The New York Times|date=15 January 1997|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/15/world/france-moves-to-crush-corsican-separatists.html|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> A war between two rival independence groups led to several deaths in the 1990s. The peaceful occupation of a ''[[pied-noir]]'' vineyard in [[Aléria]] in 1975 marked a turning point when the French government responded with overwhelming force, generating sympathy for the independence groups among the Corsican population.

In 2000, Prime Minister [[Lionel Jospin]] agreed to grant increased autonomy to Corsica. The proposed autonomy for Corsica would have included greater protection for the [[Corsican language]] (''Corsu''), the island's traditional language, whose practice and teaching, like other [[Languages of France|regional or minority languages in France]], had been discouraged in the past. According to the [[UNESCO]] classification, the Corsican language is currently in danger of becoming extinct.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corsican|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-340.html|work=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=24 November 2012|date=27 April 2011}}</ref> However, plans for increased autonomy were opposed by the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] opposition in the [[French National Assembly]], who feared that they would lead to calls for autonomy from other ''régions'' (such as [[Brittany]], [[Alsace]], or [[Provence]]), eventually threatening France's unity as a country.<ref>{{cite journal|title=French Cabinet Split Over Corsican Autonomy|journal=The New York Times|date=30 August 2000|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/french/corsica/corsica2.htm|accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref>

In a [[Corsican autonomy referendum, 2003|referendum]] on 6 July 2003, a narrow majority of Corsican voters opposed a project from the government of [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] and then-[[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] that would have suppressed the two ''départements'' of the island and granted greater autonomy to the territorial collectivity of Corsica.<ref>{{cite web|title=A worrying result|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1914648|work=The Economist|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=24 November 2012|date=10 July 2003}}</ref>

On 13 December 2015, the regionalist coalition ''[[Pè a Corsica]]'' ({{lang-en|For Corsica}}), supported by both Femu a Corsica and Corsica Libera and led by Gilles Siméoni, won the territorial elections with a percentage of 36.9 %.<ref>[http://abp.bzh/article.php?id=39128 source]</ref><ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/14/corsican-nationalists-win-historic-victory-in-french-elections source]</ref>

On December 17, 2015, Jean Guy Talamoni is elected President of the Assembly of Corsica and Gilles Simeoni is elected executive President of council of the Region with a measure of autonomy of Corsica.<ref>[http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/corse/discours-de-gilles-simeoni-president-du-conseil-executif-de-corse-887597.html source]</ref>
