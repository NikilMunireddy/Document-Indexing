Independent politician

An '''independent''' or '''nonpartisan politician''' is an individual [[politician]] not affiliated to any [[political party]].  There are numerous reasons why someone may stand for office as an independent.
* Independents may support policies which are different from those of the major political parties. 
* In some parts of the world electors may have a tradition of electing independents, so standing for a political party is a disadvantage.
* In some countries (including [[Russia]]) a political party can only be registered if it has a huge number of members in more than one region, but in certain regions only a minority of electors support the major parties.
* In some countries (including [[Kuwait]]), political parties are unlawful and all candidates thus stand as independents.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Al-Zumai |first= Fahad |date= June 2013 |title= Kuwait's political impasse and rent-seeking behaviour: A call for institutional reform |url= http://www.lse.ac.uk/middleEastCentre/kuwait/documents/Kuwaits-political-impasse-and-rent-seking-behaviour.pdf |journal= Kuwait Programme on Development, Governance and Globalisation in the Gulf States |publisher= [[London School of Economics]] |volume= 29 |pages= 1–33 |accessdate= 1 January 2015}}</ref>

Some independent politicians may be associated with a political party, perhaps as former members of it, or else have views that align with it, but choose not to stand in its name, or are unable to do so because the party in question has selected another candidate. Others may belong to or support a political party at the national level but believe they should not formally represent it (and thus be subject to its policies) at another level.

In running for public office, independents sometimes choose to form a party or alliance with other independents, and may formally register their party or alliance. Even where the word "independent" is used, such alliances have much in common with a political party, especially if there is an organization which needs to approve the "independent" candidates.

==Australia==
{{main|Independent politicians in Australia}}
Independents have rarely been elected to the federal [[Parliament of Australia]], although they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. A large number of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the [[Australian Labor Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the [[Australian Greens]], or the [[National Party of Australia]]. In 2013 a political party named the [[Australian Independents]] was registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/australian-independents.htm|title=Australian Independents|work=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>

Currently, two independents sit in the [[Australian House of Representatives]], [[Andrew Wilkie]] from [[Division of Denison|Denison]] in [[Tasmania]] (former [[Australian Greens|Greens]] candidate) and [[Cathy McGowan (politician)|Cathy McGowan]] from [[Division of Indi|Indi]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Independent [[Australian Senate|Senators]] are quite rare. In modern politics, independent [[Brian Harradine]] served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times. [[Nick Xenophon]] has been the only elected independent Senator since his election to the Senate at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]]. Xenophon was re-elected for another six-year term at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|title=Senate Results: South Australia|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]] Senator [[John Madigan (Australian politician)|John Madigan]] became an independent Senator in September 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=217571|title=Senator John Madigan|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> while [[Palmer United Party|PUP]] Senators [[Jacqui Lambie]] and [[Glenn Lazarus]] became independent Senators in November 2014 and March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=250026|title=Senator Jacqui Lambie|publisher=APH|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=108616|title=Senator Glenn Lazarus|publisher=APH|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>

==Canada==
{{see also|Independent Liberal|Independent Conservative}}
Independent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of [[Independent Liberal]] or [[Independent Conservative]] MPs into the 1950s.

Independent politicians have held considerable sway in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] in recent years as Canada has been governed by successive [[minority government]]s with independent [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) sometimes sharing in the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]].

In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], [[Chuck Cadman]] was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the [[British Columbia]] [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Surrey North]]. Cadman had previously represented that riding on behalf of the [[Reform Party of Canada]] and [[Canadian Alliance]], but after the Canadian Alliance merged with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] to form the new [[Conservative Party of Canada]] in 2003, Cadman lost the nomination to represent the Conservative Party in that riding to [[Jasbir Singh Cheema]]. Cadman then stood in the subsequent election as an independent and defeated Cheema, as well as the candidates of other Canadian parties, by a significant margin.

In the spring of 2005, Cadman cast the tying vote in favour of a budget supported by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] government of [[Paul Martin]] as well as the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), but opposed by the opposition Conservatives and [[Bloc Québécois]].  Two other independents also voted on that budget. [[Carolyn Parrish]], independent MP for [[Mississauga—Erindale]], had recently been kicked out of the Liberal Party for criticizing US president George W Bush, but nonetheless sided with the Liberals on the budget vote. [[David Kilgour]] independent MP for [[Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont]], had previously quit the Liberal caucus and voted with the opposition parties against the budget. The tie vote required the [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons|Speaker of the House]] [[Peter Milliken]] to cast the deciding vote, and he did so in favor of the budget, allowing the government to survive.

Cadman was terminally ill with [[cancer]] at the time he cast his crucial vote, and he died later in 2005. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], his riding was won by NDP candidate [[Penny Priddy]]. Neither Parrish nor Kilgour (nor [[Pat O'Brien (politician)|Pat O'Brien]], MP for [[London—Fanshawe]], who quit the Liberal Party to sit as an independent after the 2005 budget vote) stood for re-election in 2006.

Another independent candidate, [[André Arthur]], was elected in the [[Quebec]] riding of [[Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier]] in 2006, and was the only independent to win a seat in that election. He was re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|October 14, 2008 federal election]]. Former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] MP [[Bill Casey]], who was expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 Federal Budget, also ran as an independent in the 2008 election, easily retaining his seat.

Candidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with "Independent" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent.

The territorial legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] are [[consensus government]]s with no political parties, so that all members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other subnational legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the [[British Columbia general election, 2009|2009 election]] in [[British Columbia]], independent candidate [[Vicki Huntington]] narrowly defeated incumbent [[Attorney General of British Columbia|Attorney General]] [[Wally Oppal]] as MLA for [[Delta South]].

True independents should not be confused with members of parties without [[official party status]] in a legislature. Most legislatures provide that a party must hold a certain number of seats to enjoy certain advantages in staffing, budget, ability to ask questions in [[Question Period]], and the like. Although members whose parties do not hold this status may have no more privileges than independent members, they remain representatives of political parties.

Also, members who are expelled from or choose to leave their party caucus may sit as "Independent" with some designation, e.g., "Independent Liberal" or "Independent Conservative", to indicate their affiliation to that party even if it is not officially recognized.

Election as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties.

==Taiwan==
After the last [[Taiwan local elections, 2014|local election]] in [[Taiwan]] on 29 November 2014, there are three independent local heads, which are:
* [[Chen Fu-hai]], [[List of county magistrates of Kinmen|Magistrate]] of [[Kinmen County]]
* [[Fu Kun-chi]], [[List of county magistrates of Hualien|Magistrate]] of [[Hualien County]]
* [[Ko Wen-je]], [[Mayor of Taipei|Mayor]] of [[Taipei|Taipei City]]

==Croatia==

After an inconclusive election in [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015|2015]] [[Tihomir Orešković (politician)|Tihomir Orešković]] was named the first non-partisan [[Prime Minister of Croatia]].

==Germany==
[[Joachim Gauck]], incumbent [[President of Germany]] since 2012 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, is currently the most prominent Independent politician. In the [[German presidential election, 2010|German presidential election of 2010]] he was the candidate of the  [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]], in [[German presidential election, 2012|2012]] the candidate of all major parties except [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]. His presidency—though his powers are limited—constitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since [[World War II]]. It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without no chances of election by the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer [[Luise Rinser]].

In the [[Bundestag]] parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of [[mixed-member proportional representation|personalized proportional representation]] (since 1949) allows any individual holding the [[suffrage|passive right to vote]] to stand for a direct [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] in the [[electoral districts]]—half of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a [[plurality voting system]]. Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first [[West German federal election, 1949|Bundestag election in 1949]] saw three independents elected; since then, no party-independent candidate has won a seat.<ref>[http://www.wahlrecht.de/lexikon/parteilose.html Unabhängige Direktkandidaten], last seen October 13th, 2012.</ref> At [[States of Germany|state]] level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a [[Landtag]] legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in [[local election]]s it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to [[Districts of Germany|districts]]', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a [[city council]] or even [[mayor]], especially in [[Northern Germany]]. In recent years, independents have formed [[Free Voters]] associations to enter Landtag parliaments, so far only successful in [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavaria]].

An independent [[Member of Parliament|MP]], who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of a ''[[non-inscrit]]'' ({{lang-de|fraktionsloser Abgeordneter}}) not affiliated to any [[parliamentary group]]. A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes an independent and ''non-inscrit''. In 1989 the Bundestag MP [[Thomas Wüppesahl]], who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a non-inscrit, for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decided partially in his favor.

After the [[Unification of Germany|German unification]] of 1871, the first [[Chancellor of Germany|Reich Chancellors]] ([[head of government|heads of government]]) ''de jure'' served as [[executive officer]]s of the [[German Empire|German Imperial states]] as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] period after [[World War I]], several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliaton: these chancellors were [[Wilhelm Cuno]] (1922–1923), [[Hans Luther]] (1925–1926), the former [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]] politician [[Franz von Papen]] (1932), and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] (1932–1933). The last two [[Cabinet of Germany|cabinets]] appointed by Reich President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a non-partisan (though strongly [[Conservatism in Germany|Conservative]]) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]; many of the ministers were not party members.

Since World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though "on the ticket" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister [[Hans Leussink]] (1969–1972), and Minister of Economy [[Werner Müller (politician)|Werner Müller]] (1998–2002). Minister of Justice [[Klaus Kinkel]] only shortly after his appointment joined the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]] in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]], whose affiliation with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU [[party chair]]man in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by ''[[Der Stern]]'' magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949.<ref>[http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-altkanzler-ludwig-erhard-war-nie-cdu-mitglied-587764.html Stern: Ludwig Erhard war nie CDU-Mitglied], April 25th, 2007, last seen August 7th, 2012.</ref>

==Hong Kong==
More than half of Hong Kong's [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], and are not rare among [[geographical constituencies]]. All of them are nevertheless belonging either to the '[[Pan-democracy camp]]' (Pan-democrats) or the '[[Pro-Beijing camp]]' (Pro-Beijing/Royalists).

==Iceland==
The [[president]] of [[Iceland]] (currently [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]]) is independent. The 9th prime minister of Iceland, [[Björn Þórðarson]], was also independent.

==India==
Independents candidate contest to seek election on the basis of their personal appeal or want to promote their ideology different then any party . Also some are those candidates who are sidelined by party political rivals within party but confident to make it or have motive to not allowing other candidates  to get elected. Some contest genuinely and but few candidates are often criticised in India as being dummy candidates put forward by political parties to get around the spending ceiling imposed by the [[Election Commission of India|Election Commission]]. Independent candidates are sometimes also rebel candidates from a party contesting the election, who were unable to secure their party's nomination.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

Dummy candidates running as independents who bear the same or a similar name to a party candidate have also been put forward by political parties to confuse voters. For example, in the [[Indian general election, 2009|2009 general election]] an independent named Bhakti Adhikary contested the Tamluk constituency, allegedly to cause confusion to voters; the eventually elected contestant was [[Suvendu Adhikari]] of the [[All India Trinamool Congress]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Ireland==
After the [[Irish general election, 2011|Irish general election in 2011]], there were 16 independent [[Teachtaí Dála|TD]]s (Members of Parliament) in the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 10% of the total, excluding the three members of the [[United Left Alliance]] are also members of the Dáil Technical Group of Independent TDs.<ref name="technicalgroup">{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0309/1224291667861.html |publisher=Irish Times |date=9 March 2011 |title=TDs agree to form Dáil technical group |first=Deaglán |last=De Bréadún}}</ref> A further 3 TDs became Independent in the Dáil after [[Tommy Broughan]] TD and [[Willie Penrose]] TD left the Labour Party Parliamentary whip along with [[Denis Naughten]] TD who left the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party whip.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Róisín Shortall]] TD and [[Colm Keaveney]] TD joined these three on the Independent benches when they left the Labour Party Parliamentary whip in 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

There are twelve independent senators in the [[Members of the 24th Seanad|24th]] [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 20% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the [[National University of Ireland]] and two from [[Trinity College Dublin|Dublin University]]. There are also seven senators who are nominated by the [[Taoiseach]] who have also formed an independent technical grouping.

==Italy==
The Prime Ministers [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] (1993 - 1994), [[Lamberto Dini]] (1995 - 1996), [[Giuliano Amato]] (2000 - 2001), and [[Mario Monti]] (2011 - 2013) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the [[President of the Italian Republic]] between 1999 and 2006.

==Kosovo==
In [[Kosovo]],{{ref label|status|a|}} [[Atifete Jahjaga]] was elected the first female and Independent [[President]] of Kosovo. She was also the first female and Independent elected in the whole [[Balkans]].

==Malaysia==
Independents have rarely been elected to the [[Dewan Rakyat]] and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast.

Independent [[List of members of the Dewan Negara|Senators]] are quite rare.

Currently, one independent politician sits in the [[Dewan Rakyat]], [[Abdul Khalid Ibrahim]] from [[Bandar Tun Razak]], the constituency with the highest registered voters in [[Kuala Lumpur]] (former [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|PKR]] candidate).

==Mexico==
[[Jaime Rodríguez Calderón|Jaime Heliodoro Rodríguez Calderón]] (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname "El Bronco", is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] politician who is the current governor-elect for the northern state of [[Nuevo León]] and holds no political party affiliation. As of June 7, 2015 elected Governor for Nuevo León, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country.

==New Zealand==
Originally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties around the beginning of the 20th Century considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since [[New Zealand general election, 1943|1943]], although two independent candidates have been successful in [[by-election]]s (in both cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such.

The last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was [[Winston Peters]], who won the {{By-election link|Tauranga|1993}} in {{NZ electorate link|Tauranga}} electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. By the time of the [[New Zealand general election, 1993|next general election]], he had formed his own party ([[New Zealand First]]), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party  but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co-found their own parties, with varying levels of success — examples include [[Peter Dunne]], [[Taito Phillip Field]], [[Gordon Copeland]], [[Tau Henare]], and [[Alamein Kopu]]. Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as [[Frank Grover]] and [[Tuariki Delamere]].

There were two independent MPs in the [[49th New Zealand Parliament|last Parliament]]; [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]] and [[Hone Harawira]]. Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]'s leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the [[Māori Party]] and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the {{By-election link|Te Tai Tokerau|2011}} when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party, [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana]] and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There are also two parties other which have only a single MP  [[United Future]] with [[Peter Dunne]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] with [[David Seymour (politician)|David Seymour]]. Neither Dunne nor Seymour are classed as independents — Dunne's presence in Parliament is due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence is as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the {{NZ election link|2011}}. In the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]] there was one independent MP: [[Brendan Horan]], a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets.

Peter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re-registered.

==Niue==
In [[Niue]], there have been no political parties since 2003, when the [[Niue People's Party]] disbanded, and all politicians are ''de facto'' independents. The government depends on an informal coalition.

==Pakistan==
[[Pakistan]] is a Democratic country and also has Independent politician standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has  [[Pakistani general election, 2008|General Elections, 2008]] Elected 30 Members. In Election 2011 has won the 4 candidates in National Assembly.In General Election 2013, 9 seats won by independents.

==Poland==
The [[Poland|Polish]] [[Sejm]] is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although there have been attempts to create non-partisan ''Elector's Election Committees'' (pol. ''KWW''; they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g. [[Kukiz'15]], or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold)  However, during a Sejm term many Sejm Members switch parties or become independents.

Tickets like [[Civic Platform]] during the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2001|2001 election]] were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now.

The situation in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. However, only [[Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz]] is independent.

Three [[President of Poland|Presidents]] since 1990 have technically been independents. [[Lech Wałęsa]] was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]). [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] was a leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]], but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did [[Lech Kaczyński]], who was the first leader of [[Law and Justice]], [[Bronisław Komorowski]] ([[Civic Platform|PO]]) and [[Andrzej Duda]] ([[Law and Justice|PiS]]). The resignation is nothing more than a tradition, and the aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party).

==Philippines==
[[Noli de Castro]], the [[Philippines]]' former [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], [[Philippine general election, 2001|ran as senator]] in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino|Pwersa ng Masa coalition]] but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran [[Philippine presidential election, 2004|as vice president]] as a guest candidate of the administration [[Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan|K-4 coalition]] and won with just under majority of the vote.

Starting in 2001, several [[Senate of the Philippines|senators]] had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]], there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the [[Philippine Senate election, 2007|2007 Senate election]] when [[Gregorio Honasan]] (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier [[Philippine Senate election, 1995|elected in 1995]] as an independent candidate and being adopted by the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]-led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since [[Magnolia Antonino]] in [[Philippine Senate election, 1967|1967]], although Antonino was a guest candidate of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] then.

In the local level, former priest [[Eddie Panlilio]] was elected as governor of [[Pampanga]] in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated.

In the [[Philippine House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010 House of Representatives elections]], seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections.

In contesting elections, independent candidates are required by law to spend less than candidates nominated by a party.

==Russia==
All of Russia's [[President of Russia|Presidents]] have been independents. Former president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] declined an offer to join [[United Russia]], saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party.

[[Vladimir Putin]], the current president of Russia, is the head of the [[United Russia]] party, but is not its member, thus formally is independent.

==United Kingdom==

The [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]]. Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent ''annibynol'') or no term at all.

Some groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties. Some English examples are the [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]], the [[Epsom and Ewell Residents Association]], the [[Devizes Guardians]], the [[Derwentside Independents]], and the East Yorkshire Independents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.TheEYIP.co.uk|title=History of East YorkshireLearn about East Yorkshire|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>

===House of Commons===
:''See also [[List of UK minor party and independent MPs elected]]''.
Before the twentieth century it was fairly common for independents to be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], but there have been very few since 1945. When the journalist [[Martin Bell]] was elected at [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] in 1997, having stood on an anti-corruption platform, he was the first independent elected to the Commons since 1951.<ref name="GuardianMartinBell">[[Martin Bell]]'s 1997 election was the first election of an Independent in the UK since 1951: {{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2007/jun/03/martinbell | title=Martin Bell Profile | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=October 18, 2012 | location=London | date=3 June 2008}}</ref> He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001, but [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Dr Richard Taylor]] of the [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] party was elected for the constituency of [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]].

Two independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]], although both were defeated five years later: [[Peter Law]] was elected at [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]], and died on 25 April 2006; the resulting [[Blaenau Gwent by-elections, 2006|by-election]] elected [[Dai Davies (politician)|Dai Davies]] of the local party [[Blaenau Gwent People's Voice]]. The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent. In 2005 Richard Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest. This was notable for the fact that he was the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term.

Only one independent was elected to the Commons in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 election]]s, [[Sylvia Hermon]], the Member for [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], a [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] who left the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] because of its links with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].

There have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included [[Mike Hancock (British politician)|Mike Hancock]] (formerly a Liberal Democrat), [[Eric Joyce]] (formerly Labour) and [[Nadine Dorries]], a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time.

Independent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without  success. An example from the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] was [[Aston Villa]] supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the [[Sutton Coldfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton Coldfield constituency]] in protest at the way chairman [[Doug Ellis]] ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the [[Salisbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Salisbury constituency]], is [[Arthur Uther Pendragon]], a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of [[King Arthur]].

Other independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] but before the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]] was founded, British [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[George Galloway]] described himself as "Independent Labour".

On 23 March 2005 the [[Independent Network]] was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election.<ref>[http://www.independentnetwork.org.uk/Launch_news_release.html Launchdate of the Independent Network]</ref> The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections. It has an organic{{clarify|date=May 2014}} set of principles which are known as the Bell Principles and are very closely related to [[Committee on Standards in Public Life|Lord Nolan's Standards of Public Life]]. The Independent Network does not impose any [[ideology]] or political influence on their candidates.

In March 2009, the multi-millionaire [[Paul Judge|Sir Paul Judge]] established the [[Jury Team]], an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections.<ref name=Independant8Mar09>{{cite news | last = Gourlay  | first = Chris | title = Tycoon finances ‘X Factor’ party to clean up politics | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 2009-03-08 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | accessdate = 2009-05-10 | location=London}}</ref>

===House of Lords===
{{main|Crossbencher|Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords|Lords Spiritual}}
The [[House of Lords]] includes a large number of peers independent from political parties. Some are simply [[Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords|not affiliated]] with any grouping, whilst another, larger, grouping is given the official designation of [[Crossbench#United Kingdom|crossbencher]]s. Additionally the [[Lords Spiritual]] (bishops of the [[Church of England]]) do not have party affiliations.

===Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, Northern Irish Assembly===
In the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2003|2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections]], three [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] were elected as Independents: [[Dennis Canavan]] ([[Falkirk West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Falkirk West]]), [[Jean Turner|Dr Jean Turner]] ([[Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Strathkelvin and Bearsden]]) and [[Margo MacDonald]] ([[Lothians (Scottish Parliament region)|Lothians]]). In 2004 [[Campbell Martin]] ([[West of Scotland (Scottish Parliament region)|West of Scotland region]]) left the [[Scottish National Party]] to become an independent and in 2005 [[Brian Monteith]] ([[Mid Scotland and Fife (Scottish Parliament region)|Mid Scotland and Fife]]) left the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to become an independent. At the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections]] Margo MacDonald was again returned as an independent MSP and was elected as an independent for the third time [[Scottish Parliament election, 2011|four years later]]. She died in 2014 while still serving as member of the Parliament. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, there could be no by-election and her seat remained vacant until the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2016|2016 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26883278|title=Independent MSP Margo MacDonald dies|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=4 April 2014|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>

===Local elections===
The introduction of [[Directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly elected mayors]] in several parts of England has witnessed the election of independents to run councils in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Middlesbrough (borough)|Middlesbrough]], [[Borough of Bedford|Bedford]], [[Hartlepool (borough)|Hartlepool]] and [[Mansfield (district)|Mansfield]]. The first [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]], was [[London mayoral election, 2000|first elected]] as an independent, having run against the official Labour candidate [[Frank Dobson]]. He was subsequently re-admitted to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in December 2003 before his first re-election campaign.

Independent candidates frequently stand and are elected to local councils. There is a special Independent group of the [[Local Government Association]] to cater for them. A number of local authorities have been entirely or almost entirely composed of independent members, such as the [[City of London Corporation]], the [[Isles of Scilly Council election, 2009|Isles of Scilly Council]], and [[Comhairle nan Eilean Siar]] (Western Isles Council) in the [[Outer Hebrides]].

Roughly a quarter of the [[police and crime commissioner]]s elected in England and Wales in the [[England and Wales police and crime commissioner elections, 2012|2012 election]] were independents.<ref name=PCCs_uk>{{cite news|title=Q&A: Police and crime commissioners|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19504639|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=BBC News|date=12 November 2013}}</ref>

==United States==
{{see also|Third party officeholders in the United States}}

===President===
[[George Washington]] was the only president elected as an independent, as he was not formally affiliated with any party during his two terms.

[[John Tyler]] was expelled from the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in September 1841, and remained effectively an independent for the remainder of his presidency, later returning to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. He briefly sought re-election in [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844]] as a National Democrat, but withdrew over fear he would split the Democratic vote.

Since 1900, notable candidates running as independents for U.S. president have included Republican Congressman [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]], [[Ross Perot]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], and former [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in the [[United States third party and independent presidential candidates, 2004|2004]] and [[United States third party and independent presidential candidates, 2008|2008]] elections.

In 2008, Nader formed Independent Parties in [[New Mexico]], [[Delaware]], and elsewhere to gain ballot access in several states. This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for Federal races, including [[Joe Lieberman]] ([[Connecticut for Lieberman]]).

===Governor===
[[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], [[Alaska]] and [[Minnesota]] are the only states to have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors, [[Shadrach Bond]] and [[Edward Coles]]; [[James B. Longley]] in 1974 as well as [[Angus King]] in 1994 and 1998 from Maine; [[Lincoln Chafee]] in 2010 from Rhode Island; [[Julius Meier]] in 1930 from Oregon; [[Sam Houston]] in 1859 from Texas; and [[Bill Walker (American politician)|Bill Walker]] in 2014 from Alaska. [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]] is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as [[A Connecticut Party]] candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees.  Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is [[Jesse Ventura]], who actually ran as a member of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]].

In 1971, State Senator [[Henry Howell]] of [[Virginia]], a former Democrat, was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|lieutenant governor]] as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for [[Governor of Virginia|governor]] as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes.

There were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In [[Maine]], state legislator [[Barbara Merrill]] (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In [[Texas]], [[country music]] singer and [[detective fiction|mystery novelist]] [[Kinky Friedman]] received 12.43% of the vote, and State [[Comptroller]] [[Carole Keeton Strayhorn]] received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties.

In 2010, [[Florida]] governor [[Charlie Crist]] left the Republican party and became Independent (he later became a Democrat<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/27/charlie-crist-senate-race_n_774589.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Charlie Crist Comes Under Fire For Pulling Party Switch | date=27 October 2010}}</ref>) rather than face former [[Florida House of Representatives|state house]] [[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Marco Rubio]] in the Republican primary (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee [[Kendrick Meek]]).

In 2014, former [[Honolulu]] mayor [[Mufi Hannemann]] ran as an independent candidate for the [[Governor of Hawaii|governorship]] of the State of [[Hawaii]] after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. As a result, Democratic candidate [[David Ige]] was elected as governor with a plurality of 49%.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.kitv.com/politics/ige-takes-early-lead-in-hawaii-governors-race/29545058 | title=Democrat David Ige elected Hawaii governor | date=4 November 2014}}</ref>

===Congress===
There have been several independents elected to the [[United States Senate]] throughout history. Notable examples include [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] of [[Illinois]] (a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) in the 19th century, and [[Harry F. Byrd, Jr.]] of [[Virginia]] (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century.  Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]]. [[Nebraska]] senator [[George W. Norris]] was elected for four terms as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican [[Kenneth S. Wherry]] in 1942. [[Vermont]] senator [[Jim Jeffords]] left the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's [[party switching|change of party status]] was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50-50 between the Republicans and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] (with a Republican [[Vice President]], [[Dick Cheney]], who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]], and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the [[U.S. Senate election, 2002|Congressional elections in 2002]], when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat.

Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] is the longest serving independent member of Congress in American history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-president-democrat-145640890.html |title=Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders says he may run for president as a Democrat |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=2014-09-14 |accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref> He was an independent member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[United States House of Representatives, Vermont At Large|Vermont-at-large]] from 1991 to 2007. Sanders later won the open Senate seat of [[Jim Jeffords]] as an independent. [[Joe Lieberman]] is a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who, like Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., ran under a third party ([[Connecticut for Lieberman|Connecticut for Lieberman Party]]) in the [[Connecticut United States Senate election, 2006|2006 election]]. Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress. In 2012 [[Angus King]] was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine.  As of 2016, he has caucused with the Democrats.

The [[United States House of Representatives]] has also seen a handful of [[Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives|independent members]]. Examples include [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]], [[Virgil Goode]] of [[Virginia]], and [[Frazier Reams]] of [[Ohio]].

===State and local offices===
In August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from [[Kentucky Senate|Kentucky]], one from [[Oregon Senate|Oregon]], one from [[Tennessee Senate|Tennessee]], and one from [[New Mexico Senate|New Mexico]]. The representatives came from the states of [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]] (two), [[Maine House of Representatives|Maine]] (two), [[Vermont House of Representatives|Vermont]] (two), and [[Virginia House of Delegates|Virginia]] (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator [[Joseph Carraro]] left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection.

In November 2005 [[Manny Diaz (Florida politician)|Manny Diaz]] was elected Mayor of [[Miami, Florida]] as an independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/miami_mayor.html |title=Manny Diaz - Mayor of Miami |publisher=City Mayors |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> On June 19, 2007, [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent. [[Oscar Goodman]], Mayor of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] switched his affiliation to Independent from Democrat in December 2009.<ref>[http://www.kxnt.com/Mayor-Goodman-Switches-Party-Affiliation/5902291 Goodman Switches Party Affiliation. KXNT, Ret. December 16th 2009]</ref>[[Dan Hollingsworth]] has won four consecutive elections as an Independent since 1998 for mayor of the small city of [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]], [[Louisiana]], the home of [[Louisiana Tech University]].

The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is unique in that it is the only nonpartisan state legislature. In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is [[unicameral]]), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections. Members are allowed to register with political parties but choose not to reveal their affiliation while seated, as a professional courtesy. However, the political affiliation of party-affiliated members are considered [[open secret]]s and the parties exist in the legislature on an unofficial basis. Some members, such as [[Ernie Chambers]] of [[Omaha]], are independent of party officially, while others have not publicly disclosed their affiliation.
