The '''Indianapolis Motor Speedway''', located in [[Speedway, Indiana]], (an [[enclave]] suburb of [[Indianapolis]]) in the United States, is the home of the [[Indianapolis 500]] and the [[Brickyard 400]].<ref name="nrhpinv3">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=75000044}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory—Nomination Form: Indianapolis Motor Speedway |date=October 1985|author=Charleton, James H. |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=75000044|title=''Accompanying two photos from 1985''|photos=y}}</ref> It is located on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|0|spell=in}} west of [[Downtown Indianapolis]].

Constructed in 1909, it is the original speedway, the first racing facility so named. It has a permanent [[seating capacity]] estimated at 235,000<ref name="seating">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofstadiums.com/north-america/united-states/indiana/indianapolis-motor-speedway/ |title=Indianapolis Motor Speedway – World of Stadiums |publisher=Worldofstadiums.com |date=1909-08-12 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}</ref> with infield seating raising capacity to an approximate 400,000.<ref>[http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/stadium_list/100000.shtml List of stadiums with 100,000 plus capacity]</ref> It is the [[List of sports venues by capacity|highest-capacity sports venue in the world]].<ref>{{cite web|title=100 000+ Stadiums|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/stadium_list/100000.shtml|publisher=World Stadiums|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>

Considered relatively flat by American standards, the track is a two-and-a-half mile, nearly rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its inception: four {{convert|1/4|mi|m|adj=on}} turns, two {{convert|5/8|mi|m|adj=mid|-long}} straightaways between the fourth and first turns and the second and third turns, and two {{convert|1/8|mi|m|adj=on}} short straightaways, termed "short chutes", between the first and second, and third and fourth turns.

A modern [[Oval track racing#Combined road course|infield road course]] was constructed between 1998 and 2000, incorporating the western and southern portions of the oval (including the southwest turn) to create a
{{convert|2.605|mi|km|sing=on}} track. In 2008, the road course was modified to replace the southwest turn with an additional infield section for motorcycle racing, resulting in a {{convert|2.621|mi|km|sing=on}} course. Altogether, the current grounds have expanded from an original {{convert|320|acre|km2|1}} on which the speedway was first built to cover an area of over {{convert|559|acre|km2|1}}. Placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975 and designated a [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Site]] in 1987, it is the only such site to be affiliated with automotive racing history.

In addition to the [[Indianapolis 500]], the speedway also hosts [[NASCAR]]'s [[Brickyard 400]]. From 2000 to 2007, the speedway also hosted the [[United States Grand Prix]] for [[Formula One]]. The inaugural USGP race drew an estimated 400,000 spectators, setting a Formula One attendance record. In 2008, the speedway added the [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix]], a [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] event.

On the grounds of the speedway is the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum]], which opened in 1956. The museum moved into its current building located in the infield near the short chute between turns one and two in 1975; its previous building outside the track at the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road was razed for the construction of current IMS administration offices. Also on the grounds is the Brickyard Crossing Golf Resort, which originally opened as the Speedway Golf Course in 1929. The golf course has 14 holes outside of the track, along the backstretch, and four holes in the infield. The speedway was also the venue of the opening ceremonies for the [[1987 Pan American Games]].

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Carl G Fisher 1909.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl G. Fisher|Carl Graham Fisher]] (1874–1938) of Indiana, an American vehicle parts and highway entrepreneur, co-founder and first president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. May 1909.]]

Indianapolis businessman [[Carl G. Fisher]] first envisioned building the speedway in 1905 after assisting friends racing in [[France]] and seeing that Europe held the upper hand in automobile design and craftsmanship. Fisher began thinking of a better means of testing cars before delivering them to consumers. At the time, racing was just getting started on horse tracks and public roads. Fisher noticed how dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing. He also argued that spectators did not get their money's worth, as they were only able to get a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.<ref name="birthplace">{{cite web|title=FEATURES: Indianapolis Motor Speedway: Birthplace of Speed|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/racing/0906_indianapolis_motor_speedway_birthplace_of_speed/index.html|publisher=automobilemag.com|accessdate=November 24, 2010|date=May 2009}}</ref>

Fisher proposed building a circular track {{convert|3|to|5|mi|0}} long with smooth {{convert|100|–|150|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide|round=5}} surfaces. Such a track would give manufacturers a chance to test cars at sustained speeds and give drivers a chance to learn their limits. Fisher predicted speeds could reach up to {{convert|120|mph|abbr=on}} on a {{convert|5|mi|adj=on|0}} course. He visited the [[Brooklands]] circuit outside London in 1907, and after viewing the [[Banked turn|banked layout]], it solidified his determination to build the speedway.<ref name="birthplace"/> With dozens of car makers and suppliers in Indiana, Fisher proclaimed, "Indianapolis is going to be the world's greatest center of horseless carriage manufacturer, what could be more logical than building the world's greatest racetrack right here?"<ref name="history">{{cite web|title=Indy 500: Indianapolis Motor Speedway History|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/99999999/SPORTS0107/90429082/Indy-500-Indianapolis-Motor-Speedway-history|publisher=Indystar.com|date=May 14, 2010}}</ref>

Fisher began looking around the Indianapolis area for a site to build his track; he rejected two potential sites before finding level farmland, Pressley Farm, totaling {{convert|328|acre}} about {{convert|5|mi|0}} outside of Indianapolis. In December 1908, he convinced [[James A. Allison]], Arthur Newby, and Frank W. Wheeler to join him in purchasing the property for $72,000. The group incorporated the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Company on March 20, 1909, with a capitalization of $250,000, with Fisher and James Allison in for $75,000 apiece and Frank Wheeler and Arthur Newby on board for $50,000 each.<ref name="birthplace" />

Construction of the track started in March 1909. Fisher had to quickly downsize his planned {{convert|3|mi|adj=on|0}} oval with a {{convert|2|mi|adj=on|0}} road course to a {{convert|2.5|mi|adj=on}} oval to leave room for the grandstands. Reshaping of the land for the speedway took 500 laborers, 300 [[mule]]s and a fleet of steam-powered machinery. The track surface consisted of graded and packed soil covered by {{convert|2|in|cm|0}} of gravel, {{convert|2|in|cm|0}} of [[limestone]] covered with taroid (a solution of tar and oil), {{convert|1|-|2|in|cm|0}} of crushed stone chips that were also drenched with taroid, and a final topping of crushed stone. Workers also constructed dozens of buildings, several bridges, grandstands with 12,000 seats, and an {{convert|8|ft|adj=on}} perimeter fence. A white-with-green-trim paint scheme was used throughout the property.<ref name="birthplace" />

The first event ever held at the speedway was a helium gas-filled balloon competition on Saturday, June 5, 1909, more than two months before the oval was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fun Facts|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/history/35357-Fun-Facts/|publisher=indianapolismotorspeedway|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref> The event drew a reported 40,000 people.<ref name='history'/> Nine balloons lifted off "racing" for trophies; a balloon by the name of ''Universal City'' won the race, landing {{convert|382|mi}} away in [[Alabama]] after spending more than a day aloft.<ref name="birthplace" /> The first motorsport event at the track consisted of seven motorcycle races, sanctioned by the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM), on August 14, 1909. This was originally planned as a two-day, 15-race program, but ended before the first day was completed due to concerns over suitability of the track surface for motorcycle use.<ref name="scott">[http://www.indianareflections.com/index.asp Scott, D. Bruce; ''INDY: Racing Before the 500''; Indiana Reflections; 2005; ISBN 0-9766149-0-1.]</ref> These early events were largely planned by one of the top names in early auto racing promotion, [[Ernest Moross]], who earned fame for his bold and sometimes outlandish barnstorming events at fairgrounds tracks with racing star [[Barney Oldfield]].

[[Image:Indianapolis-motor-speedway 1909-0701.jpg|left|thumb|Artist's rendition of the original speedway plan (not an actual picture)]]

On August 19, 1909, fifteen carmakers' teams arrived at the track for practice. The track surface again became a concern with drivers being covered in dirt, oil, and tar and with ruts and chuckholes beginning to form in the turns. Speedway workers oiled and rolled the track prior to the gates opening to the public. Fifteen to twenty thousand spectators showed up, paying at the most $1 for a ticket. Halfway through the first {{convert|250|mi|adj=on}} event, race leader [[Louis Chevrolet]] was temporarily blinded when a stone smashed his goggles. [[Wilfred Bourque]], driving in a Knox, suffered a suspected rear-axle failure resulting in his car flipping end over end on the front stretch before crashing into a fence post. Both he and his mechanic, Harry Halcomb, died at the scene.<ref name="birthplace" />

The first day of car racing resulted in four finishes and two land speed records, but concerns over safety led AAA officials to consider canceling the remaining events. Fisher promised the track would be repaired by the next day and convinced officials that the show should go on. The second day saw 20,000 spectators, no major incidents, and additional speed records broken.<ref name="birthplace" />

On the third day of racing, 35,000 spectators showed up to watch the grand finale {{convert|300|mi|adj=on}} race. At {{convert|175|mi}} into the race, the right front tire blew on [[Charlie Merz]]'s car. His car mowed down five fence posts and toppled dozens of spectators. Two spectators and his mechanic, Claude Kellum, were killed in the crash. Ten laps later, driver Bruce Keen struck a pothole and crashed into a bridge support. The race was then halted and the remaining drivers given engraved certificates instead of trophies. The race resulted in the AAA boycotting any future events at the speedway until significant improvements were made.<ref name="birthplace" />

Fisher and his partners began looking into the idea of paving the track with bricks or concrete. Paving in 1909 was still relatively new with only a few miles of public roads paved, leaving little knowledge of what would work best. Traction tests were conducted on bricks, proving they could hold up. Less than a month after the first car races, the repaving project began. Five Indiana manufacturers supplied 3.2 million {{convert|10|lb|adj=on}} bricks to the track. Each was hand laid over a {{convert|2|in|adj = on}} cushion of sand, then leveled and the gaps filled with mortar. At the same time, a concrete wall {{convert|33|in}} tall was constructed in front of the main grandstand and around all four corners to protect spectators.<ref name="birthplace" /> The final brick added to the track was made of gold and laid in a special ceremony by [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Thomas R. Marshall]]. Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track the "Brickyard".<ref name="IMShistory1">{{cite web|title=IMS Milestones: 1906–1911 – Indianapolis Motor Speedway|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/history/35207-1906-1911-Milestones|publisher=Indianapolismotorspeedway.com|date=March 26, 2013}}</ref> Today, {{convert|3|ft|m}}, or one yard, of original bricks remain at the start-finish line.<ref name="IMShistory2">{{cite web|title=FAQs about the Indianapolis Motor Speedway|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/about/35550-FAQ/|publisher=Indianapolismotorspeedway.com|date=March 26, 2013}}</ref>

In December 1909, eleven drivers and a few motorcyclists returned for speed trials. Drivers soon reached speeds of up to {{convert|112|mph|abbr=on}} on the new surface.<ref name="birthplace" /> Racing returned in 1910, with a total of 66 automobile races held during three holiday weekends (Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day).<ref name="scott"/> Each weekend featured two or three races of {{convert|100|to|200|mi|km}}, with several shorter contests. Each race stood on its own and earned its own trophy. All races were sanctioned by the AAA (as were the Indianapolis 500 races through 1955). 1910 also saw the speedway host the National Aviation Meet, featuring [[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]] and highlighted by [[Walter Brookins]] setting a world record by taking a plane up to {{convert|4938|ft}}.<ref name='history'/>

A change in marketing focus led to only one race per year beginning in 1911.<ref name="scott"/> An estimated 80,000 spectators attended the [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first]] {{convert|500|mi|adj=on}} race on [[Memorial Day]], May 30, 1911. Forty cars competed with [[Ray Harroun]] winning at an average speed of {{convert|74.602|mph}}. While all the other drivers in the race had a [[riding mechanic]] in their car, Harroun decided to save weight and go faster by driving solo. So, to be able to see what was happening behind his No. 32 [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon "Wasp"]], he installed a [[rear-view mirror]]. It was the first time such a device was used in an automobile.<ref name="history"/>

===The golden age (1912–1929)===
[[File:HarvestClassicAd.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for an Indianapolis Motor Speedway "Harvest Classic" race]]
A classic race followed in [[1912 Indianapolis 500|1912]], when [[Ralph DePalma]] lost a five lap lead with five laps to go after his car broke down. As DePalma pushed his car around the circuit, [[Joe Dawson (racecar driver)|Joe Dawson]] made up the deficit to win. Three of the next four winners were European, with DePalma being the exception as an American national, though originally Italian born. These races gave Indy a worldwide reputation and international drivers began to enter. The 1916 race was shortened to 120 laps, for a number of reasons including a lack of entries from Europe (there were so few entries that the speedway itself entered several cars), a lack of oil, and out of respect for the [[World War I|war in Europe]].<ref name='history'/>

On September 9, 1916, the speedway hosted a day of short racing events termed the "[[Harvest Auto Racing Classic|Harvest Classic]]", composed of three races held at 20-, 50-, and 100-mile (32, 80 and 160&nbsp;km) distances.<ref>Dill, Mark; "A Forgotten Classic;" ''2006 Allstate 400 at the Brickyard Official Program;'' Indianapolis Motor Speedway; 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.champcarstats.com/year/1916.htm |title=1916 AAA National Championship Trail |publisher=Champcarstats.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/stats/champ/byyear.asp?Y=1916 |title=Compete channel |publisher=Motorsport.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> In the end, [[Johnny Aitken]], in a [[Peugeot]], would win all three events, his final victories at the facility. The Harvest Classic contests were the last races other than the Indianapolis 500 to be held on the grounds for seventy-eight years.

Racing was interrupted in 1917–1918 by [[World War I]], when the facility served as a military aviation repair and refueling depot. When racing resumed, speeds quickly increased.

In 1921, speedway co-founder Wheeler committed suicide.<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. "Indianapolis: The Richest Race in the World", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 9, p.1014.</ref>

At the 1925 event, [[Pete DePaolo]] became the first to average 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) for the race,<ref name='history'/> with a speed of {{convert|101.13|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="K1014">Kettlewell, p.1014.</ref>

In 1926, Fisher and Allison were offered "a fortune" for the speedway site by a local real estate developer.<ref name="K1014"/> They refused, selling instead to former racing driver (and World War One [[Flying ace|fighter ace]]) [[Eddie Rickenbacker|Edward V. Rickenbacker]] in 1927. How much he paid was not revealed.<ref name="K1015">Kettlewell, p.1015.</ref> Rickenbacker built a [[golf course]] in the infield.<ref name="K1015"/> The next year, Allison died from [[pneumonia]].<ref name="K1015"/>

===The "junkyard" formula (1930s)===
With the [[Great Depression]] hitting the nation, the purse dropped from a winners share of $50,000 and a total of $98,250 in 1930 to $18,000 and $54,450 respectively. There is a common misconception the rules were "dumbed down" to what was called the "junkyard formula" to allow more entries during the depression. The rules were indeed changed, but it was due to an effort by the speedway to get more car manufacturers involved in the race by discouraging the entry of specialized racing machines which dominated the 500 during the mid- to late-'20s. The rule changes, in fact, were already being laid out before the market crash.

In 1931, [[Dave Evans (driver)|Dave Evans]] performed a remarkable feat when his [[Cummins]] [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] Special completed the entire 500 miles without a [[pit stop]].<ref name="WOA 1">Kettlewell, Mike. "Indianapolis: The Richest Race in the World", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 9, p.1015.</ref> It was also the first diesel entrant.

In 1933, a record 42 cars started the 500. For 1934, a maximum fuel consumption limit was imposed, {{convert|45|USgal|impgal l|abbr=on}}.<ref name="WOA 1"/> It became {{convert|42.5|USgal|impgal l|abbr=on}} in 1935 and {{convert|37.5|USgal|impgal l|abbr=on}} in 1936.<ref name="WOA 1"/> When the limits resulted in several top competitors running out of fuel in the closing stages, the limits were abandoned,<ref name="WOA 1"/> though the use of [[pump gasoline]] was still mandatory.<ref name="WOA 1"/>

By the early 1930s, rising race speeds began to make the track increasingly dangerous, and in the period 1931–1935 there were 15 fatalities. This forced another repavement, with [[tarmac]] replacing the bricks in parts of the track. In addition, during the 1935–36 seasons the inside wall was removed in the corners, the outside wall was realigned (to change the angle compared to the track, reducing the potential for cars to vault over it), hard crash helmets became mandatory, and the first yellow light system was installed around the track. The continuing track dangers during this period, however, did not stop [[Louis Meyer]] or [[Wilbur Shaw]] from becoming the first two three-time winners, with Shaw also being the first back-to-back winner in 1939 and 1940.<ref name='history'/>

===Start of the Hulman era (1940s)===
[[File:Indianapolis Motor Speedway.svg|thumb|left|The IMS wing and wheel logo has been used since 1909. This variation was used from the 1970s through 2008.]]
At the beginning of the 1940s, the track required further improvements. In 1941, about a third of "Gasoline Alley" (the garage area) burned down before the race. With U.S. involvement in [[World War II]], the [[1942 Indianapolis 500|1942 500-mile race]] was cancelled in December, 1941. Late in 1942, a ban on all [[auto racing]] led to the canceling of the 500-mile race for the rest of the war, for a total of three years (1942–1945). The track was more or less abandoned during the war and fell into a state of disrepair.<ref name='history'/>

Many of the locals conceded that the speedway would be sold after the war and become a housing development. With the end of the war in sight, on November 29, 1944, three-time 500 winner [[Wilbur Shaw]] came back to do a {{convert|500|mi|km|sing=on}} tire test approved by the government for Firestone. Shaw was shocked at the dilapidated state of the speedway and contacted owner [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], only to discover that it was for sale. Shaw then sent out letters to the automobile industry to try to find a buyer. All the responses indicated that the speedway would be turned into a private facility for the buyer. Shaw then looked around for someone to buy the speedway, who would reopen the racetrack as a public venue. He found [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]] businessman [[Tony Hulman]]. Meetings were set up and the speedway was purchased on November 14, 1945. Though not officially acknowledged, the purchase price for the speedway was reported by the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'' and ''[[Indianapolis News|News]]'' to be $750,000. Major renovations and repairs were made at a quick pace to the frail speedway, in time for the 1946 race. Since the record 42 cars that started the 1933 edition of the 500, the field size has been set at 33 drivers, with only three exceptions to this rule, the first being 1947, when only 30 cars started due to a strike by certain teams affiliated with the ASPAR drivers, owners and sponsors association.<ref name='history'/>

Since then the speedway has continued to grow. Stands have been built and remodeled many times over, suites and museums were added, and many other additions helped bring back Indy's reputation as a great track.<ref name='history'/>

===The fabulous roadsters (1950s)===
In the 1950s, cars were topping out at {{convert|150|mph|abbr=on}}, helping to draw more and more fans. The low-slung, sleek cars were known as roadsters and the Kurtis, Kuzma, and Watson chassis dominated the field. Nearly all were powered by the [[Offenhauser]], or "Offy", engines. The crowd favorite [[Novi engine|Novi]], with its unique sound and look, was the most powerful car of the decade that dominated time trials. However, they would never make the full {{convert|500|mi|km}} in first place, often breaking down before the end or having to make too many pit stops because of the massive engine's thirst for fuel and the weight that went with the extra fuel.<ref name='history'/>

The track's reputation improved so much that the 500-mile race became part of the [[Formula One]] World Championship for 10 years (1950–1960), even though none of the Indy drivers raced in Formula One and only [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari's]] [[Alberto Ascari]] of the F1 drivers at the time raced in the 500 in 1952. Five time world champion [[Juan Fangio]] practiced at the speedway in 1958, but ultimately decided against racing there. The 1950s were also the most dangerous era of American racing. Of the 33 drivers to qualify for the 1953 race, nearly half, 16, were to eventually die in racing accidents.<ref name='history'/>

===Rear-engine revolution (1960s–1990s)===
[[File:Starting-line-at-the-Indianapolis-motor-speedway-1985.JPG|thumb|Starting line, featuring the Yard of Bricks]]
[[File:Indy500pylon.JPG|thumb|The pylon from 1994 until the 2014 SVRA vintage races in June.  It was replaced by a video screen for the 2014 Kroger Super Weekend.]]

In October 1961, the final remaining brick sections of the track were paved over with asphalt, with the exception of a distinct three-foot-wide line of bricks at the start-finish line. The "Brickyard" thus became known for its "Yard of Bricks". After being widely ignored by Formula One drivers when it was an F1 World Championship event, a wave of F1 drivers went to the speedway in the 1960s, and the [[Rear-engine design|rear-engine]] revolution that was started by the [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] F1 team changed the face of the 500 as well, with {{f1|1959}} and {{f1|1960}} world drivers' champion [[Jack Brabham]] of [[Australia]] qualifying his Cooper in 13th for the [[1961 Indianapolis 500|1961]] race. The Cooper used a smaller (2.7 liter) and less powerful [[Coventry Climax]] engine compared to the 4.4 liter Offy engines used by the other 32 cars and was slower on the straights, but many took note of the British car's superior handling through the turns. Brabham qualified 17th and after running as high as third, would ultimately finish ninth after completing all 200 laps. Despite this, many doubters claimed the rear-engine cars were for drivers who liked to be pushed around, though as Brabham said "It started the rear-engined revolution at Indy".

[[A. J. Foyt]], who had won his first 500 in 1961, won the [[1964 Indianapolis 500]], which was the last ever win for a front-engine car, and since [[Jim Clark]]'s win driving the rear-engine [[Lotus 38]] in [[1965 Indianapolis 500|1965]], every winner has driven a rear-engine car. [[Graham Hill]] won the following year in his first attempt, eventually becoming the only driver to date to achieve auto racing's "[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]" of winning the [[Monaco Grand Prix]], Indianapolis 500, and [[Le Mans 24 Hours]]. There were enough Americans to compete with them, with A.J. Foyt, [[Mario Andretti]], and the Unser brothers [[Bobby Unser|Bobby]] and [[Al Unser|Al]] leading the charge in the 1960s and 1970s, of whom Foyt and Al Unser would eventually become, respectively, the first two of three drivers, to date, to win four times each, while Bobby Unser won the race three times, with Andretti only ever winning the race once, in [[1969 Indianapolis 500|1969]]. Andretti would go on to race in F1 and win the world championship in {{f1|1978}} with [[Team Lotus]], who had been the first rear-engine winners at Indy, with Clark, in 1965.<ref name='history'/>

From 1970 to 1981, Indianapolis had a twin in the city of [[Ontario, California]], by the name of the [[Ontario Motor Speedway]]. This track was known as the "Indianapolis of the West" and the home of the California 500, but was a financial failure due to poor management and not holding enough races on the racetrack.<ref name='history'/>

In the 1977 Indy 500, [[Janet Guthrie]] made history when she became the first female driver to qualify for the race. Guthrie started the race from 18th position but retired with timing gear failure after 27 laps. She was eventually classified 29th. Nineteen-seventy seven also saw A.J. Foyt make history when he became the first driver to win the race four times.

Nineteen-seventy nine saw the second exception to the 1934 33-driver field rule. By the late 1970s there arose some resistance from certain car owners and drivers as to the direction being taken by [[United States Auto Club|USAC]], the auto racing sanctioning body that among other things, governed the Indianapolis 500 event. Some of the dissident teams formed their own racing body, [[Champ Car|Championship Auto Racing Teams]] ([[Champ Car|CART]]). USAC responded by barring six of the most famous teams in the sport from qualification (including Roger Penske and Dan Gurney), for "undermining the well-being of USAC". The ruling would sideline former Indy winners Bobby Unser, Al Unser Sr., Gordon Johncock, and Johnny Rutherford. After a court injunction in favor of CART, and a controversy where exhaust pipe rules were clarified after qualifications began and certain teams with an altered exhaust pipe were "locked into" the field, USAC held an additional qualification round on the day before the race, announcing that any driver who could post a faster speed than the slowest qualifier (Roger McCluskey) would be allowed to start the race. Bill Vukovich and George Snider were added to the lineup, bringing the field to 35. A crisis was averted for the moment, but USAC's handling of both issues was seen as bungling by some people, and as outright manipulation by others, and that year spelled the beginning of the end for USAC's governance of the Indy Car series.<ref name="memories">{{cite web|title=INDYCAR: CART/USAC Memories – Indy 1979|url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/indycar-cart-usac-memories-indy-1979//P2/|publisher=Fox Sports|date=May 6, 2009}}</ref>

The 1980s brought a new generation of speedsters, led by four-time race winner [[Rick Mears]] who also broke the 220&nbsp;mph (355&nbsp;km/h) speed mark in qualifying ([[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]]) and won six pole positions. Other stars of the decade included [[Danny Sullivan]], [[Bobby Rahal]], and F1 veteran [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]. The 1989 race came down to a final ten-lap, thrilling duel between Fittipaldi and [[Al Unser, Jr.]], culminating in Unser crashing in the third turn of the 199th lap after making contact with Fittpaldi's right front tire.<ref name='history'/>

The early 1990s witnessed [[Arie Luyendyk]] winning in what was then the [[1990 Indianapolis 500|fastest 500 to date]], with an average speed of {{convert|185.981|mph|abbr=on}}. That record was not eclipsed for almost a quarter of a century, until Tony Kanaan won the [[2013 Indianapolis 500|2013]] race with an average speed of over {{convert|187|mph|abbr=on}}. Rick Mears became the third four-time winner after a late-race duel with [[Michael Andretti]] in [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991]], and in [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992]], Al Unser, Jr. eked out a hard-fought victory by defeating last-place-starting driver [[Scott Goodyear]] by 0.043 of a second, a margin that is still the closest finish in race history. The 500 got a new look in 1996 when it became an [[Indy Racing League]] event, formed as a rival to CART.<ref name='history'/>

There was another qualifying controversy in 1997, arising over the IRL's "25/8 rule" which locked the previous year's top-25 overall points finishers into the Indianapolis race, regardless of their qualifying speed, leaving only eight spots open for entries to qualify on speed alone. The rule effectively guaranteed that IRL cars would get precedence over CART cars in the qualifying for the Indy 500. Two CART drivers who posted qualifying speeds fast enough to make the race were bumped to make room for slower IRL cars with more 1996 racing points. USAC complained to the IRL that the field would not include the 33 fastest cars. It was decided to add the two cars, driven by Johnny Unser and Lyn St. James, back into the field, once again bringing the number of starters to 35. This marked the last time the 500's starting field has been larger than 33 drivers.

===NASCAR and IROC at Indy===
{{See also|List of NASCAR race tracks}}

From 1919 to 1993, the 500 was the only race run at the Brickyard. When [[Tony George]] (Hulman's grandson) inherited the track, he brought more racing to the speedway, with [[NASCAR]] in 1994 (the [[Brickyard 400]], known from 2005 to 2009 as the Allstate 400 at The Brickyard), and an [[International Race of Champions]] (IROC) event in 1998.<ref name='history'/>

[[File:Ims02.svg|thumb|250px|left|Basic map of speedway]]
Starting in 2012, the Brickyard 400 is supported by both the [[Xfinity Series]] (the [[Lilly Diabetes 250]]) and also the Grand-Am [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] (Brickyard Grand Prix, until 2014). From 1998–2003, an IROC event was held as a support race. From 1982–2011, nearby [[Indianapolis Raceway Park]] held a Nationwide Series event known as the [[Kroger 200 (Nationwide)|Kroger 200]] which, since the Brickyard 400 in 1994, had been held the night prior to the IMS event. From 1995–2011, a [[Camping World Truck Series]] race, the [[AAA Insurance 200 (LOR)|AAA Insurance 200]], had also been held at IRP.

===Unification (2000s)===
The early 2000s saw drivers from the rival [[Champ Car|CART]] series begin to cross over to compete at the Indianapolis 500. In the [[2000 Indianapolis 500]], multiple CART champion team [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] brought their drivers [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] and [[Jimmy Vasser]] to Indianapolis. Montoya qualified second, led 167 laps and won the race convincingly, becoming the seventh Indy 500 rookie to win the race. The [[2001 Indianapolis 500|next year]], [[Team Penske]] made its return to the Indianapolis 500 after a five-year absence and was joined by Ganassi, [[Walker Racing]] and [[Michael Andretti]], driving for [[Andretti Autosport|Team Kool Green]] in a separate effort headed by Kim Green, known as "Team Motorola". For the second straight year, an Indy rookie won the race as [[Hélio Castroneves]] took the checkered flag. Roger Penske then elected to move his entire operation over to the IRL beginning in 2002, taking Castroneves and teammate [[Gil de Ferran]] with him. After fielding one car in 2002, Ganassi Racing followed Penske to the IRL full-time for the 2003 season. [[Michael Andretti]], who had left his long-time ride at [[Newman-Haas Racing]] because he wanted to run the Indianapolis 500 again (something they were not willing to do), bought a majority interest in CART's Team Green, which returned to Indianapolis in 2002 with [[Dario Franchitti]], [[Paul Tracy]] and [[Michael Andretti]], and moved it to the IRL that same year as [[Andretti Autosport|Andretti Green Racing]], and in 2004 former CART champion [[Bobby Rahal]]'s operation moved to the IRL as [[Rahal Letterman Racing]]. Castroneves repeated his Indianapolis 500 win in 2002 despite controversial circumstances involving a late race caution and a pass made by Tracy, and his teammate de Ferran won in 2003.<ref name='history'/>

[[File:DougBolesAt2015indy500.JPG|thumb|Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Doug Boles at the 2015 Indianapolis 500.]]
In 2003, the [[Firestone Indy Lights]] Series, a minor league series to the [[IndyCar Series]], made history with the first May race at the track since 1910, other than the 500. The [[Freedom 100]], first held during the final qualifying weekend, has been moved to "carburetion day" on the Friday before the 500. From 2005–2007, the [[Firestone Indy Lights]] Series became the first racing series since 1916 to run at the race course twice in one year. The first event being the Freedom 100, held on the oval track as part of the Indianapolis 500 weekend, and the second event, the [[Liberty Challenge]], during the United States Grand Prix weekend, competing on the Grand Prix road course.<ref name="faq">{{cite web|title=FAQs about the Indianapolis Motor Speedway|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/about/35550-FAQ/|publisher=Indianapolismotorspeedway|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>

[[Buddy Rice]] became the first American driver since 1998 to win the race in the rain-shortened [[2004 Indianapolis 500]]. At the time, Rice drove for the team co-owned by [[1986 Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Bobby Rahal]] and the Indiana native television talk show host and comedian [[David Letterman]]. In 2005, [[Danica Patrick]] became the first female driver to lead the race at Indianapolis, after acquiring it for a lap near the 125-mile (200&nbsp;km) mark while cycling through pit stops. [[Dan Wheldon]] would go on to win the [[2005 Indianapolis 500]].<ref name='history'/>

[[Sam Hornish Jr.]] became the first driver to ever overtake for the lead on the race's final lap, ultimately winning the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]] in the last {{convert|450|ft}} by a 0.0635-second margin over rookie [[Marco Andretti]]. [[Dario Franchitti]] became the first native of [[Scotland]] since [[Jim Clark]]'s victory in 1965 to win, in the rain-shortened [[2007 Indianapolis 500]].<ref name='history'/>

In mid February, 2008, Champ Car filed for bankruptcy. In late February, an agreement was reached for Champ Car to be merged with the IRL, and the first IRL [[IndyCar Series]] season since the unification took place in 2008. [[Scott Dixon]], driving for Chip Ganassi Racing, became the first native of [[New Zealand]] to win, in the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]].<ref name='history'/>

In the 100th anniversary year of the construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Hélio Castroneves became the sixth three-time winner of the 500 in the [[2009 Indianapolis 500]]. Danica Patrick also had her best finish ever (third place) in the race, also the best finish ever by a woman in the history of the Indianapolis 500.<ref name='history'/>

===Formula One and road course racing===
[[File:Indianapolis Motor Speedway - road course.svg|thumb|right|Formula One Grand Prix layout]]
[[File:Ims2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[2000 United States Grand Prix]] was the first event at IMS to be held clockwise.]]

In 1998, Tony George arranged for [[Formula One]] to return to the US for the first time since 1991. Two years of renovation and new construction for an [[roval|Indy-based road course]] led to the first [[United States Grand Prix]] there in [[2000 Formula One season|2000]], a race which was a success. The 2001 event's success (185,000 fans were reported in attendance) was even more important with the race, originally held in September, being the largest international sporting event held in the United States after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Kallmann |title=Drivers , organizers showing no fear – All involved feel safe after Sept . 11 attacks |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EED8C2CCA2D7E01&p_docnum=1&p_queryname=2 |format=NewsBank |work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |publisher=Journal Sentinel Inc |location=Wisconsin |page=10 |date=September 29, 2001 |accessdate=October 10, 2010 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref>

[[File:Formula one.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Cars wind through the infield section at the start of the 2003 United States Grand Prix.]]
The Grand Prix road course, unlike the oval, is raced in a clockwise direction. This follows the general practice of Formula One, in which the vast majority of circuits at the time ran clockwise (at the time, only [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] and [[Imola Circuit|Imola]] ran anti-clockwise).

The short history of the event is littered with controversies. The [[2002 United States Grand Prix]] was marred by a bizarre ending, in which [[Michael Schumacher]], having already clinched the championship, seemingly tried to stage a dead heat with team-mate [[Rubens Barrichello]]. The official timings showed Barrichello ahead by 0.011 seconds at the line, leading fans and media to dub the event a farce.<ref name="gphistory">{{cite web|title=United States Grand Prix history|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2004/6/1739.html|publisher=formula1.com|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref> The 2002 race was also the first ever Formula One race to use [[SAFER barrier]]s.

The [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] turned out to be one of the most controversial races in motorsport history. New rules meant cars had to use the same tires throughout the event. A crash during practice on the banked corner (the only banked corner on the F1 calendar) led to Michelin realizing their tires were ill-equipped for the banking, and could complete no more than a fraction of the race before failing. The Michelin teams were unable to find a solution, and while debates raged until the last second, the Michelin teams pulled into the pits at the end of the parade lap, leaving only the three Bridgestone teams to contest the race. As two of these teams were backmarkers under normal circumstances, this led to Ferrari winning the race, accepting the trophies from a presentation party hastily assembled after speedway boss [[Tony George]] refused to take part.<ref name="gphistory" />

The perceived outrage of this event put the future of Formula One at Indianapolis in doubt. However, the following year's event was held on July 2, 2006, on the American [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] weekend, with American [[Scott Speed]] driving for the new [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]] team. Speed had become the first American in Formula One since [[Michael Andretti]] drove for [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] in [[1993 Formula One season|1993]]. In this race, Speed became the first American to compete in a United States Grand Prix since [[Eddie Cheever]] in [[1989 Formula One season|1989]].<ref name="gphistory" />

During the [[2006 United States Grand Prix]], Formula One boss [[Bernie Ecclestone]] said that it did not matter to him whether or not there was a [[List of Formula One Grands Prix|Grand Prix]] in [[United States of America|America]], but also said he would be happy to discuss a new contract for the race. There was also a rumor going around that in future seasons, there would be two [[United States Grand Prix|Grands Prix]] held in the United States. Even with Ecclestone's statements, the [[2007 Formula One season|2007]] [[2007 Formula One season#Formula One 2007 race schedule|calendar]] was confirmed on October 31, 2006, following an extension of the race contract into 2007.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ecclestone digs in over US deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5108704.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=June 23, 2006}}</ref>

On July 12, 2007, it was announced that Formula One would not return to the IMS for {{F1|2008}}, although a continuation of USGP at the IMS has not been completely ruled out for the future. Tony George stated difficulties in meeting the demands of Ecclestone to continue to host the event. George and Ecclestone were in talks to revive the race for {{F1|2009}}, but no deal was made for a future race in Indianapolis.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miersma|first=Seyth|title=Formula One could Return to Indy by 2009 |url=http://eurosport.yahoo.com/07032008/58/indy-return-2009.html|publisher=Next Autos|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=March 7, 2008}}</ref> In a statement on April 10, 2008, Indianapolis chairman [[Joie Chitwood III|Joie Chitwood]] said that the "door is open" for Formula One to return to the circuit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indy remains 'open' to F1 return|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/news_article.aspx?id=42292|publisher=itv-f1.com|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=April 10, 2008}}</ref> However, on May 25, 2010, it was announced that Formula One would return to the United States in [[2012 Formula One season|2012]] at a new [[Circuit of the Americas|purpose-built track]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]].

===Motorcycle racing and a new road course===
{{See also|List of Grand Prix motorcycle races}}
[[File:Indianapolis Moto GP.svg|thumb|Moto GP Grand Prix layout]]

On July 16, 2007, the speedway announced that it would host a round of [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] beginning in 2008. The race was held for the first time on September 14, 2008, backed by [[Red Bull]] and known as the "[[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|Red Bull Indianapolis GP]]". This marked the first motorcycle racing event at the facility since its first month of operation, in August 1909.

Modifications approved by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] and [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] were made to the former Formula One circuit, bringing the new track to a total of 16 turns. The motorcycle course runs anti-clockwise, in the same direction as the oval events at the speedway, and completely bypass the banking of the oval with a new infield section inside turn one ("Snake Pit Complex"). Also, the double-hairpin at the Hulman Straight was replaced with traditional esses. This construction was completed before the opening day of the [[2008 Indianapolis 500|92nd Indianapolis 500]] in May, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=New IMS motorcycle circuit |url=http://www.racecar.com/Motorsport/News/New-IMS-motorcycle-circuit-../18003.htm|publisher=racecar.com|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=July 17, 2007}}</ref> The layout can be run clockwise (for car use, with or without the Snake Pit Complex) or anti-clockwise (for motorcycle use, with the Snake Pit Complex).

The first Moto GP event was heavily affected by the arrival of the remnants of [[Hurricane Ike]]. On race day, the weather was overcast and cold, with a 100% chance of rain during the event. The 125cc class started on a dry track, and went on until rain began to fall with seven laps to go. Since two-thirds of the scheduled distance had been run, the race was declared over and full points were given. Rain intensity then led the organizers to postpone the 250cc race until after the MotoGP race, hoping the winds and rain would stop. The MotoGP race was started at the scheduled time, with a very wet track but little rain. It ran until the 21st lap, when strong winds again began to blow. Fearing for the safety of the riders, the stewards red-flagged the race, which was declared completed, and full world championship points were given. The winds did not stop after the race, and safety concerns ultimately led to the cancellation of the 250cc race.<ref>{{cite web|title=MotoGP : 2008 Indianapolis – Repsol Honda – Sunday report|url=http://www.f1sa.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6715&Itemid=219|publisher=f1sa.com|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=September 15, 2008}}</ref>

===Super Weekend at the Brickyard===
[[Super Weekend at the Brickyard|Kroger Super Weekend]] is held in late July, with events building up to the annual [[NASCAR]] [[Brickyard 400]]. Races on the combined road course include [[United SportsCar Championship|TUDOR United Sports Car Championship]] [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway race results#Brickyard Grand Prix (since 2012)|Brickyard Grand Prix]] and [[IMSA Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge]] [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway race results#Brickyard Sports Car Challenge (since 2012)|Brickyard Sports Car Challenge]]

The [[NASCAR]] races taking place on the oval include the [[Xfinity Series]] [[Indiana 250]] on Saturday and the [[Sprint Cup Series]] [[Brickyard 400]] on Sunday.

===Grand Prix of Indianapolis===
{{main|Grand Prix of Indianapolis}}
On October 1, 2013, details of the Grand Prix of Indianapolis, an additional race for the 2014 IndyCar season and beyond, were announced. The inaugural event was scheduled for May 8–10, 2014 on the newly reconfigured 2.439-mile (3.925&nbsp;km), 14-turn Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course (a chicane replaces the long curve in turns five through seven) and the Snake Pit section is included. Spectator mounds were modified, along with special grandstand seating arrangements. This IndyCar road race began the month of May, with practice for the 2014 Indy 500 starting the day after the race. It was televised live by ABC TV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Details for 2014 GP of Indianapolis|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/speed/indycar/breaking-2014-details-for-gp-of-indianapolis-and-indy-500/}}</ref>

===Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational===
The Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational, held three weeks after the Indianapolis 500, is an event featuring over 500 vintage race cars using the road course. The races are sponsored by the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association.<ref name=sweetman>{{cite journal|last1=Sweetman|first1=Bruce|title=Open Invite|journal=[[Autoweek]]|date=July 6, 2015|volume=65|issue=13|page=11|issn=0192-9674}}</ref>

[[File:Brickyard Crossing Golf.svg|100px|left]]
[[File:IMS Centennial Era.svg|right|200px|thumb|This logo was used to commemorate the track's centennial celebration from 2009–2012, drawing on elements from 1909, 1933, and 1961.]]
Since 1977, the city of [[Indianapolis]] has hosted a [[half marathon]], which includes one lap around the speedway. Known as the "[[OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon]]", it usually starts the official events that occur prior to the Indy 500.

From 1960 to 1968, the Speedway Golf Course, originally built in 1929, hosted a [[PGA Tour]] event, the [[500 Festival Open Invitation]], in conjunction with Indy 500 race week. In 1968, it also held an [[LPGA]] event. From 1991 to 1993, the course was demolished and changed from a 27-hole layout (18 holes outside, nine in the infield) to an 18-hole championship course designed by legendary golf architect [[Pete Dye]]. The new course, renamed the "Brickyard Crossing Golf Resort" features 14 holes outside, and four holes in the infield, along with an infield lake. A [[Champions Tour]] event, the [[Brickyard Crossing Championship]], was hosted there from 1994 to 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brickyard Crossing Information|url=http://www.brickyardcrossing.com/content/General/Brickyard_Crossing_Information/129|publisher=Brickyardcrossing.com|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>

During the three-year centennial era, announced on May 23, 2008, special festivities which included a balloon festival to commemorate the first event, was held at two of the major races at the speedway, the Indianapolis 500, and the Brickyard 400. In February 2012, the facility was used to host events during the week of [[Super Bowl XLVI]], which was held in Indianapolis.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL Names Indianapolis Site of Super Bowl XLVI|url=http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/sportsent/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003805779|publisher=Brandweek|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=May 20, 2008}}</ref>
