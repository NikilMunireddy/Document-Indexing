==Etymology==
{{further|Hindu}}
The word ''Hindu'' is derived from the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]{{sfn|Flood|2008|p=3}}/[[Sanskrit]]{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} word ''Sindhu'', the Indo-Aryan name for the [[Indus River]] in the northwestern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] (modern day Pakistan and [[Northern India]]).{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}}{{refn|group=note|The Indo-Aryan word ''Sindhu'' means "river", "ocean".{{sfn|Flood|2008|p=3}} It is frequently being used in the [[Rigveda]]. The Sindhu-area is part of [[Āryāvarta]], "the land of the Aryans".}} According to [[Gavin Flood]], "The actual term 'Hindu' first occurs as a [[Persian language|Persian]] geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: ''Sindhu'')",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} more specifically in the 6th-century BCE inscription of [[Darius I]] (550–486 BCE).<ref name=arvindsharmahhhh>Arvind Sharma (2002), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, pages 2-3</ref> The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is a geographical term and did not refer to a religion.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} Among the earliest known records of 'Hindu' with connotations of religion may be in the 7th-century CE Chinese text ''Record of the Western Regions'' by [[Xuanzang]],<ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/> and 14th-century Persian text ''Futuhu's-salatin'' by 'Abd al-Malik Isami.{{refn|group=note|There are several views on the earliest mention of 'Hindu' in the context of religion:
#Gavin Flood (1996) states: "In Arabic texts, Al-Hind is a term used for the people of modern-day India and 'Hindu', or 'Hindoo', was used towards the end of the eighteenth century by the British to refer to the people of 'Hindustan', the people of northwest India. Eventually 'Hindu' became virtually equivalent to an 'Indian' who was not a Muslim, Sikh, Jain or Christian, thereby encompassing a range of religious beliefs and practices. The '-ism' was added to Hindu in around 1830 to denote the culture and religion of the high-caste Brahmans in contrast to other religions, and the term was soon appropriated by Indians themselves in the context of building a national identity opposed to colonialism, though the term 'Hindu' was used in Sanskrit and Bengali hagiographic texts in contrast to 'Yavana' or Muslim as early as the sixteenth century".({{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=6}})
#[[Arvind Sharma]] (2002) and other scholars state that the 7th-century Chinese scholar [[Xuanzang]], whose 17 year travel to India and interactions with its people and religions were recorded and preserved in Chinese language, uses the transliterated term ''In-tu'' whose "connotation overflows in the religious".<ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/> Xuanzang describes [[Hindu temple|Hindu Deva-temple]]s of early 7th century CE, worship of [[Surya|Sun]] deity and [[Shiva]], his debates with scholars of Samkhya and Vaisheshika schools of [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosophies]], monks and monasteries of Hindus, Jains and Buddhists (both Mahayana and Theravada), and the study of the [[Veda]]s along with Buddhist texts at [[Nalanda]].<ref>Stephen Gosch and Peter Stearns (2007), Premodern Travel in World History, Routledge, ISBN 978-0415229418, pages 88-99</ref><ref>Arvind Sharma (2011), Hinduism as a Missionary Religion, State University of New York Press, ISBN 978-1438432113, pages 5-12</ref><ref>Bonnie Smith et al (2012), Crossroads and Cultures, Combined Volume: A History of the World's Peoples, Macmillan, ISBN 978-0312410179, pages 321-324</ref>
#Arvind Sharma (2002) also mentions the use of word 'Hindu' in Islamic texts such those relating to 8th-century Arab invasion of Sindh by Muhammad ibn Qasim, Al Biruni's 11th-century text ''Tarikh Al-Hind'', and those of the Delhi Sultanate period, where the term 'Hindu' retains the ambiguities of including all non-Islamic people such as Buddhists and of being "a region or a religion".<ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2>Arvind Sharma (2002), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, pages 5-9</ref>
#[[David Lorenzen]] (2006) states, citing Richard Eaton: "one of the earliest occurences of the word 'Hindu' in Islamic literature appears in 'Abd al-Malik Isami's Persian work, ''Futuhu's-salatin'', composed in the Deccan in 1350. In this text, 'Isami uses the word 'hindi' to mean Indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word 'hindu' to mean 'Hindu' in the sense of a follower of the Hindu religion".<ref>David Lorenzen (2006), Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, Yoda Press, ISBN 978-8190227261, page 33</ref>
#David Lorenzen (2006) also mentions other non-Persian texts such as ''Prithvíráj Ráso'' by ~12th century Canda Baradai, and epigraphical inscription evidence from Andhra Pradesh kingdoms who battled military expansion of Muslim dynasties in 14th century, where the word 'Hindu' partly implies a religious identity in contrast to 'Turks' or Islamic religious identity.<ref>David Lorenzen (2006), Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, Yoda Press, ISBN 978-8190227261, pages 32-33</ref> One of the earliest uses of word 'Hindu' in religious context, in a European language (Spanish), was the publication in 1649 by Sebastiao Manrique.<ref>David Lorenzen (2006), Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, Yoda Press, ISBN 978-8190227261, page 15</ref>}}

Thapar states that the word ''Hindu'' is found as ''heptahindu'' in [[Avesta]] – equivalent to Rigvedic ''sapta sindhu'', while ''hndstn'' (pronounced ''Hindustan'') is found in a [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] inscription from the 3rd century CE, both of which refer to parts of northwestern South Asia.<ref>Romila Thapar (2004), Early India: From the Origins to A.D. 1300, University of California Press, ISBN 978-0520242258, page 38</ref> The Arabic term ''al-Hind'' referred to the people who live across the River Indus.{{sfn|Thapar|1993|p=77}} This Arabic term was itself taken from the pre-Islamic Persian term ''Hindū'', which refers to all Indians. By the 13th century, ''[[Hindustan]]'' emerged as a popular alternative [[Names of India|name of India]], meaning the "land of ''Hindus''".{{sfn|Thompson Platts|1884}}{{refn|group=note|In ancient literature the name ''Bharata'' or ''Bharata Vrasa'' was being used.({{harvnb|Garg|1992|p=3}})}}

The term ''Hindu'' was later used occasionally in some Sanskrit texts such as the later [[Rajatarangini]]s of Kashmir (Hinduka, c. 1450) and some 16th- to 18th-century [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] texts including ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]'' and ''[[Chaitanya Bhagavata]]''. These texts used it to contrast Hindus from Muslims who are called [[Yona#Later meanings|Yavanas]] (foreigners) or [[Mlecchas]] (barbarians), with the 16th-century ''Chaitanya Charitamrita'' text and the 17th century ''Bhakta Mala'' text using the phrase "Hindu [[dharma]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Word 'Hindu' in Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Texts| author = O'Conell, Joseph T.| journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society| volume= 93| number =3 | year =1973| pages=340–344| doi=10.2307/599467}}</ref> It was only towards the end of the 18th century that European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as ''Hindus''. The term ''Hinduism'', then spelled ''Hindooism'', was introduced into the English language in the 18th-century to denote the religious, philosophical, and cultural traditions native to India.<ref>Will Sweetman (2003), Mapping Hinduism: 'Hinduism' and the Study of Indian Religions, 1600-1776, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, ISBN 3-931479498, pages 163, 154-168</ref>

==Definitions==
Hinduism includes a diversity of ideas on [[Spirituality#Hinduism|spirituality]] and traditions, but has no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.<ref>[[Julius J.

===Typology===
{{Main|Hindu denominations}}

Hinduism as it is commonly known can be subdivided into a number of major currents. Of the historical division into six [[darsanas]] (philosophies), two schools, [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], are currently the most prominent.<ref>{{cite book|title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIvHQc0-rwgC&pg=PA28&dq=|author=Matthew Clarke|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011|page=28}}</ref> Classified by primary deity or deities, four major Hinduism modern currents are [[Vaishnavism]] (Vishnu), [[Shaivism]] (Shiva), [[Shaktism]] (Devi) and [[Smarta Tradition|Smartism]] (five deities treated as same).{{sfn|Nath|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=113, 154}} Hinduism also accepts numerous divine beings, with many Hindus considering the deities to be aspects or manifestations of a single impersonal absolute or ultimate reality or God, while some Hindus maintain that a specific deity represents the supreme and various deities are lower manifestations of this supreme.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=14}} Other notable characteristics include a belief in existence of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (soul, self), [[reincarnation]] of one's ātman, and [[karma]] as well as a belief in [[dharma]] (duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and right way of living).

McDaniel (2007) classifies Hinduism into six major kinds and numerous minor kinds, in order to understand expression of emotions among the Hindus.<ref name=junemcdaniel6>June McDaniel ''Hinduism'', in John Corrigan, ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion'', (2007) Oxford University Press, 544 pages, pp. 52-53 ISBN 0-19-517021-0</ref> The major kinds, according to McDaniel are, [[Folk Hinduism]], based on local traditions and cults of local [[deities]] and is the oldest, non-literate system; [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Hinduism]] based on the earliest layers of the [[Vedas]] traceable to 2nd millennium BCE; [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] Hinduism based on the philosophy of the [[Upanishad]]s, including [[Advaita Vedanta]], emphasizing knowledge and wisdom; [[Yoga|Yogic]] Hinduism, following the text of [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] emphasizing introspective awareness; [[Dharma|Dharmic]] Hinduism or "daily morality", which McDaniel states is stereotyped in some books as the "only form of Hindu religion with a belief in karma, cows and caste"; and [[Bhakti]] or devotional Hinduism, where intense emotions are elaborately incorporated in the pursuit of the spiritual.<ref name=junemcdaniel6/>

Michaels distinguishes three Hindu religions and four forms of Hindu religiosity.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=21}} The three Hindu religions are "Brahmanic-Sanskritic Hinduism,", "folk religions and tribal religions," and "founded religions.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=22}} The four forms of Hindu religiosity are the classical "karma-marga",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=23}} [[Jnana yoga|jnana-marga]],{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=24}} [[bhakti yoga|bhakti-marga]],{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=24}} and "heroism," which is rooted in [[Sannyasa#Warrior ascetics|militaristic traditions]], such as Ramaism and parts of political Hinduism.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=23}} This is also called [[Vīrya (Hinduism)|virya-marga]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=24}} According to Michaels, one out of nine Hindu belongs by birth to one or both of the Brahmanic-Sanskritic Hinduism and Folk religion typology, whether practicing or non-practicing. He classifies most Hindus as belonging by choice to one of the "founded religions" such as Vaishnavism and Shaivism that are salvation-focussed and often de-emphasize Brahman priestly authority yet incorporate ritual grammar of Brahmanic-Sanskritic Hinduism.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|pp=21-22}} He includes among "founded religions" Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism that are now distinct religions, syncretic movements such as [[Brahmo Samaj]] and the [[Theosophical Society]], as well as various ''[[Guru]]-ism'' and new religious movements such as [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] and [[ISKCON]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004|pp=22-23}}

Inden states that the attempt to classify Hinduism by typology started in the imperial times, when proselytizing missionaries and colonial officials sought to understand and portray Hinduism from their interests.<ref name=ronaldinden127/> Hinduism was construed as emanating not from a reason of spirit but fantasy and creative imagination, not conceptual but symbolical, not ethical but emotive, not rational or spiritual but of cognitive mysticism. This stereotype followed and fit, states Inden, with the imperial imperatives of the era, providing the moral justification for the colonial project.<ref name=ronaldinden127/> From tribal Animism to Buddhism, everything was subsumed as part of Hinduism. The early reports set the tradition and scholarly premises for typology of Hinduism, as well as the major assumptions and flawed presuppositions that has been at the foundation of Indology. Hinduism, according to Inden, has been neither what imperial religionists stereotyped it to be, nor is it appropriate to equate Hinduism to be merely monist pantheism and philosophical idealism of Advaita Vedanta.<ref name=ronaldinden127>Ronald Inden (2001), Imagining India, Indiana University Press, ISBN 978-0253213587, pages 117-122, 127-130</ref>

To its adherents, Hinduism is a traditional way of life.<ref>{{Citation | last = Insoll| first = Timothy| title = Archaeology and world religion| publisher = [[Routledge]]| year = 2001| url = https://books.google.com/?id=QNxnYjYRuOMC&pg=PA35| isbn = 978-0-415-22155-9}}</ref> Many practitioners refer to Hinduism as ''{{IAST|Sanātana Dharma}}'', "the eternal [[dharma|law]]" or the "eternal way".<ref>{{harvnb|Bowker|2000}}; {{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=xiii}}</ref> The [[Sanskrit]] word dharma has a much deeper meaning than [[religion]] and is not its equivalent. All aspects of a Hindu life, namely acquiring wealth ([[Artha]]), fulfillment of desires ([[kama]]), and attaining liberation ([[moksha]]) are part of dharma which encapsulates the "right way of living" and eternal harmonious principles in their fulfillment.<ref>{{cite book | title=Hinduism, A Very Short Introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | author=Knott, Kim | year=2000 | page=111}}</ref><ref>Paul Hacker, Dharma in Hinduism, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 34, No. 5, pages 479–496</ref>

''{{IAST|Sanātana Dharma}}'' refers to the "eternal" duties all Hindus have to follow, regardless of class, caste, or sect, such as honesty, refraining from injuring living beings, purity, goodwill, mercy, patience, forbearance, self-restraint, generosity, and asceticism. This is contrasted with [[Bhagavad Gita#Svadharma and svabhava|svadharma]], one's "own duty", the duties to be followed by members of a specific caste and stage of life.<ref group=web name="EB-sanatana dharma">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/665848/sanatana-dharma "The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica", ''sanatana dharma'', Encyclopedia Britannica]</ref> According to Knott, this also

According to the Encyclopædia Britannica,
{{quote|The term has also more recently been used by Hindu leaders, reformers, and nationalists to refer to Hinduism as a unified world religion. Sanatana dharma has thus become a synonym for the "eternal" truth and teachings of Hinduism, the latter conceived of as not only transcendent of history and unchanging but also as indivisible and ultimately nonsectarian.<ref group=web name="EB-sanatana dharma" />}}

Western stereotypes were reversed, emphasizing the universal aspects, and introducing modern approaches of social problems.{{sfn|King|1999}} This approach had a great appeal, not only in India, but also in the west.{{sfn|King|1999}} Major representatives of [[Neo-Vedanta|"Hindu modernism"]]{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} are [[Raja Rammohan Roy]], [[Vivekananda]], [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=256-261}}

[[Raja Rammohan Roy]] is known as the father of the [[Hindu Renaissance]].<ref name=hindu1>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Serinity|title=Hinduism|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NIxG6DWVY9AC&pg=PA87&dq=Rammohun+Roy+Father+of+Hindu+Renaissance#v=onepage&q=Rammohun%20Roy%20Father%20of%20Hindu%20Renaissance&f=false|accessdate=19 February 2015|isbn=9780761421160|year=2007}}</ref> He was a major influence on Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), who, according to Flood, was "a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} Central to his philosophy is the idea that the divine exists in all beings, that all human beings can achieve union with this "innate divinity",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} and that seeing this divine as the essence of others will further love and social harmony.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Vivekananda, there is an essential unity to Hinduism, which underlies the diversity of its many forms.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Flood, Vivekananda's vision of Hinduism "is one generally accepted by most English-speaking middle-class Hindus today."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=259}} Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan sought to reconcile western rationalism with Hinduism, "presenting Hinduism as an essentially rationalistic and humanistic religious experience."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=249}}

This "Global Hinduism"{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=265}} has a worldwide appeal, transcending national boundaries{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=265}} and, according to Flood, "becoming a world religion alongside Christianity, Islam and Buddhism",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=265}} both for the Hindu diaspora communities and for westerners who are attracted to non-western cultures and religions.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=265}} It emphasizes universal spiritual values such as social justice, peace and "the spiritual transformation of humanity."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=265}} It has developed partly due to "re-enculturation",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=267}} or the [[Pizza effect]],{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=267}} in which elements of Hindu culture have been exported to the West, gaining popularity there, and as a consequence also gained greater popularity in India.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=267}} This globalization of Hindu culture brought "to the West teachings which have become an important cultural force in western societies, and which in turn have become an important cultural force in India, their place of origin."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=267-268}}

Hinduism's tolerance to variations in belief and its broad range of traditions make it difficult to define as a religion according to traditional Western conceptions.{{sfn|Turner|1996-A|p=275}}

Some academics suggest that Hinduism can be seen as a category with "fuzzy edges" rather than as a well-defined and rigid entity. Some forms of religious expression are central to Hinduism and others, while not as central, still remain within the category. Based on this idea Ferro-Luzzi has developed a 'Prototype Theory approach' to the definition of Hinduism.<ref>Ferro-Luzzi, (1991)''The Polythetic-Prototype Approach to Hinduism'' in G.D. Sontheimer and H. Kulke (ed.) ''Hinduism Reconsidered''. Delhi: Manohar. pp. 187-95</ref>

==Diversity and unity==

===Diversity===
{{See also|Hindu denominations}}

Hinduism has been described as a tradition having a "complex, organic, multileveled and sometimes internally inconsistent nature."{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=434}} Hinduism does not have a "unified system of belief encoded in a declaration of faith or a [[creed]]",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} but is rather an umbrella term comprising the plurality of religious phenomena of India.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1962|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Halbfass|1991|pp=1–22}}</ref> According to the Supreme Court of India,
{{quote|Unlike other religions in the World, the Hindu religion does not claim any one Prophet, it does not worship any one God, it does not believe in any one philosophic concept, it does not follow any one act of religious rites or performances; in fact, it does not satisfy the traditional features of a religion or creed. It is a way of life and nothing more".<ref>{{harvnb|Klostermaier|1994|p=1}}</ref>}}

Part of the problem with a single definition of the term "Hinduism" is the fact that Hinduism does not have a founder.<ref>{{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=1, 7}}</ref> It is a synthesis of various traditions,<ref>{{harvnb|Lockard|2007|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}</ref> the "Brahmanical orthopraxy, the renouncer traditions and popular or local traditions."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=16}}

Some [[Hindu philosophies]] postulate a [[theism|theistic]] [[ontology]] of creation, of sustenance, and of the destruction of the universe, yet [[Atheism in Hinduism|some Hindus are atheists]], as they view Hinduism more as philosophy than religion.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Sense of unity===
Despite the differences, there is also a sense of unity.{{sfn|Halbfass|1991|p=15}} Most Hindu traditions revere a body of religious or [[sastra|sacred literature]], the [[Veda]]s,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} although there are exceptions.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=35}} These texts are a reminder of the ancient cultural heritage and point of pride for Hindus,<ref name=andreapinkney/><ref>Jeffrey Haines (2008), Routledge Handbook of Religion and Politics, Routledge, ISBN 978-0415600293, page 80</ref> with [[Louis Renou]] stating that "even in the most orthodox domains, the reverence to the Vedas has come to be a simple raising of the hat".<ref name=andreapinkney>Andrea Pinkney (2014), Routledge Handbook of Religions in Asia (Editors: Bryan Turner and Oscar Salemink), Routledge, ISBN 978-0415635035, pages 31-32</ref>{{sfn|Halbfass|1991|p=1}}

Halbfass states that, although Shaivism and Vaishaism may be regarded as "self-contained religious constellations",{{sfn|Halbfass|1991|p=15}} there is a degree of interaction and reference between the "theoreticians and literary representatives"{{sfn|Halbfass|1991|p=15}} of each tradition which indicates the presence of "a wider sense of identity, a sense of coherence in a shared context and of inclusion in a common framework and horizon".{{sfn|Halbfass|1991|p=15}}

====Indigenous developments====
The notion of common denominators for several religions and traditions of India was already noted from the 12th century CE on.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Lorenzen|2006|pp=1–36}}</ref> Lorenzen traces the emergence of a "family resemblance", and what he calls as "beginnings of medieval and modern Hinduism" taking shape, at c. 300-600 CE, with the development of the early Puranas, and continuities with the earlier Vedic religion.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=36}} Lorenzen states that the establishment of a Hindu self-identity took place "through a process of mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim Other."{{sfn|Lorenzen|1999|p=648}} According to Lorenzen, this "presence of the Other"{{sfn|Lorenzen|1999|p=648}} is necessary to recognise the "loose family resemblance" among the various traditions and schools,{{sfn|Lorenzen|1999|p=648,655}}

According to Nicholson, already between the 12th and the 16th centuries "certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy."{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}} The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions" has also been noted by Burley.{{sfn|Burley|2007|p=34}} Hacker called this "inclusivism"{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} and Michaels speaks of "the identificatory habit".{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus,{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=24-33}} and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other",{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=27}}{{refn|group=note|See also Arvind Sharma (2002), ''On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva''. Numen Vol. 49, Fasc. 1 (2002), pp. 1-36.}} which started well before 1800.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=26-27}} Michaels notes:
{{quote|As a counteraction to Islamic supremacy and as part of the continuing process of regionalization, two religious innovations developed in the Hindu religions: the formation of sects and a historicization which preceded later nationalism [...] [S]aints and sometimes militant sect leaders, such as the Marathi poet Tukaram (1609-1649) and Ramdas (1608-1681), articulated ideas in which they glorified Hinduism and the past. The Brahmins also produced increasingly historical texts, especially eulogies and chronicles of sacred sites (Mahatmyas), or developed a reflexive passion for collecting and compiling extensive collections of quotations on various subjects.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=44}}}}

This inclusivism<ref>Hackel in {{harvnb|Nicholson|2010}}</ref> was further developed in the 19th and 20th centuries by [[Hindu reform movements]] and [[Neo-Vedanta]],{{sfn|King|2001}} and has become characteristic of modern Hinduism.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

====Colonial influences====
{{See also|Orientalism}}

The notion and reports on "Hinduism" as a "single world religious tradition"{{sfn|King|1999|pp=100-102}} was popularised by 19th-century proselytizing missionaries and European Indologists, roles sometimes served by the same person, who relied on texts preserved by Brahmins (priests) for their information of Indian religions, and animist observations which the missionary Orientalists presumed was Hinduism.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=100-102}}<ref name=ronaldinden127/>{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|pp=14-15}} These reports influenced perceptions about Hinduism. Some scholars state that the colonial polemical reports led to fabricated stereotypes where Hinduism was mere mystic paganism devoted to the service of devils,{{refn|group=note|Pennington<ref>Brian K. Pennington (2005), Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0195166552, pages 76-77</ref> describes the circumstances in which early impressions of Hinduism were reported by colonial era missionaries: "Missionary reports from India also reflected the experience of foreigners in a land whose native inhabitants and British rulers often resented their presence. Their accounts of Hinduism were forged in physically, politically and spiritually hostile surroundings [impoverished, famine prone Bengal - now West Bengal and Bangladesh]. Plagued with anxieties and fears about their own health, regularly reminded of colleagues who had lost their lives or reason, uncertain of their own social location, and preaching to crowds whose reactions ranged from indifference to amusement to hostility, missionaries found expression for their darker misgivings in their production of what is surely part of their speckled legacy: a fabricated Hinduism crazed by blood-lust and devoted to the service of devils."}} while other scholars state that the colonial constructions influenced the belief that the ''Vedas'', ''Bhagavad Gita'', ''Manusmriti'' and such texts were the essence of Hindu religiosity, and in the modern association of 'Hindu doctrine' with the schools of Vedanta (in particular Advaita Vedanta) as paradigmatic example of Hinduism's mystical nature".{{sfn|King|1999|p=169}}{{refn|group=note|Sweetman identifies several areas in which "there is substantial, if not universal, agreement that colonialism influenced the study of Hinduism, even if the degree of this influence is debated":{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13}}
# The wish of European Orientalists "to establish a textual basis for Hinduism," akin to the Protestant culture,{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13}} which was also driven by a preference among the colonial powers for "written authority" rather than "oral authority."{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13}}
# The influence of [[Brahmin]]s on European conceptions of Hinduism.{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13}}
# [T]he identification of [[Vedanta]], more specifically [[Advaita Vedanta]], as 'the paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion'.{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13}}{{refn|group=subnote|Sweetman cites Richard King (1999) p.128.({{harvnb|King|1999}})}}{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13}} Several factors led to the favouring of Vedanta as the "central philosophy of the Hindus":{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13-14}}
## According to Niranjan Dhar's theory that Vedanta was favored because British feared French influence, especially the impact of the [[French Revolution]]; and Ronald Inden's theory that Advaita Vedanta was portrayed as 'illusionist pantheism' reinforcing the colonial stereotypical construction of Hinduism as indifferent to ethics and life-negating.{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13-14}}
## "The amenability of Vedantic thought to both Christian and [[Hindu]] critics of 'idolatry' in other forms of Hinduism".{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=14}}
# The colonial constructions of caste as being part of Hinduism.{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|pp=14-16}} According to Nicholas Dirks' theory that, "Caste was refigured as a religious system, organising society in a context where politics and religion had never before been distinct domains of social action.{{refn|group=subnote|Sweetman cites Dirks (2001), ''Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of Modern India'', Princeton University Press, p. xxvii}}
# "[T]he construction of Hinduism in the image of Christianity"{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=15}} 
# Anti-colonial Hindus{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|pp=15-16}} "looking toward the systematisation of disparate practices as a means of recovering a precolonial, national identity".{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=15}}{{refn|group=subnote|Sweetman cites Viswanathan (2003), ''Colonialism and the Construction of Hinduism'', p.26}}}} Pennington, while concurring that the study of Hinduism as a world religion began in the colonial era, disagrees that Hinduism is a colonial European era invention.<ref name=brianpennington5>Brian K. Pennington (2005), Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0195166552, pages 4-5 and Chapter 6</ref> He states that the shared theology, common ritual grammar and way of life of those who identify themselves as Hindus is traceable to ancient times.<ref name=brianpennington5/>{{refn|group=note|Many scholars have presented pre-colonial common denominators and asserted the importance of ancient Hindu textual sources in medieval and pre-colonial times:
#Klaus Witz<ref>Klaus G Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upaniṣads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 978-8120815735, pages 10-11</ref> states that Hindu [[Bhakti movement]] ideas in the medieval era grew on the foundation of Upanishadic knowledge and Vedanta philosophies.
#John Henderson<ref>John Henderson (2014), Scripture, Canon and Commentary, Princeton University Press, ISBN 978-0691601724, page 120</ref> states that "Hindus, both in medieval and in modern times, have been particularly drawn to those canonical texts and philosophical schools such as the Bhagavad Gita and Vedanta, which seem to synthesize or reconcile most successfully diverse philosophical teachings and sectarian points of view. Thus, this widely recognized attribute of Indian culture may be traced to the exegetical orientation of medieval Hindu commentarial traditions, especially Vedanta.

It is, states Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert.<ref name=vanbuitenen/> The [[Brihadaranyaka|Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] states it as:
{{quote|Nothing is higher than Dharma. The weak overcomes the stronger by Dharma, as over a king.

In the [[Mahabharata]], [[Krishna]] defines dharma as upholding both this-worldly and other-worldly affairs. (Mbh 12.110.11). The word ''Sanātana'' means 'eternal', 'perennial', or 'forever'; thus, 'Sanātana Dharma' signifies that it is the dharma that has neither beginning nor end.<ref>{{Citation|last=Swami Prabhupādā|first=A.

[[Artha]] is objective and virtuous pursuit of wealth for livelihood, obligations and economic prosperity. It is inclusive of political life, diplomacy and material well-being.

====Mokṣa (liberation, freedom from samsara)====
{{Main|Moksha}}
Moksha ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}} ''{{IAST|mokṣa}}'') or '''mukti''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|मुक्ति}}) is the ultimate, most important goal in Hinduism. In one sense, ''Moksha'' is a concept associated with liberation from sorrow, suffering and ''saṃsāra'' (birth-rebirth cycle). A release from this eschatological cycle, in after life, particularly in theistic schools of Hinduism is called ''moksha''.<ref>R.C.

===Moksha===
The ultimate goal of life, referred to as ''moksha'', ''[[nirvana]]'' or ''[[Samādhi|samadhi]]'', is understood in several different ways: as the realization of one's union with God; as the realization of one's eternal relationship with God; realization of the unity of all existence; perfect unselfishness and knowledge of the Self; as the attainment of perfect mental peace; and as detachment from worldly desires. Such realization liberates one from ''samsara'', thereby ending the cycle of rebirth, sorrow and suffering.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rinehart|2004|pp=19–21}}</ref><ref>J.

The meaning of ''moksha'' differs among the various Hindu schools of thought. For example, Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining ''moksha'' a person knows their "soul, self" and identifies it as one with Brahman and everyone in all respects.<ref name=karlpotter/><ref name=klausklost/> The followers of [[Dvaita]] (dualistic) schools, in moksha state, identify individual "soul, self" as distinct from Brahman but infinitesimally close, and after attaining ''moksha'' expect to spend eternity in a ''[[loka]]'' (heaven). To theistic schools of Hinduism, moksha is liberation from samsara, while for other schools such as the monistic school, moksha is possible in current life and is a psychological concept. According to Deutsche, ''moksha'' is transcendental consciousness to the latter, the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of "realizing the whole universe as the Self".<ref name="E.

''Moksha'' is more than liberation from life-rebirth cycle of suffering (''samsara''); Vedantic school separates this into two: ''jivanmukti'' (liberation in this life) and ''videhamukti'' (liberation after death).<ref>see:

While ancient Vedic literature including [[Upanishads]] make no mention of reincarnation of God, the [[Puranas]] and the Epics relate several episodes of the descent of God to Earth in corporeal form to restore ''dharma'' to society. Such an incarnation is called an [[avatar]]. The [[Dashavatara|most prominent avatars]] are of [[Vishnu]] and include [[Rama]] (the protagonist of the ''[[Ramayana]]'') and [[Krishna]] (a central figure in the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'').

Both theistic and atheistic ideas, for epistemological and metaphysical reasons, are profuse in different schools of Hinduism.

[[Shaivism]] is the tradition that focuses on [[Shiva]].

[[Shaktism]] focuses on goddess worship of [[Shakti]] or Devi as cosmic mother,<ref name=sskumar/> and it is particularly common in northeastern and eastern states of India such as Assam and [[West Bengal|Bengal]]. Devi is depicted as in gentler forms like [[Parvati]], the consort of Shiva; or, as fierce warrior goddesses like [[Kali]] and [[Durga]].

{{Main|Shruti|Smriti|List of Hindu scriptures}}
The ancient scriptures of Hinduism are in Sanskrit. These texts are classified into two: Shruti and Smriti. Hindu scriptures were composed, memorized and transmitted verbally, across generations, for many centuries before they were written down.<ref>Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., ISBN 1-4051-3251-5, see [[Michael Witzel]] quote on pages 68-69</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sargeant|Chapple|1984|p=3}}</ref> Over many centuries, sages refined the teachings and expanded the Shruti and Smriti, as well as developed Shastras with epistemological and metaphysical theories of six classical schools of Hinduism.

''Shruti'' (lit. that which is heard){{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=68}} primarily refers to the ''[[Veda]]''s, which form the earliest record of the Hindu scriptures', and are regarded as eternal truths revealed to the ancient sages (''[[rishi]]s'').{{sfn|Flood|2008|p=4}} There are four ''Vedas'' - ''[[Rigveda]]'', ''[[Samaveda]]'', ''[[Yajurveda]]'' and ''[[Atharvaveda]]''. Each Veda has been subclassified into four major text types – the [[Samhita]]s (mantras and benedictions), the [[Aranyakas]] (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), the [[Brahmanas]] (commentaries on rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices), and the [[Upanishads]] (text discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge).<ref name=gflood>Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0521438780, pages 35-39</ref><ref>A Bhattacharya (2006), Hindu Dharma: Introduction to Scriptures and Theology, ISBN 978-0595384556, pages 8-14; George M.

===Festivals===

[[File:Deepawali-festival.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The festival of lights- [[Diwali]], is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.]]
Hindu festivals ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Utsava''; literally: "to lift higher") are ceremonies that weave individual and social life to [[dharma]].<ref name=sandrarobinson/><ref name=yustf>Karen-Marie Yust (2005), Sacred Celebrations, in Nurturing Child and Adolescent Spirituality (Editor: Karen-Marie Yust), Rowman & Littlefield, ISBN 978-0742544635, page 234, see also Chapter 18</ref> Hinduism has many festivals throughout the year, where the dates are set by the lunisolar [[Hindu calendar]], many coinciding with either the full moon (''Holi'') or the new moon (''Diwali''), often with seasonal changes.<ref name=denisecushf>Sandra Robinson (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Editors: Denise Cush et al), Routledge, ISBN 978-0700712670, page 907</ref> Some festivals are found only regionally and they celebrate local traditions, while a few such as ''Holi'' and ''Diwali'' are pan-Hindu.<ref name=denisecushf/><ref>Lynn Foulston and Stuart Abbott (2009), Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, ISBN 978-1902210438, page 155</ref>

The festivals typically celebrate events from Hinduism, connoting spiritual themes and celebrating aspects of human relationships such as the Sister-Brother bond over the ''Raksha Bandhan'' (or [[Bhau-beej|Bhai Dooj]]) festival.<ref name=yustf/><ref>Dale Holberg et al (2000), Festival calendar of India, in Students' Britannica India, Volume 2, Encyclopedia Britannica (India), ISBN 978-0-85229-760-5, page 120, '''Quote:''' "Raksha Bandhan (also called Rakhi), when girls and women tie a rakhi (a symbolic thread) on their brothers' wrists and pray for their prosperity, happiness and goodwill.

===Pilgrimage===
{{See also|Tirtha (Hinduism)|Hindu_pilgrimage_sites_in_India|l2=Tirtha locations|Yatra}}
[[File:Kedarnathroute.jpg|200px|thumb|right| Pilgrimage to [[Kedarnath]]]]

[[Pilgrimage]] is not mandatory in Hinduism, though many adherents undertake them.<ref>The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India [Paperback], Fuller 2004</ref> While there are different yet similar pilgrimage routes in different parts of India, all are respected equally well, according to the universality of Hinduism. The following pilgrimage sites are most famous amongst Hindu devotees:
* Old Holy cities as per Puranic Texts: [[Varanasi]] formerly known as Kashi, [[Allahabad]] formerly known as Prayag, [[Haridwar]]-[[Rishikesh]], [[Mathura]]-[[Vrindavan]], and [[Ayodhya]].
* Char Dham (Famous Four Pilgrimage sites): The four holy sites [[Puri]], [[Rameswaram]], [[Dwarka]], and [[Badrinath]] (or alternatively the [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]]) compose the ''[[Char Dham]]'' (''four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit.
* Kumbh Mela: The ''[[Kumbh Mela]]'' (the "pitcher festival") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every 12 years; the location is rotated among [[Allahabad]], [[Haridwar]], [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]].
* Major Temple cities: [[Puri]], which hosts a major [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[Jagannath]] temple and [[Ratha-Yatra (Puri)|Rath Yatra]] celebration; [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]], home to the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple; [[Madurai]], which is home to [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]]; Three comparatively recent temples of fame and huge pilgrimage are [[Shirdi]], home to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]], [[Tirumala - Tirupati]], home to the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]; and [[Sabarimala]], where [[Swami Ayyappan]] is worshipped.
* Shakti Peethas: Another important set of pilgrimages are the ''[[Shakti Peethas]]'', where [[Shakti|the Mother Goddess]] is worshipped, the two principal ones being ''[[Kalighat]]'' and ''[[Kamakhya]]''.

==Person and society==

===Varnas===
{{Main|Varna (Hinduism)}}

Hindu society has been categorised into four classes, called ''varnas''. They are the ''[[Brahmin]]s'': Vedic teachers and priests; the ''[[Kshatriya]]s'': warriors and kings; the ''[[Vaishya]]s'': farmers and merchants; and the ''[[Shudra]]s'': servants and labourers.<ref>Arvind Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0195644418, pages 132-180</ref>

The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' links the ''varna'' to an individual's duty (''svadharma''), inborn nature (''svabhāva''), and natural tendencies (''[[guṇa]]'').<ref>{{Citation |last1=Hacker|first1=Paul|last2=Halbfass|first2=Wilhelm|title=Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedānta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k91ZnWPTwXoC&pg=PA264|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2581-7|page=264}}</ref> The ''[[Manusmriti|Manusmṛiti]]'' categorises the different castes.<ref group=web>[http://www.webcitation.org/5noFbaeZw Manu Smriti Laws of Manu] 1.87-1.91</ref>

A [[sannyasa|renunciant]] man of knowledge is usually called ''Varnatita'' or "beyond all varnas" in Vedantic works. The bhiksu is advised to not bother about the caste of the family from which he begs his food. Scholars like Adi Sankara affirm that not only is Brahman beyond all varnas, the man who is identified with Him also transcends the distinctions and limitations of caste.<ref>P. 143 ''Aspects of Hindu Morality'' By Saral Jhingran</ref>

===Yoga===
[[File:Shiva Bangalore .jpg|thumb|right|200px| text|A statue of [[Shiva]] in yogic meditation.]]
{{Main|Yoga}}

In whatever way a Hindu defines the goal of life, there are several methods (yogas) that sages have taught for reaching that goal. [[Yoga]] is a Hindu discipline which trains the body, mind and consciousness for health, tranquility and spiritual insight. This is done through a system of postures and exercises to practise control of the body and mind.<ref>Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses - Page 178, Suresh Chandra - 1998</ref> Texts dedicated to Yoga include the [[Yoga Sutras]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and, as their philosophical and historical basis, the Upanishads. Yoga is means, and the four major ''marga'' (paths) discussed in Hinduism are: [[Bhakti Yoga]] (the path of love and devotion), [[Karma Yoga]] (the path of right action), [[Rāja Yoga]] (the path of meditation), [[Jñāna Yoga]] (the path of wisdom)<ref name=bhaskaressentgeneral>{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994}}</ref> An individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding. Practice of one yoga does not exclude others.

===Symbolism===
[[File:Ganesha-aum.jpg|thumb|200px|The Hindu deity [[Ganesha]] is sometimes linked to the symbol ''[[Om]]''.<ref>Stephen Alter (2004), Elephas Maximus, Penguin, ISBN 978-0143031741, page 95</ref>]]
Hinduism has a developed system of symbolism and iconography to represent the sacred in art, architecture, literature and worship. These symbols gain their meaning from the scriptures or cultural traditions. The syllable ''[[Om]]'' (which represents the ''[[Brahman]]'' and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) has grown to represent Hinduism itself, while other markings such as the [[Swastika#Hinduism|Swastika]] sign represent auspiciousness,<ref>Wendy Doniger (2000), Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, Merriam-Webster, ISBN 978-0877790440, page 1041</ref> and ''[[Tilaka]]'' (literally, seed) on forehead – considered to be the location of spiritual third eye,<ref>A David Napier (1987), Masks, Transformation, and Paradox, University of California Press, ISBN 978-0520045330, page 186-187</ref> marks ceremonious welcome, blessing or one's participation in a ritual or rite of passage.<ref>SD Sharma (2010), Rice: Origin, Antiquity and History, CRC Press, ISBN 978-1578086801, pages 68-70</ref> Elaborate ''Tilaka'' with lines may also identify a devotee of a particular denomination. Flowers, birds, animals, instruments, symmetric [[mandala]] drawings, objects, idols are all part of symbolic iconography in Hinduism.<ref>TA Gopinath Rao (1998), Elements of Hindu iconography, Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 978-8120808782, pages 1-8</ref><ref>JN Banerjea, The Development Of Hindu Iconography, Kessinger, ISBN 978-1417950089, pages 247-248, 472-508</ref>

===Ahimsa, vegetarianism and other food customs===
{{Main|Ahimsa|Diet in Hinduism|Sattvic diet|Mitahara}}

Hindus advocate the practice of ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'' (non-violence) and respect for all life because divinity is believed to permeate all beings, including plants and non-human animals.<ref>Monier-Williams, ''Religious Thought and Life in India'' (New Delhi, 1974 edition)</ref> The term ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'' appears in the [[Upanishad]]s,<ref name="Radhakrishnan">{{Citation |last=Radhakrishnan |first=S |authorlink=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan |title=Indian Philosophy, Volume 1|edition=2nd |series=Muirhead library of philosophy |year=1929 |publisher= George Allen and Unwin Ltd. |location=London|page=148}}</ref> the epic [[Mahabharata]]<ref>For ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'' as one of the "emerging ethical and religious issues" in the {{IAST|Mahābhārata}} see: Brockington, John, "The Sanskrit Epics", in Flood (2003), p. 125.</ref> and ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'' is the first of the five ''[[Yamas]]'' (vows of self-restraint) in [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Patanjali's Yoga Sutras]].<ref>For text of Y.S. 2.29 and translation of ''{{IAST|yama}}'' as "vow of self-restraint", see: {{Citation |last=Taimni |first=I.

[[File:Gosala in Guntur, India.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A ''goshala'' or cow shelter at [[Guntur]]]]
In accordance with ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'', many Hindus embrace vegetarianism to respect higher forms of life. Estimates of strict [[lacto vegetarian]]s in India (includes adherents of all religions) who never eat any meat, fish or eggs vary between 20% and 42%, while others are either less strict vegetarians or non-vegetarians.<ref name="veg">Surveys studying food habits of Indians include: [http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6170E/x6170e09.htm#TopOfPage "Diary and poultry sector growth in India"], Quote:"'''An analysis of consumption data originating from National Sample Survey (NSS) shows that 42 percent of households are vegetarian, in that they never eat fish, meat or eggs.

===Ashrama===
{{Main|Ashrama}}
Traditionally the life of a Hindu is divided into four ''Āshramas'' (phases or life stages; unrelated meanings include monastery).<ref>Patrick Olivelle (1993), The Ashrama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, {{oclc|466428084}}, pages 1-29, 84-111</ref> The four ''asramas'' are: [[Brahmacharya]] (student), [[Grihastha]] (householder), [[Vanaprastha]] (retired) and [[Sannyasa]] (renunciation).<ref name=rks>RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, ISBN 978-8171566655, page 28</ref>

''Brahmacharya'' represents the bachelor student stage of life. ''Grihastha'' refers to the individual's married life, with the duties of maintaining a household, raising a family, educating one's children, and leading a family-centred and a [[Dharma|dharmic]] social life.<ref name=rks/> ''Grihastha'' stage starts with [[Hindu wedding]], and has been considered as the most important of all stages in sociological context, as Hindus in this stage not only pursued a virtuous life, they produced food and wealth that sustained people in other stages of life, as well as the offsprings that continued mankind.<ref name=aw0>Alban Widgery (1930), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 232-245</ref> ''Vanaprastha'' is the retirement stage, where a person hands over household responsibilities to the next generation, took an advisory role, and gradually withdrew from the world.<ref name=alnu>Albertina Nugteren (2005), Belief, Bounty, And Beauty: Rituals Around Sacred Trees in India, Brill Academic, ISBN 978-9004146013, pages 13-21</ref><ref>Saraswathi et al (2010), Reconceptualizing Lifespan Development through a Hindu Perspective, in Bridging Cultural and Developmental Approaches to Psychology (Editor: Lene Arnett Jensen), Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0195383430, page 280-286</ref> The ''Sannyasa'' stage marks renunciation and a state of disinterest and detachment from material life, generally without any meaningful property or home (Ascetic), and focussed on [[Moksha]], peace and simple spiritual life.<ref>S.

===Monasticism===
{{Main|Sannyasa}}
[[File:Indian sadhu performing namaste.jpg|thumb|200px|right text|A sadhu in [[Madurai]], India.]]
Some Hindus choose to live a [[monastic]] life (Sannyāsa) in pursuit of [[moksha|liberation]] or another form of spiritual perfection. Monastics commit themselves to a life of simplicity, celibacy, detachment from worldly pursuits, and the contemplation of God.<ref name=bhaskaranandaessential112>{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994|p=112}}</ref> A Hindu monk is called a ''[[Sannyasa|Sanyāsī]]'',  ''Sādhu'', or ''Swāmi''. A female renunciate is called a ''Sanyāsini''. Renunciates receive high respect in Hindu society because their simple living, renunciation of worldly desires, and dedication to spiritual liberation ([[moksha]]) – believed to be the ultimate goal of life.<ref name="DP Bhawuk 2011 pages 93-110"/> Some monastics live in monasteries, while others wander from place to place, depending on donated food and charity for their needs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=316}}</ref>

===Periodisation===
{{History of South Asia}}

[[James Mill]] (1773–1836), in his ''[[The History of British India]]'' (1817),{{sfn|Khanna|2007|p=xvii}} distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely Hindu, Muslim and British civilisations.{{sfn|Khanna|2007|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Misra|2004|p=194}} This periodisation has been criticised for the misconceptions it has given rise to.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=7}} Another periodisation is the division into "ancient, classical, mediaeval and modern periods".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=21}} An elaborate periodisation may be as follows:{{sfn|Michaels|2004}}
* Prevedic religions (pre-history and Indus Valley Civilisation; until c. 1750 BCE);
* Vedic period (c. 1750-500 BCE);
* "Second Urbanisation" (c. 500-200 BCE);
* Classical Hinduism (c. 200 BCE-1100 CE);{{refn|group=note|Different periods are designated as "classical Hinduism":
* Smart calls the period between 1000 BCE and 100 CE "pre-classical". It is the formative period for the Upanishads and Brahmanism{{refn|group=subnote|Smart distinguishes "Brahmanism" from the Vedic religion, connecting  "Brahmanism" with the Upanishads.{{sfn|Smart|2003|p=52, 83-86}}}} Jainism and Buddhism. For Smart, the "classical period" lasts from 100 to 1000 CE, and coincides with the flowering of "classical Hinduism" and the flowering and deterioration of Mahayana-buddhism in India.{{sfn|Smart|2003|p=52}}
* For Michaels, the period between 500 BCE and 200 BCE is a time of "Ascetic reformism",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=36}} whereas the period between 200 BCE and 1100 CE is the time of "classical Hinduism", since there is "a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=38}}
* Muesse discerns a longer period of change, namely between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, which he calls the "Classical Period". According to Muesse, some of the fundamental concepts of Hinduism, namely karma, reincarnation and "personal enlightenment and transformation", which did not exist in the Vedic religion, developed in this time.{{sfn|Muesse|2003|p=14}}}}
:* Pre-classical Hinduism (c. 200 BCE-300 CE);
:* "Golden Age" (Gupta Empire) (c. 320-650 CE);
:* Late-Classical Hinduism - Puranic Hinduism (c. 650-1100 CE);
* Islam and Sects of Hinduism (c. 1200-1700 CE);
* Modern Hinduism (from c. 1800).

===Origins===
Hinduism is a fusion{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=50}}{{refn|group=note|name=Lockard}} or synthesis{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|name="Hiltebeitel-synthesis"}} of various Indian cultures and traditions.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|name=fusion}} Among the roots of Hinduism are the [[historical Vedic religion]] of [[Iron Age India]],<ref>{{harvnb|Samuel|2010|pp=41–42}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=16}}</ref> itself already the product of "a composite of the indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations",{{sfn|White|2006|p=28}}{{refn|group=note|name="Vedic composite"}} but also the [[Sramana]]{{sfn|Gomez|2013|p=42}} or renouncer traditions{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=16}} of [[Maurya Empire|northeast India]],{{sfn|Gomez|2013|p=42}} and mesolithic{{sfn|Doniger|2010|p=66}} and neolithic{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=xvii}} cultures of India, such as the religions of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]],<ref>{{harvnb|Narayanan|2009|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Lockard|2007|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=xviii}}</ref> [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] traditions,<ref>{{harvnb|Tiwari|2002|p=v}}; {{harvnb|Lockard|2007|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Zimmer|1951|pp=218–219}}; {{harvnb|Larson|1995|p=81}}</ref> and the [[Adivasi|local traditions]]{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=16}} and [[Tribal religions in India|tribal religions]].{{sfn|Tiwari|2002|p=v}}{{refn|group=note|Tiwari mentions the [[Australoid race|Austric]] and [[Mongoloid]] people.{{sfn|Tiwari|2002|p=v}} See also [[Peopling of India]] for the variety of Indian people.}}

This "Hindu synthesis" emerged after the Vedic period, between 500{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}-200{{sfn|Larson|2009}} BCE and c. 300 CE,{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}} the beginning of the "Epic and Puranic" c.q.

===Prevedic religions (until c. 1750 BCE)===
{{See also|History of Hinduism}}
[[File:Shiva Pashupati.jpg|thumb|The so-called ''[[Pashupati]]'' seal, [[Indus Valley civilization]].]]
The earliest [[prehistoric religion]] in India that may have left its traces in Hinduism comes from mesolithic as observed in the sites such as the rock paintings of [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] dating to a period of 30,000 BCE or older,{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Doniger|2010|p=66}}: "Much of what we now call Hinduism may have had roots in cultures that thrived in South Asia long before the creation of textual evidence that we can decipher with any confidence. Remarkable cave paintings have been preserved from Mesolithic sites dating from c. 30,000 BCE in [[Bhimbetka rock shelters|Bhimbetka]], near present-day Bhopal, in the Vindhya Mountains in the province of Madhya Pradesh."}} as well as neolithic times.{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=xvii}}: "Some practices of Hinduism must have originated in Neolithic times (c. 4000 BCE). The worship of certain plants and animals as sacred, for instance, could very likely have very great antiquity. The worship of goddesses, too, a part of Hinduism today, may be a feature that originated in the Neolithic."}} Some of the religious practices can be considered to have originated in 4000 BCE. Several [[Tribal religions in India|tribal religions]] still exist, though their practices may not resemble those of prehistoric religions.<ref group=web>[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/india/tribal.html PHILTAR, Division of Religion and Philosophy, University of Cumbria, ''Tribal Religions of India'']</ref>

According to anthropologist [[Gregory Possehl|Possehl]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] "provides a logical, if somewhat arbitrary, starting point for some aspects of the later Hindu tradition".{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=154}} The religion of this period included worship of a Great male god, which is compared to a proto-Shiva, and probably a Mother Goddess, that may prefigure [[Shakti]]. <!---Other practices from the Indus religion that may have continued in the Vedic period include [and then the sentence is broken...].---> However these links of deities and practices of the Indus religion to later-day Hinduism are subject to both political contention and scholarly dispute.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=141–156}}

==="Second Urbanisation" (c. 500-200 BCE)===
{{Main|Sramana}}

Increasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of ascetic circles and of new ideas which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals.<ref>{{citation |last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&pg=PA82|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43878-0|page=82}}</ref> These ideas led to [[Sramana]] movements, of which Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of [[Jainism]], and [[Buddha]] (c. 563-483), founder of [[Buddhism]], were the most prominent icons.<ref name="World Religions"/>{{rp|184}}

The [[sannyasa|ascetic]] tradition of Vedic period in part created the concept of [[samsara]] and suffering, and the concept of liberation, which became characteristic for Hinduism, along with Buddhism and Jainism.{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Flood|2008|pp=273–274}}: "The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterise later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history [...] Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara - the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana - the goal of human existence."}}

These ascetic concepts were adopted by schools of Hinduism as well as other major Indian religions, but key differences between their premises defined their further development. Hinduism, for example, developed its ideas with the premise that every human being has a soul (''atman'', self), while Buddhism developed with the premise that there is no soul or self.<ref>KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, ISBN 978-8120806191, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards;<br />Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, ISBN 978-0791422175, page 64; Quote: "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] is central to Brahmanical thought).

First, it is apparent in the suggestion that the (Advaita) Vedanta philosophy of Sankara (c. eighth century CE) constitutes the central philosophy of Hinduism. Second, in an Indian context, neo-Vedanta philosophy subsumes Buddhist philosophies in terms of its own Vedantic ideology. The Buddha becomes a member of the Vedanta tradition, merely attempting to reform it from within. Finally, at a global level, neo-Vedanta colonises the religious traditions of the world by arguing for the centrality of a non-dualistic position as the ''philosophia perennis'' underlying all cultural differences."{{sfn|King|1999}}}}

===Classical Hinduism (c. 200 BCE – 1100 CE)===
After the Vedic period, between 500{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}-200{{sfn|Larson|2009}} BCE and c. 300 CE,{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}} the Vedic-Brahmanic culture spread to southern India and [[Greater India|parts of Southeast Asia]].{{refn|group=note|name="Samuel-northsouth"|{{harvnb|Samuel|2010|pp=193–228, 339–353, specifically pp.&nbsp;76–79 and p.&nbsp;199}}}}

;Pre-classical Hinduism (c. 200 BCE – 300 CE)
The "Hindu synthesis" or "Brahmanical synthesis"{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}{{sfn|Larson|2009}} incorporated [[Sramana|Sramanic]] and Buddhist influences{{sfn|Larson|2009}}{{sfn|Cousins|2010}}{{which|date=March 2015}} and the emerging ''bhakti'' tradition into the "Brahmanical fold" via the ''smriti'' literature.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=13}}{{sfn|Larson|2009}} This synthesis emerged under the pressure of the success of Buddhism and Jainism.{{sfn|Nath|2001|p=21}}

According to Embree, several other religious traditions had existed side by side with the Vedic religion. These indigenous religions "eventually found a place under the broad mantle of the Vedic religion".{{sfn|Embree|1988|p=277}} The ''[[smriti]]'' texts of the period between 200 BCE-100 CE proclaimed the authority of the [[Vedas]], and acceptance of the Vedas became a central criterium for defining Hinduism over and against the heterodoxies, which rejected the Vedas and relied on their own ''Sutras'' (texts).{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=14}}

The major Sanskrit epics, ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which belong to the ''smriti'', were compiled over a protracted period during the late centuries BCE and the early centuries CE.<ref group=web>{{cite web|title=Itihasas|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/texts/itihasas.htm|publisher=ReligionFacts|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> They contain stories about the rulers and wars of ancient India, and are interspersed with religious and philosophical treatises. The [[Bhagavad Gita]] was composed in this period and consolidated diverse ideas.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=20}}

;"Golden Age" (Gupta Empire) (c. 320–650 CE)
During the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]], the first Hindu temples dedicated to the gods of the [[Hindu deities]] emerged.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}}{{refn|group=note|Axel Michaels mentions the [[Durga temple, Aihole|Durga temple in Aihole]] and the [[Dashavatara Temple, Deogarh|Visnu Temple in Deogarh]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}} George Michell notes that earlier temples were built of timber, brick and plaster, while the first stone temples appeared during the period of Gupta rule.{{sfn|Michell|1977|p=18}}}} During the Gupta reign the first [[Puranas]] were written.{{sfn|Nath|2001|p=19}} The early Puranas, composed between 300 and 600 CE, show continuities with the Vedic religion, but also an expanded mythology of Vishnu, Shiva and Devi, which Lorenzen suggests may have been the beginnings of "medieval Hinduism".{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=36}}  The later Puranas recount tales about [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas and devis]], their interactions with humans and their battles against [[rakshasa]].

According to P. S. Sharma, "the Gupta and Harsha periods form really, from the strictly intellectual standpoint, the most brilliant epocha in the development of Indian philosophy", as Hindu and Buddhist philosophies flourished side by side.<ref>{{cite book|last= Sharma |first=Peri Sarveswara |year=1980 | page= 5| title=Anthology of Kumārilabhaṭṭa's Works |publisher=Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass}}</ref>

;Late-Classical Hinduism - Puranic Hinduism (c. 650–1100 CE)
After the end of the Gupta Empire, power became decentralised in India. The disintegration of central power also led to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Rural and devotional movements arose within Hinduism, along with [[Shaivism]], [[Vaisnavism]], [[Bhakti]] and [[Tantra]],{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} that competed with each other, as well as with numerous sects of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}}{{sfn|Inden|1978|p=67}} [[Decline of Buddhism in India|Buddhism declined]], though many of its ideas, and even the Buddha himself, were absorbed into certain Brahmanical traditions.<ref name="Lal_disappearance">[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/paths/BuddhismDisappear.doc Vinay Lal, ''Buddhism's Disappearance from India'']</ref>

===Modern Hinduism (from c.1800)===
[[File:Rath Yatra russia winter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Russian people|Russian]] [[Krishnaism|Krishnaites]] celebrating [[Ratha Yatra]]. In the late 20th century forms of Hinduism have grown indigenous roots in parts of Russia, significantly in [[Altai Republic|Altay]] where Hinduism is now the religion of 2% of the population.]]

====Hindu revivalism====
With the onset of the [[British Raj]], the colonization of India by the British, there also started a [[Bengali renaissance|Hindu renaissance]] in the 19th century, which profoundly changed the understanding of Hinduism in both India and the west.{{sfn|King|2002}} [[Indology]] as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as [[Max Müller]] and [[John Woodroffe]]. They brought [[Vedas|Vedic]], [[Puranic]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States. Western [[Orientalism|orientalist]] searched for the "essence" of the Indian religions, discerning this in the Vedas,{{sfn|King|2002|p=118}} and meanwhile creating the notion of "Hinduism" as a unified body of religious praxis{{sfn|King|1999-B}} and the popular picture of 'mystical India'.{{sfn|King|1999-B}}{{sfn|King|2002}} This idea of a Vedic essence was taken over by [[Hindu reform movements]] as the [[Brahmo Samaj]], which was supported for a while by the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian Church]],{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=114}} together with the ideas of [[Universalism in religion|Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], the idea that all religions share a common [[Mysticism|mystic]] ground.{{sfn|King|2002|p=119-120}} This [[neo-Vedanta|"Hindu modernism"]], with proponents like [[Vivekananda]], [[Aurobindo]] and [[Radhakrishnan]], became central in the popular understanding of Hinduism.{{sfn|King|2002|p=123}}{{sfn|Muesse|2011|p=3-4}}{{sfn|Doniger|2010|p=18}}{{sfn|Jouhki|2006|p=10-11}}{{sfn|King|1999}}

====Popularity in the west====
Influential 20th-century Hindus were [[Ramana Maharshi]], [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Prabhupada]] (founder of [[ISKCON]]), [[Sri Chinmoy]], [[Swami Rama]] and others who translated, reformulated and presented Hinduism's foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations, raising the profiles of Yoga and [[Vedanta]] in the West and attracting followers and attention in India and abroad.

Hindu practices such as Yoga, Ayurvedic health, Tantric sexuality through [[Neotantra]] and the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' have spread beyond Hindu communities and have been accepted by several non-Hindus:
{{quote|Hinduism is attracting Western adherents through the affiliated practice of yoga.

====Hindutva====

In the 20th century, Hinduism also gained prominence as a political force and a source for national identity in India. With origins traced back to the establishment of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] in the 1910s, the movement grew with the formulation and development of the [[Hindutva]] ideology in the following decades; the establishment of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) in 1925; and the entry, and later success, of RSS offshoots [[Jana Sangha]] and [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) in electoral politics in post-independence India.<ref name=Ram-Prasad>{{cite book|last=Ram-Prasad|first=C|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|year=2003|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|isbn=0-631-21535-2|pages=526–550|editor-link=Gavin Flood|editor=Flood, Gavin|chapter=Contemporary political Hinduism}}</ref> Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}{{refn|group=note|This conjunction of nationalism and religion is not unique to India.
