'''David William Donald Cameron''', ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|(ə)|r|ə|n}}; born 9 October 1966), is a British politician who is at present the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader]] of its [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Oxfordshire]] constituency of [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conservatives.com/ourteam/david_cameron|title=David Cameron|website=www.conservatives.com|access-date=21 April 2016}}</ref> In 2005, he won the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|Conservative Party leadership election]].<ref name=beeb>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/ps/sites/roughguide/hall_of_fame/pages/david_cameron.shtml |title=Hall of Fame, David Cameron |work=BBC Wales |accessdate=7 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/20100510170722/http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/wales/ps/sites/roughguide/hall_of_fame/pages/david_cameron.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2010}}</ref> Following the election of a [[hung parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Cameron became Prime Minister as the leader of a [[coalition government|coalition]] between the Conservatives and [[Liberal Democrats]].<ref name="Telegraph11May2009YoungestPM"/> He was re-elected Prime Minister in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 election]], when his party won a parliamentary majority for the first time since [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]]. He was first elected to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]].

His [[Premiership of David Cameron|premiership]] has been marked by the ongoing effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|late-2000s financial crisis]] leading to a large deficit in government finances, which his government has emphasised the need to reduce through [[austerity]] measures. Cameron's administration introduced large-scale changes to [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare]], [[United Kingdom immigration law|immigration policy]], [[Education in England|education]] and [[Healthcare in England|healthcare]], by introducing the [[Welfare Reform Act 2012|Welfare Reform Act of 2012]], the [[Education Act 2011|Education Act of 2011]], the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Act of 2012]] and a range of immigration reforms from 2010 onwards, culminating in the [[Immigration Act 2014|Immigration Act of 2014]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-sticks-to-his-guns-on-immigration-reduction-pledge-even-while-numbers-rise-9420749.html |title=David Cameron sticks to his guns on immigration reduction pledge even while numbers rise |last=Morris |first=Nigel |newspaper=The Independent |location= London |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2011, Cameron became the first UK Prime Minister to 'veto' a [[European Union]] treaty.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.sky.com/story/907908/pms-eu-treaty-veto-i-did-it-for-britain |title=PM's EU Treaty Veto: 'I Did It For Britain' |work=[[Sky News]] |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref> Cameron's government introduced a nationwide [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|referendum on voting reform]] in 2011, and agreed to a [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish independence referendum]] in September 2014, which resulted in a 'No' to independence majority. David Cameron is the first Conservative Party leader to set out the case for [[same-sex marriage]] in the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]]. Cameron's government met the [[United Nations]] target of spending at least 0.7% of GNI on aid to developing countries. In 2013, Cameron promised an [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|'In/Out' referendum]] on the UK's membership of the [[European Union|EU]] before the end of 2017, which would follow a period of renegotiation with the [[European Union|EU]]. The referendum is to occur on 23 June 2016.

== Education ==
From the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]]: at [[Heatherdown School]] in [[Winkfield]] (near [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]]) in [[Berkshire]], which counts [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] among its old boys.

Six weeks before taking his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-Levels]] he was caught smoking [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name=beeb /> He admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled, but was fined, prevented from leaving the school grounds, and given a "[[Georgics|Georgic]]" (a punishment which involved copying 500 lines of [[Latin]] text).<ref name="Cannabis punishment">Elliott and Hanning, p. 32.</ref>

Cameron passed twelve [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-Levels]] and then three [[A-level]]s: [[History of art]], History, in which he was taught by [[Michael Kidson]], and Economics with Politics. He obtained three 'A' grades and a '1' grade in the [[Scholarship Level]] exam in Economics and Politics.<ref name="A levels">Elliott and Hanning, pp. 45–6.</ref> The following autumn he passed the entrance exam for the [[University of Oxford]], and was offered an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]].<ref name="Oxford entrance">Elliott and Hanning, p. 46.</ref>

Returning from Hong Kong, Cameron visited the then [[Soviet Union]], where he was approached by two [[Russians|Russian]] men speaking fluent English. Cameron was later told by one of his professors that it was "definitely an attempt" by the [[KGB]] to recruit him.<ref name="KGB">{{cite news |title=Cameron: KGB tried to recruit me |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5021166.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 May 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2006}}</ref>

While at Oxford, Cameron was a member of the student dining society the [[Bullingdon Club]], which has a reputation for an outlandish drinking culture associated with boisterous behaviour and damaging property.<ref name="clubmembership">Foster, Patrick (28 January 2006).[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2012918,00.html "How young Cameron wined and dined with the right sort"].

Cameron graduated in 1988 with a [[first-class honours]] BA degree (later promoted to an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] by seniority).<ref name=feud>{{cite news |url= http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/03/30/origins-of-the-cameron-balls-feud/ |title= Origins of the Cameron-Balls Feud |author= Rentoul, John |work=The Independent (blog) |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

== Early political career, 1988–2005 ==

=== Conservative Research Department, 1988–93 ===
After graduation, Cameron worked for the [[Conservative Research Department]] between September 1988 and 1993. His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation, and he befriended fellow young colleagues including [[Edward Llewellyn (Conservative adviser)|Edward Llewellyn]], [[Ed Vaizey]] and [[Rachel Whetstone]]. They and others formed a group they called the "[[Smith Square]] set", which was dubbed the "Brat Pack" by the press, though it is better known as the "[[Notting Hill set]]", a name given to it pejoratively by [[Derek Conway]].{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=9}} In 1991, Cameron was seconded to [[Downing Street]] to work on briefing [[John Major]] for his then bi-weekly session of [[Prime Minister's Questions]]. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for "sharper&nbsp;... [[Despatch box]] performances" by Major,<ref name="Major PMQs">"Atticus", ''The Sunday Times'', 30 June 1991</ref> which included highlighting for Major "a dreadful piece of [[doublespeak]]" by [[Tony Blair]] (then the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national [[minimum wage]].<ref name="Blair minimum wage">[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199091/cmhansrd/1991-06-27/Orals-2.html "House of Commons 6th series, vol. 193, cols. 1133–34"], ''Hansard''. Retrieved 4 September 2007.</ref> He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow [[Judith Chaplin]] as Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.<ref name="CRD">"Diary", ''The Times'', 14 August 1991.</ref>

However, Cameron lost to [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford|Jonathan Hill]], who was appointed in March 1992. Instead, Cameron was given the responsibility for briefing Major for his press conferences during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]].<ref name="1992 election">Wood, Nicholas (13 March 1992). "New aide for Prime Minister". ''The Times'' (London).</ref> During the campaign, Cameron was one of the young "brat pack" of party strategists who worked between 12 and 20 hours a day, sleeping in the house of [[Alan Duncan]] in [[Smith Square|Gayfere Street]], [[Westminster]], which had been Major's campaign headquarters during his bid for the Conservative leadership.<ref name="1992 campaign">"Sleep little babies". ''The Times'' (London). 20 March 1992.</ref> Cameron headed the economic section; it was while working on this campaign that Cameron first worked closely with and befriended [[Steve Hilton]], who was later to become Director of Strategy during his party leadership.<ref name="Meets Hilton">Wood, Nicholas (23 March 1992). "Strain starts to show on Major's round the clock 'brat pack'". ''The Times'' (London).</ref> The strain of getting up at 4:45&nbsp;am every day was reported to have led Cameron to decide to leave politics in favour of journalism.<ref name="Journalism">"Campaign fall-out". ''The Times''. 30 March 1992.</ref>

==== Special Adviser to the Chancellor (1992–93) ====
The Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues, saying "whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right," and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across [[Smith Square]] to jeer at [[Transport House]], the former Labour headquarters.<ref name="1992 post mortem">Pierce, Andrew (11 March 1992). "We got it right, say Patten's brat pack". ''The Sunday Times'' (London).</ref> Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to [[Special advisers (UK government)|Special Adviser]] to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Norman Lamont]].<ref name="Lamont's Spad">"Brats on the move". ''The Times'' (London). 14 April 1992.</ref>

Cameron was working for Lamont at the time of [[Black Wednesday]], when pressure from currency speculators forced the [[pound sterling]] out of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference, Cameron had difficulty trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion, [[Patricia Morris, Baroness Morris of Bolton|Patricia Morris]], to contact him.<ref name="1992 conference">"Diary", ''The Times'', 8 October 1992.</ref> Later that month Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]]; he was reported to be "still smarting" over the [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]]'s contribution to the economic crisis.<ref name="Germany visit">"Peace-mongers". ''The Times'' (London). 20 October 1992.</ref>

Lamont fell out with [[John Major]] after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 Budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters]] for their political acceptability to be assessed.<ref name="1993 budget">Hencke, David (8 February 1993). "Treasury tax review eyes fuel and children's clothes". ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> By May 1993, the Conservatives' average poll rating dropped below 30%, where they would remain until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]].{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=24}} Major and Lamont's personal ratings also declined dramatically. However, Lamont's unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron: he was considered as a potential "[[kamikaze]]" candidate for the [[Newbury by-election, 1993|Newbury by-election]], which includes the area where he grew up.<ref name="Newbury">White, Michael; Wintour, Patrick (26 February 1993). "Points of Order". ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> However, Cameron decided not to stand.

During the by-election, Lamont gave the response "[[Non, je ne regrette rien|Je ne regrette rien]]" to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see "the green shoots of recovery" or admitting to "singing in his bath" with happiness at leaving the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this gaffe; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming Chancellor himself, even though as he was not a Member of Parliament he could not have been.<ref name="Piaf">"Careless talk". ''The Times'' (London). 10 May 1993.</ref> Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.<ref name="Lamont sacked">Smith, David; Prescott, Michael (30 May 1993). "Norman Lamont: the final days" (Focus). ''The Sunday Times'' (London).</ref>

=== Special Adviser to the Home Secretary (1993–94) ===
[[File:HomeOffice QueenAnnesGate.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[102 Petty France|Home Office building]] Cameron worked at during the 1990s]]
After Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] for less than a month before being specifically recruited by [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]]. It was commented that he was still "very much in favour"<ref name="Howard's Spad">"No score flaw". ''The Times'' (London). 22 June 1993.</ref> and it was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on.<ref name="Clarke profile">Grigg, John (2 October 1993).

Cameron was much more socially liberal than Howard but enjoyed working for him.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=24}} According to [[Derek Lewis (prison governor)|Derek Lewis]], then Director-General of [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]], Cameron showed him a "his and hers list" of proposals made by Howard and his wife, Sandra.

Lewis reported that Cameron was "uncomfortable" about the list.<ref name="Prison food">Leigh, David (23 February 1997). "Mrs Howard's own recipe for prison reform". ''The Observer'' (London).</ref> In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist [[Bruce Anderson (columnist)|Bruce Anderson]] wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase "balanced diet", and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.<ref name="Anderson">Anderson, Bruce (1 March 1997). "Derek Lewis: Big job, little man, inaccurate book". ''The Spectator'' (London).</ref>

During his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed the media. In March 1994, someone leaked to the press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|Prevention of Terrorism Act]]. After an inquiry failed to find the source of the leak, Labour MP [[Peter Mandelson]] demanded assurance from Howard that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave.<ref name="Leak">Wintour, Patrick (10 March 1994).

In July 1994, Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at [[Carlton Communications]].<ref name="Carlton job">"Smallweed". ''The Guardian'' (London). 16 July 1994.</ref> Carlton, which had won the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise for London weekdays in 1991, was a growing media company which also had film-distribution and video-producing arms.

In 1997, Cameron played up the Company's prospects for [[digital terrestrial television]], for which it joined with [[ITV Granada]] and [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]] to form [[ITV Digital|British Digital Broadcasting]]. In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998 he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry.<ref name="Regulatory overlap">"We can't wait any longer to map the digital mediascape". ''[[New Statesman]]'' (London). 3 April 1998.</ref> Carlton's consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers.

==== Parliamentary candidacies ====
[[File:Stafford town centre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]], the constituency Cameron contested in 1997]]
Having been approved for the Candidates' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. He was reported to have missed out on selection for [[Ashford (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashford]] in December 1994 after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays.<ref name="Ashford">"Pendennis". ''The Observer'' (London). 1 January 1995.</ref> In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for [[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]], a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=24}}<ref name="Stafford candidate">{{cite news |authorlink= Michael White (journalist) |author= White, Michael |title=Seat-seeking missiles |newspaper=The Guardian |location =London |date=9 March 1996}}</ref> The incumbent Conservative MP, [[Bill Cash]], ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of [[Stone (UK Parliament constituency)|Stone]], where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called for [[tax cut]]s in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to "small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going".<ref name="Conference 1996">Sherman, Jill (11 October 1996). "Clarke challenged to show gains of economic recovery". ''The Times'' (London).</ref> He also said the Party "should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements&nbsp;...

BBC Archive. 10 October 1996</ref>

When writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the [[Euro|single European currency]] clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations.<ref name="Single currency 1997">Travis, Alan (17 April 1997). "Rebels' seven-year march". ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> Otherwise, Cameron kept closely to the national [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. He also campaigned using the claim that a Labour Government would increase the cost of a pint of beer by 24p; however, the Labour candidate, [[David Kidney]], portrayed Cameron as "a right-wing Tory". Initially, Cameron thought he had a 50/50 chance but as the campaign wore on and the scale of the impending Conservative defeat grew, Cameron prepared himself for defeat.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=3}} On election day, Stafford had a [[swing (politics)|swing]] of 10.7%, almost the same as the national swing, which made it one of the many seats to fall to Labour: Kidney defeated Cameron by 24,606 votes (47.5%) to 20,292 (39.2%), a majority of 4,314 (8.3%).<ref name="1997 election">Elliott and Hanning (2007), pp.&nbsp;172–5.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/constituencies/533.htm |title=Stafford 1997 election result |publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 September 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/19970429084317/http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/constituencies/533.htm |archivedate=29 April 1997 |year=1997}}</ref>

In the round of selection contests taking place in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], Cameron again attempted to be selected for a winnable seat. He tried for the [[Kensington and Chelsea by-election, 1999|Kensington and Chelsea]] seat after the death of [[Alan Clark]], but did not make the shortlist. He was in the final two but narrowly lost at [[Wealden (UK Parliament constituency)|Wealden]] in March 2000,<ref name="Wealden">White, Michael (14 March 2000). "Rightwingers and locals preferred for safe Tory seats".

On 4 April 2000 Cameron was selected as [[Prospective parliamentary candidate|prospective candidate]] (PPC) for [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. This had been a safe Conservative seat but its sitting MP [[Shaun Woodward]] (who had worked with Cameron on the 1992 election campaign) had "crossed the floor" to join the Labour Party and was selected instead for the safe Labour seat of [[St Helens South (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens South]]. Cameron's biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning describe the two men as being "on fairly friendly terms".<ref name=autogenerated1>Elliott and Hanning (2007), p. 192.</ref> Cameron, advised in his strategy by friend [[Catherine Fall]], put a great deal of effort into "nursing" his potential constituency, turning up at social functions, and attacking Woodward for changing his mind on [[fox hunting]] to support a ban.<ref name="Woodward hunting">"Why Shaun Woodward changed his mind" (Letter).

During the election campaign, Cameron accepted the offer of writing a regular column for ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s online section.<ref name="Guardian column">[http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/davidcamerondiaries "The Cameron diaries"] (archive). ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> He won the seat with a 1.9% swing to the Conservatives, taking 22,153 votes (45%) to Labour candidate Michael Bartlet's 14,180 (28.8%), a majority of 7,973 (16.2%).<ref name="2001 election result">''Dod's Guide to the General Election June 2001''.

=== Member of Parliament, 2001–05 ===
Upon his election to Parliament, he served as a member of the Commons [[Home Affairs Select Committee]], a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP.

Cameron determinedly attempted to increase his public visibility, offering quotations on matters of public controversy. He opposed the payment of compensation to Gurbux Singh, who had resigned as head of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] after a confrontation with the police;<ref name="Gurbux Singh">Johnston, Philip; Barrow, Becky (8 August 2002).

Cameron agreed to holding the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014]] and eliminated the "devomax" option from the ballot for a straight out yes or no vote. He supported the successful [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] campaign. He had also backed a successful campaign to retain the status quo in a [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|referendum on changing the voting system]] held at the request of his coalition partners.

He supported the introduction of [[gay marriage]] despite more of his own Conservative MPs voting against the move than for it, meaning the support of Lib Dem MPs in government and Labour MPs in opposition was required to allow it to pass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/02/05/more-conservative-mps-voted-against-same-sex-marriage-than-for-it/|title=More Conservative MPs voted against same-sex marriage than for it|work=PinkNews}}</ref>

{{main|United Kingdom general election, 2015}}
On 7 May 2015, Cameron was re-elected UK Prime Minister with a majority in the Commons. The Conservative Party's decisive win in the general election was as a surprise victory, as most polls and commentators predicted the outcome would be too close to call and result in a second [[hung parliament]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://gu.com/p/487bn |title= Labour has one-point lead over Tories in final Guardian/ICM poll |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=7 May 2015 |author= Clark, Tom}}</ref> Forming the first [[Second Cameron ministry|Conservative majority government]] since 1992, David Cameron became the first Prime Minister to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a larger popular vote share since [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]in [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900]] and the only Prime Minister other than [[Margaret Thatcher]] to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a greater number of seats to-date.

== Policies and views ==
{{Main|Political positions of David Cameron}}

=== Self-description of views ===
Cameron describes himself as a "modern [[Compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]]" and has spoken of a need for a new style of politics, saying that he was "fed up with the [[Punch and Judy]] politics of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]".<ref>{{cite news |authorlink= Jonathan Freedland |author=Freedland, Jonathan |url= http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/07/conservatives.toryleadership20051 |title= Enough of this love-in: Bush was a compassionate conservative too |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 December 2005 |accessdate=6 November 2006 |location =London}}</ref> He has stated that he is "certainly a big [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] fan, but I don't know whether that makes me a Thatcherite."<ref name="new identity">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4446864.stm "Cameron: Tories need new identity"].

Retrieved 6 November 2006.</ref> As Leader of the Opposition, Cameron stated that he did not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and would offer his support in areas of agreement.

Shortly after becoming Conservative leader, Cameron gave a speech to the 2006 Conservative Conference in [[Bournemouth]] in which he described the [[National Health Service]] as "one of the 20th Century's greatest achievements". He went on to say, "[[Tony Blair]] explained his priorities in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters: N.H.S." He also talked about his severely disabled son, concluding "So, for me, it is not just a question of saying the NHS is safe in my hands – of course it will be.

[[File:Merkel Obama Cameron G8 2011.jpg|thumb|Cameron talks with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], 25 May 2011]]
Cameron has stated that he believes in "spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention" in cases such as the [[genocide]] in [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]]. However, he says he is not a [[neo-conservative]] because, as a [[Conservatism|conservative]], he recognizes "the complexities of [[human nature]], and will always be skeptical of grand schemes to remake the world."<ref name="party speech">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5407714.stm ''In full: Cameron speech''], [[BBC News Online]], 4 October 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> He supports [[multilateralism]] stating "a country may act alone – but it cannot always succeed alone."

He believes that British [[Muslim]]s have a duty to [[Cultural assimilation|integrate]] into British culture, but noted in an article published in 2007 that the Muslim community finds aspects such as high divorce rates and drug use uninspiring, and that "Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/13/comment.communities |author=Cameron, David |title= What I learnt from my stay with a Muslim family |work=The Observer |date=13 May 2007 |accessdate=13 April 2010 |location=London}}</ref> In 2010 he appointed the first Muslim member of the British cabinet, [[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Baroness Sayeeda Hussain Warsi]], as a minister without portfolio, and in 2012 made her a special minister of state in foreign affairs. She resigned however in August 2014 over the government's handling of the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]].

Whilst urging members of his party to support the Coalition's proposals for [[same-sex marriage]], Cameron said that he backed gay marriage not in spite of his conservatism but because he is a conservative, and claimed it was about equality.<ref>Green, Jessica (5 October 2011).[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/10/05/david-cameron-urges-tories-to-back-gay-marriage/ "David Cameron urges Tories to back gay marriage"].

The rapid growth in the use of food banks under David Cameron became one of the major criticisms of his administration, and a recurring theme at ''Question Time''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Fraser|title=David Cameron should not be afraid to talk about food banks|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11511944/David-Cameron-should-not-be-afraid-to-talk-about-food-banks.html|accessdate=5 March 2016|publisher=Telegraph|date=3 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gentleman|first1=Amelia|title=Food bank Britain: can MPs agree on the causes of poverty in the UK?|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/04/food-bank-britain-can-mps-agree-causes-uk-poverty|accessdate=6 March 2016|publisher=Guardian|date=4 July 2014}}</ref> Cameron praised volunteers providing donated food as "part of what I call the [[Big Society]]", to which Ed Miliband responded that he "never thought the Big Society was about feeding hungry children in Britain"<ref>{{cite news|title=Cameron rejects Miliband's attack over poverty|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9779000/9779758.stm|accessdate=5 March 2016|publisher=BBC|date=19 December 2012}}</ref>

In February 2014, 27 [[Anglican bishop]]s together with leading [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quaker]]s wrote an [[open letter]] to Cameron blaming government policy for a rise in the use of [[food bank#United Kingdom|food banks]]. The letter claimed that "over half of people using food banks have been put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures in the benefit system, whether it be payment delays or punitive sanctions"<ref>Watt, Nicholas (20 February 2014).

=== Expenses ===
During the [[MPs expenses scandal]] in 2009, Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying "excessive" expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:

{{quote|We have to acknowledge just how bad this is, the public are really angry and we have to start by saying, 'Look, this system that we have, that we used, that we operated, that we took part in – it was wrong and we are sorry about that'.<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Appalled' Cameron leads payback |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8044998.stm |accessdate=3 May 2015 |work=BBC News |date=12 May 2009}}</ref>}}

''The Daily Telegraph'' (London). 8 April 2014.</ref>

=== Raising teaching standards ===
At the launch of the Conservative Party's education [[manifesto]] in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the "brazenly elite" approach to education of countries such as [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]] and expressed a desire to "elevate the status of teaching in our country".<ref name=Telegraph_18_01_10>{{Cite news |last= Kirkup |first= James |title= David Cameron pledges 'brazen elitism' in teaching |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date=7 February 2010 |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/david-cameron/7014885/David-Cameron-pledges-brazen-elitism-in-teaching.html |accessdate =15 February 2010 |location=London }}</ref> He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from "good" universities.<ref name=Independent_18_01_10>{{Cite news |last= Garner |first= Richard |title= 'Only for elite' fear over Tory teaching deal |newspaper= The Independent |date = 18 January 2010 |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/only-for-elite-fear-over-tory-student-loans-deal-1871847.html |accessdate =15 February 2010 |location=London }}</ref>

[[Wes Streeting]], then president of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], said "The message that the Conservatives are sending to the majority of students is that if you didn't go to a university attended by members of the Shadow Cabinet, they don't believe you're worth as much."<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.nus.org.uk/cy/news/nus-comments-on-david-camerons-proposals-to-create-good-university-shortlist/ |publisher= [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2014 | title=NUS comments on David Cameron's proposals to create 'Good University' shortlist}}</ref>

===Transport===
{{hatnote|See also: [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date#The Conservative government (2015-present)|Conservative government rail policy (2015-present)]]}}
Commenting on rail fare increases in January 2015, Cameron said "We’ve made sure that rail fares cannot go up by more than inflation. So the rail fare increase this year, as last year, is linked to inflation, and I think that’s right. In previous years it’s gone up by more than inflation. But, of course, what you’re seeing on our railways is a £38bn investment project. And that money is coming, of course, from taxpayers, from the government, and from farepayers as well.” He described the policies of his government as “the biggest investment in our roads since the 1970s, but in our railways since Victorian times”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/02/rail-fare-rises-network-transport-secretary |title=David Cameron defends rail fare rises amid concerns over rip-off Britain}}</ref>

=== European Union ===
David Cameron supports the United Kingdom staying in the European Union, which it joined in 1973. Following a renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU, he called a referendum on membership of the European Union to be held on 23 June 2016.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/cameron-to-make-statement-in-parliament-tomorrow/article8262733.ece The Hindu]</ref>

=== South Africa ===
In April 2009, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that in 1989, while [[Nelson Mandela]] remained imprisoned under the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid régime]], David Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm. A spokesperson for Cameron responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip "jolly", saying that "it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The [[P. W. Botha|Botha]] regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence." Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime. He was criticised by Labour MP [[Peter Hain]], himself an anti-apartheid campaigner.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/revealed-camerons-freebie-to-apartheid-south-africa-1674367.html |title=Cameron's freebie to apartheid South Africa |date=26 April 2009|author= Merrick, Jane |author2= Hanning, James |work=The Independent on Sunday |location=London}}</ref>

=== Iraq war ===
In an interview on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war in Iraq]], and said that he thought supporters should "see it through".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5108584.stm |title=Cameron backs Blair on Iraq war |work=BBC News |date=23 June 2006 |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006 calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war. In 2011, he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq. He has repeatedly called for the [[Chilcot Inquiry]] into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying “People want to know the truth" <ref>{{cite news|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewan|title=David Cameron pushes Chilcot for Iraq report: 'We want this inquiry finished'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/21/david-cameron-pushes-chilcot-iraq-report-we-want-this-inquiry-finished|accessdate=27 September 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, in response to [[Argentina]]'s calls for negotiations over the [[Falkland Islands]]' sovereignty, a referendum was called asking [[Falkland Islanders]] whether they supported the continuation of their status as an [[Overseas Territory]] of the United Kingdom.

In a speech in 2011 Cameron said: "You have a Prime Minister whose commitment and determination to work for peace in Israel is deep and strong.

=== Plots against leadership ===
In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2012|2012 local elections]], the Conservative Party's share of the vote fell from 35% to 31%, losing control of several councils including [[Plymouth]], [[Southampton]], [[Harlow]], [[Redditch]], [[Worcester]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls. Many Conservative MPs spoke out because of this, and [[Nadine Dorries]] warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen.<ref>{{cite news |agency= Press Association |url= http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/06/nadine-dorries-david-cameron-leadership |title=Nadine Dorries tells David Cameron to change policies or lose Tory leadership |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=6 May 2012 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>

Later that year, [[Brian Binley]] openly said that Cameron's leadership was like being a 'maid' to the Liberal Democrats, and accused him of leading the party to defeat. In January 2013 it was revealed that [[Adam Afriyie]] was planning his own bid for the Tory leadership with the support of fellow MPs [[Mark Field]], [[Bill Wiggin]], [[Chris Heaton-Harris]], [[Priti Patel]], [[Jonathan Djanogly]] and [[Dan Byles]]. In the same month, ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[ConservativeHome]]'' revealed that a 'rebel reserve' of 55 Tory MPs had given firm pledges to a coordinating MP to support a motion of 'no confidence' and write to Brady simultaneously, which would be enough MPs to trigger a vote of no confidence as the level of MPs needed to trigger such vote is 46.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2013/01/rebel-reserve-of-55-conservative-mps-is-being-gathered-for-cameron-leadership-challenge.html |title='Rebel reserve' of 55 Conservative MPs 'is being gathered for Cameron leadership challenge' |publisher=Conservative Home |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>

Coulson had resigned as the paper's editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to [[News of the World phone hacking affair|illegal phone hacking]], although stating that he knew nothing about it.<ref name=beebo>{{cite news |author= Douglas, Torin |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12251456 |title=Andy Coulson quits Downing Street communications role |work=BBC News |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/the-battle-of-wapping-mk-ii-2310041.html |title=The Battle of Wapping, Mk II – Press, Media |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=10 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |location=London |first1=Jane |last1=Merrick |first2=James |last2=Hanning |first3=Matt |last3=Chorley |first4=Brian |last4=Brady}}</ref> In June 2010 [[Downing Street]] confirmed Coulson's annual salary as £140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10285825 "David Cameron's PR director Andy Coulson paid £140,000"].

In January 2011 Coulson left his post, saying coverage of the phone-hacking scandal was making it difficult to give his best to the job.<ref name=beebo/> In July 2011 he was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the News of the World, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition [[Ed Miliband]], Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/news/Prime-Minister39s-39gross-error-of.6797112.jp |title=Prime Minister's 'gross error of judgment' over former editor Andy Coulson |work=[[The Scotsman]] |place=Edinburgh |date=6 July 2011}}</ref> On 20 July, in a special parliamentary session at the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], arranged to discuss the [[News of the World phone hacking scandal]], Cameron said that he "regretted the furore" that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that "with hindsight" he would not have hired him.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sorry-david-cameron-sees-values-of-hindsight-2317454.html |title='Sorry' David Cameron sees values of hindsight |work=[[The Independent]] |date=20 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref> Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by [[Strathclyde Police]] on 30 May 2012.<ref name=scotsmancharge>{{cite web |url= http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/scottish-police-charge-andy-coulson-with-tommy-sheridan-trial-perjury-1-2326534 |last= Rose |first= Gareth |date= 31 May 2012 |title= Scottish police charge Andy Coulson with Tommy Sheridan trial perjury |newspaper= [[The Scotsman]] |location =Edinburgh |accessdate=31 May 2012 }}</ref><ref name=guardiancharge>{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/may/30/andy-coulson-charged-with-perjury |last= Carrell |first1= Severin |last2= Wintour |first2= Patrick |date= 30 May 2012 |title= Andy Coulson charged with perjury |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location =London |accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref> Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a "full and frank" apology for hiring him, saying "I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that." The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.<ref name="CameronCoulson">{{cite news |title= David Cameron has explaining to do over apology for hiring Andy Coulson |url= http://www.thelondonnews.net/index.php/sid/223255805/scat/c08dd24cec417021/ht/David-Cameron-has-explaining-to-do-over-apology-for-hiring-Andy-Coulson |accessdate=27 June 2014 |work=''The London News.Net''}}</ref>

In ''The Observer'', [[Andrew Rawnsley]] commented that he believes that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to "generate publicity", "stir trouble for the prime minister" and influence the direction of the party.<ref name=andy>{{cite news |url= http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/05/lord-ashcroft-poll-dowses-tories-optimism |title= Lord Ashcroft's big bucket of cold water to douse Tory optimism |author=Rawnsley, Andrew |work=The Observer |location=London |date=5 January 2014 |accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref> In 2015 Ashcroft released ''[[Call Me Dave]]'', an unauthorised biography of Cameron written with journalist [[Isabel Oakeshott]], which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron's time at university.

Many commentators have described the accusations as a "revenge job" by Ashcroft, who was not offered a senior role in government when Cameron came to power in 2010.<ref name="The Guardian"/><ref name="The Daily Telegraph"/> Ashcroft initially claimed the book was "not about settling scores", while Oakeshott said that they had held back publication until after the 2015 General Election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives' electoral chances.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lord Ashcroft 'not settling scores' with David Cameron book |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34312744 |accessdate=23 September 2015 |work=BBC News |date=21 September 2015}}</ref> Ashcroft subsequently admitted that the initiation allegations "may have been case of mistaken identity” and has stated that he has a personal "beef" with Cameron.<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news |title=Lord Ashcroft's Cameron biography bears hallmarks of revenge job |url= http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/lord-ashcrofts-cameron-biography-bears-hallmarks-of-revenge-job |accessdate=22 September 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London}}</ref><ref name="The Daily Telegraph">{{cite news |last1=Kirkup |first1=James |title=A pig, some drugs and a disappointed billionaire: the life of David Cameron |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11880588/A-pig-some-drugs-and-a-disappointed-billionaire-the-life-of-David-Cameron.html |accessdate=21 September 2015 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Brooks-Pollock |first1=Tom |title=Piers Gaveston Society: The elite Oxford University club at the centre of claims David Cameron put his genitals in a dead pig |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/piers-gaveston-society-the-elite-oxford-university-club-at-the-centre-of-claims-david-cameron-put-his-genitals-in-a-dead-pig-10510602.html |accessdate=21 September 2015 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Khomami |first1=Nadia |title=David Cameron, a pig's head and a secret society at Oxford University – explained |url= http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/david-cameron-piers-gaveston-society-what-we-know-oxford-secret |accessdate=21 September 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 September 2015 |location= London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=David Cameron pig claims: How Twitter reacted to allegations about PM's time at university |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-pig-claims-how-twitter-reacted-to-allegations-about-pms-time-at-university-10511302.html |accessdate=22 September 2015 |newspaper=The Independent |date=21 September 2015 |location= London}}</ref>  Cameron later went on to deny these allegations and stated that Ashcroft's reasons for writing the book were clear and the public could see clearly through it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1559948/pm-says-hes-too-busy-to-sue-lord-ashcroft |title=PM Says He's 'Too Busy' To Sue Lord Ashcroft |work=Sky News |date=28 September 2015}}</ref>

== Standing in opinion polls ==

===Before becoming Prime Minister===
{{Main|Opinion polling for the 2010 United Kingdom general election}}
In the first month of Cameron's leadership, the Conservative Party's standing in opinion polls rose, with several pollsters placing it ahead of the ruling [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. While the Conservative and Labour Parties drew even in early spring 2006, following the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2006|May 2006 local elections]] various polls once again generally showed Conservative leads.<ref>[http://www.ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/voting-intention/ "Current voting intention"].

When [[Gordon Brown]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in June 2007, Labour moved ahead and its ratings grew steadily at Cameron's expense, an [[ICM Research|ICM]] poll<ref>Hennessy, Patrick; Kite, Melissa (15 July 2007).[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/15/nbrown115.xml "Gordon Brown has biggest lead over Tories"].

A [[YouGov]] poll for Channel 4 one week later, after the Labour Party Conference, extended the Labour lead to 11 points, prompting further speculation of an early election.<ref>Wintour, Patrick; Hencke, David (26 September 2007).

At the end of the year a series of polls showed improved support for the Conservatives giving them an 11-point lead over Labour. By May 2008, following the worst local election performance from the Labour Party in 40 years, the Conservative lead was up to 26 points, the largest since 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.yougov.co.uk/extranets/ygarchives/content/pdf/Sun%2008%2005%2008%20toplines.pdf |title =YouGov/Sun survey results |publisher=[[YouGov]] |date=May 2008}}</ref>

In late 2009, the Conservative lead decreased and by January 2010 some polls were predicting a [[hung parliament]], which was the eventual result.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/dec/14/tory-lead-nine-points-guardian-icm-poll |title= Tory lead cut to nine points in Guardian/ICM poll |date=14 December 2009 |author=Clark, Tom

A [[YouGov]] poll on party leaders conducted on 9–10 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, whilst 38% thought he would be the best PM, 23% preferred [[Ed Miliband]] and 35% didn't know.<ref>[http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/yg-archives-trackers-leaders-140611.pdf The Party Leaders.] [[YouGov]]. 14 June 2011. {{wayback|url=http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/yg-archives-trackers-leaders-140611.pdf |date=20120118093856 |df=y }}</ref>

Until his veto on treaty changes to the European Union in December 2011 amid the Eurozone crisis, most opinion polls that year had shown a slim Labour lead. Many opinion polls showed that the majority of voters felt that Cameron made the right decision. Subsequent opinion polls have shown a narrow lead for the Conservatives ahead of Labour.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2011/12/11/cameron-s-eu-veto-wipes-out-labour-poll-lead |title=Cameron's EU veto wipes out Labour poll lead |work=Politics.co.uk |date=11 December 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===Family===
Cameron is married to [[Samantha Cameron|Samantha Gwendoline Sheffield]], the daughter of [[Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet]], and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (now [[Annabel Astor, Viscountess Astor|Viscountess Astor]]). A [[Marlborough College]] school friend of Cameron's sister Clare, Samantha accepted Clare's invitation to accompany the Cameron family on holiday in [[Tuscany]], Italy, after graduating from Bristol School of Creative Arts. It was then David and Samantha's romance started. They were married on 1 June 1996 at the Church of St Augustine of Canterbury, [[East Hendred]], [[Oxfordshire]], five years before Cameron was elected to parliament.<ref name="Peer"/>

=== Inheritance and family wealth ===
In October 2010, David Cameron inherited £300,000 from his father's will. The Camerons' family fortune was built up by his late father, Ian Cameron, who had worked as a stockbroker in the City. Ian Cameron used multimillion-pound investment funds based in offshore tax havens, such as Jersey, Panama City, and Geneva, to increase the family wealth.
