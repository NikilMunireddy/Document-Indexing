'''Henry Alfred Kissinger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|s|ɪ|n|dʒ|ər}};<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Kissinger |title=Kissinger – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=October 23, 2009}}</ref> born '''Heinz Alfred Kissinger''' {{IPA-de|haɪnts ˈalfʁɛt ˈkɪsɪŋɐ|}}; Born May 27, 1923) is an American [[diplomat]] and [[political scientist]]. He served as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and later concurrently as [[United States Secretary of State]] in the administrations of presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]]. For his actions negotiating the ceasefire in Vietnam (though never realized), Kissinger received the 1973 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] under controversial circumstances,<ref name="Feldman16"/> with two members of the committee resigning in protest. After his term, his advice has been sought by world leaders including subsequent U.S. presidents.

A proponent of ''[[Realpolitik]]'', Kissinger played a prominent role in [[United States foreign policy]] between 1969 and 1977. During this period, he pioneered the policy of ''[[détente]]'' with the [[Soviet Union]], orchestrated the opening of [[Sino-American relations|relations]] with the [[People's Republic of China]], and negotiated the [[Paris Peace Accords]], ending American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. Kissinger's ''[[Realpolitik]]'' resulted in controversial policies such as U.S. support for Pakistan, despite [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|its genocidal actions]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21586514-new-history-sheds-fresh-light-shameful-moment-american-foreign-policy-blood |title=Blood Meridian |last=Bass |first=Gary |date=September 21, 2013 |work=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}</ref> He is the founder and chairman of [[Kissinger Associates]], an international [[consulting firm]]. Kissinger has been a prolific author of books on politics and international relations with over one dozen books authored.

General opinion of Henry Kissinger remains widely divided.

==Early life and education==
Kissinger was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger in [[Fürth]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], in 1923 during the [[Weimar Republic]], to a family of [[German Jews]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Isaacson |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Isaacson |title=Kissinger: A Biography |year=1992 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-0-671-66323-0 |ref=harv |page=20}}</ref> His father, Louis Kissinger (1887–1982), was a schoolteacher. His mother, Paula (Stern) Kissinger (1901–1998), from [[Leutershausen]], was a homemaker. Kissinger has a younger brother, Walter Kissinger. The surname Kissinger was adopted in 1817 by his great-great-grandfather Meyer Löb, after the [[Bavaria]]n [[spa town]] of [[Bad Kissingen]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.br-online.de/land-und-leute/artikel/0506/02-kissinger/index.xml |title=Die Kissingers in Bad Kissingen |trans_title=The Kissinger in Bad Kissingen |publisher=Bayerischer Rundfunk |language=German |date=June 2, 2005 |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018235610/http://www.br-online.de/land-und-leute/artikel/0506/02-kissinger/index.xml |archivedate=October 18, 2007 }}</ref> As a youth, Heinz enjoyed playing [[Association football|soccer]], and even played for the youth wing of his favorite club, [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth|SpVgg Fürth]], which was one of the nation's best clubs at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1022970/uli-hesse-go-furth-and-conquer |title=Go Furth and Conquer |publisher=[[ESPN Soccernet]] |date=February 17, 2012 |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |last=Hesse |first=Uli}}</ref> In 1938, fleeing [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution, his family moved to London, England, before arriving in New York on September 5.

Kissinger spent his high school years in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of upper [[Manhattan]] as part of the German Jewish immigrant community that resided there at the time. Although Kissinger assimilated quickly into American culture, he never lost his pronounced [[East Franconian German|Frankish accent]], due to childhood shyness that made him hesitant to speak.<ref>{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=37}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1198517217372&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Bygone Days: Complex Jew.

Following high school, Kissinger enrolled in the [[City College of New York]], studying accounting. He excelled academically as a part-time student, continuing to work while enrolled. His studies were interrupted in early 1943, when he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=38}}

==Army experience==
Kissinger underwent basic training at Camp Croft in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. On June 19, 1943, while stationed in South Carolina, at the age of 20 years, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] [[U.S.&nbsp;citizen]]. The [[United States Army|army]] sent him to study engineering at [[Lafayette College]], [[Pennsylvania]], but the program was cancelled, and Kissinger was reassigned to the [[84th Division (United States)|84th Infantry Division]]. There, he made the acquaintance of [[Fritz G. A. Kraemer|Fritz Kraemer]], a fellow immigrant from Germany who noted Kissinger's fluency in German and his intellect, and arranged for him to be assigned to the [[military intelligence]] section of the division. Kissinger saw combat with the division, and volunteered for hazardous intelligence duties during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|pp=39–48}}

During the American advance into Germany, Kissinger, only a [[Private E-2|private]], was put in charge of the administration of the city of [[Krefeld]], owing to a lack of German speakers on the division's intelligence staff. Within eight days he had established a civilian administration.{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=48}} Kissinger was then reassigned to the [[Counter Intelligence Corps]], with the rank of [[sergeant]]. He was given charge of a team in [[Hanover]] assigned to tracking down [[Gestapo]] officers and other saboteurs, for which he was awarded the [[Bronze Star]].{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=49}} In June 1945, Kissinger was made commandant of the [[Bensheim]] metro CIC detachment, [[Bergstrasse (district)|Bergstrasse]] district of [[Hesse]], with responsibility for [[de-Nazification]] of the district. Although he possessed absolute authority and powers of arrest, Kissinger took care to avoid abuses against the local population by his command.{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=53}}

In 1946, Kissinger was reassigned to teach at the European Command Intelligence School at [[Camp King]], continuing to serve in this role as a civilian employee following his separation from the army.{{sfn|Isaacson|1992|p=55}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1138.html |title=Henry Kissinger at Large, Part One |date=January 29, 2004 |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Henry Kissinger received his [[Bachelor of Arts|AB degree]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in political science from [[Harvard College]] in 1950, where he lived in [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]] and studied under [[William Yandell Elliott]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/isaacson-kissinger.html |title=Little Heinz And Big Henry |last=Draper |first=Theodore |date=September 6, 1992 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 30, 2006}}</ref> He received his MA and PhD degrees at [[Harvard University]] in 1951 and 1954, respectively. In 1952, while still studying at Harvard, he served as a consultant to the director of the [[Psychological Strategy Board]].<ref name=nobelbio>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/kissinger-bio.html |title=Henry Kissinger – Biography |publisher=NobelPrize.org |accessdate =December 30, 2006}}</ref> His doctoral dissertation was titled "Peace, Legitimacy, and the Equilibrium (A Study of the Statesmanship of [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] and [[Metternich]])".

Kissinger remained at Harvard as a member of the faculty in the Department of Government and, with [[Robert R. Bowie]], co-founded the [[Weatherhead Center for International Affairs|Center for International Affairs]] in 1958. In 1955, he was a consultant to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]'s [[Operations Coordinating Board]].<ref name=nobelbio/> During 1955 and 1956, he was also study director in nuclear weapons and foreign policy at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. He released his book ''Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy'' the following year.<ref>{{cite book |first=Henry |last=Kissinger |title=Nuclear weapons and foreign policy |year=1957 |page=455 |publisher=[[Harper & Brothers]] |isbn=0-393-00494-5}}</ref> From 1956 to 1958 he worked for the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] as director of its [[Special Studies Project]].<ref name=nobelbio/> He was director of the Harvard Defense Studies Program between 1958 and 1971. He was also director of the Harvard International Seminar between 1951 and 1971. Outside of academia, he served as a consultant to several government agencies and think tanks, including the [[Operations Research Office]], the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], and the [[Rand Corporation]].<ref name=nobelbio/>

Keen to have a greater influence on [[U.S. foreign policy]], Kissinger became an advisor to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and supported his bid for the [[US Republican Party|Republican]] nomination for president in 1960, 1964, and 1968.<ref name=Rothbard>{{cite web |last=Rothbard |first=Murray |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=Why the War?

Kissinger served as [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[Richard Nixon]], and continued as Secretary of State under Nixon's successor [[Gerald Ford]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the National Security Council, 1947–1997 |publisher=White House |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/ |accessdate=December 30, 2006}}</ref>

A proponent of ''[[Realpolitik]]'', Kissinger played a dominant role in [[United States foreign policy]] between 1969 and 1977. In that period, he extended the policy of ''[[détente]]''. This policy led to a significant relaxation in US–Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. The talks concluded with a [[rapprochement]] between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and the formation of a new strategic anti-Soviet Sino-American alignment. He was jointly awarded the 1973 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[Le Duc Tho]] for helping to establish a [[ceasefire]] and U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. The ceasefire, however, was not durable,<ref name="ceasefire"/> and Tho declined to accept the award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1973 - Henry Kissinger, Le Duc Tho |publisher=NobelPrize.org |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/tho-facts.html |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref> As National Security Advisor, in 1974 Kissinger directed the much-debated [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]].

===''Détente'' and the opening to China===
{{see also|On China}}
As National Security Advisor under Nixon, Kissinger pioneered the policy of ''[[détente]]'' with the [[Soviet Union]], seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers. As a part of this strategy, he negotiated the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (culminating in the [[SALT I treaty]]) and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] with [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]. Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Johnson Administration but were postponed in protest upon the [[Prague Spring|invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968.
[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|left|Kissinger, shown here with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]], negotiated rapprochement with the People's Republic of China.]]
Kissinger sought to place diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union. He made two trips to the People's Republic of China in July and October 1971 (the first of which was made in secret) to confer with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], then in charge of Chinese foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dube |first=Clayton |title=Getting to Beijing: Henry Kissinger's Secret 1971 Trip |url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2483 |publisher=USC U.S.-China Institute |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> According to Kissinger's book, "The White House Years", the first secret China trip was arranged through Pakistan's diplomatic and Presidential involvement, as there were no direct communication channels between the states.  His trips paved the way for the groundbreaking [[Nixon visit to China 1972|1972 summit]] between Nixon, Zhou, and [[Communist Party of China]] Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], as well as the [[Sino-American relations|formalization of relations]] between the two countries, ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility. The result was the formation of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States.

While Kissinger's diplomacy led to economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides and the establishment of Liaison Offices in the Chinese and American capitals, with serious implications for Indochinese matters, full normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China would not occur until 1979, because the [[Watergate scandal]] overshadowed the latter years of the Nixon presidency and because the United States continued to recognize the government of Taiwan.

In September 1989, the Wall Street Journal's John Fialka disclosed that Kissinger took a direct economic interest in US-China relations in March 1989 with the establishment of China Ventures, Inc., a Delaware limited partnership, of which he was chairman of the board and chief executive officer.  A US$75 million investment in a joint venture with the Communist Party government's primary commercial vehicle at the time, China International Trust & Investment Corporation (CITIC), was its purpose.  Board members were major clients of Kissinger Associates.  Kissinger was criticised for not disclosing his role in the venture when called upon by ABC's Peter Jennings to comment the morning after the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen crackdown.  Kissinger's position was generally supportive of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s clearance of the square and he opposed economic sanctions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Soley |first=Lawrence C. |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |title=The News Shapers: The Sources who Explain the News |year=1992 |page=?}}</ref>

===Vietnam War===
{{Main|Vietnam War}}{{See also|Cambodian Civil War|Laotian Civil War}}

Kissinger's involvement in [[Indochina]] started prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon. While still at Harvard, he had worked as a consultant on foreign policy to both the [[White House]] and State Department. Kissinger says that "In August 1965&nbsp;... <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, an old friend serving as [[United States Ambassador to South Vietnam|Ambassador to Saigon]], had asked me to visit Vietnam as his consultant. I toured Vietnam first for two weeks in October and November 1965, again for about ten days in July 1966, and a third time for a few days in October 1966&nbsp;... Lodge gave me a free hand to look into any subject of my choice". He became convinced of the meaninglessness of military victories in Vietnam, "...&nbsp;unless they brought about a political reality that could survive our ultimate withdrawal".<ref>{{cite book |title=White House Years |pages=231–32 |first=Henry A. |last=Kissinger |location=Boston |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |year=1979}}</ref> In a 1967 peace initiative, he would mediate between Washington and [[Hanoi]].

Nixon had been elected in 1968 on the promise of achieving "peace with honor" and ending the Vietnam War. In office, and assisted by Kissinger, Nixon implemented a policy of [[Vietnamization]] that aimed to gradually withdraw U.S. troops while expanding the combat role of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the [[Viet Cong|National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]], a Communist guerrilla organization, and North Vietnamese army ([[Vietnam People's Army]] or PAVN). Kissinger played a key role in [[Operation Menu|bombing Cambodia]] to disrupt PAVN and Viet Cong units launching raids into South Vietnam from within Cambodia's borders and resupplying their forces by using the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] and other routes, as well as the 1970 [[Cambodian Incursion]] and subsequent widespread bombing of [[Khmer Rouge]] targets in Cambodia. The bombing campaign contributed to the chaos of the [[Cambodian Civil War]], which saw the forces of leader [[Lon Nol]] unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing Khmer Rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Totten |first1=Samuel |last2=Parsons |first2=William S. |last3=Charny |first3=Israel W. |title=Century of Genocide: Critical Essays and Eyewitness Accounts |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2004 |page=349 |isbn=978-0-415-94430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ef8Hrx8Cd0C&pg=PA349&dq=US+bombing+cambodia+civil+war+result |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Smyth |first1=Marie |last2=Robinson |first2=Gillian |title=Researching Violently Divided Societies: Ethical and Methodological Issues |publisher=[[United Nations University Press]] |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=978-92-808-1065-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWqNwsv6AIQC&pg=PA93&dq=US+bombing+cambodia+civil+war+result |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by [[Pol Pot]]'s then second in command, [[Nuon Chea]].<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, "The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives", in Susan E.

Along with [[North Vietnamese]] Politburo Member [[Le Duc Tho]], Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1973, for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the [[Paris Peace Accords]] on "Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam", signed the previous January.<ref name="ceasefire">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1973 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/press.html |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}</ref> According to [[Irwin Abrams]], this prize was the most controversial to date.

Under Kissinger's guidance, the United States government supported Pakistan in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Kissinger was particularly concerned about the expansion of Soviet influence in South Asia as a result of a treaty of friendship recently signed by India and the [[USSR]], and sought to demonstrate to the People's Republic of China (Pakistan's ally and an enemy of both India and the USSR) the value of a tacit alliance with the United States.<ref name="nixonarchive">{{cite web |title=The Tilt: The U.S. and the South Asian Crisis of 1971 |publisher=National Security Archive |date=December 16, 2002 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/ |accessdate=December 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=nytPak>{{cite news|last=Bass|first=Gary|title=Nixon and Kissinger's Forgotten Shame|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/nixon-and-kissingers-forgotten-shame.html|accessdate=May 27, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name=bbcPak>{{cite news|last=Dymond|first=Jonny|title=The Blood Telegram|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0183r3l|accessdate=May 27, 2014|publisher=BBC Radio|date=December 11, 2011}}</ref>

Kissinger sneered at people who "bleed" for "the dying Bengalis" and ignored the first telegram from the United States consul general in East Pakistan, [[Archer Blood|Archer K. Blood]], and 20 members of his staff, which informed the US that their allies West Pakistan were undertaking, in Blood's words, "a selective genocide".<ref>{{cite web|title=Selective Genocide|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/BEBB1.pdf|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> In the second, more famous, [[Blood telegram#The Blood telegram|Blood Telegram]] the word [[genocide]] was again used to describe the events, and further that with its continuing support for West Pakistan the US government had "evidenced [...] moral bankruptcy".<ref name=BloodTelegram>{{cite web|title=Dissent from US Policy towards East Pakistan|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/BEBB8.pdf|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>

Henry Kissinger had also come under fire for private comments he made to Nixon during the Bangladesh–Pakistan War in which he described Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] as a "[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]" and a "[[witch]]". He also said "The Indians are bastards", shortly before the war.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Keefer, Edward C.; Smith, Louis J. |title=150.

===Israeli policy and Soviet Jewry===
According to notes taken by [[H. R. Haldeman]], Nixon "ordered his aides to exclude all [[Jewish-Americans]] from policy-making on Israel", including Kissinger.<ref name=Chait>[[Jonathan Chait|Chait, Jonathan]] (December 10, 2010) [http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/79829/nixon-disallowed-jewish-advisors-discussing-israel-policy Nixon Disallowed Jewish Advisors From Discussing Israel Policy], ''[[The New Republic]]''</ref> One note quotes Nixon as saying "get K. [Kissinger] out of the play—[[Alexander Haig|Haig]] handle it".<ref name=Chait/>

In 1973, Kissinger did not feel that pressing the Soviet Union concerning the plight of [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Jews being persecuted there]] was in the interest of U.S. foreign policy. In conversation with Nixon shortly after a meeting with [[Golda Meir]] on March 1, 1973, Kissinger stated, "The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy, and if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern."<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |title=In Tapes, Nixon Rails About Jews and Blacks |work=The New York Times |date= December 10, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/us/politics/11nixon.html }}</ref> Kissinger argued, however:
{{quote|That emigration existed at all was due to the actions of "realists" in the White House. Jewish emigration rose from 700 a year in 1969 to near 40,000 in 1972. The total in Nixon's first term was more than 100,000. To maintain this flow by quiet diplomacy, we never used these figures for political purposes.&nbsp;... The issue became public because of the success of our Middle East policy when Egypt evicted Soviet advisers. To restore its relations with Cairo, the Soviet Union put a tax on Jewish emigration. There was no Jackson–Vanik Amendment until there was a successful emigration effort. Sen. Henry Jackson, for whom I had, and continue to have, high regard, sought to remove the tax with his amendment. We thought the continuation of our previous approach of quiet diplomacy was the wiser course.&nbsp;... Events proved our judgment correct. Jewish emigration fell to about a third of its previous high.<ref>Kissinger, Henry. [http://www.henryakissinger.com/articles/wp122610.html "Putting The Nixon Tape In Context"].

====1973 Yom Kippur War====
Documents show that Kissinger delayed telling President Richard Nixon about the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 to keep him from interfering. On October 6, 1973, the Israelis informed Kissinger about the attack at 6&nbsp;am; Kissinger waited nearly 3 and a half hours before he informed Nixon.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/book-says-kissinger-delayed-telling-nixon-about-yom-kippur-war-1.217323 |title=Book says Kissinger delayed telling Nixon about Yom Kippur War|work=Haaretz|date=April 3, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>

According to Kissinger, in an interview in November 2013, he was notified at 6:30&nbsp;a.m. (12:30&nbsp;pm. Israel time) that war was imminent, and his urgent calls to the Soviets and Egyptians were ineffective. He says Golda Meir's decision not to preempt was wise and reasonable, balancing the risk of Israel looking like the aggressor and Israel's actual ability to strike within such a brief span of time.<ref name="haaretz.com">{{cite web|last=Laor |first=Yitzhak |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.555704 |title=Kissinger wants Israel to know: The U.S. saved you during the 1973 war|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=November 2, 2013 |accessdate=February 15, 2014}}</ref>

The war began on October 6, 1973, when [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] attacked [[Israel]]. Kissinger published lengthy telephone transcripts from this period in the 2002 book ''Crisis''. On October 12, under Nixon's direction, and against Kissinger's initial advice,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Siniver |first1=Asaf |title=Nixon, Kissinger, and U.S. Foreign Policy Making; The Machinery of Crisis |publisher= Cambridge |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-521-89762-4 |page= 188 |year= 2008}}</ref> while Kissinger was on his way to Moscow to discuss conditions for a cease-fire, Nixon sent a message to [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] giving Kissinger full negotiating authority.<ref name="haaretz.com"/>

Israel regained the territory it lost in the early fighting and gained new territories from Syria and Egypt, including land in Syria east of the previously captured [[Golan Heights]], and additionally on the western bank of the [[Suez Canal]], although they did lose some territory on the eastern side of the Suez Canal that had been in Israeli hands since the end of the [[Six Day War]]. Kissinger pressured the Israelis to [[cede]] some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors, contributing to the first phases of Israeli-Egyptian non-aggression. The move saw a warming in [[Foreign relations of Egypt#United States|U.S.–Egyptian relations]], bitter since the 1950s, as the country moved away from its former independent stance and into a close partnership with the United States. The peace was finalized in 1978 when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] mediated the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]], during which Israel returned the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in exchange for an Egyptian peace agreement that included the recognition of the state of Israel.

===Turkish invasion of Cyprus===
{{See also|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}
Following a period of steady relations between the US Government and the [[Greek junta|Greek military regime]] after 1967, Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the coup by the Greek junta and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in July and August 1974.  In an August 1974 edition of the New York Times, it was revealed that Kissinger and State Department were informed in advance οf the impending coup by the Greek junta in Cyprus.  Indeed, according to the journalist,<ref>Article republished on the front page of the Greek newspaper [[To Vima]], issue of Fr. August 2, 1974, article "The Americans knew there was plan to overthrow Makarios" [Οἱ Ἀμερικανοί ἐγνώριζον ὅτι ἑτοιμάζετο ἀνατροπή τοῦ Μακαρίου στήν Κύπρο] (photo-reprint in the book series "To Vima- 90 years", Lambrakis Press 2012, volume XI "1972-1981")</ref> the official version of events as told by the State Department was that it felt it had to warn the Greek military regime not to carry out the coup. The warning had been delivered by July 9, according to repeated assurances from its Athens services, that is, the USA embassy and the American ambassador [[Henry J. Tasca]] himself.

Ioannis Zigdis, then a Greek MP for [[Centre Union]] and former minister, stated in an Athenian newspaper<ref name= "Irakleion">Front page of the Greek newspaper [[To Vima]], issue of Sa. August 17, 1974, articles "Τhe Cyprus crisis is Kissinger's Watergate" [Τό Κυπριακό εἶναι το Γουώτεργκέητ τοῦ κ. Κίσσινγκερ] and "Anti-American youth demonstration in Thessaloniki and Heraklion" [Ἀντιαμερικανική διαδήλωσις νέων εἰς τήν Θεσσαλονίκην και εἰς τό Ἡράκλειον] (photo-reprint in the book series "To Vima- 90 years", as above).</ref> that "the Cyprus crisis will become Kissinger's [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]". Zigdis also stressed: “Not only did Kissinger know about the coup for the overthrow of Archbishop Makarios before July 15th, he also encouraged it, if he did not instigate it.”

Kissinger was a target of [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American sentiment]] which was a significant feature of Greek public opinion at the time - particularly among young people - viewing the US role in Cyprus as negative. In a demonstration by students in Heraklion, Crete,<ref name= "Irakleion"/><ref>"[[To Vima]]" (August 17, 1974) original text passages on the demonstrations: ''Θεσσαλονίκη 16 Αὐγούστου. Σιωπηρά ἀντιαμερικανική διαδήλωση ἐπραγματοποίησαν σήμερα Κύπριοι φοιτηταί τοῦ Πανεπιστημόυ Θεσσαλονίκης'' [...]''περίπου 150 διελήθησαν ἀργότερον ἡσύχως.''[...]'' Ἡράκλειον 16 Αὐγούστου. Οἱ διαδηλωταί φέροντες ἑληνικάς σημαίας καί εἰκόνας τοῦ Καραμανλῆ καί τοῦ Μακαρίου περιήρχοντο μέχρις ἀργά τό βράδυ ''[...]'' κραυγάζοντες συνθήματα ὅπως "Δολοφόνε Κίσσινγκερ", "Ἔξω οἱ Ἀμερικανοί", " Ὄχι διχοτόμηση", "Ζήτω ὁ Καρμανλῆς", "Ἑνωμένοι Ἕλληνες", "Συμπαράσταση Λαέ", "Ὄχι ἡ Κύπρος Βιετνάμ".'' [...] ''ὑπολογίζονται δε εἰς  5.000" ''</ref> soon after the second phase of the Turkish invasion in August 1974, slogans such as "Kissinger, murderer", "Americans get out", "No to Partition" and "Cyprus is no Vietnam" were heard.

Some years later, Kissinger expressed the opinion that the Cyprus issue was resolved in 1974,<ref>{{cite book |last=Mallinson |first=William M. |title=Cyprus: A Historical Overview |year=2011 |publisher=Republic of Cyprus |url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/embassies/Embassy_Paris.nsf/all/2ABA3DAE2A22F3DAC12579EC0049FFA8/$file/HISTORICAL%20OVERVIEW.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}</ref> a position very similar to that held by PM Ecevit, who had ordered the invasion.

===Latin American policy===

The United States continued to recognize and maintain relationships with non-left-wing governments, democratic and authoritarian alike. [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Alliance for Progress]] was ended in 1973. In 1974, negotiations about a new settlement over the [[Panama Canal]] started. They eventually led to the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] and the handing over of the Canal to Panamanian control.

Kissinger initially supported the normalization of [[United States-Cuba relations]], broken since 1961 (all U.S.–Cuban trade was blocked in February 1962, a few weeks after the exclusion of Cuba from the [[Organization of American States]] because of U.S. pressure). However, he quickly changed his mind and followed Kennedy's policy. After the involvement of the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] in the independence struggles in [[Angolan War of Independence|Angola]] and [[Mozambican War of Independence|Mozambique]], Kissinger said that unless Cuba withdrew its forces relations would not be normalized. Cuba refused.

====Intervention in Chile====
{{Main|United States intervention in Chile#1970 election|}}
Chilean [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] presidential candidate [[Salvador Allende]] was elected by a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of 36.2% in 1970, causing serious concern in Washington, D.C. due to his openly socialist and pro-Cuban politics. The Nixon administration, with Kissinger's input, authorized the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to encourage a [[military coup]] that would prevent Allende's inauguration, but the plan was not successful.<ref name="Church Report">{{cite web |url=http://foia.state.gov/Reports/ChurchReport.asp |title=Church Report |date=December 18, 1975 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=November 20, 2006}}</ref><ref name="Interim Report">[http://history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/contents.htm Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders (1975)], [[Church Committee]], pages 246–247 and 250–254.</ref><ref name="The Pinochet File">{{cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Kornbluh|title=[[The Pinochet File]]: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2003|publisher=[[The New Press]]|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-936-1}}</ref>{{rp|115}}<ref name="The Pinochet File"/>{{rp|495}}<ref name="Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq">{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq|year=2006|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-8240-1}}</ref>{{rp|177}}
[[File:Reunión Pinochet - Kissinger.jpg|thumb|Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] shaking hands with Kissinger in 1976]]

[[United States-Chile relations]] remained frosty during Salvador Allende's tenure, following the complete [[nationalization]] of the partially U.S.-owned copper mines and the Chilean subsidiary of the U.S.-based [[ITT Corporation]], as well as other Chilean businesses. The U.S. claimed that the Chilean government had greatly undervalued fair compensation for the [[nationalization]] by subtracting what it deemed "excess profits". Therefore, the U.S. implemented [[economic sanctions]] against Chile. The CIA also provided funding for the mass anti-government strikes in 1972 and 1973, and extensive [[black propaganda]] in the newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]''.<ref name="The Pinochet File"/>{{rp|93}}

The most expeditious way to prevent Allende from assuming office was somehow to convince the Chilean congress to confirm [[Jorge Alessandri]] as the winner of the election. Once elected by the congress, Alessandri—a party to the plot through intermediaries—was prepared to resign his presidency within a matter of days so that new elections could be held. This first, nonmilitary, approach to stopping Allende was called the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track I|Track I]] approach.<ref name="Church Report"/> The CIA's second approach, the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track II|Track II]] approach, was designed to encourage a military overthrow.<ref name="The Pinochet File"/>

On September 11, 1973, Allende died during a military coup launched by Army Commander-in-Chief [[Augusto Pinochet]], who became President.<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Pike |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/chile/allende.htm |title=Allende's Leftist Regime |accessdate=November 20, 2006 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}</ref>
A document released by the CIA in 2000 titled "CIA Activities in Chile" revealed that the United States, acting through the CIA, actively supported the [[military junta]] after the overthrow of Allende and that it made many of Pinochet's officers into paid contacts of the CIA or U.S. military.<ref name="NSA-2000-9-19">Peter Kornbluh, [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20000919/ CIA Acknowledges Ties to Pinochet’s Repression Report to Congress Reveals U.S. Accountability in Chile], Chile Documentation Project, National Security Archive, September 19, 2000.

In 1976, [[Orlando Letelier]], a Chilean opponent of the Pinochet regime, was assassinated in Washington, D.C. with a car bomb.

====Argentina====
Kissinger took a similar line as he had toward Chile when the Argentinian military, led by [[Jorge Rafael Videla|Jorge Videla]], toppled the elected government of [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]] in 1976 with a process called the [[National Reorganization Process]] by the military, with which they consolidated power, launching brutal reprisals and "[[forced disappearance#Argentina|disappearances]]" against political opponents. During a meeting with Argentinian foreign minister [[César Augusto Guzzetti]], Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally, but urged him to "get back to normal procedures" quickly before the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] reconvened and had a chance to consider sanctions.<ref>{{cite web |editor-last=Osorio |editor-first=Carlos |editor2-last=Costar |editor2-first=Kathleen |title=Kissinger to the Argentine Generals in 1976: 'If There Are Things That Have To Be Done, You Should Do Them Quickly' |date=August 27, 2004 |work=[[National Security Archive]] |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB133/index.htm |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944) |title=Kissinger Approved Argentinian 'Dirty War' |date=December 5, 2003 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/06/argentina.usa |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}</ref>

===Rhodesia===
In September 1976 Kissinger was actively involved in negotiations regarding the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. Kissinger, along with South Africa's Prime Minister [[John Vorster]], pressured [[Rhodesia]]n Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] to hasten the transition to black [[majority rule]] in Rhodesia. With [[FRELIMO]] in control of Mozambique and even South Africa withdrawing its support, Rhodesia's isolation was nearly complete. According to Smith's autobiography, Kissinger told Smith of Mrs. Kissinger's admiration for him, but Smith stated that he thought Kissinger was asking him to sign Rhodesia's "death certificate". Kissinger, bringing the weight of the United States, and corralling other relevant parties to put pressure on Rhodesia, hastened the end of minority-rule.<ref name="Ian_Smith_memoir">{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Ian Douglas |title=Bitter Harvest: The Great Betrayal and the Dreadful Aftermath |year=2001 |publisher=[[Blake Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=1-903402-05-0 |oclc=1676807}}</ref>

===East Timor===
{{Main|Indonesian occupation of East Timor}}
The Portuguese decolonization process brought U.S. attention to the former Portuguese colony of [[East Timor]], which lies within the Indonesian archipelago and declared its independence in 1975. Indonesian president [[Suharto]] was a strong U.S. ally in Southeast Asia and began to mobilize the Indonesian army, preparing to annex the nascent state, which had become increasingly dominated by the popular leftist [[Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor|FRETILIN]] party. In December 1975, Suharto discussed the invasion plans during a meeting with Kissinger and President Ford in the Indonesian capital of [[Jakarta]]. Both Ford and Kissinger made clear that U.S. relations with Indonesia would remain strong and that it would not object to the proposed [[annexation]].<ref>{{cite web |editor-last=Burr |editor-first=William |editor2-last=Evans |editor2-first=Michael L. |title=

In February 1976 Kissinger considered launching air strikes against ports and military installations in Cuba, as well as deploying Marine battalions based at the US Navy base at [[Guantanamo Bay]], in retaliation for Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]]'s decision in late 1975 to send troops to [[Angola]] to help the newly independent nation fend off attacks from [[South Africa]] and right-wing guerrillas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/29441281|title=Henry Kissinger 'considered Cuba air strikes' in 1976|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

==Later roles==
[[File:Reagan with Henry Kissinger.jpg|thumb|right|Kissinger meeting with President [[Ronald Reagan]] in the White House family quarters, 1981]]

Kissinger left office when Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]] defeated Republican Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential elections. Kissinger continued to participate in policy groups, such as the [[Trilateral Commission]], and to maintain political consulting, speaking, and writing engagements.

Shortly after Kissinger left office in 1977, he was offered an endowed chair at [[Columbia University]]. There was significant student opposition to the appointment, which eventually became a subject of wide media commentary.<ref>{{cite news|title=400 sign petition against offering Kissinger faculty post|work=Columbia Spectator|date=March 3, 1977}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Anthony Lewis of the Times also blasts former Secretary|work=Columbia Spectator|date=March 3, 1977}}</ref> Columbia cancelled the appointment as a result.

Kissinger was then appointed to [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csis.org/about/history/#1960|title=CSIS|year=2007|publisher=CSIS|accessdate=January 20, 2007}}</ref> He taught at Georgetown's [[Edmund Walsh School of Foreign Service]] for several years in the late 1970s. In 1982, with the help of a loan from the international banking firm of [[Warburg Pincus|E.M.

He also serves as an honorary advisor to the [[U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce|United States-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce]].

From 2000–2006, Kissinger served as chairman of the board of trustees of [[Eisenhower Fellowships]]. In 2006, upon his departure from Eisenhower Fellowships, he received the Dwight D. Eisenhower Medal for Leadership and Service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Council of the Americas Member|publisher=Council of the Americas|url=http://www.efworld.org/about/eisenhower_medal.php|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}</ref>

In November 2002, he was appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to chair the newly established [[9/11 Commission|National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]] to investigate the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/terrorism/july-dec02/investigation_11-27.html |title=INVESTIGATING SEPT. 11 |publisher=Pbs.org |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=February 15, 2014}}</ref> Kissinger stepped down as chairman on December 13, 2002 rather than reveal his business client list, when queried about potential conflicts of interest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/13/kissinger.resigns/|title=Kissinger resigns as head of 9/11 commission|work=CNN Inside Politics|publisher=CNN|date=December 13, 2002|accessdate=August 7, 2006}}</ref>

Kissinger—along with [[William Perry]], [[Sam Nunn]], and [[George Shultz]]—has called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' [[op-ed]]s proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled "[[Nuclear Tipping Point]]". The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in the ''Wall Street Journal'' op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.

===Views on U.S. foreign policy===

====Yugoslav wars====
In several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the [[Yugoslav wars]], he criticized the United States' policies in [[Southeast Europe]], among other things for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state, which he described as a foolish act.<ref name="Rose7185">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/7185|title=Charlie Rose – A panel on the crisis in Bosnia|publisher=charlierose.com|date=November 28, 1994|accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Most importantly he dismissed the notion of [[Serbs]], and [[Croats]] for that part, being aggressors or separatist, saying that "they can't be separating from something that has never existed".<ref name="Rose6651">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/6651|title=Charlie Rose – An interview with Henry Kissinger|publisher=charlierose.com|date=September 14, 1995|accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref>
In addition, he repeatedly warned the West of inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time, and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries.<ref name="Rose6651"/>
Kissinger shared similarly critical views on [[Kosovo War|Western involvement]] in [[Kosovo]]. In particular, he held a disparaging view of the [[Rambouillet Agreement]]:

{{Quote|The Rambouillet text, which called on Serbia to admit NATO troops throughout Yugoslavia, was a provocation, an excuse to start bombing. Rambouillet is not a document that any Serb could have accepted. It was a terrible diplomatic document that should never have been presented in that form.|Henry Kissinger|[[Daily Telegraph]], June 28, 1999}}

However, as the [[Serbs]] did not accept the Rambouillet text and [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombings started]], he opted for a continuation of the bombing as NATO's credibility was now at stake, but dismissed the use of ground forces, claiming that it was not worth it.<ref name="Rose4347">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/4347|title=Charlie Rose – An hour with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger|publisher=charlierose.com|date=April 12, 1999|accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref>

====Iraq====
[[File:Kissinger speaking during Ford's funeral.jpg|thumb|right|Kissinger speaking during [[Gerald Ford]]'s funeral in January 2007]]
In 2006, it was reported in the book ''[[State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III|State of Denial]]'' by [[Bob Woodward]] that Kissinger met regularly with President George W. Bush and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] to offer advice on the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bob Woodward: Bush Misleads On Iraq|publisher=CBS News|date=October 1, 2006|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/28/60minutes/printable2047607.shtml|accessdate=December 29, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203004011/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/28/60minutes/printable2047607.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=December 3, 2006}}</ref> Kissinger confirmed in recorded interviews with Woodward<ref>{{cite news|last=Woodward|first=Bob|title=Secret Reports Dispute White House Optimism|pages=A01|work=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/30/AR2006093000293_pf.html|accessdate=December 29, 2006}}</ref> that the advice was the same as he had given in an August 12, 2005 column in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "Victory over the insurgency is the only meaningful exit strategy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Kissinger|first=Henry A.|title=Lessons for an Exit Strategy|work=The Washington Post|pages=A19|date=August 12, 2005|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/11/AR2005081101756_pf.html|accessdate=December 29, 2006}}</ref>

In a November 19, 2006, interview on BBC ''[[Sunday AM]]'', Kissinger said, when asked whether there is any hope left for a clear military victory in Iraq, "If you mean by 'military victory' an Iraqi government that can be established and whose writ runs across the whole country, that gets the civil war under control and sectarian violence under control in a time period that the political processes of the democracies will support, I don't believe that is possible. ... I think we have to redefine the course. But I don't believe that the alternative is between military victory as it had been defined previously, or total withdrawal."<ref>{{cite news|last=Marr|first=Andrew|title=US Policy on Iraq|date=November 19, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/sunday_am/6163050.stm|accessdate=December 29, 2006|work=[[Sunday AM]]|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

In an April 3, 2008, interview with Peter Robinson of the [[Hoover Institution]], Kissinger reiterated that even though he supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Kissinger |first=Henry A. |title=Iraq is Becoming Bush's Most Difficult Challenge |date=August 11, 2002 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-08-11/news/0208110058_1_regime-change-pre-emptive-action-iraq |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}</ref> he thought that the [[George W. Bush administration]] rested too much of its case for war on Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction. Robinson noted that Kissinger had criticized the administration for invading with too few troops, for disbanding the Iraqi Army, and for mishandling relations with certain allies.<ref name=hoover>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Peter M. |title=Kissinger on War & More |date=April 3, 2008 |work=[[Hoover Institution]] |url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/17980579.html |accessdate=August 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125115002/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uncommon-knowledge/26765 |archivedate=January 25, 2012}}</ref>

====India====
Kissinger said in April 2008 that "India has parallel objectives to the United States," and he called it an [[allies|ally]] of the U.S.<ref name=hoover/>

====China====
Kissinger was present at the opening ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93522545|title=Pioneers of U.S.-China Relations Attend Olympics|author=Juan Williams|date=August 12, 2008|publisher=NPR|accessdate=May 28, 2012|quote=Among the political luminaries attending the Beijing Olympics are Henry Kissinger and former President George H.W.

In 2011, Kissinger published ''[[On China]]'', chronicling the evolution of [[Sino-American]] relations and laying out the challenges to a partnership of 'genuine strategic trust' between the U.S. and China.<ref>{{cite web|last=Friedberg|first=Aaron|title=The Unrealistic Realist|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/books/magazine/91893/henry-kissinger-on-china?page=0,0|work=The New Republic|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref>

====Iran====
Kissinger's position on this issue of U.S.–Iran talks was reported by the ''[[Tehran Times]]'' to be that "Any direct talks between the U.S. and Iran on issues such as the nuclear dispute would be most likely to succeed if they first involved only diplomatic staff and progressed to the level of secretary of state before the heads of state meet."<ref>{{cite news|title=Kissinger backs direct U.S. negotiations with Iran|work=The Tehran Times|date=September 27, 2008|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=165193|accessdate=September 27, 2008}} (Transcript of a [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg reportinterview]].)</ref>

===2014 Ukrainian crisis===
On March 5, 2014, ''The Washington Post'' published an [[op-ed]] piece by Kissinger, 11 days before the [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|Crimean referendum]] on whether [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] should officially rejoin in [[Ukraine]] or join neighboring [[Russia]].<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/henry-kissinger-to-settle-the-ukraine-crisis-start-at-the-end/2014/03/05/46dad868-a496-11e3-8466-d34c451760b9_story.html|title=Henry Kissinger: To settle the Ukraine crisis, start at the end|author=Henry A. Kissinger|date=March 5, 2014|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> In it, he attempted to balance the Ukrainian, Russian and Western desires for a functional state. He made four main points:
# Ukraine should have the right to choose freely its economic and political associations, including with Europe;
# Ukraine should not join NATO, a repetition of the position he took seven years before;
# Ukraine should be free to create any government compatible with the expressed will of its people. Wise Ukrainian leaders would then opt for a policy of reconciliation between the various parts of their country. He imagined an international position for Ukraine like that of [[Finland]].
# Ukraine should maintain sovereignty over Crimea.

Kissinger also wrote: "The west speaks Ukrainian; the east speaks mostly Russian. Any attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the other—as has been the pattern—would lead eventually to civil war or break up."<ref name="washingtonpost"/>

Following the publication of his new book titled ''World Order'', Kissinger participated in an interview with [[Charlie Rose]] and updated his position on Ukraine, which he sees as a possible geographical mediator between Russia and the West.<ref>Charlie Rose, PBS, September 2014.</ref> In a question he posed to himself for illustration regarding re-conceiving policy regarding Ukraine, Kissinger stated: "If Ukraine is considered an outpost, then the situation is that its eastern border is the NATO strategic line, and NATO will be within {{convert|200|mi|km}} of [[Volgograd]]. That will never be accepted by Russia. On the other hand, if the Russian western line is at the border of Poland, Europe will be permanently disquieted. The Strategic objective should have been to see whether one can build Ukraine as a bridge between East and West, and whether one can do it as a kind of a joint effort."<ref>Charlie Rose, reported in Bloomberg BusinessWeek, page 20, October 2, 2014.</ref>

==Public perception==
At the height of Kissinger's prominence, many commented on his wit. In February 1972, at the [[National Press Club (USA)|Washington Press Club]] annual congressional dinner, "Kissinger mocked his reputation as a secret swinger."<ref name="TimeOffDuty">"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905709,00.html Henry Kissinger Off Duty]." ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', February 7, 1972.</ref> The insight, "Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac", is widely attributed to him, although Kissinger was paraphrasing [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-12-26/features/0112250228_1_bill-and-monica-lewinsky-power-ultimate-aphrodisiac |title=Authors: Men's power is sexy, women's suspect |last1=O'Connell |first1=Loraine |date=December 26, 2001 |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref> Some scholars have ranked Kissinger as the most effective U.S. Secretary of State in the 50 years to 2015.<ref name="foreignpolicy"/> A number of activists and human rights lawyers have sought his prosecution for alleged war crimes.<ref name="Rohter"/><ref>{{Cite web|title = Protesters heckle Kissinger, denounce him for 'war crimes'|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/protesters-heckle-kissinger-denounce-him-for-war-crimes/|website = The Times of Israel|accessdate = December 14, 2015}}</ref> According to historian and Kissinger biographer [[Niall Ferguson]], however, accusing Kissinger alone of war crimes "requires a double standard" because "nearly all the secretaries of state&nbsp;... and nearly all the presidents" have taken similar actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1601/10/fzgps.01.html|title=Fareed Zakaria GPS: Islamic Infighting, Iran versus Saudi Arabia; Inside the Oil Kingdom; Kim Jong-Un's Quest for the H-Bomb; Interview with Niall Ferguson; Interview with Gary Kasparov.|publisher=CNN|date=January 10, 2016|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}</ref>

Kissinger has shied away from mainstream media and cable talk-shows{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}. He granted a rare interview to the producers of a documentary examining the underpinnings of the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt entitled ''[[Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tvfestival.net/content/Opening-Film/openUK.php |title= TV Festival 2009 : Opening Film |publisher= Tvfestival.net |accessdate= March 10, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/20091005002038/http://www.tvfestival.net:80/content/Opening-Film/openUK.php |archivedate= October 5, 2009 }}</ref> In the film, Kissinger revealed how close he felt the world came to nuclear war during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] launched by Egypt and Syria against Israel.

Attempts have been made to attach liability to Kissinger for injustices in American foreign policy during his tenure in government.  In September 2001, relatives and survivors of General Rene Schneider, the former head of the Chilean general staff, commenced civil proceedings in Federal Court in Washington, DC, and, in April 2002, a petition for Kissinger's arrest was filed in the High Court in London by human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petertatchell.net/international/united_states/kissinger.htm|title=Warrant Sought for the Arrest of Henry Kissinger|access-date=December 5, 2015}}</ref> citing the destruction of civilian populations and the environment in Indochina during the years 1969-75.
