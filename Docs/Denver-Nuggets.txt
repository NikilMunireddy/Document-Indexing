The '''Denver Nuggets''' are an American professional basketball team based in [[Denver, Colorado]]. The Nuggets are a member of the [[Northwest Division (NBA)|Northwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The team was founded as the '''Denver Larks''' in 1967 as a charter franchise of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) but changed its name to '''Rockets''' before the first season.<ref>{{cite web |title=December to Remember |url=http://www.nba.com/nuggets/december-to-remember |publisher=Denver Nuggets |date=February 16, 2015 |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}</ref> It changed its name again to the Nuggets in 1974, and played for the final [[List of ABA champions|ABA Championship]] title in 1976, losing to the [[Brooklyn Nets|New York Nets]].

The team has had some periods of success, qualifying for the ABA Playoffs for all seasons from 1967 to the [[1976 ABA playoffs]] where it lost in the finals.<ref name="basketball-reference">{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/ |title=Denver Nuggets Franchise Index |publisher=Basketball Reference}}</ref> The team joined the NBA in 1976 after the [[American Basketball Association–National Basketball Association merger|ABA–NBA merger]] and qualified for the [[NBA playoffs]] in nine consecutive seasons in the 1980s and ten consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2013.<ref name="basketball-reference"/> However, it has not made an appearance in a [[NBA Finals|championship round]] since its last year in the ABA.<ref name="basketball-reference"/> The Nuggets play their home games at [[Pepsi Center]], which they share with the [[Colorado Avalanche]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

==Franchise history==

===Team creation===
In 1967, one of the ABA's charter franchises was awarded to a group in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], headed by Southern Californian businessman James Trindle. However, Trindle was unable to find a suitable arena in the Kansas City area. League commissioner [[George Mikan]] suggested moving the team to Denver. After agreeing to name Denver native and former NBA player [[Vince Boryla]] as general manager, Trindle moved his team to Denver as the Denver Larks, named after Colorado's state bird.<ref name="nuggetscompanyhistory">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Denver-Nuggets-Company-History.html Denver Nuggets history] at FundingUniverse</ref> The Trindle group was severely undercapitalized, leading Mikan to order the Larks to post a $100,000 performance bond or lose the franchise. Hours before the deadline, Trindle sold a ⅔ controlling interest to Denver trucking magnate Bill Ringsby for $350,000. Ringsby then renamed the team the Rockets, after his company's long-haul trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/DenverMaterial/RocketsNuggetsYearly.html |title=ABA-era team notes |publisher=Remembertheaba.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref>

===1969–1976: ABA years===
Playing at the [[Denver Auditorium Arena]], the Rockets had early successes on the court, developing a solid fan base along the way.<ref name="remembertheaba.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/DenverMaterial/RocketsNuggetsYearly.html |title=Denver Rockets/Nuggets Year-by-Year Notes |publisher=Remember the ABA |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref> However, the team had a history of early playoff exits and failed to play in an ABA championship series.

Early, they had a solid lineup led by [[Byron Beck]] and [[Larry Jones (basketball)|Larry Jones]], then later by Beck and [[Ralph Simpson]]. [[Lonnie Wright]] of the [[American Football League]]'s [[Denver Broncos]] signed with the Rockets during that first season and became the first player to play professional football and basketball in the same season. Wright played four seasons with Denver.<ref name="remembertheaba.com"/> Controversial rookie [[Spencer Haywood]] joined the team for the 1969–70 season. Haywood was one of the first players to turn pro before graduating from college, and the NBA initially refused to let him play in the league. Haywood averaged nearly 30 points and 19.5 rebounds per game in his only ABA season, being named ABA MVP, ABA rookie of the year, as well as the All-Star Game MVP. The team finished 51-33, winning their division, before exiting the playoffs in the 2nd round.

Just before the start of the 1970-71 season, Haywood signed with the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], jumping to the NBA. The team tumbled to a 30-54 record and attendance suffered.<ref name="remembertheaba.com"/>
[[Image:Denver rockets.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Denver Rockets (1967–76)]]

====Becoming the Denver Nuggets====
Ringsby sold the team to [[San Diego]] businessmen Frank Goldberg and Bud Fischer in 1972.<ref name="nuggetscompanyhistory"/> In 1974, in anticipation of moving into the [[NBA]], and the new [[McNichols Arena]], the franchise held a contest to choose a new team nickname, as "Rockets" was already in use by the [[Houston Rockets]]. The winning choice was "Nuggets", in honor of the original [[Denver Nuggets (original)|Nuggets]] team in Denver from 1948–50, the last year as a charter member of the NBA. Their new logo was a miner "discovering" an ABA ball. Goldberg and Fischer in turn sold the team to a local investment group in 1976.

With the drafting and signing of future hall of fame player [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] out of [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]], [[Marvin Webster]] and the acquisitions of [[Dan Issel]] and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]] and with [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] coaching, they had their best seasons in team history in their first two seasons as the Nuggets. Playing in the [[Denver Auditorium Arena]] for the last season the 1974–75 team went 65-16, including a 40-2 record at home. However, a quick playoff exit followed.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Denver-Rockets.html |title=Denver Rockets |publisher=Remember the ABA |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref>

In 1975-76, playing at their new arena, the Nuggets edged the reigning champion [[Kentucky Colonels]] four games to three to make the [[1976 ABA Playoffs|1976 ABA finals]] for the first time. Eventually, they lost to the [[New York Nets]] and [[Julius Erving]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> They did not get a second chance to win an ABA league championship, as the [[American Basketball Association–National Basketball Association merger|ABA–NBA merger]] took place after the 1975–76 season. The Nuggets, Nets, [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[San Antonio Spurs]] were merged into the NBA. The [[Spirits of St. Louis]] and Kentucky Colonels were disbanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Spirits-of-St-Louis.html |title=Spirits of St. Louis |publisher=Remember the ABA |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref>

===1976–1982: early NBA years===
The Nuggets and Nets had actually applied to join the NBA in 1975, but were forced to stay in the ABA by a court order. The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason.  Similarly to the other new NBA teams, the Nuggets were given many financial issues including a $2 million entry fee. [[Red McCombs]] bought the team in 1978.

[[Image:Denvernuggets.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Classic "Rainbow" logo (1982–93)]]
In 1979, Brown left the team, helping usher in a brief decline in their team's performance. It ended in 1981, when they hired [[Doug Moe]] as a head coach. Moe brought with him a "motion offense" philosophy, a style of play focusing on attempting to move the ball until someone got open. Moe was also known for not paying as much attention to defense as his colleagues. The offense helped the team become highly competitive. During the 1980s, the Nuggets often{{quantify|date=June 2015}} scored in excess of 115 points a game, and during the 1981–82 season, they scored at least 100 points in every game—136 consecutive games (NBA record).<ref name="NBA Records">{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_points.html |title=Regular Season Records: Points |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> During the 1981–82 season, the Nuggets set the league scoring record for the highest points per game average at 126.5 points.

===1982–1989: The Alex English era===
Anchored by scoring machines [[Alex English]] and [[Kiki Vandeweghe]] at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span. (On December 13, 1983, the Nuggets and the visiting [[Detroit Pistons]] combined for an NBA record 370 points, with Detroit winning in triple [[Overtime (sport)#Basketball|overtime]], 186–184.) At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe. In [[1984–85 NBA season|1984–85]], they made it to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in 5 games to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

Vandeweghe was traded before the 1984–85 season to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for 6–3 rebounding guard [[Fat Lever]], undersized power forward [[Calvin Natt]] and center [[Wayne Cooper (basketball)|Wayne Cooper]]. Spearheaded by Alex English and supported by the three new acquisitions and defensive specialists [[Bill Hanzlik]] and [[TR Dunn]], the team replicated its success in the Western Conference despite the loss of Vandeweghe. They even managed to win 54 games in the [[1987-88 NBA season|1987–88 season]], the most they had ever won as an NBA team. However, the Mavericks eliminated the Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs. McCombs sold the team to Sidney Shlenker in 1985. Shlenker, in turn, sold the team to [[COMSAT]] in 1989.

===1989–1991: A period of decline===
Moe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by [[Paul Westhead]]. Westhead also believed in a "[[run and gun (basketball)|run and gun]]" style of play, and gave the green light for players like [[Michael Adams (basketball)|Michael Adams]] and [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf|Chris Jackson]] to light up the scoreboards within seconds of possession.
[[Image:Lipofsky-Dikembe Motombo.jpg|thumb|upright|Dikembe Mutombo (shown with the 76ers) was drafted by the Nuggets in 1991.]]
However, Westhead cared even less about defense than Moe. As a result, the Nuggets gave up points so quickly that even their prolific offense couldn't keep up. They finished with the worst record in the league during the 1990–91 season, despite setting many scoring records. As an insult, many sportswriters nicknamed the team at the time as the "Enver Nuggets" (as in no "D", or no defense).

===1991–1996: The Dikembe Mutombo era===
Denver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting 7–2 [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University]] [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Dikembe Mutombo]] in 1991. Mutombo finished runner-up to [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] for the NBA rookie of the year that season. Denver finished 24–58 that year.

Denver fired Westhead prior to the 1992–93 season and hired former star player [[Dan Issel]] as his successor. The Nuggets had two lottery picks that year and drafted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|University of Notre Dame]] [[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[LaPhonso Ellis]] and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|University of Virginia]] [[guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Bryant Stith]]. Denver improved to 36–46, just missing the playoffs that year.

Denver ditched their rainbow colors for a dark navy, metallic gold and wine color scheme starting in the 1993–94 season. Led by Mutombo, [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]] (who changed his name from Chris Jackson prior to the season), and Ellis, Denver finished with its first winning season since the Doug Moe era at 42–40. Denver clinched the 8th seed in the Western Conference playoffs, playing the first place [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. Denver was a heavy underdog, having only a couple of players on their roster with actual NBA playoff experience. After dropping the first two games of the five-game set in [[Seattle]], the series returned to Denver. Denver won both games and tied the series at 2. The Nuggets made NBA history in Game 5, upsetting Seattle in overtime 98–94. They became the first 8th-seeded team to defeat a 1st-seeded team in NBA playoff history. Denver almost repeated the feat before falling to the [[Utah Jazz]] in Game 7 of the second round.

Denver acquired Sonics sharp-shooter [[Dale Ellis]] in the off-season and drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] guard [[Jalen Rose]]. Denver struggled, causing Issel to resign as coach partway into the season. Assistant Coach [[Gene Littles]] assumed control for a brief period before relinquishing control to general manager [[Bernie Bickerstaff]]. Denver rebounded and earned the 8th seed again in the playoffs, finishing 41–41. The Nuggets were swept by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the first round of the playoffs that season.

Following that season, Denver acquired [[Antonio McDyess]] in a draft day trade with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. McDyess was the face of the franchise for the next few years, as Mutombo left after the 1995–96 season for the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Ellis missed the majority of the next few seasons due to recurring knee and leg injuries, Rose was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] for [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]], and Abdul-Rauf was traded to the [[Sacramento Kings]] prior to the 1996–97 season.

===1997–2003: Another period of struggle===
After finishing the 1996-97 season with the fourth worst record in the league (21-61), the Nuggets sent [[Antonio McDyess]] to the [[Phoenix Suns]], and [[Dale Ellis]] returned to Seattle. Denver flirted with history in the [[1997–98 NBA season|1997–98]], by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11). They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst ''single-season'' losing streak at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|23]]—only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the early 1980s. The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses. Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03]], also with the Cavaliers.

====New ownerships====
The team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability. COMSAT bought the [[NHL]]'s [[Quebec Nordiques]] in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to [[Liberty Media]].<ref name="nuggetscompanyhistory"/> However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the [[Atlanta Braves]]), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.<ref name=CSprings>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20000223/ai_n9967143 Liberty buys Ascent/Nuggets, Avs, arena still on block]. [[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]], 2000-02-23.</ref>

[[Image:Denver Nuggets 2003-2008.svg|thumb|The Nuggets have used this logo in various forms since 1993. The logo in this picture was introduced in 2003 and replaced the navy, metallic gold, and dark red colors of the original with royal blue, powder blue, gold, and white. It was revised in 2008, when the shade of the mountain was changed back to navy.]]
After almost two years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to [[Walmart]] heirs [[Nancy Walton Laurie|Bill and Nancy Laurie]] for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.<ref name=Press>Schley, Stewart. [http://www.allbusiness.com/north-america/united-states-colorado/1181899-1.html Stan Kroenke's full-court press]. Colorado Biz, 2006-06-01.</ref>

However, a new wrinkle appeared when the city of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had bought the teams in his own name, and the city wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.<ref name=bizjournal>Moore, Paula. [http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2000/07/17/story4.html Why one deal went smoothly]. [[Denver Business Journal]], 2000-07-17.</ref> In the meantime, Issel had returned as head coach in 1999, but the protracted ownership negotiations made it difficult for him to rebuild the team. Just before the start of the 1999–2000 season, he told reporters there were several personnel moves he simply couldn't make due to the unstable ownership situation (since all basketball decisions required the approval of both Ascent/Liberty ''and'' Sturm).<ref>[http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/news/1999/1111/164615.html Nuggets roster moves put on hold]. [[ESPN]], 1999-11-11.</ref>

Finally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center were bought by real estate entrepreneur [[Stan Kroenke]] in a $450 million deal.<ref name="nuggetscompanyhistory"/> Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife [[Ann Walton Kroenke|Ann]] is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained only a 6.5% stake of the sports franchises. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that would ensure the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025.<ref name=bizjournal/> After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises.

===2003–2013: George Karl in charge===

====2003–2006 Carmelo Anthony arrives====
In [[2003–04 NBA season|2003]], the Nuggets drafted future [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] [[Carmelo Anthony]] with the third overall pick in the [[2003 NBA Draft]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2003/draft/news/2003/06/26/nuggets_anthony_ap/ | work=CNN | title=Denver ecstatic to get Anthony with third pick | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> That same year, the team also updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of powder blue, gold and royal blue; the latter color was changed to navy blue in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_nuggets.html |title=Going Retro: Denver Nuggets |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> In just two months of the season, the Nuggets recorded more wins than they had in 5½ months of play in 2002–03.

In the [[2005 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], however, the Nuggets could not survive the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. After winning game one in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], the Nuggets proceeded to lose the next four games and lost the series 4–1.<ref>Deseret News Publishing Co. (May 5, 2005).

In [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06]], for the first time in 18 years, the club won the Northwest division title.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tuesday, Apr 11, 2006 |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap?gid=2006041022&prov=ap |title=Nuggets 110, Trail Blazers 98 – NBA – Yahoo!

====2006–2008: Anthony and Iverson====
[[File:Iverson from behind.jpg|thumb|right|Allen Iverson helped Denver to their first 50-win season since 1988.]]
On December 19, 2006, the Nuggets traded [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], [[Andre Miller]] and two first-round draft picks of the [[2007 NBA Draft]] to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] for [[Ivan McFarlin]] and superstar [[Allen Iverson]] (McFarlin was waived immediately following the trade's approval). The moves gave the Nuggets the top two scorers in the league at the time in Anthony and Iverson, who were both scoring over 30 points per game at the time of the trade. On January 11, 2007, [[Earl Boykins]], [[Julius Hodge]] and cash considerations were traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], in exchange for point guard [[Steve Blake]]. With Iverson, many considered the Nuggets as one of the elite in the West. However, chemistry was an issue, as the Nuggets finished the season with the 6 seed, giving them a first round matchup against the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. In the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the Nuggets took Game 1 and home court advantage away from the Spurs. However, in an eerie repeat of the 2005 playoffs, the Spurs bounced back to sweep the next four, as the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round in five games for the fourth straight year.

On March 16, [[2007–08 NBA season|2008]], the Nuggets scored 168 points in a 168–116 home win over [[Seattle SuperSonics]].<ref name="nuggets168points">{{cite web|author=Pepsi Center, Denver, CO |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280316007 |title=ESPN – Seattle vs. Denver – Recap – March 16, 2008 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-03-16 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> It was the third-most points scored for a regulation game in NBA history (The Nuggets and the Pistons hold the spot for most combined points scored in a game which was over 360 points total.)<ref name="nuggets168points" />

They finished the [[2007–08 NBA season]] with exactly 50 wins as well as finishing the first half of that season 25–16 (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in the last game of the season.<ref name="nuggets50wins0708">{{cite web|author=Pepsi Center, Denver, CO |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280416007 |title=ESPN – Memphis vs. Denver – Recap – April 16, 2008 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> It was the first time since the [[1987–88 NBA season]] that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season.<ref name="nuggets50wins0708" /> Denver ended up as the 8th seed in the Western Conference of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs]], and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an 8th seed in NBA history.<ref name="nuggets50wins0708" /> It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a Conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (57–25) in the first round. The seven games separating the Nuggets and the Lakers overall records is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in [[1983–84 NBA season|1983–84]].<ref name="nuggets50wins0708" /> However, the Lakers swept them in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven playoff series]] in the first round.

====2008–2011: Anthony and Billups====
On July 16, 2008, at the end of the [[2007–08 NBA season]], the Nuggets traded former [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|NBA Defensive Player of the Year]] [[Marcus Camby]] to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for a second-round draft pick (that was then traded to the [[New York Knicks]] for [[Renaldo Balkman]]). This trade was to reduce the Nuggets' payroll costs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On November 3, 2008, guard [[Allen Iverson]] was traded to the [[Detroit Pistons]] for [[Chauncey Billups]], [[Antonio McDyess]], and [[Cheikh Samb]] (part of the trade exception from the Marcus Camby trade was used to allow the deal to go through). McDyess was waived though on November 10, 2008, and he returned to Detroit shortly afterwards.

[[File:Chauncey Billups with the ball.jpg|thumbnail|Chauncey Billups, acquired in 2008, helped the George Karl/ Carmelo Anthony duo to their first playoff series win.]]
With [[Carmelo Anthony]] averaging 22.8 ppg and Billups averaging 6.4 assists in the [[2008–09 NBA season]] the [[2008-09 Denver Nuggets season|Nuggets]] accomplished a great number of franchise milestones. Their 54–28 record matched the most wins the franchise had gotten since their induction in the NBA; their 27–14 start was also a record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise's history the team had back-to-back 50-win seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and placing #2 in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team has ever been seeded for the playoffs. [[General Manager]] [[Mark Warkentien]] won the [[NBA Executive of the Year Award]] for the Nuggets' improvement. They won Game 1 of the playoffs in a blowout victory against the [[2008-09 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]], the first time they had home-court advantage since [[1987–88 NBA season|1988]] and also, the 29-point victory was the largest victory for any team for Game 1 of the first round of the [[2009 NBA Playoffs]]. Chauncey Billups set a Nuggets franchise record with the most three-pointers in a playoff game with 8, and his 19 three-pointers in total is also a Nuggets record for threes made in a playoff series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/den |title=Denver Nuggets on Yahoo!

They then went on to beat the 6th seed [[Dallas Mavericks]] 4 games to 1 in the Conference Semifinals to make their first trip to the [[1985 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference Finals since 1985]]. That was also the first time the Nuggets had ever led 3–0 in a best-of-seven series. Up to that point, they held an NBA Playoffs-high in three-pointers made and a 16-point average margin of victory, the largest average margin of victory in the first 10 playoff games in NBA Playoff history. They lost the first game of the Western Conference Finals against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] but won the second game to tie the series. Anthony became the first Denver player to score at least 30 points in five consecutive playoff games since the Nuggets joined the NBA in 1976. They lost the series 4–2, ending Denver's longest playoff run in team history.<ref>{{cite web|author=BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer, May 22, 2:04 am EDT |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap;_ylt=AlNN2XjoZYQHYEqbjaNlBrN70bYF?gid=2009052113&prov=ap |title=Nuggets beat Lakers 106–103 in Game 2&nbsp;– NBA&nbsp;– Yahoo!

In the [[2009 NBA Draft]], the Nuggets traded a first-round draft pick acquired from the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for the rights to rookie [[Ty Lawson]], who was drafted 18th overall. On July 13, 2009, the Nuggets traded a second-round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons for [[Arron Afflalo]] (part of the trade exception from the Iverson trade was used to allow the deal to go through) and [[Walter Sharpe]]. Afflalo replaced starting guard [[Dahntay Jones]], who signed with the [[Indiana Pacers]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Dempsey The Denver Post |url=http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_12830172 |title=Nuggets' deal for Afflalo fills Jones' role |publisher=The Denver Post |date= July 14, 2009|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> However, on August 10, the Nuggets lost forward [[Linas Kleiza]], who signed with [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos Piraeus]] of the [[A1 Ethniki|Greek League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4389053 |title=NBA free agents: Denver Nuggets forward Linas Kleiza takes Olympiakos' offer&nbsp;– ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

The [[2009–10 NBA season|2009–10]] season saw Anthony average 28.2 ppg and Billups average a career-high 19.6 ppg. In the opening two games of the season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals [[Utah Jazz]] and [[Portland Trail Blazers]], respectively.  Anthony became one of two players in the Nuggets' history to open with more than 70 points through two games (Alex English also accomplished the feat). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hochman |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_13681618 |title=Nuggets' Carmelo Anthony, armed with a new mind-set, is off to sizzling start for 2–0 Denver |publisher=The Denver Post |date=2009-10-31 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> They later went 3–0, 4–0, and 5–0 for the first time since 1985 after defeating the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], [[Indiana Pacers]], and [[New Jersey Nets]] respectively. Despite injuries which caused all three captains – Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, and [[Kenyon Martin]]&nbsp;– to miss a total of 46 games, and then later on in the second half of the season the absence of head coach [[George Karl]], who underwent treatment for [[neck]] and [[throat cancer]], the Nuggets were still able to win 53 games (third consecutive 50-win season, a Nuggets first) for the season which gave them a second consecutive Northwest division title and finished as the fourth seed in the West Conference. However, they were eliminated by the [[Utah Jazz]] 4-2, their sixth first-round elimination in 7 seasons. Anthony averaged a career-high 30.7 ppg in the playoffs.

On July 14, 2010, the Nuggets bolstered their frontcourt depth by signing [[Al Harrington]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Tomasson %BloggerTitle% |url=http://nba.fanhouse.com/2010/07/14/harrington-heading-to-denver-for-five-tear-deal/ |title=Al Harrington Heading to Denver for Five-Year Deal |publisher=Nba.fanhouse.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> During the 2010 off-season, [[Masai Ujiri]] replaced [[Mark Warkentien]] as the General Manager, while Josh Kroenke was named team president.

Since the NFL does not allow its owners to hold majority control of major-league teams in other NFL cities, Kroenke turned over day-to-day control of the Nuggets and Avalanche to Josh Kroenke toward the end of 2010, and must sell his controlling interest in both teams by 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5496516|title=Stan Kroenke is new Rams owner|date=25 August 2010|publisher=''[[ESPN]]''}}</ref>

====2011–2012: Anthony departs====
On February 22, 2011, after months of speculation that he wanted to leave the Nuggets, [[Carmelo Anthony]] was traded along with [[Chauncey Billups]], [[Anthony Carter]], [[Shelden Williams]] and [[Renaldo Balkman]] to the [[New York Knicks]] in a multi-player deal also involving the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in which the Nuggets received [[Wilson Chandler]], [[Raymond Felton]], [[Danilo Gallinari]], [[Timofey Mozgov]] and [[Kosta Koufos]]. On the day when the trade was done, the Nuggets were left with 9 players to play against the [[Memphis Grizzlies]]. The Nuggets won 120–107, where they led by as many as 27 points. In the closing minutes of the game, the arena resounded with chants of "Who needs Melo?" George Karl said after the game, "Our guys, when their backs are confronted with a difficult situation, they usually play at a high level. We always react to tough situations in a very positive way." Some people{{who|date=June 2015}} said after the trade the Nuggets would become the "[[Cleveland Cavaliers]]" of the West, that is, falter in the standings and lose their playoff hopes due to the loss of their franchise player, Carmelo. However, the trade only seemed to make them better. Post-trade, the Nuggets averaged 24.1 assists, showing their newfound teamwork. The defense of the Nuggets also improved, from allowing 105.2 ppg before the trade to of 97.1 ppg for the remainder of the season. <!--PPG UPDATED ON APRIL 4, 2011--><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_17443219 | work=Denver Post | first1=Benjamin | last1=Hochman | first2=Chris | last2=Dempsey | title=Carmelo Anthony traded to New York Knicks in blockbuster deal | date=February 21, 2011}}</ref> Despite the franchise changing trade which saw eighteen different starting lineups through the whole season, Denver finished with 50 wins (fourth consecutive 50 win seasons for the first time in Nuggets history), clinching the 5th seed of the Western Conference. They met the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the first round of the playoffs and lost four games to one.
[[File:George Karl.jpg|thumb|right|George Karl was named NBA Coach of the Year in 2013, his final season in Denver]]
The first full season of the post-Melo Nuggets saw the steady rise of Danilo Gallinari, who averaged 17 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists through the first 25 games of the season, which resulted to the Nuggets' best start through the first 20 games. But Gallinari was robbed off his best season by injuries to his ankle, thumb, and wrist. On March 15, 2012, the Nuggets decided to make their team younger by trading [[Nenê]], who had played the previous 9 seasons for Denver, to the [[Washington Wizards]] for [[JaVale McGee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/wizards/news/wizards_acquire_nene_031512.html|title=WIZARDS ACQUIRE NENE FROM DENVER|date=March 15, 2012|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}</ref>  In his first game as a Nugget, McGee made a putback dunk off an [[Arron Afflalo]] miss which proved to be the game-winning basket in Denver's 116-115 victory over the Detroit Pistons. In two of the Nuggets final games of their season, McGee finally earned national attention when he had a 16-point,15-rebound effort, and a 21-point, 14-rebound effort in Denver's playoff series against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. These performances helped the Nuggets come back from a 2-0 and a 3-1 series deficit, but the Nuggets eventually lost in Game 7, 87-96.

====2012–2013: Team concept====
On August 10, 2012, Denver was involved in a four-team trade where they received All-Star [[Andre Iguodala]] and sent Arron Afflalo and [[Al Harrington]] to the [[Orlando Magic]]. This same trade also sent [[Dwight Howard]] to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. After the trade, Iguodala tweeted "I'm excited to be joining the Denver Nuggets and I know my best basketball is ahead of me!"<ref>{{cite web|title=Sources: Dwight Howard to Lakers|url=http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/8252042/sources-dwight-howard-los-angeles-lakers-four-team-deal-complete|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref> Despite losing their first three games, the 2012-2013 Nuggets finished with a franchise best 57-25 record, and a 38-3 record in Pepsi Center (the Washington Wizards, [[Miami Heat]], and Minnesota Timberwolves were the only 3 visitors to defeat Denver on their home during the regular season).Denver also clinched the 3rd seed in the Western Conference, with a first round matchup with the [[Golden State Warriors]]. The Nuggets won Game 1 97-95 on their home court on a last second Andre Miller game winner, but the Warriors won the next three games, putting the Nuggets on the brink of elimination. Denver won Game 5 at home to keep their season alive, but the Warriors eliminated the Nuggets in Game 6, winning 88-92 in Oakland. It was Denver's ninth first round loss in the previous 10 seasons, and the eighth of Karl's tenure.  Although Karl won that year's [[NBA Coach of the Year Award]] and had led Denver to the playoffs in every year of his nine-year tenure, it wasn't enough to keep him from being fired after the season.

===2013–present===
Along with Karl being fired, Denver saw a major shake-up in the front office with [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]] [[Masai Ujiri]] accepting the general manager position with the [[Toronto Raptors]]<ref>[http://www.mississauga.com/sports-story/3254800-toronto-raptors-introduce-masai-ujiri-as-the-club-s-new-general-manager/ Toronto Raptors introduce Masai Ujiri as the club’s new general manager<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and vice-president [[Pete D'Alessandro]], who was expected to replace Ujiri, being named General Manager of the [[Sacramento Kings]].

Guard-forward Andre Iguodala was sent to the Golden State Warriors in a sign-and-trade in which they acquired guard [[Randy Foye]] from the Utah Jazz. They also signed center-forward [[JJ Hickson]], who was previously with the Portland Trail Blazers and 5' 9" guard [[Nate Robinson]], who played for the Bulls during the 2012–2013 season. They also acquired Darrell Arthur from the Memphis Grizzlies and 55th pick Joffrey Lauvergne in return for Kosta Koufos.<ref>https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--kings-hire-nuggets-vp-pete-d-alessandro-as-general-manager-194709663.html</ref> In a tough 2013-14 season which saw numerous injuries to key players missing a significant amount of the season, the Nuggets finished with 36 wins, their worst in 11 years, and missed the playoffs.

During the 2014 offseason, the Nuggets brought back [[Arron Afflalo]] who they traded [[Evan Fournier]] for. Denver also traded their first lottery pick (#11) since 2003 to [[Chicago Bulls|Chicago]] to acquire two later first round draft picks, which were used to draft [[Jusuf Nurkić]] and [[Gary Harris]]. On March 3, 2015 general manager [[Tim Connelly]] announced the Nuggets fired head coach Brian Shaw and named [[Melvin Hunt]] interim head coach.<ref>https://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12413975/brian-shaw-fired-denver-nuggets</ref>

==Uniforms==
The Nuggets have worn numerous uniforms throughout their franchise history, including their days in the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) as the "Denver Rockets." From the early to mid-1970s, the Nuggets wore gold and purple (Columbine blue) uniforms.

When the Nuggets joined the NBA in the 1976–77 season, they retained the pick-axe logo on their jerseys from the ABA days. The home uniforms feature 'Nuggets' in red with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back. The road uniforms were blue, with 'Denver' in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back.

The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA. From 1977–82, their home uniforms were white, with a "Nuggets" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers. The royal blue away jersey had "Denver" written across the chest in white, with gold trim.

From the early-1980s until the [[1992–93 NBA season|1992–93]] season, the Nuggets wore the Denver "rainbow city" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms. Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the "[[Tetris]]" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares. The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with "Nuggets" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim. The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position. In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue. In 1991, coinciding with the debut of [[Dikembe Mutombo]], the word "Nuggets" became white with royal blue and gold trim. The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with "Denver" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms).

For the [[1993–94 NBA season|1993–94]] season, the Nuggets drastically changed their look, with a navy blue, gold and wine color scheme on their uniforms. The home jerseys had a "Nuggets" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with dark red and gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in gold, with dark red and white trim. The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03]] season.

For the [[2003–04 NBA season|2003–04]] season, the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with [[Carmelo Anthony]]'s debut with a new color scheme of powder blue, royal blue and gold. Like the 1990s uniforms, the new Nuggets jerseys also have the Aachen typeface across the chest — it's "Nuggets" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the new powder blue road jersey has "Denver" in white, with gold and royal blue trim. These jerseys were tweaked prior to the [[2008–09 NBA season|2008–09]] season, with the royal blue trim replaced by navy blue, as well as a circle patch of the Nuggets alternate pick axe logo placed above the nameplate on the backs of the jerseys.

In the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06]] season, the Nuggets also introduced an alternate navy blue uniform, with an alternate Nuggets script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining. This uniform was used until the end of the [[2011–12 NBA season|2011–12]] season.

For the [[2012–13 NBA season|2012–13]] season, the Nuggets unveiled a new gold alternate jersey, replacing the aforementioned navy blue jerseys that had been used during the previous seven seasons. The new alternate uniform features a return to the Denver "rainbow skyline" logo, but used the team's current color scheme and Aachen typeface.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/nuggets/nuggets-unveil-new-alternate-skyline-jerseys Nuggets Unveil New Alternate "Skyline" Jerseys]</ref>

For the [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–16]] season, the Nuggets will modify the script and numbering fonts on their home and away jerseys, with a gold "Nuggets" script on the home white jersey and a gold "Denver" script on the powder blue away jersey — both with the Coliseum typeface. Navy blue numerals trimmed in gold, as well as navy blue nameplates, will be featured on both the home and away jerseys. The alternate gold "skyline" jerseys were also tweaked, with a retro "Nuggets" wordmark (that was used on the 1980s rainbow skyline jerseys) in navy blue trimmed in white. The numerals will also be modified with the Coliseum typeface, but will remain white, with powder blue interior trim and navy blue exterior outlining.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lukas, Paul |title=Uni changes coming to numerous teams in 2015-16 |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12880062/uni-changes-coming-numerous-teams-2015-16 |work=[[ESPN]] |date=May 13, 2015 |accessdate=May 13, 2015}}</ref>

===Retained draft rights===
The Nuggets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm|title=NBA Salary Cap FAQ – 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement|quote=If the player is already under contract to, or signs a contract with a non-NBA team, the team retains the player's draft rights for one year after the player's obligation to the non-NBA team ends. Essentially, the clock stops as long as the player plays pro ball outside the NBA.|first=Larry|last=Coon|authorlink=Larry Coon|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.
