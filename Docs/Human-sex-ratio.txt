In [[anthropology]] and [[demography]], the '''human sex ratio''' is the [[ratio]] of [[male]]s to [[female]]s in a [[population]]. Like most sexual species, the sex ratio in humans is approximately 1:1.  The sex ratio at birth worldwide is commonly thought to be 107 [[boy]]s to 100 [[girl]]s,<ref>{{cite web |title=CIA Fact Book | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html | publisher=The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States}}</ref> although this value is subject to debate in the scientific community. The sex ratio for the entire [[world population]] is 101 males to 100 females.<ref name="CIA Fact Book">{{cite web |title=CIA Fact Book | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html | publisher=The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States}}</ref> Depending upon which definition is used, between 0.1% and 1.7% of live births are [[intersex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency |title=How common is intersex? &#124; Intersex Society of North America |publisher=Isna.org |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref><ref name="sexing">{{cite book| last =  Fausto-Sterling| first =  Anne| authorlink = Anne Fausto-Sterling| title = Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality| publisher = Basic Books| year = 2000| location = New York| pages = | url =  |doi =| id = |isbn = 0-465-07713-7 }}</ref>

[[Human sex ratio#Gender imbalance|Gender imbalance]] may arise as a consequence of various factors including natural factors, exposure to pesticides and environmental contaminants,<ref>Davis, Devra Lee; Gottlieb, Michelle and Stampnitzky, Julie; "Reduced Ratio of Male to Female Births in Several Industrial Countries" in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''; April 1, 1998, volume 279(13); pp. 1018-1023</ref> war casualties, gender-selective abortions and infanticides, aging, and deliberate [[gendercide]].

More data are available for humans than for any other species, and the human sex ratio is more studied than that of any other species, but interpreting these statistics can be difficult.

Human sex ratios, either at birth or in the population as a whole, are reported in any of four ways: the ratio of males to females, the ratio of females to males, the proportion of males, or the proportion of females. If there are 108,000 males and 100,000 females the ratio of males to females is 1.080 and the proportion of males is 51.9%. Scientific literature often uses the proportion of males. This article uses the ratio of males to females, unless specified otherwise.

==Natural ratio==
In a study around 2002, the natural sex ratio at birth was estimated to be close to 1.06 males/female.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Unexplained differences in sex ratios at birth in Europe and North America | pmc=102777 | publisher=BMJ, NCBI/National Institutes of Health | pmid=11976243 |year=2002 |last1=Grech |first1=V |last2=Savona-Ventura |first2=C |last3=Vassallo-Agius |first3=P |volume=324 |issue=7344 |pages=1010–1 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7344.1010}}</ref> In most populations, adult males tend to have higher death rates than adult females of the same age (even after allowing for causes specific to females such as death in childbirth), both due to natural causes such as heart attacks and strokes, which account for by far the majority of deaths and also to violent causes, such as homicide and warfare (for example, in the USA as of 2006, an adult non-elderly male is 3 to 6 times more likely to become a victim of a homicide and 2.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die in an accident than a female of the same age),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/gmwk291r.htm|title=Death Rates for 113 Selected Causes by 5-Year Age Groups, Race, and Sex: United States, 1999-2006}}</ref> resulting in higher [[life expectancy]] of females. Consequently, the sex ratio tends to reduce as age increases, and among the elderly there is usually an excess of females. For example, the male to female ratio falls from 1.05 for the group aged 15 to 65 to 0.70 for the group over 65 in [[Demographics of Germany|Germany]], from 1.00 to 0.72 in [[Demographics of the USA|the USA]], from 1.06 to 0.91 in mainland [[People's Republic of China|China]] and from 1.07 to 1.02 in India.

In the United States, the sex ratios at birth over the period 1970–2002 were 1.05 for the white non-Hispanic population, 1.04 for Mexican Americans, 1.03 for African Americans and Indians, and 1.07 for mothers of Chinese or Filipino ethnicity.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Matthews TJ, etal |title=Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States |journal=National Vital Statistics Reports |volume=53 |issue=20 |date=June 2005}}</ref>  Among Western European countries ca. 2001, the ratios ranged from 1.04 in Belgium to 1.07 in Switzerland,<ref>{{cite web |title=Sex ratio in Switzerland|url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/00/01/blank/02.html | publisher=Switzerland Federal Statistics Office}}</ref> Italy,<ref>{{cite web |title=UN Sex Ratio Statistics|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm|publisher=United Nations Population Division}}</ref> Ireland<ref>{{cite web|title=Sex ratio at birth (per 100 female newborn)|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=sex+ratio+birth&d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3a52|publisher=United Nations Data Division}}</ref> and Portugal.  In the aggregated results of 56 Demographic and Health Surveys<ref>[http://www.measuredhs.com/ Demographic and Health Survey]</ref> in African countries, the ratio is 1.03, though there is also considerable country-to-country variation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garenne M |title=Sex ratios at birth in African populations: a review of survey data |journal=Hum. Biol. |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=889–900 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12617497 |doi=10.1353/hub.2003.0003 }}</ref>

Even in the absence of [[sex selection]] practices, a range of "normal" sex ratios at birth of between 103 and 108 boys per 100 girls has been observed in different economically developed countries,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sex ratio at birth (per 100 female newborn, 2005-2010 data)|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=sex+ratio+birth&d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3a52%3btimeID%3a113&c=2,4,6,7&s=_crEngNameOrderBy:asc,_timeEngNameOrderBy:desc,_varEngNameOrderBy:asc&v=1 | publisher=United Nations Data Division}}</ref> and among different ethnic and racial groups within a given country.

In an extensive study, carried out around 2005, of sex ratio at birth in the United States from 1940 over 62 years,<ref name=NCHS>{{cite web|title=Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics}}</ref> statistical evidence suggested the following: For mothers having their first baby, the total sex ratio at birth was 1.06 overall, with some years at 1.07. For mothers having babies after the first, this ratio consistently decreased with each additional baby from 1.06 towards 1.03. The age of the mother affected the ratio: the overall ratio was 1.05 for mothers aged 25 to 35 at the time of birth; while mothers who were below the age of 15 or above 40 had babies with a sex ratio ranging between 0.94 and 1.11, and a total sex ratio of 1.04. This United States study also noted that American mothers of Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, Cuban and Japanese ethnicity had the highest sex ratio, with years as high as 1.14 and average sex ratio of 1.07 over the 62-year study period.

== Factors affecting sex ratio in humans ==

=== Fisher's principle ===
{{Main|Fisher's principle}}

Fisher's principle is an explanation of why the sex ratio of most species is approximately 1:1. Outlined by [[Ronald Fisher]] in his 1930 book, it is an argument in terms of parental expenditure. Essentially he argues that the 1:1 ratio is the evolutionarily stable strategy.

===Natural factors===
The natural factors that affect the human sex ratio are an active area of scientific research. Over 1000 articles have been published in various journals. Two of the often cited reviews of scientific studies on human sex ratio are by W. H. James.<ref>{{cite journal | author= James WH|year= 1987|title= The human sex ratio. Part 1: A review of the literature|journal= Human Biology|volume= 59|issue= 5 |pages= 721–752|pmid= 3319883|url= http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&nextAction=lnk&base=MEDLINE&exprSearch=3319883&indexSearch=UI&lang=i|accessdate= August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author= James WH|year= 1987|title= The human sex ratio. Part 2: A hypothesis and a program of research|journal= Human Biology|volume= 59|issue= 6 |pages= 873–900|pmid= 3327803|url= http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&nextAction=lnk&base=MEDLINE&exprSearch=3319883&indexSearch=UI&lang=i|accessdate= August 2011}}</ref> The scientific studies are based on extensive birth and death records in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe. A few of these studies extend to over 100 years of yearly human sex ratio data for some countries. These studies suggest that the human sex ratio, both at birth and as a population matures, can vary significantly according to a large number of factors, such as paternal age, maternal age, plural birth, birth order, gestation weeks, race, parent's health history, and parent's psychological stress. Remarkably, the trends in human sex ratio are not consistent across countries at a given time, or over time for a given country. In economically developed countries, as well as developing countries, these scientific studies have found that the human sex ratio at birth has historically varied between 0.94 and 1.15 for natural reasons.

In a scientific paper published in 2008,<ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology/> James states that conventional assumptions have been:
*there are equal numbers of X and Y chromosomes in mammalian sperm
*X and Y stand equal chance of achieving conception
*therefore equal number of male and female zygotes are formed, and that
*therefore any variation of sex ratio at birth is due to sex selection between conception and birth.

James cautions that available scientific evidence stands against the above assumptions and conclusions. He reports that there is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 1.02 and 1.08. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons.

A 1999 scientific paper published by Jacobsen reported the sex ratio for 815,891 children born in Denmark between 1980–1993.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=R. Jacobsen |author2=H Moeller |author3=A Mouritsen |year= 1999|title= Natural variation in the human sex ratio|journal= Human Reproduction|volume= 14|issue= 12 |pages= 3120–3125|doi= 10.1093/humrep/14.12.3120|url= http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/12/3120.short|accessdate= August 2011 | pmid= 10601107}}</ref> They studied the birth records to identify the effects of multiple birth, birth order, age of parents and the sexes of preceding siblings on the proportion of males using contingency tables, [[chi-squared test|<math>\chi^2</math> tests]] and regression analysis. The secondary sex ratio decreased with increased number of children per plural birth and with paternal age, whereas no significant independent effect was observed for maternal age, birth order, or other natural factors.

A 2009 research paper published by Branum et al. reports the sex ratio derived from data in United States birth records over a 25-year period (1981–2006).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Amy Branum |author2=Jennifer Parker |author3=Kenneth Schoendorf |year= 2009|title= Trends in US sex ratio by pluraity, gestational age and race/ethinicity, see page 2941 - Figure 2|journal= Reproductive Epidemiology|volume= 24|issue= 11 |pages= 2936–2944|doi= 10.1093/humrep/dep255|url= http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/11/2936.full.pdf+html|accessdate= August 2011}}</ref> This paper reports that the sex ratio at birth for the white ethnic group in the United States was 1.04 when the gestational age was 33–36 weeks, but 1.15 for gestational ages of less than 28 weeks, 28–32 weeks, and 37 or more weeks. This study also found that the sex ratios at birth in the United States, between 1981–2006, were lower in both black and Hispanic ethnic groups when compared with white ethnic group.

The relationship between natural factors and human sex ratio at birth, and with aging, remains an active area of scientific research.

===Environmental factors===
;Effects of climate change
Various scientists have examined the question whether human birth sex ratios have historically been affected by environmental stressors such as climate change and global warming. Catalano et al. report that cold weather is an environmental stressor, and women subjected to colder weather abort frail male fetuses in greater proportion thereby lowering birth sex ratios. Cold weather stressors simultaneously extend male longevity thereby raise human sex ratio in its older age bracket.<ref name=Catalano/> Catalano team finds that a 1&nbsp;°C increase in annual temperature predicts one more male than expected for every 1,000 females born in a year.

Helle et al. have studied 138 years worth of human birth sex ratio data, from 1865 to 2003. They find an increased excess of male births during periods of the exogenous stress (World War II) and during warm years. In the warmest period over the 138 years, the birth sex ratio peaked at about 1.08 in northern Europe.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1226–1233|date=November 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01598.x|title=Evolutionary ecology of human birth sex ratio under the compound influence of climate change, famine, economic crises and wars}}</ref>

;Effects of gestation environment
Causes of stress during gestation, such as maternal malnutrition<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson R, Bergström S |title=Is maternal malnutrition associated with a low sex ratio at birth? |journal=Hum. Biol. |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=1101–6 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9825599 }}</ref> generally appear to increase fetal deaths particularly among males,<ref name=Catalano>{{cite journal |vauthors=Catalano R, Bruckner T, Smith KR |title=Ambient temperature predicts sex ratios and male longevity |journal=Proc.

Also, higher incidence of [[Hepatitis B]] virus in populations is believed to increase the male to female sex ratio, while some unexplained environmental health hazards are thought to have the opposite effect.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis DL, Gottlieb MB, Stampnitzky JR |title=Reduced ratio of male to female births in several industrial countries: a sentinel health indicator? |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=13 |pages=1018–23 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9533502 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9533502 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.13.1018}}</ref>

The effects of gestational environment on human sex ratio are complicated and unclear, with numerous conflicting reports. For example, Oster et al. examined a data set of 67,000 births in China, 15 percent of whom were Hepatitis B carriers. They found no effect on birth sex ratio from Hepatitis B presence in either the mothers or fathers.<ref name="revision">{{cite web | last=Oster | first=Emily |authorlink=Emily Oster | last2=Chen | first2=Gang | last3=Yu | first3=Xinsen | last4=Lin | first4=Wenyao | title=Hepatitis B Does Not Explain Male-Biased Sex Ratios in China | year=2008 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/hbvnotecon.pdf | accessdate=19 May 2009}}</ref>

;Effects of chemical pollution
A 2007 survey by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program noted abnormally low sex ratios <!-- in which direction? --> in Russian Arctic villages and [[Inuit]] villages in [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]], and attributed this imbalance to high levels of [[endocrine disruptor]]s in the blood of inhabitants, including [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] and [[DDT]]. These chemicals are believed to have accumulated in the tissues of fish and animals that make up the bulk of these populations' diets.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/gender/story/0,,2167005,00.html Man-made chemicals blamed as many more girls than boys are born in Arctic], The Guardian, 12 Sept. 2007.</ref> However, as noted in the [[#Social factors|Social factors]] section below, it is important to exclude alternative explanations, including social ones, when examining large human populations whose composition by ethnicity and race may be changing.

A 2008 report provides further evidence of effects of [[xenoestrogens|feminizing chemicals]] on male development in each class of [[vertebrate]] species as a worldwide phenomenon, possibly leading to a decline in the sex ratio in humans and a possible decline in [[sperm]] counts.<ref name=indepen/> Out of over 100,000 recently introduced chemicals, 99% are poorly regulated.<ref name=indepen>{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/its-official-men-really-are-the-weaker-sex-1055688.html | title=It's official: Men really are the weaker sex | work=[[The Independent]] | author=Geoffrey Lean  | date=07/12/2008}}</ref>

Other factors that could possibly affect the sex ratio include:
* Social status of the mother, known to be a factor in influencing the sex ratio of certain animals such as swine,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendl M, Zanella AJ, Broom DM, Whittemore CT |title=Maternal social status and birth sex ratio in domestic pigs: an analysis of mechanisms |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1361–70 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80051-4 }}</ref> but apparently not in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ellis L, Bonin S |title=Social status and the secondary sex ratio: new evidence on a lingering controversy |journal=Soc Biol |volume=49 |issue=1–2 |pages=35–43 |year=2002 |pmid=14652908 |doi=10.1080/19485565.2002.9989047}}</ref>

*[[Latitude]], with countries near the equator producing more females than near the poles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Navara KJ |title=Humans at tropical latitudes produce more females |journal=Biol.

Other scientific studies suggest that environmental effects on human sex ratio at birth are either limited or not properly understood. For example, a research paper published in 1999, by scientists from Finland’s National Public Health Institute, reports the effect of environmental chemicals and changes in sex ratio over 250 years in Finland.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=T Vartiainen |author2=L Kartovaara |author3=J Tuomisto |year= 1999|title= Environmental chemicals and changes in sex ratio: analysis over 250 years in finland|journal= Environmental Health Perspectives|volume= 107|issue= 10 |pages= 813–815|pmid= 10504147 |pmc= 1566625 | doi= 10.1289/ehp.99107813}}</ref> This scientific team evaluated whether Finnish long-term data are compatible with the hypothesis that the decrease in the ratio of male to female births in industrial countries is caused by environmental factors. They analyzed the sex ratio of births from the files of Statistics Finland and all live births in Finland from 1751 to 1997. They found an increase in the proportion of males from 1751 to 1920; this was followed by a decrease and interrupted by peaks in births of males during and after World War I and World War II. None of the natural factors such as paternal age, maternal age, age difference of parents, birth order could explain the time trends. The scientists found that the peak ratio of male proportion precedes the period of industrialization or the introduction of pesticides or hormonal drugs, rendering a causal association between environmental chemicals and human sex ratio at birth unlikely. Moreover, these scientists claim that the trends they found in Finland are similar to those observed in other countries with worse pollution and much greater pesticide use.

=== Social factors ===
[[Sex-selective abortion]] and [[infanticide]] are thought to significantly skew the naturally occurring ratio in some populations, such as China, where the introduction of ultrasound scans in the late 1980s has led to a birth sex ratio (males to females) of 1.181 (2010 official census data for China).<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-08/16/c_131052436.htm China's sex ratio declines for two straight years] Xinhua, China; Quote - "Li Bin, director of the National Population and Family Planning Commission, made the remarks at a press conference (...). China's sex ratio at birth was 118.08 males for every 100 females in 2010, according to census data, Li said."</ref> The 2011 India census reports India's sex ratio in 0-6 age bracket at 1.088.<ref>[http://www.census2011.co.in/p/glance.php India at Glance - Population Census 2011 - Final] Census of India, Government of India (2013)</ref> The 2011 birth sex ratios for China and India are significantly above the mean ratio recorded in the United States from 1940 through 2002 (1.051); however, their birth sex ratios are within the 0.98-1.14 range observed in the United States for significant ethnic groups over the same time period.<ref name=NCHS/>{{rp|10}} Along with Asian countries, a number of European, Middle East and Latin American countries have recently reported high birth sex ratios in the 1.06 to 1.14 range. High birth sex ratios, some claim, may be caused in part by social factors.

Reported sex ratios at birth, outside the typical range of 1.03 to 1.07, thus call for an explanation of some kind.

Another hypothesis has been inspired by the recent and persistent high birth sex ratios observed in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]—both predominantly Orthodox Christian societies—and [[Azerbaijan]], a predominantly Muslim society. Since their independence from Soviet Union, the birth sex ratio in these Caucasus countries has risen sharply to between 1.11 and 1.20, some of world's highest. France Mesle et al. consider the hypothesis that the high birth sex ratio may be because of the social trend of more than two children per family, and birth order possibly affects the sex ratio in this region of the world. They also consider the hypothesis that sons are preferred in these countries of the Caucasus, the spread of scans and there being a practice of sex-selective abortion; however, the scientists admit that they do not have definitive proof that sex-selective abortion is actually happening or that there are no natural reasons for the persistently high birth sex ratios.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Sharp Increase in Sex Ratio at Birth in the Caucasus. Why? How?|author1=France MESLÉ |author2=Jacques VALLIN |author3=Irina BADURASHVILI |year=2007|pages=73–89|isbn=2-910053-29-6|publisher=Committee for International Cooperation in National Research in Demography|url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Publications/pdf/BOOK_singapore.pdf#page=85}}</ref>

In all such research, it is important to consider plausible alternative explanations. For example, in some populations that have experienced declining sex ratios, researchers have suggested that ecological factors may be at work.

As an example of how the social composition of a human population may produce unusual changes in sex ratios, we can consider a study in several counties of California where declining sex ratios had been observed. Smith and Von Behren observe that: "In the raw data, the male birth proportion is indeed declining. However, during this period, there were also shifts in demographics that influence the sex ratio. Controlling for birth order, parents' age, and race/ethnicity, different trends emerged. White births (which account for over 80%) continued to show a statistically significant decline, while other racial groups showed non-statistically significant declines (Japanese, Native American, other), little or no change (black), or an increase (Chinese). Finally, when the white births were divided into Hispanic and non-Hispanic (possible since 1982), it was found that both white subgroups suggest an increase in male births."  They concluded "that the decline in male births in California is largely attributable to changes in demographics."<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith D, Von Behren J |title=Trends in the sex ratio of California births, 1960–1996 |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=1047–53 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16286492 |pmc=1732975 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036970 |url=http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16286492}}</ref>

====Early marriage and parents' age====
Several studies have examined human birth sex ratio data to determine if there is a natural relationship between the age of mother or father to the birth sex ratio. For example, Ruder has studied 1.67 million births in 33 states in the United States to discern effect of parent's age and birth sex ratios.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Paternal-Age and Birth-Order Effect on the Human Secondary Sex Ratio|author=Avima Ruder|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=37|pages=362–372|year=1985|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1684568/pdf/ajhg00157-0130.pdf|pmc=1684568|pmid=3985011|issue=2}}</ref> Similarly, Jacobsen et al. have studied 0.82 million births in Denmark with the same goal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Natural Variation in the Human Sex Ratio|author=Jacobsen|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=14|issue=12|pages=3120–3125|year=1999|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/12/3120.full.pdf|doi=10.1093/humrep/14.12.3120|pmid=10601107|display-authors=etal}}</ref> These scientists find that maternal age has no statistically significant role on human birth sex ratio. However, they report a significant effect of paternal age. Significantly more male babies were born per 1000 female babies to younger fathers than to older fathers. These studies suggest that social factors such as [[Child marriage|early marriage]] and quickly fertile couples may play a role in raising birth sex ratios in certain societies.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Studies in The Human Sex Ratio 5.

====Data sources and data quality issues====
Reported sex ratios at birth for some human populations may be influenced not only by cultural preferences and social practices that favor the birth or survival of one sex over the other but also by incomplete or inaccurate reporting or recording of the births or the survival of infants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Even what constitutes a [[live birth (human)|live birth]] or [[infant mortality|infant death]] may vary from one population to another. For example, for most of the 20th century in Russia (and the [[Soviet Union]]), extremely premature newborns (less than 28 weeks gestational age, or less than 1000&nbsp;grams in weight, or less than 35 centimeters in length) were not counted as a live birth until they had survived 7 days; and if that infant died in those first 168 hours it would not be counted as an infant death. This led to serious underreporting of the [[Infant mortality rate]] (by 22% to 25%) relative to standards recommended by the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Barbara A. |first2=Brian D. |last2=Silver |title=Infant Mortality in the Soviet Union: Regional Differences and Measurement Issues |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=705–37 |year=1986 |doi=10.2307/1973432 |jstor=1973432}}</ref>

When unusual sex ratios at birth (or any other age) are observed, it is important to consider misreporting, misrecording, or underregistration of births or deaths as possible reasons. Some researchers have in part attributed the high male to female sex ratios reported in [[mainland China]] in the last 25 years to the underreporting of the births of female children after the implementation of the [[one-child policy]], though alternative explanations are now generally more widely accepted, including above all the use of ultrasound technology and [[sex-selective abortion]] of female fetuses and, probably to a more limited degree, neglect or in some cases [[infanticide]] of females. In the case of China, because of deficiencies in the [[vital signs|vital statistics]] registration system, studies of sex ratios at birth have relied either on special fertility surveys, whose accuracy depends on full reporting of births and survival of both male and female infants, or on the national [[population census]] from which both birth rates and death rates are calculated from the household's reporting of births and deaths in the 18 months preceding the census.<ref>For example, the number of births reported to family planning and other administrative agencies has been significantly lower than the number determined in population surveys and the census. See Guangyu Zhang, "Very Low Fertility in China in the 1990s: Reality or An Illusion Arising from Birth Underreporting?," Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America, April 2004.</ref> To the extent that this underreporting of births or deaths is sex-selective, both fertility surveys and censuses may inaccurately reflect the actual sex ratios at birth.<ref>For studies reveal underreporting or delayed reporting of female births in China, see {{cite journal |vauthors=Merli MG, Raftery AE |title=Are births underreported in rural China?

===Economic factors===
Catalano has examined the hypothesis that population stress induced by a declining economy reduces the human sex ratio. He compared the sex ratio in East and West Germany for the years 1946 to 1999, with genetically similar populations. The population stressors theory predicts that the East German sex ratio should have been lower in 1991, when East Germany's economy collapsed, than expected from its previous years. Furthermore, the theory suggests that East German birth sex ratios should generally be lower than the observed sex ratio in West Germany for the same years, over time. According to Catalano's study, the birth sex ratio data from East Germany and West Germany over 45 years supports the hypothesis. The sex ratio in East Germany was also at its lowest in 1991. According to Catalano study, assuming women in East Germany did not opt to abort male more than female, the best hypothesis is that a collapsing economy lowers the human birth sex ratio, while a booming economy raises the birth sex ratio. Catalano notes that these trends may be related to the observed trend of elevated incidences of very low birth weight from maternal stress, during certain macroeconomic circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sex ratios in the two Germanies: a test of the economic stress hypothesis|author=Ralph Catalano|journal=Human Reproduction| volume=18|issue=9|pages=1972–1975|year=2003|doi=10.1093/humrep/deg370|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/9/1972.full.pdf}}</ref>

===Other gestational factors===
A research group led by Ein-Mor reported that sex ratio does not seem to change significantly with either maternal or paternal age. Neither [[gravidity]] nor [[parity (medicine)|parity]] seem to affect the male-to-female ratio.<ref name=Ein-Mor/> However, there is a significant association of sex ratio with the length of gestation.<ref name=Ein-Mor>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ein-Mor E, Mankuta D, Hochner-Celnikier D, Hurwitz A, Haimov-Kochman R |title=Sex ratio is remarkably constant |journal=Fertil.

For example, James suggested<ref name=James-FertilSterilJournal>{{cite journal |author=James W.H.|title=The Inconstancy of Human Sex Ratios at Birth |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=94 |issue=3 | doi =10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.05.044 |date=May 2010 |url=http://fertstert.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/the-inconstancy-of-human-sex-ratios-at%C2%A0birth/ |pages=e53}}</ref> that Ein-Mor results are based on some demographic variables and a small data set, a broader study of variables and larger population set suggests human sex ratio shows substantial variation for various reasons and different trend effects of length of gestation than those reported by Ein-Mor. In another study, James has offered the hypothesis that human sex ratios, and mammalian sex ratios in general, are causally related to the hormone levels of both parents at the time of conception.<ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology>{{cite journal|author=James W.H.|title=Hypothesis:Evidence that Mammalian Sex Ratios at birth are partially controlled by parental hormonal levels around the time of conception|journal=Journal of Endocrinology|volume=198|pages=3–15|date=July 2008|doi= 10.1677/JOE-07-0446|url=http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/198/1/3.full.pdf+html|issue=1|pmid=18577567}}</ref> This hypothesis is yet to be tested and proven true or false over large population sets.

== Gender imbalance ==
[[File:Pyramide Bahrein.PNG|thumb|220px|Gender imbalance in [[Bahrain]] caused by policies that restrict female spouses and children of immigrant workers]]

'''Gender imbalance''' is a disparity between male and females in a population. As stated above, males usually exceed females at birth but subsequently experience different mortality rates due to many possible causes such as differential natural death rates, war casualties, and deliberate gender control.

According to Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, two Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters for the New York Times, violence against women is causing gender imbalances in many developing countries.<ref name="Kristof">Kristof, Nicholas and Sheryl WuDunn. ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunities for Women Worldwide.'' Knopf, 2009. ISBN 978-0-307-26714-6</ref> They detail sex-selective [[infanticide]] in the developing world, particularly in China, India and Pakistan.<ref name="Kristof"/>

Commonly, countries with gender imbalances have three characteristics in common. The first is a rapid decline in fertility, either because of preference for smaller families or to comply with their nation's population control measures. Second, there is pressure for women to give birth to sons, often because of cultural preferences for male heirs. Third, families have widespread access to technology to selectively abort female fetuses.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Single Man|work=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-gao-po-bachelor-women-marriage-economy|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting}}</ref>

As a contributing measure to gender imbalance in developing countries, Kristof and WuDunn's<ref name=Kristof/> best estimate is that a girl in India, from 1 to 5 years of age, dies from discrimination every four minutes (132,000 deaths per year); that 39,000 girls in China die annually, within the first year of life, because parents didn’t give girls the same medical care and attention that boys received. The authors describe similar gender discrimination and gendercide in Congo, Kenya, Pakistan, Iraq, Bahrain, Thailand and many other developing countries.

Some of the factors suggested as causes of the gender imbalance are [[war]]fare (excess of females, notably in the wake of [[World War I casualties|WWI]] in western Europe, and [[World War II casualties|WWII]], particularly in [[Demographics of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]]); [[Sex-selective abortion|sex-selective abortion and infanticide]] (excess of males, notably in [[Demographics of China|China]] as a result of the [[one-child policy]], or in [[Demographics of India|India]]); and large-scale migration, such as that by male labourers unable to bring their families with them (as in [[Qatar]] and other Gulf countries<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://qz.com/335183/heres-why-men-on-earth-outnumber-women-by-60-million/|title = A story of drinkers, genocide and unborn girls|last = Bauer|first = David|date = Jan 2015|work = |access-date = 5/2/2015|via = |publisher = Quartz}}</ref>). Gender imbalance may result in the threat of social unrest, especially in the case of an excess of low-status young males unable to find spouses,<ref>''Bare Branches: The Security Implications of Asia's Surplus Male Population'', [[Valerie M. Hudson]] and Andrea M. den Boer (2004)</ref> and being recruited into the service of militaristic political factions. [[Economic]] factors such as male-majority industries and activities like the [[petrochemical]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[military]], and [[technology]] also have created a male gender imbalance in some areas dependent on one of these industries. Conversely, the [[entertainment]], [[banking]], [[tourism]], [[fashion]], and [[Customer service|service]] industries may have resulted in a female-majority gender imbalance in some areas dependent on them.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/03/30/a_singles_map_of_the_united_states_of_america/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A singles map of the United States of America | first=Richard | last=Florida | date=March 30, 2008}}</ref>

One study<ref>{{Cite journal |first1=Michael |last1=Kvasnicka |first2=Dirk |last2=Bethmann |title=World War II, Missing Men, and out-of-wedlock childbearing |id=07-30 |publisher=The Institute of Economic Research, Korea University |date=2007-10-01 |url=http://econ.korea.ac.kr/~ri/WorkingPapers/W0730.pdf}}</ref> found that the male-to-female sex ratio in the German state of Bavaria fell as low as 0.60 after the end of [[World War II]] for the most severely affected age cohort (those between 21 and 23 years old in 1946). This same study found that out-of-wedlock births spiked from approximately 10–15% during the inter-war years up to 22% at the end of the war. This increase in out-of-wedlock births was attributed to a change in the marriage market caused by the decline in the sex ratio.

[[File:Pyramide Estonie.PNG|thumb|220px|left|Gender imbalance in [[Estonia]]]]The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] have the highest female ratio with 0.77 males per female. [[Qatar]] has the highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/female. For the group aged below 15, [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest female ratio with 0.96 males/female, and the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] are tied for the highest male ratio with 1.13 males/female (according to the 2006 [[CIA World Factbook]]).

The value for the entire [[world population]] is 1.01 males/female, with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.<ref name="CIA Fact Book"/>

The "[[First World]]" [[G7]] members all have a gender ratio in the range of 0.95–0.98 for the total population, of 1.05–1.07 at birth, of 1.05–1.06 for the group below 15, of 1.00–1.04 for the group aged 15–64, and of 0.70–0.75 for those over 65.

Countries on the [[Arabian peninsula]] tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 (Saudi Arabia 1.13, Arab Emirates 2.73, Qatar 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male [[guest workers]]. Conversely, countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (the [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]]) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, [[Armenia]] has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by [[human migration|emigration]] and higher male mortality as result of higher Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states. Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.

Sex ratio imbalances have many consequences. High ratios of males make it easier for women to marry, but harder for men.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Henry Louis | year = 1975 | title = Schema d'Evolution des Marriages apres de Grandes Variations des Naissances | url = | journal = Population | volume = 30 | issue = 759| page = 779 }}</ref> Analyses of how sex ratio imbalances affect personal consumption and intra-household distribution were pioneered by [[Gary Becker]], [[Shoshana Grossbard-Shechtman]],<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Heer David M. |author2=Grossbard-Shechtman Amyra | year = 1981 | title = The Impact of the Female Marriage Squeeze and the Contraceptive Revolution on Sex Roles and the Women's Liberation Movement in the United States, 1960 to 1975 | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 49–65 | doi=10.2307/351416}}</ref><ref>Shoshana Grossbard-Shechtman, On the Economics of Marriage - A Theory of Marriage, Labor and Divorce.
