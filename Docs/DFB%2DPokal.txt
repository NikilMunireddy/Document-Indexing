The '''DFB-Pokal''' {{IPA-de|ˈdeː ʔɛf beː poˈkaːl|}} (until 1952 '''Tschammer-Pokal''' {{IPA-de|tʃaːmɐ poˈkaːl|}}) or ''German Cup'' is a German knockout [[Association football|football]] cup competition held annually. Sixty-four teams participate in the competition, including all clubs from the [[Bundesliga]] and the [[2. Bundesliga]]. It is considered the second-most important club title in German football after the [[Bundesliga]] championship. The DFB-Pokal is run by the [[Deutscher Fußball-Bund]] (English: German Football Association). The competition runs from August until June. The winner qualifies for the [[DFL-Supercup]] and the [[UEFA Europa League]] unless the winner already qualifies for the [[UEFA Champions League]] in the Bundesliga.

The competition was founded in 1935, then called ''[[Hans von Tschammer und Osten|Tschammer]]-Pokal''. The first titleholder were [[1. FC Nuremberg]]. In 1937 [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] were the first team to win [[Double (association football)|the double]]. The Tschammer-Pokal was suspended in 1944 due to [[World War II]] and disbanded following the demise of [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1952–53, the cup was reinstated as the ''DFB-Pokal'', named after the Deutscher Fußball-Bund and was won by [[Rot-Weiss Essen]]. 

[[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] have won the most titles, with 18 wins while being the most recent winner as well. [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]] hold the record for most consecutive tournament game wins (18) between 1978 and 1981, taking the cup in 1979 and 1980.

==Format==

The competition format has varied considerably since the inception of the ''Tschammer-Pokal'' in 1935.

===Participation===
The DFB-Pokal begins with a round of 64 teams. The 36 teams of the [[Bundesliga]] and [[2. Bundesliga]], along with the top four finishers of the [[3. Liga]] are automatically qualified for the tournament. Of the remaining slots 21 are given to the cup winners of the regional football associations, the ''[[Verbandspokal]]e''. The three remaining slots are given to the three regional associations with the most men's teams. They may assign the slot as they see fit but usually give it to the runner up in the association cup. As every team is entitled to participate in local tournaments which qualify for the association cups every team can in principle compete in the DFB-Pokal. Reserve teams like [[Borussia Dortmund II]] are not permitted to enter.<ref name=rules>{{cite web | title = DFB Cup Men – Mode | publisher = DFB | year = 2008 | accessdate = 9 October 2008 | url = http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=460546}}</ref>

===Seeding===
The pairings for the DFB Cup are not entirely random as the teams are split into two pots of 32 teams each. One pot contains all the amateur teams including teams from the [[3. Liga]] and the teams just being promoted to the [[2. Bundesliga]]. The other pot contains the teams from the Bundesliga and the teams of the 2. Bundesliga who have not just been promoted. Therefore, in the first round of the cup each professional team plays an amateur team. Since [[1982–83 DFB-Pokal|1982]], the amateur generally plays at home when facing a professional team.

For the second round the teams are again divided into two pots according to the same principles. This time the pots don't have to be of equal size though, depending on the results of the first round. Amateur teams get paired with professional teams until one pot is empty. The remaining teams are then drawn from the nonempty pot with the team first drawn playing at home.

For the remaining rounds other than the final the teams are drawn from one pot. Since [[1984–85 DFB-Pokal|1985]] the final has been held in the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Berlin]] every year.<ref name=rules />

===Match rules===
Extra time will be played if the scores are level after 90 minutes with a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] following if needed.<ref name=rules />

==History==
Historically the number of participants in the main tournament has varied between four from [[1955–56 DFB-Pokal|1956]] until [[1959–60 DFB-Pokal|1960]] and 128 from [[1973–74 DFB-Pokal|1973]] through [[1981–82 DFB-Pokal|1982]] resulting in tournaments of two to seven rounds. Since the inception of the [[Bundesliga]] in 1963 all clubs from the Bundesliga are automatically qualified for the DFB-Pokal as are all clubs from the 2. Bundesliga since its inception in [[1974–75 2. Bundesliga|1974]]. Reserve sides for most of the time were allowed to participate in the DFB-Pokal but have been excluded since [[2008–09 DFB-Pokal|2008]].

The final has been held at the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Berlin]] every season since [[1984–85 DFB-Pokal|1985]]. Before 1985, the host of the final was determined on short notice. In the decision, the [[German Football Association]] took into consideration the ease with which supporters of both finalists could reach the site.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Originally the cup games were held over two 45 minute halves with two 15 minute overtime periods in case of a draw. If the score was still level after 120 minutes the game was replayed with the home field right reversed. In the 1939 ''Tschammer-Pokal'' the semi-final between [[SV Waldhof Mannheim]] and [[Wacker Wien]] was played to a draw three times before the game was decided by lot. The [[German Football Association]] decided to hold a penalty shootout if the replay was another draw after a similar situation arose in the [[1969–70 DFB-Pokal|1970 cup]], when the match between [[Alemannia Aachen]] and [[SV Werder Bremen]] had to be decided by lot after two draws.

In [[1971–72 DFB-Pokal|1971–72]] and [[1972–73 DFB-Pokal|1972–73]] the matches were held over two legs. The second leg was extended by two additional 15 minute overtime periods if the aggregate was a draw after both legs. In case the extension brought no decision a penalty shootout was held.

In [[1976–77 DFB-Pokal|1977]] the final [[1. FC Köln]] vs. [[Hertha BSC]] had to be replayed. This led to great logistic difficulties. In the aftermath the DFB decided not to replay cup finals in the future; instead holding a penalty shootout after extra time. Eventually this change was extended to all cup games in [[1991–92 DFB-Pokal|1991]].

===International qualification===
Since 1960, the winner of the DFB-Pokal qualified for the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. If the cup winner had already qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|European Club Champions Cup]], the losing finalist moved into the Cup Winners' Cup instead. Following the abolition of the Cup Winners' Cup in 1999, the winner of the DFB-Pokal qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], known as the [[Europa League]] since 2009. If the DFB-Pokal winner or both finalists qualify through the Bundesliga for European cup competitions, the best placed team of the Bundesliga not already qualified for at least the Europa League gets the spot.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = dfb.de | url = http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=3110 | title = Internationale Vereinswettbewerbe: Qualifikation zum Europa-Cup | language = German | trans_title = International Club Competitions: Qualification for the Europa Cup  | accessdate= 8 August 2015}}</ref>

===Tschammerpokal===
The first German cup was held in 1935. It was then called ''von Tschammer und Osten Pokal'', or ''Tschammerpokal'' for short, named after ''Reichssportführer'' (Sports Chief of the Reich) [[Hans von Tschammer und Osten]]. The first final was contested between the two most successful clubs of that era, the [[1. FC Nuremberg]] and [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], with Nuremberg winning 2 – 0.<ref>{{cite web | title = Wie alles begann... | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = 8 September 2006 | accessdate = 10 October 2008 | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/news/dfb/wie-es-begann%E2%80%A6-2006-09-08/ | language = German | trans_title = How it all began...}}</ref> After the last ''Tschammerpokal'' was held in 1943 the cup was not held for almost 10 years, being re-introduced by the [[German Football Association]] in [[1952–53 DFB-Pokal|1952]] under its current name ''DFB-Pokal''. In [[1964–65 DFB-Pokal|1965]], the original trophy, ''Goldfasanen-Pokal'', was substituted by the trophy which is still awarded today, because the original reminded DFB President [[Peco Bauwens]] of the Nazi era.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Trophy | publisher = DFB | accessdate = 10 October 2008 | url = http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=460545}}</ref>

===Giant killing===
Originally, the DFB-Pokal was a competition open to clubs from the top divisions of German football only. This continued after the establishment of the Bundesliga in 1963. Semi-professional and amateur clubs could only enter the competition from 1974 onwards, when it was enlarged. Up until 2008, only the top two divisions of German football, the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, were fully professional but from 2008, with the establishment of the 3. Liga, the third tier also became fully professional.

From the start, the new match ups between Bundesliga and amateurs (most usually third division clubs) became a source of surprises. Often titled the "mother of all cup sensations" ({{lang-de|Die Mutter aller Pokalsensationen}}),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/news/2010/index.php?f=0000160183.php | title = Das ewige Duell: David gegen Goliath | language = German | publisher = Bundesliga | trans_title = The eternal duel: David versus Goliath | date = 28 July 2011 | accessdate = 22 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdr.de/tv/sport_inside/sendungsbeitraege/2010/1213/pokal_manuskript.jsp |title=Eine Chance für alle |language=German |publisher=[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] |trans_title=A chance for all |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20101219061249/http://www.wdr.de:80/tv/sport_inside/sendungsbeitraege/2010/1213/pokal_manuskript.jsp |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}</ref> was [[Hamburger SV]]'s second round loss to VfB Eppingen in 1974, the first instance of an amateur side knocking out a Bundesliga club. It took until 1990 for a fourth division side to achieve the same, when [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth|SpVgg Fürth]] took [[Borussia Dortmund]] out of the competition. Further milestones were the reserve side of [[Hertha BSC]], [[Hertha BSC II]], reaching the cup final in 1993, a first for a third division club and a reserve team. In 1997 [[Eintracht Trier]] proved too strong for both the UEFA Cup and Champions League winners, knocking [[FC Schalke 04]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]] out of the competition. In 2000, the [[1. FC Magdeburg]] became the first fourth division side to eliminate two Bundesliga clubs in one season.<ref name="Greatest">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportal.de/sportal/generated/article/fussball/2009/03/03/12218600000.html |title=Die zehn größten Pokalsensationen |trans_title=The ten greatest cup sensations |language=German |publisher=sportal.de |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090608041049/http://www.sportal.de:80/sportal/generated/article/fussball/2009/03/03/12218600000.html |archivedate=8 June 2009 }}</ref> Hannover 96, a team playing in the 2. Bundesliga, became cup winners after eliminating several Bundesliga teams in the process.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Kickers Offenbach won all matches including the semi final as a 2. Bundesliga team but was promoted to the Bundesliga a week before they won the cup final.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Surprise results in the cup attract a strong media coverage in Germany and, at times, abroad. When [[TSV Vestenbergsgreuth]] took out [[FC Bayern Munich]] in 1994, who were coached by [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] at the time, ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' reported on its front page "Club di dilettanti elimina Trapattoni" (Amateur club eliminate Trapattoni).<ref name="Greatest" />

==Records==
Having won 18 titles, [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] has been the most successful team in the cup since they won their fourth title in [[1968–69 DFB-Pokal|1969]]. [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]] established a record for consecutive German Cup match victories (18 straight victories between 1978 and 1981, taking the trophy in 1979 and 1980). [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] holds the record for the biggest win in a DFB-Pokal final. They won 5–0 against [[1. FC Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]] in 1972 and 5–0 against [[MSV Duisburg|Duisburg]] in 2011.
