The '''2014–15 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|98th]] season of operation (97th season of play) of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

The [[Los Angeles Kings]] became the first team to miss the playoffs after winning the [[Stanley Cup]] the previous season since the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in [[2006–07 NHL season|2006&ndash;07]].<ref name=kings-miss-playoffs>{{cite web|title=Flames qualify for playoffs, eliminate Kings|url=http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/recap?id=2014021211 |publisher=''NHL'' |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}</ref> The Boston Bruins also became the third defending [[Presidents' Trophy]] winner to miss the playoffs (and the first since the [[Buffalo Sabres]] missed the playoffs in [[2007–08 NHL season|2007&ndash;08]] after winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2007).

The [[Ottawa Senators]] also became the first team in NHL history to make the post season after trailing for the final playoff spot by 14 points.

==League business==

===Canadian television rights ===
The 2014–15 season brought a significant realignment for NHL broadcast rights in Canada, as it marked the first year of [[Rogers Communications]]' 12-year, [[Canadian dollar|$]]5.2 billion contract for exclusive national television and digital media rights to the league. The networks of [[NHL on Sportsnet|Sportsnet]] (including the [[Sportsnet|Sportsnet regional channels]], [[Sportsnet One]], and [[Sportsnet 360]]) replaced [[The Sports Network|TSN]] as the English-language cable broadcasters of the league. National French-language rights were sub-licensed by Rogers to [[Quebecor Media]], with [[TVA Sports]] replacing [[Réseau des sports|RDS]] as the national French-language television broadcaster of the NHL in Canada.<ref name=snet-500games>{{cite web|title=500-plus NHL games to air under Rogers deal|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nearly-500-nhl-games-to-air-under-rogers-deal/|work=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=rogers-numbers>{{cite web|title=By The Numbers: Rogers and the NHL – 2014–15 Season|url=http://stream1.newswire.ca/media/2014/02/04/20140204_C7577_DOC_EN_36263.pdf|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=gandm-rogersnhl14/>

[[CBC Television]], the previous over-the-air television broadcaster of the NHL, continues to participate in coverage to an extent: Rogers reached a deal with CBC to license the ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' brand and maintain the network's traditional Saturday night games, along with post-season coverage and exclusive coverage of the Stanley Cup Final. ''HNIC'' began to air across CBC, [[City (TV network)|City]], the [[Sportsnet]] networks, and [[FX Canada]] (typically an all-U.S. game). As part of the arrangement, CBC did not pay a rights fee to either Rogers or the NHL, but all the telecasts are [[Brokered programming|brokered]] and produced by Sportsnet. CBC is allotted advertising time during the games to promote its own programming, but Rogers receives all ad revenue from the telecasts. City also introduced a new primetime game of the week on Sunday nights, known as ''Rogers Hometown Hockey'', which was hosted on-location from various cities by [[Ron MacLean]]. Similarly to TSN under the previous contract, Sportsnet also has a flagship, national Wednesday night game.<ref name=gandm-rogersnhl14>{{cite news|title=Rogers reaches 12-year broadcast deal with NHL worth $5.2-billion|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rogers-reaches-12-year-broadcast-deal-with-nhl-worth-52-billion/article15600412/|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=November 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/cbc-has-much-at-stake-in-next-nhl-television-rights-negotiation/article4601079/ | title=CBC has much at stake in next NHL television rights negotiation | publisher=The Globe and Mail | date=October 11, 2012 | location=Toronto}}</ref><ref name=gandm-hnicnewgame>{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=James|title=Rogers' Hockey Night in Canada will be a whole new game for viewers|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/canadians-prepare-for-more-game-coverage-storytelling-with-new-nhl-season/article20930976/?page=all|accessdate=October 12, 2014|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

With the loss of national cable rights, TSN's NHL coverage began consisting solely of regional coverage using its new [[TSN3]], [[TSN4]] and [[TSN5]] channels. The three channels broadcast regional [[Winnipeg Jets]], [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], and [[Ottawa Senators]] games respectively.<ref name=tsn-regionalNHL/> Regional rights to the Toronto Maple Leafs were split between TSN4 and Sportsnet Ontario beginning this season, with TSN4 airing 26 of these games—Bell and Rogers own a joint majority stake in the team's parent company [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]].<ref name=tsn-regionalNHL>{{cite web|title=Sens, Lets, and Leafs featured regionally on TSN's feeds|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=459687|website=TSN.ca|publisher=Bell Media|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name="fagstein-habs15">{{cite web|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2014/08/18/nhl-regional-schedule-2014-15/|title=NHL broadcast schedule 2014-15: Who owns rights to what games|first=Steve|last=Faguy|work=Fagstein.com|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}</ref> TSN5 began airing regional Senators games as part of a new 12-year deal between the team and TSN's parent company [[Bell Media]] (which also included French-language regional rights for RDS, and an extension of [[CFGO]]'s radio rights), replacing Sportsnet East.<ref name=tsn-regionalNHL/><ref name=tsn-newsenscontract>{{cite web|title=TSN, TSN Radio 1200 become Senators' broadcasters|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=442467|work=TSN.ca|publisher=[[Bell Media]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref><ref name=sun-tsnsens>{{cite web|title=Senators to sign major new TV deal with Bell, TSN|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/01/28/senators-to-sign-major-new-tv-deal-with-bell-tsn|work=Ottawa Sun|publisher=[[Sun Media]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref> The Senators were replaced on Sportsnet East by the [[Montreal Canadiens]] under a new three-year deal with Rogers.<ref name="fagstein-habs15"/><ref name=sn-habs2015>{{cite web|title=Canadiens, Sportsnet ink new regional deal|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/canadiens-sportsnet-ink-new-regional-deal/|website=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=[[Rogers Media]]|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref>

TVA Sports' national French-language coverage consisted of themed games on selected nights of the week; its flagship telecasts, ''La super soirée LNH'', primarily aired the Montreal Canadiens' Saturday night games, along with the [[NHL All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], [[Winter Classic]], and Stanley Cup playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvasports.ca/hockey/lnh/tva-sports-devoile-son-calendrier-5082014|title=TVA SPORTS DÉVOILE SON CALENDRIER|work=TVASports.ca|publisher=Groupe TVA|date=2014-08-05|accessdate=2014-09-20}}</ref><ref name=nhl-tvasports>{{cite web|title=NHL, TVA Sports launch French-language agreement|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=729553|website=NHL.com|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}</ref> RDS continued its long-standing relationship with the Montreal Canadiens for French-language television coverage under a new, 12-year regional contract.

===Agreement with GoPro===
Midway through the season, the league signed an agreement with [[GoPro]] to use the company's wearable cameras to record content for the league's television broadcasts and other video productions.<ref>[http://wivb.com/2015/01/24/nhl-players-to-wear-gopro-cameras-during-games/ NHL players to wear GoPro cameras during games].

===Changes to the Draft Lottery===
The NHL Board of Governors approved changes to the draft lottery format on June 24, 2014, starting with the 2015 Draft. Beginning in 2015, the odds of winning the first overall pick will be adjusted down for the first four lowest point-gaining teams, and adjusted up for the following ten. The change was made in order to "reflect the current state of competitive balance in the League." In 2016, the Draft Lottery will be used to choose the first three overall picks, rather than just the first.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=728795 | title=NHL Announces Changes to Draft Lottery Format |work=[[National Hockey League]] | date=August 20, 2014 | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref>

===Rule changes===
The following rule changes were voted upon by the NHL Board of Governors in June, and were approved by the Players' Association in September 2014.<ref name=nhlcom-changes>{{cite news|title=Analysis: Rules changes could create more scoring|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=730220|accessdate=September 17, 2014|work=NHL.com}}</ref><ref name=cp-changes>{{cite news|title=Fines for repeat diving offenders, coaches among NHL rule changes|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/fines-for-repeat-diving-offenders-coaches-among-nhl-rule-changes/article20563032/|accessdate=September 17, 2014|agency=The Canadian Press}}</ref>

*The trapezoidal areas behind each net in which goaltenders are allowed to play the puck are to be made {{convert|4|ft|m}} wider than their current width.
*The width of the hashmarks outside the faceoff circles will be extended from their current 3.5 feet to five feet, seven inches apart (international markings). 
*Prior to any overtime period, both teams will change ends and the ice will be dry-scraped by an ice resurfacer. The league hopes that the "long line changes" and the better ice surfaces will increase scoring in overtime, and thus decrease shootouts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=708853 | title=GMs considering minor changes to overtime | date=March 10, 2014 | accessdate=June 20, 2014}}</ref> 
*Coaches no longer have to submit a list of shootout participants as it begins. The coaches will be free as to who they will pick next. 
*Teams that ice the puck can only use one center to take the ensuing faceoff. If that player attempts to get kicked out of the faceoff to buy his team time, he'll get a two-minute delay-of-game penalty.
*The NHL's "situation room" will have more latitude to conduct video reviews of goals that don't fall under the guidelines of what can be reviewed but that clearly weren't scored legally.
*The wording "embellishment" will be changed to allow an escalating scale of fines to repeat-offense players and coaches.
*The "[[spin-o-rama]]" will no longer be allowed on penalty shots and during the shootout.

At the league's General Managers Meeting in November, it was decided to immediately end the dry-scrap prior to overtime, as it was felt that the average time of five minutes was too long and it seemed to have no significant difference. The GMs also voted to allow officials in the Situation Room to buzz the arena to have play immediately stopped for a video review without waiting for a whistle.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/nhl-scraps-the-dry-scrape--makes-goal-review-change-at-gm-meeting-222919047.html | title=NHL scraps the dry scrape, makes goal review change at GM meetings | date=November 13, 2014 | accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref>

===Uniforms===
*The [[Anaheim Ducks]] added a new away jersey to match the alternate "webbed D" as their new primary jerseys, replacing the old home/road jerseys that bore the “Anaheim Ducks” word mark on the crest.
*As part of the deal approved by the City of [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]] to keep the team from relocating, the Phoenix Coyotes changed their name to the [[Arizona Coyotes]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/glendale/articles/20130706phoenix-coyotes-fans-take-hit-wallet.html | title=Phoenix Coyotes fans to take hit in wallet | date=July 5, 2014 | accessdate=September 11, 2014}}</ref> There will also be a throwback alternate based on the Kachina-styled jerseys they wore from [[1996–97 NHL season|1996]] to [[2002–03 NHL season|2003]].<ref name=sbnation-azjersey>{{cite news|title=Phoenix Coyotes to wear throwback jerseys next season|url=http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2014/2/2/5370778/phoenix-coyotes-throwback-jerseys-new-uniforms|accessdate=September 21, 2014|work=SBNation}}</ref>
*The [[Chicago Blackhawks]] NHL Winter Classic uniform was inspired by the 1957–58 jersey worn by the Chicago Blackhawks. This uniform is nearly identical to the road uniform that the Blackhawks currently wear. The main differences between this design and the current road design comes in the form of the lace up collar, the name/number block font (which is serifed), and the C-Tomahawk logo, which is mostly red, black, and white (with a tad bit of yellow) instead of being mostly red, yellow, green black and white. 
*The [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] wore a special patch to commemorate hosting the [[60th National Hockey League All-Star Game]].
*The [[Los Angeles Kings]] wore alternate throwbacks based on their inaugural [[1967–68 NHL season|1967]] gold uniforms, instead of the purple ones they have been wearing since [[2010–11 NHL season|2011]]. The Kings' [[2015 NHL Stadium Series]] featured the top half of the jersey in silver, bottom half white, a black horizontal stripe runs through the middle of the jersey behind the team crest. On the collar are two crowns, one for each Stanley Cup "crown" the team has won throughout their franchise history. On the white pants is a large "LA" logo as seen on the jersey. The numbers on the back and sleeves were enlarged.
* On December 5, [[Montreal Canadiens]] added a number 4 patch to their jerseys on the upper-right corner in memory of their former captain, [[Jean Béliveau|Jean Beliveau]], who died on December 2 at the age of 83, for the remainder of the season. 
*The [[New York Islanders]] wore a special shoulder patch during their final season playing inside [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], and replaced their black third jerseys with the jerseys they wore in the 2014 NHL Stadium Series. The venue has served the franchise for 43 years.  
*The [[Philadelphia Flyers]] wore their [[2012 Winter Classic]] jersey as a full-time third jersey during the season.<ref>http://www.icethetics.co/blog/2014/9/20/flyers-adopt-2012-winter-classic-jersey-as-new-third</ref>
*The [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] wore a throwback alternate jersey, featuring the shade of gold the team wore on the uniforms from [[1980–81 NHL season|1980]] to [[2001–02 NHL season|2002]] (the color has been recently referred to as "Pittsburgh gold") instead of Vegas Gold, which the team has been wearing in its primary home and road uniforms since [[2002–03 NHL season|2002]]. The jersey was revealed via the club's Twitter page on September 19, and they resemble the black (road) jerseys the team wore during the two seasons it won its two first Stanley Cups, [[1990–91 NHL season|1991]] and [[1991–92 NHL season|1992]].<ref>https://twitter.com/penguins/status/512954036216033280</ref>
*The [[San Jose Sharks]]' Stadium Series uniform featured the top half in teal, bottom half in black, with a horizontal white stripe serperating the two. Centred on the white stripe is the San Jose Sharks logo. The entire back of the jersey is teal with large player numbers in white (extremely large on the sleeve). On the shoulder is a new logo paying homage to San Jose's Northern California fans, a star placed in the location of San Jose. The numbers on the back and sleeves have been enlarged.
*The [[St. Louis Blues]] had new home and away jerseys; the alternate remained along with the new set. The uniforms reflect a modernized version of the classic traditional look worn by the team from [[1997–98 NHL season|1997]] to [[2006–07 NHL season|2007]]. The uniform leaves the long-lasting, iconic Blue Note unchanged, symbolizing the club's pride and history. The team is not the first to move from a jersey design that was modernized by Reebok when the league started using the new Edge jersey template in the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], to a cleaner, more traditional look. The change removes the irregular curves on the cuff stripes and the apron string piping.
*The [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] replaced the alternate jersey they wore with the "BOLTS" script on the front from [[2008–09 NHL season|2008]] until [[2013–14 NHL season|2014]] with a new black alternate. The new third jersey is black and features the popular BOLTS logo from previous seasons across the front, with white trim and has blue and gray as secondary colors. The club also wore a black version of their signature lightning bolt pants and black gloves as part of their new third jersey system.<ref name="icethetics.co">http://www.icethetics.co/blog/2014/8/11/nhl-jerseywatch-2014-august-edition</ref>
*On November 26, the [[Vancouver Canucks]] added a patch decal "PQ" in memory of [[Pat Quinn (ice hockey)|Pat Quinn]] to their helmets for the remainder of the season. Quinn died on November 23 at the age of 71. 
*The [[Washington Capitals]] NHL Winter Classic uniform was vintage deep red to symbolize hockey's deep roots in Washington. The stripes on the shoulders, waist and legs bring in elements of Washington professional hockey jerseys from the 1930s, predating the Capitals' formation in the 1970s. A large “W” on the front of the jersey, offset in blue to contrast the white Capitals wordmark, offered a unique look never seen before on Capitals jerseys. A large “W” on the front of the jersey is offset in blue to contrast the white Capitals wordmark and features a silhouette of the Washington Monument. They also wore special patches to commemorate their 40th NHL season.
*For the [[60th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2015 NHL All-Star Game]], the two teams wore black/neon green jerseys, a far cry from any other jersey that has been used for the special game.<ref name="icethetics.co"/>

==Regular season==
The regular season began on October 8, 2014, and ended on April 11, 2015. Both the first Saturday (October 11) and the last day (April 11) of the regular season featured 15 games (all 30 teams).<ref name="2014-15_Schedule">{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=723369 | title=Winter Classic, rivalries highlight 2014-15 schedule | publisher=NHL.com | accessdate=June 22, 2014 | date=June 22, 2014}}</ref>
