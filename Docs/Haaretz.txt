'''''Haaretz''''' ({{lang-he|הארץ}}) (lit. "The Land [of Israel]", originally ''Ḥadashot Ha'aretz'' – {{lang-he|חדשות הארץ}}, {{IPA-he|χadaˈʃot haˈʔaʁets|IPA}} – "News [of] the Land [of Israel]"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressreference.com/Gu-Ku/Israel.html |title=Israel |publisher=Press Reference |accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref>) is [[Israel]]'s oldest [[daily newspaper]]. It was founded in 1918 and is now published in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and English in [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format. The English edition is published and sold together with the ''[[International New York Times]].'' Both Hebrew and English editions can be read on the Internet. In North America, it comes out as a [[weekly newspaper]], combining articles from the Friday edition with a roundup from the rest of the week. It is known for its strongly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[Liberalism in Israel|liberal]] stances on domestic and foreign issues.

==History and ownership==
''Haaretz'' was first published in 1918 as a newspaper sponsored by the British military government in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/bronfman/kesher29.heb.html#haaretz |title=TAU – Institute of Jewish Press and Communications – The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Center |publisher=[[Tel Aviv University]] |accessdate=10 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120925002822/http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/bronfman/kesher29.heb.html |archivedate=25 September 2012 }}</ref> In 1919, it was taken over by a group of [[Labor Zionism|socialist-oriented Zionists]], mainly from Russia.<ref name=fas>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/dni/osc/israelmedia.pdf |title=Israel — Hebrew- and English-Language Media Guide |publisher=[[Open Source Center]] |date=16 September 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="A fine and fragile balance">{{cite news |last=Marmari |first=Hanoch |url=http://www.haaretz.com/a-fine-and-fragile-balance-1.119759 |title=A fine and fragile balance |work=Haaretz |date=16 April 2004 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> The newspaper was established on 18 June 1919 by a group of businessmen including prominent philanthropist [[Isaac Leib Goldberg]], and initially, it was called ''Hadashot Ha'aretz'' ("News of the Land"). Later, the name was shortened to ''Haaretz''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08065.html |title=Israel Society and Culture: Haaretz |last1=Cohen |first1=Yoel |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |publisher=[[American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]] |accessdate=2015-01-12}}

The newspaper was initially published in [[Jerusalem]]. From 1919 to 1922, the paper was headed by a succession of editors, among them [[Leib Yaffe]]. It was shut down briefly due to a budgetary shortfall and reopened in Tel Aviv at the beginning of 1923 under the editorship of Moshe Glickson, who held the post for 15 years.<ref name="A fine and fragile balance"/> The Tel Aviv municipality granted the paper financial support by paying in advance for future advertisements.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/haaretz-history-1.265016 |title=Haaretz history |author=[[Tom Segev]] |newspaper=Haaretz |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>

[[Salman Schocken]], a wealthy German Jewish Zionist who owned a chain of department stores in Germany, bought the paper in 1937. His son, [[Gershom Schocken]], became the chief editor in 1939 and held that position until his death in 1990.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/a-newspaper-s-mission-1.314618 |title=A newspaper's mission |author=Amos Schocken |newspaper=Haaretz |date=18 September 2002 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>

Until August 2006, the Schocken family owned 100% of the Haaretz Group, but then the German publisher [[M. DuMont Schauberg]] acquired 25 percent of the shares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dumont.eu/dumont/dir/?101798 |title=M. DuMont Schauberg.

On 12 June 2011, it was announced that Russian-Israeli businessman [[Leonid Nevzlin]] had purchased a 20% stake in the Haaretz Group, buying 15% from the family and 5% from M.&nbsp;DuMont Schauberg. This means that the Schocken family now owns 60% and M.&nbsp;DuMont Schauberg and Leonid Nevzlin have 20% each.<ref>{{cite news |author=Li-or Averbach |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000653184 |title=Russian immigrant billionaire buys 20% of "Haaretz" |newspaper=[[Globes]] |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>

In October 2012, a union strike mobilized to protest planned layoffs by the ''Haaretz'' management. As a consequence, both the ''Haaretz'' newspaper and its ''TheMarker'' business supplement were not printed for one day. According to ''Israel Radio'', it was the first time since 1965 that a newspaper did not go to press on account of a strike.<ref>{{cite news|last=Koopmans |first=Ofira |title=Journalists at Israel's Haaretz newspaper strike over job cuts |url=http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/journalists-at-israels-haaretz-newspaper-strike-over-job-cuts_241385.html |accessdate=12 October 2012 |publisher=Europe Online |date=4 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130527082723/http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/journalists-at-israels-haaretz-newspaper-strike-over-job-cuts_241385.html |archivedate=27 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Haaretz' daily not printed today |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000787939 |newspaper=[[Globes]] |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>

==Management==
The newspaper's editorial policy was defined by [[Gershom Schocken]], who was editor-in-chief from 1939 to 1990. Schocken was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Hanoch Marmari. In 2004 [[David Landau (journalist)|David Landau]] replaced Marmari and was succeeded by [[Dov Alfon]] in 2008.<ref name=remnick/> The current editor-in-chief of the newspaper is [[Aluf Benn]], who replaced Alfon in August 2011.<ref name=benn-named /> Charlotte Halle became editor of the English Print Edition in February 2008.

==Editorial policy and viewpoints==
[[File:Newspapers.jpg|250px|thumb|Front page of the Hebrew and English editions]]
''Haaretz'' describes itself as having "a broadly liberal outlook both on domestic issues and on international affairs".<ref>{{cite news |work=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/about-haaretz-1.63277 |title=About Haaretz |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref> Others describe it alternatively as liberal<ref>

=== Formatting, circulation and reputation ===
Compared to other mass circulation [[List of newspapers in Israel|papers in Israel]], ''Haaretz'' uses smaller headlines and print. Less space is devoted to pictures, and more to political analysis. Opinion columns are generally written by regular commentators rather than guest writers.<ref name=fas/> Its editorial pages are considered influential among government leaders.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Beckerman |first=Gal |date=September–October 2005 |title=Disengaged |journal=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |url=http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2005/5/beckerman.asp |accessdate=21 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007125902/http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2005/5/beckerman.asp |archivedate=7 October 2007<!-- as of October 2014, cjr.org archive http://www.cjr.org/issues/ goes back to 2007 and it says "2006: We are converting older issues to the new site as quickly as possible."
