==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
The ''Daily Record'' was founded in 1895. The ''North British Daily Mail'' ceased publication in 1901 and was then incorporated into the ''Daily Record'', which was renamed the ''Daily Record and Mail''. [[Lord Kemsley]] bought the paper for £1&nbsp;million in 1922, forming a controlling company known as [[Associated Scottish Newspapers Limited]]. Production was transferred from Renfield Lane to 67 Hope Street in 1926. In 1971 the ''Daily Record'' became the first European newspaper to be printed with run-of-paper colour, and was the first British national to introduce computer page make-up technology. It was purchased by [[Trinity Mirror]] in 1999,<ref>Trinity Mirror website, History page, http://www.trinitymirror.com/our-company/history/</ref> from the estate of [[Robert Maxwell]].

Historical copies of the ''Daily Record'' from the years 1914 to 1918 are available to search and view in digitised form at The [[British Newspaper Archive]].<ref name=BNA>[http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results?newspaperTitle=Daily%20Record Digitised copies of the ''Daily Record'']</ref>

==''Daily Record PM''==
In August 2006, the paper launched afternoon editions in [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] entitled ''Record PM''.<ref>[http://www.trinitymirror.com/mdia/press/tm_objectid=17602786&method=full&siteid=111046&headline=daily-record-launches-pm-editions-name_page.html Daily Record launches PM editions]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}, [[Trinity Mirror]], 22 August 2006</ref> Both papers initially had a cover price of 15p, but in January 2007, it was announced that they would become [[Free daily newspaper|freesheets]], which are distributed on the streets of the city centres.<ref name = "PM drops cover price"/> It was simultaneously announced that new editions were to be released in [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]].<ref name = "PM drops cover price">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6234907.stm Daily Record PM drops cover price], [[BBC News]], 5 January 2007</ref> The ''PM'' is no longer published by the ''Daily Record''.

==Political involvement==
Politically, the ''Daily Record'' supported the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]] until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]], when it switched its allegiance to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The paper continues to support the Labour Party and has a close relationship with it, including donating £10,000 to the party in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/snp-steps-up-its-borrowing-despite-big-donations-1.843313 |title=SNP steps up its borrowing despite big donations |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate= }}</ref> It opposes both the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and [[Scottish independence]]. On the day of the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament election]], it ran a front-page editorial attacking the SNP.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/think-about-it-951097 |title=THINK ABOUT IT |work=Daily Record |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=3 May 2007|accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref> Since Murray Foote became editor in February 2014, the publication's stance has become less clear cut.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://theconversation.com/which-way-will-scotlands-tabloids-go-on-independence-24047 |title=Which way will Scotland’s tabloids go on independence? |work=[[The Conversation (website)]] |date=6 March 2014|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Headlines such as "Scottish lives considered cheap by UK defence bosses"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scottish-lives-considered-cheap-by-uk-1523923 |title=Scottish lives considered cheap by UK defence bosses |work=Daily Record |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=8 January 2014|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> regarding the UK's [[Trident nuclear deterrent]] are seen as pro-independence by some.

For many years there has been a close relationship between ''Daily Record'' journalists and Labour Party politicians in Scotland, and a revolving door between newspaper staff and Labour advisers. [[Helen Liddell, Baroness Liddell of Coatdyke|Helen Liddell]] went from being General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party to being [[Robert Maxwell]]’s Head of Corporate Affairs at the ''Daily Record'' (1988-1991). Tom Brown worked as one of the ''Daily Record''’s highest-profile columnists (1982-2003) and served as its political editor, before advising his friend, First Minister [[Henry McLeish]]. Paul Sinclair was political editor of the ''Daily Record'' (2000-2005), before becoming a special advisor to [[Douglas Alexander]], and then to [[Gordon Brown]]. He has been [[Johann Lamont]]'s special adviser and official spokesperson since 2011.<ref>Hassan, Gerry and Shaw, Eric, ''The Strange Death of Labour Scotland'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2012), p. 215.</ref> Labour peer, and former MP and MSP, [[Michael Goodall Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie|Lord Watson of Invergowrie]] has reflected that ‘the one paper no Labour MP or MSP can afford to ignore is the ''Daily Record'''.<ref>Watson, Mike, ''Year Zero: An Inside View of the Scottish Parliament'' (Polygon, 2001), p. 59.</ref>

The ''Daily Record'', {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} along with [[Brian Souter]], spearheaded the "''[[Keep the Clause campaign|Keep the Clause]]''" campaign which aimed to prevent the [[Scottish Parliament]] from repealing [[Section 28]]. This law prevented local authorities from promoting "the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship" in state schools. Section 28 was eventually repealed in Scotland in 2000 by 99 votes to 17 in the Scottish Parliament, and was repealed in England and Wales in 2003.
