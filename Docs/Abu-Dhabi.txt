Abu Dhabi lies on a T-shaped island jutting into the [[Persian Gulf]] from the central western coast. The city proper had a population of 1.5 million in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ahmad |first=Anwad |title=Ahbu Dhabi population doubles in eight years |date=4 November 2014 |accessdate=22 July 2015 |url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/abu-dhabi-population-doubles-in-eight-years}}</ref>

Abu Dhabi houses federal government offices, is the seat of the [[Federal National Council|United Arab Emirates Government]], home to the [[Al Nahyan family|Abu Dhabi Emiri Family]] and the President of the UAE, who is from this family. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and [[Urbanization|urbanisation]], coupled with the relatively high average income of its population, has transformed the city into a large and advanced metropolis. Today the city is the country's center of [[Politics|political]] and [[industry|industrial]] activities, and a major [[Culture|cultural]] and [[commerce|commercial]] centre, due to its position as the capital. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $400-billion [[United Arab Emirates]] economy.<ref>[http://gulfbusiness.com/2014/06/abu-dhabi-economy-grows-5-2-2013-slower-expected/#.VCKLLlAo7qA Gulfnews: Abu Dhabi Economy Grows 5.2% In 2013, Slower Than Expected]. www.gulfnews.com (3 June 2014).

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Abu Dhabi}}

Abu Dhabi is full of archeological evidence that points to civilizations, such as the [[Umm an-Nar Culture]], having been located there from the third millennium BCE. Settlements were also found farther outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi but closer to the modern city of [[Al Ain]]. There is evidence of civilizations around the mountain of Hafeet (Jebel Hafeet). This location is very strategic because it is the UAE’s second tallest mountain, so it would have great visibility. It also contains a lot of moisture in its springs and lakes, which means that there would have been more moisture thousands of years ago.<ref>{{cite book|last=Potts|first=Daniel|title=Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates|year=2003|publisher=Trident Press}}</ref>

;Origin of the name Abu Dhabi
The origin of the name "Abu Dhabi" is uncertain. Meaning "Father of the Gazelle", when literally translated from Arabic, it probably referred to the few gazelles that inhabit the emirate. According to Bilal al-Budoor, assistant under-secretary for Cultural Affairs at the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Community Development, "The area had a lot of dhibaa [deer (plural)], and was nicknamed after that." An old story tells about a man who used to chase deer [dhabi (deer - singular)] and was named the "father" of the animal. Abu Dhabi's original name was ''Milh'' "salt", possibly referring to the salty water of the Persian Gulf, or the ancient [[salt marsh]]es that surround the city. Some Bedouins called the city Umm Dhabi (mother of deer), while British records refer to the place as Abu Dhabi. According to some historical accounts, the name Abu Dhabi was first used more than 300 years ago. The first word of Abu Dhabi is pronounced "Bu" by inhabitants on the city's western coast. In the eastern part of the city, the pronunciation is "Abu".<ref name="name"/>

;Origins of the Al Nahyan family
The Bani Yas bedouin were originally centered on the [[Liwa Oasis]]. This tribe was the most significant in the area, having over 20 subsections. In 1793, the Al Bu Falah subsection migrated to the island of Abu Dhabi on the coast of the Persian Gulf due to the discovery of fresh water there. One family within this section was the [[Al Nahyan family]]. This family makes up the rulers of Abu Dhabi today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bani Yas|url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae|work=His Highness Sheikh Maktoum|accessdate=2011-04-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110430085200/http://sheikhmohammed.co.ae/| archivedate= 30 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

;Pearl trade
Abu Dhabi worked in the pearl business and traded with others. According to a source about pearling, the [[Persian Gulf]] was the best location for pearls. Pearl divers dove for one to one-and-a-half minutes, and would have dived up to thirty times per day. There were no oxygen tanks and any other sort of mechanical device was forbidden. The divers had a leather nose clip and leather coverings on their fingers and big toes to protect them while they searched for oysters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trench|first=Richard|title=Arab Gulf Cities|year=1995|publisher=Archive International Group|location=Oxford}}</ref> The divers were not paid for a day’s work but received a portion of the season’s earnings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pearl Diving|url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae|work=His Highness Sheikh Maktoum|accessdate=2011-04-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110430085200/http://sheikhmohammed.co.ae/| archivedate= 30 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

;Trucial coast
In the 19th century, as a result of treaties (known as "truces" which gave the coast its name) entered into between Great Britain and the sheikhs of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, Britain became the predominant influence in the area.<ref>[http://www.eceme.ensino.eb.br/cihm/Arquivos/PDF%20Files/99.pdf Trucial Gulf Sheikdoms and Great Britain]</ref> The main purpose of British interest was to protect the trade route to India from pirates, hence the earlier name for the area, the "Pirate Coast". After piracy was suppressed, other considerations came into play, such as a strategic need of the British to exclude other powers from the region. Following their withdrawal from India in 1947, the British maintained their influence in Abu Dhabi as interest in the oil potential of the Persian Gulf grew.

;First oil discoveries
In the 1930s, as the pearl trade declined, interest grew in the oil possibilities of the region. On 5 January 1936, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC), an associate company of the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], entered into a concession agreement with the ruler, [[Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan al Nahyan]], to explore for oil. This was followed by a seventy-five-year concession signed in January 1939. However, owing to the desert terrain, inland exploration was fraught with difficulties. In 1953, D'Arcy Exploration Company, the exploration arm of [[BP]], obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate the concession: Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA) was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]). In 1958, using a marine drilling platform, the ADMA Enterprise, oil was struck in the Umm Shaif field at a depth of about {{convert|8,755|ft|m}}. This was followed in 1959 by PDTC’s onshore discovery well at Murban No.3.<ref name="AB">Morton, Michael Quentin, "The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries", GEO Expro article, issue 3, 2011.[http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_Abu_Dhabi_Oil_Discoveries/a3b23f12.aspx GEO ExPro - The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries]</ref>

In 1962, the company discovered the Bu Hasa field and ADMA followed in 1965 with the discovery of the Zakum offshore field. Today, in addition to the oil fields mentioned, the main producing fields onshore are Asab, Sahil and Shah, and offshore are al-Bunduq, and Abu al-Bukhoosh.<ref name=AB/>

;Pictorial essay of old Abu Dhabi
In 1904, German explorer, [[Hermann Burchardt]], took many photographs of historical sites in Abu Dhabi, photos that are now held at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].<ref>See [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625077&bt=europeanaapi The old citadel (''Qaṣr'') of Abu Dhabi] (click on photo to enlarge); [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=626029&bt=europeanaapi Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the ''Majlis''] (click on photo to enlarge).</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the United Arab Emirates}}
[[File:Abu Dhabi SPOT 1034.jpg|thumb|Abu Dhabi seen from SPOT satellite.]]
The city of Abu Dhabi is on the northeastern part of the [[Persian Gulf]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It is on an island less than {{convert|250|m|-1}} from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and [[Mussafah]] Bridges. A third, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, designed by [[Zaha Hadid]], opened in late 2010. Abu Dhabi Island is also connected to [[Saadiyat Island]] by a five-lane motorway bridge. Al-Mafraq bridge connects the city to [[Al Reem Island|Reem Island]] and was completed in early 2011. This is a multilayer interchange bridge and it has 27 lanes which allow roughly 25,000 automobiles to move per hour. There are three major bridges of the project, the largest has eight lanes, four leaving Abu Dhabi city and four coming in.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abu Dhabi Municipality {{!}} Media Center |url=http://www.adm.gov.ae|work=Municipality of Abu Dhabi City|accessdate=2011-02-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110202175555/http://www.adm.gov.ae/| archivedate= 2 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Most of Abu Dhabi city is located on the island itself, but it has many suburbs on the mainland, for example: Khalifa City A, B, and C;<ref>http://www.iscadkc-sabis.net Khalifa City</ref> Al Raha Beach;<ref>[http://www.danathotels.com/Hotels-Resorts/Al-Raha-Beach-Hotel Al Raha Beach Resort]</ref> Al Bahia City A, B, and C; Al Shahama; Al Rahba; Between Two Bridges; Baniyas; Shamkha; AL Wathba and Mussafah Residential.

==Climate==
Abu Dhabi has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Sunny blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months of June through September are generally extremely hot and humid with maximum temperatures averaging above {{convert|38|°C|0|abbr=on}}. During this time, sandstorms occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility to a few meters.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sandstorms-sweep-across-region | title=Sandstorms sweep across region | first=Gregor | last=McClenaghan | date=13 February 2009 | newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] | location=Abu Dhabi, UAE }}</ref>

====Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque====
{{Main|Sheikh Zayed Mosque}}
[[File:Front of Sheikh Zayed Mosque.jpg|thumb|Front and entrance of the [[Sheikh Zayed Mosque]].]]

One of the most important architectural landmarks is the Sheikh Zayed Mosque. This is arguably one of the most important architectural treasures of contemporary UAE society—and one of the most opulent in the world. It was initiated by the late president of the United Arab Emirates, HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fondly thought of as the father of the UAE.<ref name="szgmc.ae">SZGMC www.szgmc.ae</ref>

Its design and construction reportedly 'unites the world', using artisans and materials from many countries including Italy, Germany, Morocco, Pakistan, India, Turkey, Iran, China, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Greece and of course the United Arab Emirates.<ref>http://www.szgmc.ae/en/theory-and-implementation</ref> More than 3,000 workers and 38 renowned contracting companies took part in the construction of the mosque. Natural materials were chosen for much of its design and construction due to their long-lasting qualities, including marble, stone, gold, semi-precious stones, crystals and ceramics. Construction began on 5 November 1996. The maximum capacity is approximately 41,000 people and the overall structure is 22,412 square metres, the internal prayer halls were initially opened in December 2007.<ref name="szgmc.ae"/>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the United Arab Emirates}}
[[File:The ADCB Bank at Electra Street, Abu Dhabi.JPG|thumb|The ADCB Bank Headquarters.]]
The UAE’s large hydrocarbon wealth gives it one of the highest GDP per capita in the world and Abu Dhabi owns the majority of these resources – 95% of the oil and 92%<ref>http://www.emirates247.com/eb247/economy/uae-economy/abu-dhabi-s-oil-reserves-to-last-another-150-years-2010-03-31-1.100837</ref> of gas. Abu Dhabi thus holds 9% of the world’s proven oil reserves (98.2bn barrels) and almost 5% of the world’s natural gas (5.8&nbsp;trillion cu metres). Oil production in the UAE was in the region of 2.3m barrels per day (bpd) in 2010,<ref>{{cite journal

|accessdate=2011-06-20 }}</ref>
and projects are in progress to boost production to 3m bpd. In recent years the focus has turned to gas as increasing domestic consumption for power, desalination and reinjection of gas into oil fields increases demand. Gas extraction is not without its difficulties, however, as demonstrated by the sour gas project at Shah where the gas is rich in hydrogen sulphide content and is expensive to develop and process.<ref name=AB/>

[[File:The Heritage Village in Abu Dhabi, UAE.JPG|thumb|The Heritage Village.]]
Recently{{when|date=February 2015}} the government has been diversifying their economic plans. Served by high oil prices, the country’s non-oil and gas GDP has outstripped that attributable to the energy sector. Non-oil and gas GDP now constitutes 64% of the UAE’s total GDP. This trend is reflected in Abu Dhabi with substantial new investment in industry, [[real estate]], tourism and retail. As Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer of the UAE, it has reaped the most benefits from this trend. It has taken on an active diversification and liberalisation programme to reduce the UAE’s reliance on the hydrocarbon sector. This is evident in the emphasis on industrial diversification with the completion of free zones, Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, [[twofour54]] Abu Dhabi media free zone and the construction of another, ICAD II, in the pipeline. There has also been a drive to promote the tourism and real estate sectors with the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority and the Tourism and Development Investment Company undertaking several large-scale development projects. These projects will be served by an improved transport infrastructure with a new port, an expanded airport and a proposed rail link between Abu Dhabi and Dubai all in the development stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/191913051.html |title=Abu Dhabi - Economic Base Diversifying |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-07}}</ref>

Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest emirate of the UAE in terms of [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) and [[per capita income]]. More than $1&nbsp;trillion is invested worldwide in this city alone. In 2010, the GDP [[per capita]] also reached $49,600, which ranks ninth in the world after [[Qatar]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Luxembourg]] and many others. [[Taxation in the United Arab Emirates|Taxation in Abu Dhabi]], as in the rest of the UAE, is nil for a resident and for a non-bank, non-oil company. Abu Dhabi is also planning many future projects sharing with the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (GCC) and taking 29% of all the GCC future plannings. The United Arab Emirates is a fast-growing economy: in 2006 the [[per capita income]] grew by 9%, providing a GDP per capita of $49,700 and ranking third in the world at [[purchasing power parity]]. Abu Dhabi's [[sovereign wealth fund]], the [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]] (ADIA), currently estimated at US$875&nbsp;billion, is the world's wealthiest sovereign fund in terms of total asset value.<ref name="adia">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10533428 Asset-backed insecurity].

Abu Dhabi's government is looking to expand revenue from oil and gas production to tourism and other sorts of things which would attract different types of people. This goal is seen in the amount of attention Abu Dhabi is giving to its International Airport. The airport, in 2009, experienced a 30%+ growth in passenger usage.<ref name="forbescustom">[http://forbescustom.com/EconomicDevelopmentPgs/AbuDhabiP1.html Abu Dhabi's Urban Development Plan].

Many Hollywood and other national film production teams have used the UAE as filming locations. Whilst neighbouring Dubai gets a lot of attention, in recent years Abu Dhabi has become a popular destination. The [[Etihad Towers]] and [[Emirates Palace Hotel]] were some of the city's landmarks used as filming locations for the movie Furious 7. In this movie, cars rush through the building and smash through the windows of the Etihad Towers.<ref>http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/20131112/abu-dhabi-is-buzzing-with-fast-furious-7-filming-rumours</ref>

State-owned [[Etisalat]] and private [[Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company|du]] communication companies provide telephone and cell phone service to the city. Cellular coverage is extensive, and both GSM and CDMA (from Etisalat and Du) services are available. [[Etisalat]], the government owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Abu Dhabi prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC — better known as [[Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company|Du]]) in 2006.

[[File:AbuDhabi06.JPG|thumb|Waterfront park in Abu Dhabi.]]
[[File:One of the sit out roofs in the Corniche, Abu Dhabi, UAE.JPG|thumb|upright|At the corniche during sunset.]]
The city was planned in the 1970s for an estimated maximum population of 600,000. In accordance with what was considered to be ideal urban planning at the time, the city has wide grid-pattern roads, and high-density tower blocks.<ref>[http://www.officeplusuae.com/company/contactus.php Mention of City Grid Patterns]</ref>
On the northerly end of the island, where the population density is highest, the main streets are lined with 20- to 30-storey towers. Inside this rectangle of towers is a normal grid pattern of roads with lower density buildings (2-story villas or 6-story low-rise buildings).

Abu Dhabi is a modern city with broad boulevards, tall office and apartment buildings, and busy shops. Principal thoroughfares are the Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa Street. Abu Dhabi is known in the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. The design of the inner city roads and main roads are quite organised. Starting from the Corniche, all horizontal streets are oddly numbered, while all vertical streets are evenly numbered. Thus, the Corniche is Street #1, Khalifa is Street #3, Hamdan is Street #5, Electra street is Street #7 and so on. Conversely, [[Salam Street]] is St #8.<ref>{{cite web |title=Google Map of Abu Dhabi |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=abu+dhabi&ie=UTF8&ll=24.48543,54.374685&spn=0.022264,0.047035&z=14&iwloc=addr&om=1&output=embed&s=AARTsJrE00-YUggvMJHd59dndcY7Dx3zCA |publisher=Google Maps}}</ref>

Mail is generally delivered to post-office boxes only; however, there is door-to-door delivery for commercial organizations.
There are many parks throughout the city. Entrance is usually free for children, however there is often an entrance fee for adults. The Corniche, the city's seaside promenade, is about {{convert|7|km|mi}} in length, with gardens, playgrounds, and a BMX/skateboard ring.<ref>[http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/what.to.see/attractions/abu.dhabi.corniche.aspx The Corniche]</ref>

In 2007 the [[Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council]] (UPC) was established, which is the agency responsible for the future of Abu Dhabi’s urban environments and the expert authority behind the visionary Plan Abu Dhabi 2030 Urban Structure Framework Plan that was published in September 2007.<ref>[http://www.upc.gov.ae/abu-dhabi-2030.aspx?lang=en-US Abu Dhabi UPC]</ref> The UPC is also working on similar plans for the regions of Al-Ain and Al-Gharbia.

Because of the rapid development of Abu Dhabi, a number of challenges to the city's urban organization have developed, among them:
* Today, the city's population far surpasses the original estimated maximum population when it was designed. This causes traffic congestion, a shortage of car parking spaces, and overcrowding.
* Although there is an addressing system for the city, it is not widely used, causing problems in describing building locations. Directions must often be given based on nearby landmarks.

This unique [[socioeconomic development]] in the Persian Gulf has meant that Abu Dhabi is generally more tolerant than its neighbours, including Saudi Arabia.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2005/51612.htm UAE Religious Freedom]</ref> Emiratis have been known for their tolerance; [[Christian]] churches, [[Hindu temple]]s, and [[Gurdwara|Sikh gurdwaras]] (but no synagogues) can be found alongside mosques. The cosmopolitan atmosphere is gradually growing and as a result, there are a variety of Asian and Western schools, cultural centers and themed restaurants.

Abu Dhabi is home to a number of cultural institutions including the [[Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation|Cultural Foundation]] and the National Theater. The Cultural Foundation, while closed for reconstruction as of spring 2011, is home to the [[UAE Public Library and Cultural Center]].<ref>[http://www.abudhabi.ae/egovPoolPortal_WAR/appmanager/ADeGP/Citizen?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=p10620&lang=en UAE Public Library]</ref> Various cultural societies such as the Abu Dhabi Classical Music Society have a strong and visible following in the city.

The diversity of [[cuisine]] in Abu Dhabi is a reflection of the cosmopolitan nature of the society. Arab food is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small [[shawarma]] to the upscale restaurants in the city's many hotels. Fast food and [[South Asian cuisine]] are also very popular and are widely available. The sale and consumption of pork, though not illegal, is regulated and it is sold only to non-[[Muslim]]s in designated areas.<ref name="pork">[http://www.stat-usa.gov/agworld.nsf/505c55d16b88351a852567010058449b/898e8206171d628385256d02006df0d7/$FILE/TC3003.PDF Food and Agricultural Import Regulations and Standards].

Poetry in Abu Dhabi and the UAE is highly regarded and often is centric around the themes of satire, religion, family, chivalry and love. According to an article from an Abu Dhabi tourism page, sheikhs, teachers, sailors and princes make a large bulk of the poets within the UAE. A unique form of poetry to the UAE was formed in the 8th century by Al Khalil bin Ahmed and it was written in 16 meters. The first known poet from the UAE, Ibn Majid, was born sometime between 1432 and 1437 in Ras Al Khaimah. According to the tourism page Majid came from a family of sailors and 40 of his works have survived. Another Emirati poet, [[Ibn Daher]] is from the 17th century. Daher is important because he used Nabati poetry (AKA Bedouin poetry), poetry written in the vernacular instead of the classical/religious Arabic. Other important poets from the UAE are Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880–1954), Salem bin Ali al Owais (1887–1959) and Abdulla bin Sulayem (1905–1976). These poets made headway in the field of Classical Arabic poetry as opposed to the Nabati poetry of the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=Literature and Poetry|url=http://www.visitabudhabi.ae|work=Welcome to Abu Dhabi|accessdate=2011-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207225805/http://www.visitabudhabi.ae/|archivedate=7 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

One of Ibn Masjid's most prominent works is a book called, Kitab al-Fawa'id fi Usul 'Ilm al-Bahr wa 'l-Qawa'id (Book of Useful Information on the Principles and Rules of Navigation), and it was written in 1490. This book is effectually an encyclopædia about navigation and sailing in and around the Indian Ocean. Masjid also goes into detail about the intricacies and technologies of the Arab sailing techniques. An excerpt from his book is:

{{Quote_box|width=55%|align=right|quote="We have 32 rhumbs, and tirfa, and zam, and the measurement of stellar altitudes, but they have not. They cannot understand the way we navigate, but we can understand the way they do; we can use their system and sail in their ships. For the Indian Ocean is connected to the All-Encompassing Ocean, and we possess scientific books that give stellar altitudes, but they do not have a knowledge of stellar altitudes; they have no science and no books, only the compass and dead reckoning… We can easily sail in their ships and upon their sea, so they have great respect for us and look up to us. They admit we have a better knowledge of the sea and navigation and the wisdom of the stars."|source=Ahmad Ibn Majid on European Navigation<ref name="hero">[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com The Navigator: Ahmad Ibn Majid], Saudi Aramco World, accessed 28 February 2011.  {{wayback|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com |date=20081011195137 |df=y }}</ref>}}

Today in Abu Dhabi there is a group called the Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation that works to preserve the art and culture of the city. According to an article from the English Pen Atlas Al jawaher wal la'li was the first manuscript to come out of the UAE. According to another article this book was written in the 1990s and was banned in the city for some time for making accusations about the ruling family.<ref>{{cite web|title=UAE|url=http://penatlas.org/online|work=English Pen World Atlas|accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>
