==History==
{{main|History of Hartford, Connecticut|Timeline of Hartford, Connecticut}}
[[File:OldHartfordMap.jpg|thumb|1877 map of Hartford]]

Various tribes, all part of the loose [[Algonquin people|Algonquin confederation]], lived in or around present-day Hartford. The area was referred to as ''Suckiaug''', meaning "Black Fertile River-Enhanced Earth, good for planting." These included the [[Podunk people|Podunks]], mostly east of the Connecticut River; the Poquonocks, north and west of Hartford; the Massacoes, in the [[Simsbury, Connecticut|Simsbury]] area; the [[Tunxis]] tribe, in [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]] and [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]]; the [[Wangunk]]s, to the south; and the [[Saukiog]] in Hartford itself.<ref>Bacon, Nick. 2013.

Xiangming Chen and Nick Bacon (eds). Lanham, MD: Lexington Books.</ref>

===Colonial Hartford===

The first Europeans known to have explored the area were the Dutch, under [[Adriaen Block]], who sailed up the Connecticut in 1614. Dutch fur traders from [[New Amsterdam]] returned in 1623 with a mission to establish a trading post and fortify the area for the [[Dutch West India Company]]. The original site was located on the south bank of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]] in the present-day Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood. This fort was called [[Fort Hoop]], or the “House of Hope.” In 1633, Jacob Van Curler formally bought the land around [[Fort Hoop]] from the [[Pequot]] chief for a small sum. It was home to perhaps a couple families and a few dozen soldiers. The area today is known as Dutch Point, and the name of the Dutch fort, "House of Hope," is reflected in the name of Huyshope Avenue.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sterner|first1=Daniel|title=A Guide to Historic Hartford, Connecticut|date=2012|publisher=The History Press|isbn=1609496353|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6QkVFi7l6UC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=sheldon+charter+oak+neighborhood&source=bl&ots=sU4DmlsAXy&sig=hm1PjW-uY-xR2aNE4o2gyeu6QBs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IW_vU4jHA8e98gHzl4G4DA&ved=0CBwQ6AEwADg8#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> The fort was abandoned by 1654, but its neighborhood in Hartford is still known as Dutch Point.<ref>{{cite web|title=House of Hope|url=http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope/|website=The New Netherland Institute|publisher=The New Netherland Institute|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> The Dutch outpost, and the tiny contingent of Dutch soldiers that were stationed there, did little to check the English migration. The Dutch soon realized they were vastly outnumbered. The House of Hope remained an outpost, but it was steadily swallowed up by waves of English settlers. In 1650, when [[Peter Stuyvesant]] met with English representatives to negotiate a "permanent" boundary between the Dutch and English colonies, the line they agreed on was more than {{convert|50|mi|km}} west of the original settlement.

The [[England|English]] began to arrive 1637, settling upstream from Fort Hoop near the present-day Downtown and Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite book

The settlement was originally called Newtown, but was changed to Hartford in 1637 to honor the English town of [[Hertford, England|Hertford]] the explorer also created the town of [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] (in 1633).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shuffelton|first1=Frank|title=Thomas Hooker, 1586–1647|date=1977|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691613277|pages=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZl9BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA212&lpg=PA212&dq=Suckiaug&source=bl&ots=UtEdd5Tx76&sig=wDO2oHC5zyaa7eA6HzUg5xrcGsk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KDohVbm2LsvVsAXW7oG4Cg&ved=0CE0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Suckiaug&f=false|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref>

The fledgling colony along the Connecticut River had issues with the authority by which it was to be governed because it was outside of the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's charter. Therefore, Hooker delivered a sermon that inspired the writing of the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]], a document (ratified January 14, 1639) investing ''the people'' with the authority to govern, rather than ceding such authority to a higher power. Historians suggest that Hooker's conception of self-rule embodied in the Fundamental Orders went on to inspire the [[Connecticut Constitution]], and ultimately the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Today, one of Connecticut's nicknames is the "Constitution State."<ref>{{cite web|last=Voigt|first=Steven|title=Lessons from Thomas Hooker about the frailty of humanity and the importance of a worldview|url=http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/voigt/050905|publisher=Renew America|accessdate=24 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031100147/www.renewamerica.us/columns/voigt/050905|archivedate=January 24, 2014}}</ref>

The original settlement area contained the site of The [[Charter Oak]]. The Charter Oak was an unusually old white oak tree in which, according to legend, colonists hid the [[Connecticut Constitutional History#The Connecticut Charter of 1662|Connecticut's Royal Charter of 1662]] to protect it from confiscation by an English governor-general. Thus the grand, stately tree came to symbolize the power of nature as a defender of freedom throughout Connecticut. In fact, the state adopted the image as the emblem of the Connecticut state quarter. The Charter Oak Monument is located at the corner of Charter Oak Place, a historic street, and Charter Oak Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Charter Oak Fell – Today in History: August 21|url=http://connecticuthistory.org/the-charter-oak-fell/|website=connecticuthistory.org|publisher=Connecticut Humanities|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref>

===19th century===
Throughout the 19th century, Hartford’s residential population, economic productivity, cultural influence, and concentration of political power continued to grow. The advance of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Hartford in the mid-1800s made this city by late century one of the wealthiest per capita in United States.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lamb|first1=David|title=Once-Gilded City Buffing Itself Up|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/15/nation/na-hartford15/2|accessdate=8 June 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=15 June 2003}}</ref>

====Political turmoil====
On December 15, 1814, the [[Hartford Convention]] was called to order in Hartford. Delegations from the five New England states ([[Maine]] was still part of [[Massachusetts]] at that time) were sent to Hartford to discuss New England's possible [[secession]] from the United States.
[[Image:State Street Looking East, Hartford, CT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|State Street in 1914]]
During the early 19th century, the Hartford area was a center of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] activity. The most famous abolitionist family was the Beechers. The Reverend [[Lyman Beecher]] was an important Congregational minister known for his anti-slavery sermons. His daughter, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], wrote the famous ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', while her brother, the Reverend [[Henry Ward Beecher]], was a noted clergyman who vehemently opposed slavery and supported the temperance movement and women's suffrage. Beecher Stowe's sister, [[Isabella Beecher Hooker]], was a leading member of the [[feminism|women's rights movement]].
[[Image:PostcardBulkeleyBridgeHartfordCT19061916.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bulkeley Bridge, circa 1906–1916]]
In 1860, Hartford was the site of the first "[[Wide Awakes]]," abolitionist supporters of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. These supporters organized torch-light parades that were both political and social events, often including fireworks and music, in celebration of Lincoln's visit to the city. This type of event caught on and eventually became a staple of mid-to-late-19th century campaigning.

====Industrialization and the Colt legacy====
[[File:Colt Armory (1857).jpg|350px|right|thumb|Colt's Armory from an 1857 engraving viewed from the East]]
Perhaps the greatest influence on Hartford's development in the 100 years after independence was [[Samuel Colt]], an industrialist and inventor, and his wife [[Elizabeth Jarvis Colt|Elizabeth Colt]]. Although Colt is often considered the father of the Connecticut River Valley industrial revolution, there were in fact a handful of small outfits already in operation by the time Colt purchased a large tract of land in the area in the 1840s. In 1836, the Connecticut-born gun manufacturer received a U.S. patent for a revolver mechanism that enabled a gun to be fired multiple times without reloading. Sales were initially slow and Colt's business ventures struggled. Then in 1846, with the [[Mexican–American War]] under way, the U.S. government ordered 1,000 Colt revolvers. In 1848, Colt was able to start again with a new business of his own, and 1855, he converted it into a corporation under the name of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company]]. Settled just south of [[downtown Hartford]] the original factory is situated modern-day Sheldon/[[Charter Oak]] neighborhood.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Luke|title=Coltsville, USA: Inside America's Gun-Funded Utopia|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/coltsville_abandoned_utopian_guns_village|accessdate=8 June 2015|agency=Atlas Obscura|date=7 May 2015}}</ref>

With business booming, Colt entered an aggressive and expansionary phase and by 1855, Colt opened what was the world’s largest private armament factory, the [[Colt Armory]], in which he employed advanced manufacturing techniques such as interchangeable parts and an organized production line. By 1856, the company could produce 150 weapons per day. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] led to a surge in demand, and Colt supplied the [[Union Army]]. Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company operated at full capacity and employed over 1,000 people in its Hartford factory. By that time, Colt had become one of the wealthiest men in America was presiding over his enterprise from [[Armsmear]], an ornate [[Italianate]] manor built near the armory in 1857. Upon his death in 1862, Colt was worth over $15 million ($380 million by 2015 standards).<ref name="Smith2004">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony|title=Machine Gun: The Story of the Men and the Weapon That Changed the Face of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTNvqbkvpo4C&pg=PA52|date=2 November 2004|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-93477-4|pages=52–53}}</ref>

Colt's methods were at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and his successes secured Hartford's place as a major 19th century manufacturing center. It is estimated that in its first 25 years of manufacturing, Colt's company produced over 400,000 revolvers. His use of [[interchangeable parts]] helped him become one of the first to exploit the [[assembly line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehto|first1=Mark R.|last2=Buck|first2=James R.|title=Introduction to Human Factors and Ergonomics for Engineers|date=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-5308-7|pages=30}}</ref> Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement and mass marketing. His business practices were also innovative, involving not just a shrewd use of patents to protect his products, but also new developments in marketing and business organization to create a highly successful business which long outlived him.

Elizabeth Colt inherited a controlling interest in her late husband's manufacturing company following his death in 1862. At the time, Colt firearms were producing an estimated 1/996th of the entire gross national product of the United States. Despite living in an age where she couldn’t vote, Elizabeth steered the company until 1901 (with her brother [[Richard Jarvis]] as president), becoming one of the most prominent female industrialists in America. Together the two transitioned the company from the end of the [[American Civil War]] through the early 20th century seeing the evolution from [[percussion cap|percussion]] [[revolver]]s to cartridge [[revolver]]s to [[semiautomatic pistol]]s and [[machinegun]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title =The Colt legacy: the Colt Armory in Hartford, 1855–1980 |first= Ellsworth S.|last= Grant |pages=22, 58|publisher= Mowbray Co.|year= 1982|ISBN =978-0-917218-17-0 }}</ref>

In addition, the Colts left an indelible imprint on Hartford's built environment. Inspired by what he had seen during a trip to [[London]] in 1851, Colt embarked upon one of the boldest real estate development campaigns in Hartford's history. His intention to build an industrial community to house his workers adjacent to the [[Colt Armory]]. By 1856, it was a city within a city, where workers of many nationalities and religions worked, lived and recreated alongside one another. While not the largest, the most prominent or the most tightly controlled of America's 19th century [[company towns]], [[Coltsville Historic District|Coltsville]] was among the country's first, and easily the most advanced of its time. Colt's complex also included the largest armory in the world, wharf and ferry facilities on the Connecticut River.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hosley|first1=William|title=Making a Success of Coltsville|url=http://www.hogriver.org/issues/v04n01/coltsville.htm|website=hogriver.org|publisher=Hog River Journal|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref>

After a major fire destroyed the original armory in 1864, Colt's widow had the original armory rebuilt including the original structure's most dramatic feature: the blue onion dome with gold starts, topped by a gold orb and a rampant colt, the original symbol of [[Colt Manufacturing Company]]. Visible to commuters on I-91, the Colt Armory stands a monument to Hartford's first "celebrity industrialist," and the once mighty empire he created.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Editorial Staff|title=Sam Colt's 200th Birthday|url=http://articles.courant.com/2014-07-11/news/hc-ed-sam-colt-birthday-maker-of-gun-that-won-the--20140711_1_sam-colt-colt-park-coltsville|accessdate=16 August 2014|publisher=Hartford Courant|date=11 July 2014}}</ref>
[[File:Church of the Good Shepherd Hartford CT.JPG|thumb|Church of the Good Shepherd Hartford CT]]
Elizabeth Colt dedicated her final decades to philanthropy and public works. Following her son's death, she commissioned the [[Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House|Church of the Good Shepherd]] in 1896 as a monument to his life. Built in [[High Victorian Gothic]] style, architectural features include a variety of gun parts, such as bullet molds, gunsights and cylinders. This unusual characteristic earns the building the title of likely being the only church in the world with a gun motif.<ref>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=75001925}}|format=pdf|title=Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House |accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref>

With no remaining children, Elizabeth willed her extensive collection of rare art to the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in Hartford, one of the oldest art galleries in America. The Elizabeth Hart Jarvis Colt Memorial Wing was the first American museum wing to bear the name of a female patron.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Hart Jarvis Colt|url=http://cwhf.org/inductees/arts-humanities/elizabeth-hart-jarvis-colt#.VXVwuYcW2_c|website=Connecticut Women’s Hall of Fam|accessdate=8 June 2015|date=2012}}</ref>

When Elizabeth Colt died in 1904, she willed the majority of her estate, [[Armsmear]], to the City of Hartford for use as a public park. Today, the {{convert|105|acre}} [[Colt Park]] services the community with a number of athletic fields, playgrounds, a swimming pool, playground, skating rink and [[Dillon Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hartford Parks Department|title=Colt Park and Dillon Stadium|url=http://www.hartford.gov/parks/193-colt-park|website=hartford.gov|publisher=City of Hartford|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref>

====Rise of a major manufacturing center====
Around 1850, Hartford native Samuel Colt perfected the precision manufacturing process that enabled the mass production of thousands of his revolvers with interchangeable parts. Over the next several decades, a variety of industries adopted and adapted these techniques and Hartford became the center of production for a wide array of products—including firearms by Colt, [[Richard Gatling]] and [[John Browning]]; Weed [[sewing machines]]; Royal and Underwood typewriters; Columbia bicycles; and even Pope automobiles.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hintz|first1=Eric|title=Samuel Colt…and Sewing Machines?|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2012/06/samuel-coltand-sewing-machines-part-1.html|accessdate=8 June 2015|work=O, Say Can You See Blog|publisher=National Museum of American History|date=6 June 2012}}</ref>

Just three years after Colt's first factory opened, another weapons manufacturer set up shop in 1852 at a nearby site situated along the now-buried [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]]. Located in the present-day neighborhood of [[Frog Hollow, Hartford, Connecticut|Frog Hollow]], the [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company]] factory heralded the beginning of the area's transformation from marshy farmland into a major industrial zone. The road leading from town to the factory was called Rifle Lane; the name was later changed to College Street and then Capitol Avenue.<ref name="Flayderman 2007 193–196">{{cite book|last=Flayderman|first=Norm|title=Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms and Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THeWYkwoLSUC&pg=PA195|year=2007|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89689-455-X|pages=193–196}}</ref> A century earlier, mills had located along the Park River because of the water power, but by the 1850s water power was approaching obsolescence. Sharps located there specifically to take advantage of the railroad line that had been constructed alongside the river in 1838.

After the Sharps Rifle Company failed in 1870, the Weed Sewing Machine Company took over its factory. The invention of a new type sewing machine was an evolution of mass production after the principles of interchangeability were applied to clocks and guns. The Weed Company played a major role in making Hartford one of three machine tool centers in New England and even outranked the [[Colt Armory]] in nearby [[Coltsville Historic District|Coltsville]] in size, if not fame.<ref name="Flayderman 2007 193–196"/>  Weed eventually would become the birthplace of both the bicycle and automobile industries in Hartford.

Inspired by a British-made, high-wheel bicycle, or velocipede, he saw at the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]] industrialist [[Albert Augustus Pope|Albert Pope]] bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States. Wanting to contract out his first order, however, Pope approached George Fairfield of Hartford of Weed Sewing Machine Company, who produced Pope's first run of bicycles in 1878.<ref>{{cite web|title=Invention hot spot: Beginnings of mass production in 19th-century Hartford, Connecticut|url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/poi-hartford.aspx|website=http://invention.smithsonian.org/|publisher=Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> Bicycles proved to be a huge commercial success and production in the Weed factory expanded, with Weed making every part but the tires, and by 1890, demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market. That year, Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the [[Pope Manufacturing Company]]. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near the turn of the century when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from over-production amidst falling demand.

In an effort to save his business, Pope opened a Motor Carriage Department and turned out electric carriages, beginning with the "Mark III" in 1897. Pope's venture might have made Hartford the capital of the automobile industry were it not for the ascendency of Henry Ford and a series of pitfalls and patent struggles that outlived Pope himself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goddard|first1=Stephen B.|title=Colonel Albert Pope and His American Dream Machines: The Life and Times of a Bicycle Tycoon Turned Automotive Pioneer|date=December 30, 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786440899|pages=176–182|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

In 1876 Hartford Machine Screw was granted a charter "for the purpose of manufacturing screws, hardware and machinery of every variety." The basis for its incorporation was the epochal invention of the first single-spindle automatic screw machine. For its next four years the new firm occupied one of Weed's buildings, milling thousands of screws daily on over 50 machines. Its president was the same George Fairfield who ran Weed and its superintendent was Christopher Spencer, arguably Connecticut's most versatile inventor. Soon Hartford Machine Screw outgrew its quarters and built a new factory adjacent to Weed, where it would remain until 1948.

===20th century===

On the week of April 12, 1909, the [[Connecticut River]] reached a then-record [[flood]] stage of 24½ feet above the low water mark flooding the city and doing great damage.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Record-Breaking Flood at Hartford, Conn.|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=h-ADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=%22popular+mechanics%22+1907&lr=&as_brr=1#PPA516,M1|work= [[Popular Mechanics]]|date= June 1909|accessdate=4 February 2009 }}</ref>

On July 6, 1944, Hartford was the scene of one of the worst fire disasters in the history of the United States. The fire, which occurred at a performance of the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]], became known as the [[Hartford Circus Fire]].

[[File:Hartfort CT Post Office and Customhouse, 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Old Post Office and Custom House next to the Old State House (left) in 1903. Completed in 1882, the building was demolished in 1934.]]

After [[World War II]], many residents of [[Puerto Rico]] moved to Hartford and even today Puerto Rican flags can be found on cars and buildings all over the city. Former Hartford Mayor [[Eddie Pérez (politician)|Eddie Pérez]] was born in Puerto Rico and moved to Hartford in 1969, when he was 12 years old.

Starting in the late 1950s, as the suburbs ringing Hartford began to grow and flourish, the capital city began a long decline. Insurance giant Connecticut General (now [[CIGNA]]) moved to a new, modern campus in the suburb of [[Bloomfield, Connecticut|Bloomfield]]. [[Constitution Plaza]], at first hailed as a model of urban renewal, gradually became a concrete office park.  Once-flourishing department stores such as Brown Thomson, [[Sage-Allen]], and [[G. Fox & Co.]] all shut down as suburban malls such as [[Westfarms]] and Buckland Hills grew in popularity.

In 1997, the city lost its professional hockey franchise, the [[Hartford Whalers]], to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] despite an increase in season ticket sales and an offer of a new arena from the state. Currently a developer from [[Newton, Massachusetts]] who is also the city's largest property owner is working with the city to bring an NHL team back to Hartford and house them in a new largely publicly funded stadium.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2274541 "Developer proposes new arena in Hartford"] [[Associated Press|AP]] report on [[ESPN.com]] (December 29, 2005)</ref>

Hartford experienced problems as the population shrank 11 percent during the 1990s. Only [[Flint, Michigan]]; [[Gary, Indiana]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] experienced larger population losses during the decade. However, the population has increased since the 2000 Census.<ref name=2008pop>The estimated population as of 2008 is 124,062 – an increase of 2,484 from the 2000 Census.

In 1987, Carrie Saxon Perry was elected mayor of Hartford, the first female African-American mayor of a major American city.<ref>[http://www.hartford.gov/news/PR020111_Black%20History%20Month.pdf "I Dream a World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America" by Brian Lanker] {{wayback|url=http://www.hartford.gov/news/PR020111_Black%20History%20Month.pdf |date=20150210021338 }}</ref>

===21st century===

In 2004, Underground Coalition, a Connecticut hip hop promotion company, produced The First Annual Hartford Hip Hop festival, which also took place at Adriaen's Landing. The event drew over 5,000 fans. A significant number of cultural events and performances take place every year at Mortensen Plaza (Riverfront Recapture Organization) by the banks of the CT River.  These events are held outdoors and include live music, festivals, dance, arts and crafts and they are very diverse in ethnicity.  Hartford also has a vibrant theater scene with major Broadway productions at the Bushnell Theater as well as performances at the Hartford Stage and Theaterworks (City Arts).

The [[Connecticut River]] forms the boundary between Hartford and East Hartford.

The [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]] originally divided Hartford into northern and southern sections and was a major part of [[Bushnell Park]], but the river was nearly completely enclosed and buried by flood control projects in the 1940s.<ref name="Bushnell Park">[http://www.bushnellpark.org/parkriver.html ] {{wayback|url=http://www.bushnellpark.org/parkriver.html |date=20070622144227 }}</ref> The former course of the river can still be seen in some of the roadways that were built in the river's place, such as Jewell Street and the [[Conlin-Whitehead Highway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.past-inc.org/historic-bridges/stone-mainst.html |title=Main Street Bridge |publisher=Past-inc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

==Climate==
[[File:StateHouseSqHartford.jpg|thumb|right|State House Square in Downtown Hartford]]

Hartford lies in the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), and is part of USDA [[Hardiness zone]] 6b, degrading to 6a in the northern, western, and eastern suburbs away from the Connecticut River valley.

Seasonally, the period from May through October is warm to hot in Hartford, with the hottest months being June, July, and August. In the summer months there is often high humidity and occasional (but brief) thundershowers. The cool to cold months are from November through April, with the coldest months in December, January, and February having average highs in the lower 30's F and overnight lows near 20 F.

The average annual precipitation is approximately {{convert|45.9|in|mm|sigfig=3}},<ref name= NOAA /> which is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Hartford typically receives about {{convert|44.5|in|cm|0}} of snow in an average winter – about 40% more than coastal Connecticut cities like New Haven, Stamford, and New London.<ref name = NOAA /> seasonal snowfall has ranged from {{convert|115.2|in|cm|0}} during the winter of 1995–96 to {{convert|13.5|in|cm|0}} in 1999–2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/techrpts/tr9602/tr9602.pdf |title=The Winter of 95–96: A Season of Extremes, National Climatic Data Center |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>  During the summer, temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F}} on an average of 17 days per year,<ref name = NOAA /> though the record number of occurrences was 38 in 1983 and 1920 saw none. Conversely, on average, temperatures do not rise above freezing on 30 days and dip to {{convert|0|°F}} or below on 4.0<!--121 occurrences from 1981 to 2010--> nights per year.<ref name = NOAA />   Tropical storms and hurricanes have also struck Hartford, although the occurrence of such systems is rare and is usually confined to the remnants of such storms. Hartford saw extensive damage from the [[1938 New England Hurricane]], as well as with [[Hurricane Irene]] in 2011. The highest officially recorded temperature is {{convert|103|°F|0|abbr=on}} on July 22, 2011 and the lowest is {{convert|-26|°F|0|abbr=on}} on January 22, 1961; the record cold daily maximum is {{convert|-1|°F|0}} on December 2, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is {{convert|80|°F|0}} on July 31, 1917.<ref name = NOAA/>

There were 44,986 households, out of which 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 25.2% were married couples living together, 29.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.6% were non-families. 33.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.33.

In the city, the population distribution skews young:  30.1% under the age of 18, 12.6% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 18.0% from 45 to 64, and 9.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.0 males.

With 30 percent of the population living below the poverty line, Hartford's rate of poverty is second in the United States only to [[Brownsville, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-19.pdf |title=Poverty: 1999 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

The median income for a household in the city was $20,820, and the median income for a family was $22,051. Males had a median income of $28,444 versus $26,131 for females. The per capita income for the city was $13,428. After World War II, and continuing through the latter half of the 20th century, many [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]] moved to the city. As of 2010, 33.7% of Hartford residents claimed Puerto Rican heritage. This was the second-largest concentration of Puerto Ricans in the Northeast, behind only [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]] (source: 2010 census).

==Government==
Hartford is governed via the strong-mayor form of the [[mayor-council system]]. The current mayor is [[Luke Bronin]]. In 2015, Bronin succeeded former Mayor [[Pedro Segarra]], who was sworn in as mayor on June 25, 2010, was Hartford's second mayor of Puerto Rican ancestry, and the first openly [[gay]] mayor of the city.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/nyregion/26hartford.html ''Hartford Mayor Quits Under Fire''] from the ''New York Times'' 25 June 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.courant.com/community/hartford/eddie-perez/hc-pedro-segarra-0623-20100622,0,6225691.story ''Pedro Segarra Poised To Become Hartford Mayor''] from the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' 23 June 2010</ref>

More than fifty years after establishing the [[council-manager]] form, Hartford voted in favor of restoring a mayor-council system in 2003, restoring municipal authority in an elected mayor in 2003. Mayor [[Eddie Perez (politician)|Eddie Perez]], first elected in 2001, was re-elected with 76% of the vote in 2003. As the first strong mayor elected under the revised charter, he is widely credited with reducing crime, reforming the school system and sparking economic revitalization in the city. However, his reputation was hurt by accusations of corruption.<ref name="hartfordinfo.org">http://www.hartfordinfo.org/issues/documents/government/htfd_courant_102807_1.asp</ref>

In Connecticut there is no county-level executive or legislative government; the counties determine probate, civil and criminal court boundaries, but little else. Connecticut municipalities (like those of neighboring states [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]]) provide nearly all local services (such as fire and rescue, education, snow removal, etc.), as county government has been abolished since 1960.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A10FA355A1A7A93C6A81783D85F448685F9 | work=The New York Times | title=Connecticut Ends County Rule Oct. 1; State to Take Over Historic Government Units – Minor Court System Also to Go | date=1960-08-14 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Travelers Tower, Hartford, CT - view 1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Travelers Tower]] in Downtown Hartford]]
Hartford is the historic international center of the insurance industry, with companies such as [[Aetna]], [[Conning & Company]], [[The Hartford]], [[The Phoenix Companies]], [[UnitedHealthcare]] and [[Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company|Hartford Steam Boiler]] based in the city, and companies such as [[The Travelers Companies|Travelers]] and [[Lincoln National Corporation]] having major operations in the city.  The city is also home to the corporate headquarters of [[U.S. Fire Arms Mfg. Co.|U.S. Fire Arms]] and [[United Technologies]].

From the 19th century until the mid-20th century, Hartford was a major manufacturing city. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] into the mid-20th century, the [[Connecticut River Valley]] cities produced many major precision manufacturing innovations. Among these was Hartford's pioneer bicycle (and later) automobile maker [[Pope Manufacturing Company|Pope]].<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.37.</ref> As in nearly all former Northern manufacturing cities, many factories have been closed, relocated, or reduced operations.

Aetna and the Hartford Financial Services Group, both Fortune 100 companies, are headquartered in Hartford. Travelers Insurance has its largest national employment center and historical headquarters in the city. CIGNA insurance is headquartered in the region with a presence in Hartford and its suburb Bloomfield. United Health Insurance has a significant presence in the city.<ref>http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2013/full_list/</ref>

At the same time, many companies have moved to or expanded in the central business district and surrounding neighborhoods. [[Aetna]] announced mid-decade that by 2010 it would move nearly 3,500 employees from its [[Middletown, Connecticut]] offices to its corporate headquarters in the Asylum Hill section of the city. Travelers recently expanded its operations at several downtown locations. In 2008, [[Sovereign Bank]] consolidated two bank branches as well as its regional headquarters in a nineteenth-century palazzo on Asylum Street. In 2009, [[Northeast Utilities]], a Fortune 500 company and New England's largest energy utility, announced it would establish its corporate headquarters downtown. In the same year, work began at the southeastern corner of Constitution Plaza on the AI Technology Center, the future headquarters of the eponymous engineering firm. AI's chief executive helped finance the building, the first commercially leasable structure in Connecticut to be certified at the platinum level under the US Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) program. Other recent entrants into the downtown market include GlobeOp Financial Services and specialty insurance broker S.H. Smith. CareCentrix, a patient home healthcare management company, is moving into downtown from East Hartford, where it will add over 200 jobs within the next few years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Highways===
[[File:Bulkeley Bridge, Hartford.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bulkeley Bridge]] over Connecticut River in Hartford]] [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]], (Formerly I-86) which runs from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], to its intersection with [[Interstate 90 in Massachusetts|I-90]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], just over the Massachusetts border, and [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], which runs from [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] along the [[Connecticut River]] ultimately to Canada, intersect in downtown Hartford.  In addition to I-84 and I-91, two other highways service the city: [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]], an expressway that runs from downtown Hartford to [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]], passing through [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] and past [[Foxwoods Resort Casino]]; and the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]] portion of [[Connecticut Route 15|Route 15]] that skirts the southeastern part of the city near Brainard Airport.  A short connector known as the [[Conlin–Whitehead Highway]] also provides direct access from I-91 to the Capitol Area of downtown Hartford.

Hartford experiences heavy traffic as a result of its substantial suburban population (nearly 10 times that of the actual city). As a result, thousands of people travel on area highways at the start and end of each workday. I-84 experiences traffic from [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] through Hartford and into [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]] and [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]] during the [[rush hour]].

[[File:Charter Oak Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charter Oak Bridge]] over Connecticut River in Hartford]]
Several major surface arteries also run through the city. Albany Avenue
([[U.S. Route 44 in Connecticut|Route 44]]) runs westward through the northern part of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]] to the [[Farmington Valley]] and the hills of northern [[Litchfield County]] and into New York, and eastward towards [[Putnam, Connecticut|Putnam]] and into [[Rhode Island]]. Blue Hills Avenue ([[Route 187 (Connecticut – Massachusetts)|Route 187]]) runs north from Albany Avenue toward [[Bloomfield, Connecticut|Bloomfield]] and [[East Granby, Connecticut|East Granby]].  Main Street ([[Connecticut Route 159|Route 159]]) heads north through [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] towards the western suburbs of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Wethersfield Avenue ([[Connecticut Route 99|Route 99]]) heads south through [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] towards [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]].  Maple Avenue heads south-southwest, becoming the [[Berlin Turnpike]] in Wethersfield and [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]]. Farmington Avenue heads west through West Hartford Center and [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] towards [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]].

[[Amtrak]] provides service from Hartford to [[Vermont]], via [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], (and from there to points west, e.g. to [[Chicago]], or east through the western suburbs of [[Boston]]), and southward to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with connections to New York, [[Boston]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and Washington DC. The station also serves numerous bus companies because of Hartford's mid-way location on the New York to Boston route.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Contrada|first1=Fred|title=First passenger train in a generation stops at Northampton as new Amtrak service begins|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/12/first_passenger_train_in_a_gen.html|accessdate=5 December 2015|agency=MassLive.com|date=29 December 2014}}</ref>

As of late 2015, there are plans to create a [[commuter rail]] service connecting New Haven to Springfield via Hartford. Called the [[Hartford Line]], it will stop at stations in communities along [[Interstate 91|I-91]]. It will use the rail line currently used by [[Amtrak]], which was formerly part of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] system. The commuter rail line is anticipated to open in January 2018, and is currently under construction.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stacom|first1=Dan|title=Springfield-To-New Haven Commuter Rail Cost Increases, Service Begins In 2018|url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-amtrak-hartford-line-1204-20151204-story.html|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher=Hartford Courant|date=4 December 2018}}</ref>

==Recent developments==
* '''Adriaen's Landing''' – The state and privately funded project is situated on the banks of the [[Connecticut River]] along Columbus Boulevard, and connects to Constitution Plaza. Constitution Plaza forced hundreds of households to relocate when it was built a few decades ago. The latest project includes the {{convert|540000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} Connecticut Convention Center, which opened in June 2005 and is the largest meeting space between New York City and [[Boston]].  Attached to the Convention Center is the 22-story, 409 room [[Marriott International|Marriott]] Hartford Hotel-Downtown, which opened in August 2005. Being constructed next to the convention center and hotel is the {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} Connecticut Science Center.
* '''[[Capital Community College]] at the 11-story G. Fox Department Store Building''' – The {{convert|913000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} former home of the [[G. Fox & Co.|G. Fox & Company Department Store]] on Main Street has been renovated and made the new home of Capital Community College as well as offices for the State of Connecticut and ground level retail space. Capital Community College helps train (mostly) adult students in specific career fields. On Thursdays, vendors sell crafts on the Main Street level. Two music clubs, Mezzanine and Room 960, are housed in the building.
* '''[[CTfastrak]]''' – The recently completed [[bus rapid transit]] system connects Hartford's Union Station to downtown New Britain.
*'''Front Street''' – The final component of Adriaen's Landing, 'Front Street', sits across from the Convention Center and covers the land between Columbus Boulevard and [[The Hartford Times Building]]. The Front Street development combines retail, entertainment and residential components. Publicly funded parts of the project will include transportation improvements. There have been significant delays in the Front Street project – the first developer was removed from the project because of lack of progress. The city has chosen a new developer, but work is yet to begin on the retail and residential component of Front Street. The city and state may soon take action to increase the speed with which the project enters implementation phases. There has been talk of bringing an [[ESPN Zone]] to the Front Street ([[ESPN]] is headquartered in nearby [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontstreetdistrict.com/index.html |title=The New Pulse of Hartford &#124; Home |publisher=Front Street District |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> On the back side of Front Street, the historic [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Hartford Times Building is being converted into a downtown campus of the [[University of Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gosselin|first1=Kenneth|title=Authority Gets Look at Latest UConn Hartford Campus Renderings|url=http://www.courant.com/real-estate/property-line/hc-uconn-hartford-connecticut-campus-new-renderings-20141121-story.html|newspaper=The Hartford Courant|date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>
* '''[[Hartford Line]]''' – According to Connecticut Governor Malloy, the Hartford Line commuter rail service will reach speeds up to {{convert|110|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="nhregister.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2011/04/07/news/doc4d9cf8b24e8c3339028689.txt |title=Conn. seeks funds for rail work on Hartford-to-Springfield line (document) |publisher=The New Haven Register|date=2011-04-07 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> The rail line is intended to unite the densely populated, 61 mile region between Hartford, Springfield, and New Haven; ease the frequently congested [[Interstate 91]] automobile highway; and increase mobility in a region that is now almost entirely dependent upon automobile ownership. As of May 2011, Connecticut's portion of the commuter line has been 3/4 funded. Currently, the state is seeking the $227 million necessary to complete the northern portion of the line from the $2.4 billion in Federal funds that Florida rejected to fund its own high-speed rail project.<ref name="nhregister.com"/>
*'''Knowledge Corridor Partnership''' – In 2000, at [[The Big E]] in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]], Hartford and Springfield, Massachusetts – the two major New England, [[Connecticut River Valley]] cities with centers only 24 miles apart – jointly announced the [[Knowledge Corridor]] Partnership. The Knowledge Corridor Partnership aims to unite the two metropolitan areas economically, culturally, and geographically. The nickname comes from the metropolitan region's over 32 universities and liberal arts colleges, including several of the United States' most prestigious. As of the 10th anniversary of the Knowledge Corridor, it was announced that the Knowledge Corridor is beginning to receive federal funds, as opposed to either state or city.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Republican file photo |url=http://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2010/10/hartford_springfield_economic_partnershi.html |title=Hartford Springfield Economic Partnership gets $4.2 million to boost Knowledge Corridor |publisher=masslive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>
