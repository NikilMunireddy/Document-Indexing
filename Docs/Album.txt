[[Image:Earlyalbum1.jpg|right|thumb|Early record albums were packages of 78 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] records in book form.]]

'''Album'''s of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual [[78rpm record]]s, then from 1948 as vinyl [[LP record]]s  played at {{frac|33|1|3}}&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]]. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century albums sales have mostly focused on [[compact disc]] (CD) and [[MP3]] formats. The [[audio cassette]] was a format used in the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.

An album may be recorded in a [[recording studio]] (fixed or mobile), in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. Recording may take a few hours to several years to complete, usually in several [[take]]s with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or "[[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]]" together. Recordings that are done in one take without [[overdubbing]] are termed "live", even when done in a studio. Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, so as to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some "live rooms", allow for reverberation, which creates a "live" sound.<ref name="Philip Newell 169–170">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tbEcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=169–170|title=Recording Studio Design|author=Philip Newell|publisher=Taylor & Francis|date= 18 Jul 2013}}</ref> The majority of studio recordings contain an abundance of editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With [[History of sound recording|modern recording technology]], musicians can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using [[headphones]]; with each part recorded as a [[Multitrack recording|separate track]].

[[Album cover]]s and [[liner notes]] are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and [[lyrics]] or [[libretto]]s.<ref name="Album Cover Art Series">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockartpictureshow.com/vinylgallery|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=Album Cover Art Series|publisher=Rock Art Picture Show}}</ref><ref name="The history of the CD - The 'Jewel Case'">{{cite web|url=http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/jewelcase.html|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=The history of the CD – The 'Jewel Case'|publisher=Philips Research}}</ref> Historically, the term "album" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a [[book]] format.

When [[long-playing record]]s were introduced, a collection of pieces on a single record was called an album; the word was extended to other recording media such as [[compact disc]], [[MiniDisc]], [[Compact audio cassette]], and digital albums as they were introduced.<ref name="About Vinyl Records" />

==History==
The [[LP record]] (long play), or {{frac|33|1|3}}&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] microgroove [[polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] record, is a [[gramophone record]] format introduced by [[Columbia Records]] in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/2010/06/0621first-lp-released/|title=First LP released|work=wired.com}}</ref> It was adopted by the record industry as a standard format for the "album". Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of [[stereophonic]] sound capability, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. The term "album" had been carried forward from the early nineteenth century when it had been used for collections of short pieces of music.<ref name="Mendelssohn And Schumann"/> Later, collections of related [[78rpm record]]s were bundled in book-like albums.<ref name="alancross.ca"/> When [[long-playing record]]s were introduced, a collection of pieces on a single record was called an album; the word was extended to other recording media such as [[compact disc]], [[MiniDisc]], [[Compact audio cassette]], and digital albums, as they were introduced.<ref name="About Vinyl Records" /> As part of a trend of shifting sales in the [[music industry]], some commenters have declared that the early 21st century experienced the [[death of the album]].

==Length==
While an album may contain as many or as few tracks as required, the criteria for the [[UK Albums Chart]] is that a recording counts as an "album" if it either has more than four tracks or lasts more than 25 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/docs/NEW_Album_Chart_Rules_2007_2.pdf |title=Rules For Chart Eligibility – Albums |accessdate=20 April 2007 |date=January 2007 |format=pdf |publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070627231755/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/docs/NEW_Album_Chart_Rules_2007_2.pdf |archivedate = 27 June 2007}}</ref> Sometimes shorter albums are referred to as "[[mini-album]]s" or [[Extended play|EPs]].<ref name="As albums fade away, music industry looks to shorter records">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/jan/04/albums-fade-away-music-industry-looks-shorter-reco/?breakingnews|accessdate=1 June 2012|title=As albums fade away, music industry looks to shorter records|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Albums such as ''[[Tubular Bells]]'', ''[[Amarok (Mike Oldfield album)|Amarok]]'', ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' by [[Mike Oldfield]], and [[Yes (band)|Yes]]'s ''[[Close to the Edge (Yes album)|Close to the Edge]]'', include fewer than four tracks. There are no formal 'rules' against artists such as [[Pinhead Gunpowder]] referring to their own releases under thirty minutes as "albums."

If an album becomes too long to fit onto a single vinyl record or CD, it may be released as a [[double album]] where two vinyl [[Long Play|LPs]] or compact discs are packaged together in a single case, or a [[triple album]] containing three LPs or compact discs. Recording artists who have an extensive back catalogue may re-release several CDs in one single box with a unified design, often containing one or more albums (in this scenario, these releases can sometimes be referred to as a "two (or three)-fer"), or a compilation of previously unreleased recordings. These are known as [[box set]]s. Some musical artists have also released more than three compact discs or LP records of new recordings at once, in the form of boxed sets, although in that case the work is still usually considered to be an album.

==Tracks{{anchor|Music track}}==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2007}}
Material (music or sounds) is stored on an album in sections termed tracks, normally 11 or 12 tracks. A music track (often simply referred to as a track) is an individual [[song]] or [[instrumental]] recording. The term is particularly associated with [[popular music]] where separate tracks are known as album tracks; the term is also used for other formats such as [[EP (format)|EP]]s and [[Single (music)|singles]]. When vinyl records were the primary medium for audio recordings a track could be identified visually from the grooves and many album covers or sleeves included numbers for the tracks on each side. On a [[compact disc]] the track number is indexed so that a player can jump straight to the start of any track. On digital music stores such as [[iTunes]] the term song is often used interchangeably with track regardless of whether there is any vocal content.

;Bonus tracks{{anchor|Bonus track}}
A bonus track (also known as a bonus cut or bonus) is a piece of music which has been included as an extra. This may be done as a marketing promotion, or for other reasons. It is not uncommon to include singles as bonus tracks on re-issues of old albums, where those tracks weren't originally included. Online music stores allow buyers to create their own albums by selecting songs themselves; bonus tracks may be included if a customer buys a whole album rather than just one or two songs from the artist. The song is not necessarily free nor is it available as a stand-alone download, adding also to the incentive to buy the complete album. In contrast to [[hidden track]]s, bonus tracks are included on track listings and usually do not have a gap of silence between other album tracks.

==Recording==
The contents of the album are usually recorded in a [[recording studio|studio]] or live in concert, though may be recorded in other locations, such as at home (as with JJ Cale's [[Okie]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/JJ-Cale-Okie/release/2982662|title=JJ-Cale-Okie|work=discogs.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/10207642/JJ-Cale.html|title=JJ Cale Obituary|date=28 July 2013|work=telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> Beck's [[Odelay]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=p6-UYTO7l1MC&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=75|title=100 Greatest Albums: 16 Beck Odelay|periodical=Spin|date=July 2008}}</ref> David Gray's [[White Ladder]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7RMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=11|work=Billboard|date=18 Aug 2001|title=UK Fave Tom McRae Bows In States Via Arista}}</ref> and others),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/78949/15-legendary-albums-that-were-recorded-in-bedrooms-kitchens-and-garages|title=15 Legendary Albums That Were Recorded in Bedrooms, Kitchens, and Garages|work=mic.com|author=Matt Fowler |date=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicscoop.com/2015/02/12/10-classic-albums-made-outside-the-recording-studio/|title=10 Classic Albums Made Outside the Recording Studio|date= 12 February 2015|author= Michael Duncan|work= sonicscoop.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2012/01/10-great-albums-recorded-at-home.html|title=10 Great Albums Recorded at Home|author=Tyler Kane|date= 17 January 2012|work=pastemagazine.com}}</ref> in the field - as with early Blues recordings,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oxdloWgNSPEC&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=64|title=Red River Blues: The Blues Tradition in the Southeast|author=Bruce Bastin|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date= 1 Jan 1995}}</ref> in prison,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-news/rare-soul-album-recorded-in-a-prison-gets-reissue/|title=Rare 1979 soul album recorded in a prison gets reissue|work=thevinylfactory.com}}</ref> or with a mobile recording unit such as the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/print/can_grammy_winning_recordings_be_made_in_a_home_studio|title=Can Award-Winning Recordings Be Made In A Home Studio?|author=Bob Buontempo|date=16 May 2013|work=prosoundweb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/rolling-stones-mobile-studio/|title=A Look Back at the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio: ‘A Watershed Moment in Recording Technology’|author=Frank Mastropolo|date=23 October 2014|work=ultimateclassicrock.com}}</ref>

Although recording in a studio can be done using large multi-track systems with many overdubs and different takes of the same instrument, some recordings may be done "live" in order to reproduce the feel and energy of a live performance.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Basic parts such as [[drums]] and rhythm guitar may be recorded live, with overdubs such as solos and vocals recorded later.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Studio recordings may be [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] and [[Audio mastering|mastered]] at different facilities.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== Vinyl records ===
[[Image:1980s albums by Uncle Bonsai.jpg|thumb|Two vinyl records with inner and outer album sleeves]]
{{Main|LP record}}

Vinyl [[Long Play|LP]] records have two sides, each comprising one half of the album. If a [[pop music|pop]] or [[rock music|rock]] album contained tracks released separately as commercial [[single (music)|singles]], they were conventionally placed in particular positions on the album.<ref name="About Vinyl Records">{{cite web|url=http://www.recordcollectorsguild.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=44&page=1|accessdate=29 May 2012|title=About Vinyl Records|publisher=Record Collector's Guild}}</ref> A common configuration was to have the album led off by the second and third singles, followed by a ballad. The ''first'' single would lead off side 2.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In the past many singles (such as the [[Beatles]]' "[[Hey Jude]]" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Positively 4th Street]]") did not appear on albums, but others (such as the Beatles' "[[Come Together]]" and Dylan's "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]") formed part of an album released concurrently. Today, many commercial albums of music tracks feature one or more singles, which are released separately to radio, TV or the Internet as a way of promoting the album.<ref name="Chronology: Technology and the Music Industry">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/inside/cron.html|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=Chronology: Technology and the Music Industry|publisher=Callie Tainter}}</ref> Albums have also been issued that are compilations of older tracks not originally released together, such as singles not originally found on albums, [[b-sides]] of singles, or unfinished "demo" recordings.<ref name="About Vinyl Records" />

Album sets of the past were sequenced for [[record changers]]. In the case of a two-record set, for example, sides 1 and 4 would be stamped on one record, and sides 2 and 3 on the other. The user would stack the two records onto the spindle of an automatic record changer, with side 1 on the bottom and side 2 (on the other record) on top. Side 1 would automatically drop onto the [[Phonograph|turntable]] and be played. When finished, the tone arm's position would trigger a mechanism which moved the arm out of the way, dropped the record with side 2, and played it. When both records had been played, the user would pick up the stack, turn it over, and put them back on the spindle—sides 3 and 4 would then play in sequence.<ref name="About Vinyl Records" /> Record changers were used for many years of the LP era, but eventually fell out of use.

===8-track tape===

{{main|8-track tape}}

8-track tape (formally Stereo 8: commonly known as the eight-track cartridge, eight-track tape, or simply eight-track) is a [[magnetic tape sound recording]] technology popular in the United States<ref>{{cite web|title=What Are 8-Track Tapes?|url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-8-track-tapes.htm |publisher=wisegeek.com |accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref> from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s when the [[Compact Cassette]] format took over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/collector-resources/collectors-corner-the-history-of-the-eight-track-tape|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What Are 8-Track Tapes?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-8-track-tapes.htm|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref> The format is regarded as an obsolete technology, and was relatively unknown outside the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.goldminemag.com/collector-resources/collectors-corner-the-history-of-the-eight-track-tape |title=Collector’s Corner: The History Of The Eight-Track Tape |first=Dan |last=Moore |publisher=Goldmine magazine |accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-8-track-tapes.htm |publisher=wisegeek.com |accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref>

Stereo 8 was created in 1964 by a consortium led by [[Bill Lear]] of [[Lear Jet]] Corporation, along with [[Ampex]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[General Motors]], [[Motorola]], and [[RCA Victor Records]] (RCA). It was a further development of the similar [[Stereo-Pak]] four-track cartridge created by [[Madman Muntz|Earl "Madman" Muntz]]. A later [[quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] version of the format was announced by RCA in April 1970 and first known as Quad-8, then later changed to just Q8.

{{Main|Compact Cassette}}

The Compact Cassette was a popular medium for distributing pre-recorded music in the late 1970s through to the 1990s. The very first "Compact Cassette" was introduced by [[Philips]] in August 1963 in the form of a prototype.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette" /> Compact Cassettes became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the Sony [[Walkman]], which allowed the person to  control what they listened to.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1907884,00.html|title=''A Brief History of The Walkman''|accessdate=31 May 2012|work=Time|first=Meaghan|last=Haire|date=1 July 2009}}</ref> The Walkman was convenient because of its size, the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with a clip for belts or pants.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette" /> Compact cassettes also saw the creation of [[mixtape]]s, which are tapes containing a compilation of songs created by any average listener of music.<ref name="Mixtape History">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape/news_feature_021003/index8.jhtml|accessdate=5 July 2012|title=Mixtape History|publisher=MTV}}</ref> The songs on a mixtape generally relate to one another in some way, whether it be a conceptual theme or an overall sound.<ref name="Mixtape History" /> The compact cassette used double-sided [[magnetic tape sound recording|magnetic tape]] to distribute music for commercial sale.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette">{{cite web|url=http://vintagecassettes.com/_history/history.htm|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=History of Compact Cassette|publisher=Vintage Cassettes}}</ref><ref name="The History of Recorded Music">{{cite web|url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~s142tm01/history4.html|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=The History of Recorded Music|publisher=Music Cd Industry}}</ref> The music is recorded on both the "A" and "B" side of the tape, with cassette being "turned" to play the other side of the album.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette" /> Compact Cassettes were also a popular way for musicians to record "[[Demo (music)|Demos]]" or "Demo Tapes" of their music to distribute to various record labels, in the hopes of acquiring a [[recording contract]].<ref name="The Death of the Demo Tape (At Last)">{{cite web|url=http://wfmu.org/~davem/docs/demotape.html|accessdate=5 July 2012|title=Demo Tapes|publisher=Dave Mandl}}</ref> The sales of Compact Cassettes eventually began to decline in the 1990s, after the release and distribution [[Compact Disc]]s. After the introduction of Compact discs, the term "Mixtape" began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format.<ref name="Mixtape History" /> Recently there has been a revival of Compact Cassettes by [[independent record label]]s and DIY musicians who prefer the format because of its difficulty to [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|share over the internet]].<ref name="Cassette Revival">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediageek.net/tag/cassette-revival|accessdate=5 July 2012|title=Cassette Revival|publisher=Mediageek}}</ref>

{{Main|Music download}}
The [[MP3]] audio format has come along, revolutionizing the concept of digital storage.  Early MP3 albums were basically CD-rips created by early CD-ripping software, and sometimes real-time rips from cassettes and vinyl.

The so-called "MP3 album" isn't necessarily just in MP3 file format, in which higher quality formats such as [[FLAC]] and [[WAV]] can be used on storage mediums that MP3 albums reside on, such as [[CD-ROM|CD-R-ROM]]<nowiki/>s, [[hard drive]]s, [[flash memory]] (e.g. [[USB flash drive|thumbdrives]], [[MP3 player]]s, [[SD card]]s), etc.{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}}

===Live===
{{main|Live album}}
{{original research|section|date=July 2015}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

An album may be recorded in a [[recording studio]] (fixed or mobile), in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. Recording may take a few hours to several years to complete, usually in several [[take]]s with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or "[[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]]" together.

Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, so as to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some "live rooms", allow for reverberation, which creates a "live" sound.<ref name="Philip Newell 169–170"/> The majority of studio recordings contain an abundance of editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With [[History of sound recording|modern recording technology]], musicians can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using [[headphones]]; with each part recorded as a [[Multitrack recording|separate track]].

A live album is recorded during stage performances using [[remote recording]] techniques. Live albums may be recorded at a single [[concert]], or combine recordings made at multiple concerts. They may include applause and other noise from the audience, comments by the performers between pieces, improvisation, [[Medley (music)|medley]]s and so on. They often employ [[multitrack recording]] direct from the stage sound system (rather than microphones placed among the audience), and can employ additional manipulation and effects during post-production to enhance the quality of the recording.

===Solo===
{{Anchor|Solo album}}
{{for|albums titled "Solo"|Solo (disambiguation)}}
A '''solo album''', in [[popular music]], is an album headlined by a current or former member of a [[rock group|band]]. A solo album may feature simply one person performing all instruments, but typically features the work of other collaborators; rather, it may be made with ''different'' collaborators than the [[musician|artist]] is usually associated, though just how different that group is varies widely.

The concept of the solo album arose at least as early as the late 1940s. A 1947 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine article heralded "[[Margaret Whiting]] huddling with [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] execs over her first solo album on which she will be backed by [[Frank De Vol]]".<ref>''Billboard Magazine'' (April 5, 1947), p. 21.</ref>

A modern example is [[rock music]]ian [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who came to prominence as a member of [[The Police]]. For his first solo album, [[1985 in music|1985]]'s ''[[Dream of the Blue Turtles]]'', Sting recruited an entirely different [[backup band|backing group]] with which to perform. However, it is common for musicians to recruit some of their "regular" bandmates for the recording of a solo album. Another example is the musician [[Peter Gabriel]]. Gabriel departed from the UK band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] with the birth of his first daughter, and wrote a song, "[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]", to commemorate the event.

There is no formal definition setting forth the amount of participation a band member can solicit from other members of his band, and still have the album referred to as a solo album. One reviewer wrote that [[Ringo Starr]]'s third venture, ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]'', "[t]echnically... wasn't a solo album because all four [[Beatles]] appeared on it".<ref>Jay Warner, ''On this day in music history'' (2004), p. 323.</ref> Three of the four members of the Beatles released solo albums while the group was officially still together, a pattern later replicated by other groups such as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], who took the idea even further by releasing them on the same day and giving them similar artwork.

A performer may record a solo album for a number of reasons. A [[Solo (music)|solo performer]] working with other members will typically have full creative control of the band, be able to hire and fire accompanists, and get the majority of the proceeds. The performer may be able to produce songs that differ widely from the sound of the band with which the performer has been associated, or that the group as a whole chose not to include in its own albums. [[Graham Nash]], of [[The Hollies]] described his experience in developing a solo album as follows: "The thing that I go through that results in a solo album is an interesting process of collecting songs that can't be done, for whatever reason, by a lot of people".<ref>Dave Zimmer, ''4 way street: the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young reader'' (2004), p. 218.</ref> A solo album may also represent the departure of the performer from the group.

===Tribute or cover===
{{anchor|Tribute album}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}{{Dicdef|section|date=December 2015}}
A tribute or cover album is a collection of [[cover version]]s of songs or instrumental compositions. Its concept may involve various artists covering the songs of a single artist, genre or period, a single artist covering the songs of various artists or a single artist, genre or period, or any variation of an album of cover songs which is marketed as a "tribute".
