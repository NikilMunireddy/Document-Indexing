<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Alzheimer's disease''' ('''AD'''), also known as just '''Alzheimer's''', is a chronic [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease that usually starts slowly and gets worse over time.<ref name=BMJ2009/><ref name=WHO2014/> It is the cause of  60% to 70% of cases of [[dementia]].<ref name=BMJ2009/><ref name=WHO2014/> The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events ([[short-term memory]] loss).<ref name=BMJ2009>{{cite journal|vauthors=Burns A, Iliffe S |title=Alzheimer's disease|journal=BMJ |date=5 February 2009|volume=338|pages=b158|pmid=19196745|doi=10.1136/bmj.b158}}</ref> As the disease advances, symptoms can include [[primary progressive aphasia|problems with language]], [[Orientation (mental)|disorientation]] (including easily getting lost), [[mood swing]]s, loss of [[motivation]], not managing [[Activities of daily living|self care]], and [[challenging behaviour|behavioural issues]].<ref name=BMJ2009/><ref name=WHO2014/> As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society.<ref name=BMJ2009/> Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death.<ref name="nihstages">{{cite web|title=About Alzheimer's Disease: Symptoms|url=http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/symptoms|publisher=National Institute on Aging|accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.<ref name=NEJM2010>{{cite journal|vauthors=Querfurth HW, LaFerla FM |title=Alzheimer's disease|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=28 January 2010|volume=362|issue=4|pages=329–44|pmid=20107219|doi=10.1056/NEJMra0909142}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Todd S, Barr S, Roberts M, Passmore AP |title=Survival in dementia and predictors of mortality: a review|journal=International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|date=November 2013|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1109–24|pmid=23526458|doi=10.1002/gps.3946}}</ref>

The disease course is divided into four stages, with a progressive pattern of [[cognitive]] and [[functional symptom|functional]] [[Disability|impairment]].

===Pre-dementia===
The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to [[ageing]] or [[stress (biology)|stress]].<ref name="pmid17222085">{{vcite journal | author = Waldemar G, Dubois B, Emre M, et al | title = Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Management of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Disorders Associated with Dementia: EFNS Guideline | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = e1–26 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17222085 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01605.x | month = January }}</ref> Detailed [[neuropsychological test]]ing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfills the clinical criteria for [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of AD.<ref name="pmid15324363">{{vcite journal | author = Bäckman L, Jones S, Berger AK, Laukka EJ, Small BJ | title = Multiple Cognitive Deficits During the Transition to Alzheimer's Disease | journal = Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 256 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–204 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15324363 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2004.01386.x | month = Sep }}</ref> These early symptoms can affect the most complex [[Activities of daily living|daily living activities]].<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Nygård L | title = Instrumental Activities of Daily Living: A Stepping-stone Towards Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment? | journal = Acta Neurologica Scandinavica | volume = Suppl | issue = 179 | pages = 42–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12603250 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0404.107.s179.8.x }}</ref> The most noticeable deficit is [[short term memory]] loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.<ref name="pmid15324363"/><ref name="pmid12603249">{{vcite journal | author = Arnáiz E, Almkvist O | title = Neuropsychological Features of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease | journal = Acta Neurologica Scandinavica | volume = 179 | pages = 34–41 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12603249 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0404.107.s179.7.x }}</ref>

Subtle problems with the [[executive functions]] of [[attention|attentiveness]], [[planning]], flexibility, and [[abstraction|abstract thinking]], or impairments in [[semantic memory]] (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD.<ref name="pmid15324363"/> [[Apathy]] can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] symptom throughout the course of the disease.<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Landes AM, Sperry SD, Strauss ME, Geldmacher DS | title = Apathy in Alzheimer's Disease | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 12 | pages = 1700–7 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11844006 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49282.x | month = Dec }}</ref> Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory difficulties are also common.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice.|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=1-4377-0434-4|vauthors=Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH |edition=6th|veditors=Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J |chapter=Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice}}</ref>
The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI).<ref name="pmid12603249"/> This is often found to be a transitional stage between normal ageing and [[dementia]]. MCI can present with a variety of symptoms, and when memory loss is the predominant symptom, it is termed "amnestic MCI" and is frequently seen as a [[prodromal]] stage of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name="Grundman">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Grundman M, Petersen RC, Ferris SH, et al.  |title=Mild cognitive impairment can be distinguished from Alzheimer disease and normal aging for clinical trials |journal=Arch.

===Early===
In people with AD, the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, [[perception]] ([[agnosia]]), or execution of movements ([[apraxia]]) are more prominent than memory problems.<ref name="pmid10653284">{{vcite journal | author = Förstl H, Kurz A | title = Clinical Features of Alzheimer's Disease | journal = European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 249 | issue = 6 | pages = 288–290 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10653284 | doi = 10.1007/s004060050101 }}</ref> AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. [[long-term memory|Older memories]] of the person's life ([[episodic memory]]), facts learned ([[semantic memory]]), and [[implicit memory]] (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.<ref name="pmid1300219">{{vcite journal | author = Carlesimo GA, Oscar-Berman M | title = Memory Deficits in Alzheimer's Patients: A Comprehensive Review | journal = Neuropsychology Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–69 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1300219 | doi = 10.1007/BF01108841 | month = June }}</ref><ref name="pmid8821346">{{vcite journal | author = Jelicic M, Bonebakker AE, Bonke B | title = Implicit Memory Performance of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Brief Review | journal = International Psychogeriatrics | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 385–392 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8821346 | doi = 10.1017/S1041610295002134 }}</ref>

[[primary progressive aphasia|Language problems]] are mainly characterised by a shrinking [[vocabulary]] and decreased word [[fluency]], leading to a general impoverishment of oral and [[written language]].<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid1856925">{{vcite journal | author = Taler V, Phillips NA | title = Language Performance in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: a comparative review | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 501–56 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18569251 | doi = 10.1080/13803390701550128 }}</ref> In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid1856925"/><ref name="pmid7967534">{{vcite journal | author = Frank EM | title = Effect of Alzheimer's Disease on Communication Function | journal = Journal of the South Carolina Medical Association | volume = 90 | issue = 9 | pages = 417–23 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7967534 | month = September }}</ref>  While performing [[fine motor skill|fine motor tasks]] such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties (apraxia) may be present, but they are commonly unnoticed.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

===Moderate===
Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to [[Anomic aphasia|recall vocabulary]], which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions ([[paraphasia]]s). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7967534"/> Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Long-term memory]], which was previously intact, becomes impaired.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

Behavioural and [[neuropsychiatric]] changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are [[Wandering (dementia)|wandering]], [[irritability]] and [[labile affect]], leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated [[aggression]], or resistance to caregiving.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Sundowning]] can also appear.<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Volicer L, Harper DG, Manning BC, Goldstein R, Satlin A | title = Sundowning and Circadian Rhythms in Alzheimer's Disease | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 158 | issue = 5 | pages = 704–11 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11329390 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.704 | accessdate = 27 August 2008 | month = May }}</ref> Approximately 30% of people with AD develop [[Delusional misidentification syndrome|illusionary misidentifications]] and other [[delusion]]al symptoms.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations ([[anosognosia]]).<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Urinary incontinence]] can develop.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> These symptoms create [[stress (biology)|stress]] for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from [[home care]] to other [[Nursing home|long-term care facilities]].<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7806732">{{vcite journal | author = Gold DP, Reis MF, Markiewicz D, Andres D | title = When Home Caregiving Ends: A Longitudinal Study of Outcomes for Caregivers of Relatives with Dementia | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–6 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7806732 | month = January | doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1995.tb06235.x}}</ref>

===Advanced===
During the final stages, the patient is completely dependent upon caregivers.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7967534"/> Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme [[apathy]] and [[exhaustion]] are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks independently; [[musculature|muscle mass]] and mobility deteriorate to the point where they are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of [[pressure ulcer]]s or [[pneumonia]], not the disease itself.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><!-- cites previous 4 sentences -->

==Cause==

The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still mostly unknown except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alz.org/research/science/alzheimers_disease_causes.asp|title=What We Know Today About Alzheimer's Disease|publisher=Alzheimer's Association|accessdate=1 October 2011|quote=While scientists know Alzheimer's disease involves progressive brain cell failure, the reason cells fail isn't clear.}}

===Neuropathology===

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross [[atrophy]] of the affected regions, including degeneration in the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], and parts of the [[frontal cortex]] and [[cingulate gyrus]].<ref name="pmid12934968"/> Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the [[locus coeruleus]].<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Braak H, Del Tredici K | title = Where, when, and in what form does sporadic Alzheimer's disease begin? | journal = Current Opinion in Neurology | volume = 25 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 708–14 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23160422 | doi = 10.1097/WCO.0b013e32835a3432 }}</ref> Studies using [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] and [[positron emission tomography|PET]] have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Desikan RS, Cabral HJ, Hess CP, et al | title = Automated MRI Measures Identify Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease | journal = Brain | volume = 132 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 2048–57 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19460794 | pmc = 2714061 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awp123 }}</ref><ref>{{vcite journal|author=Moan R|title=MRI Software Accurately IDs Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease|journal=Diagnostic Imaging|date=20 July 2009|url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/news/display/article/113619/1428344}}</ref>

Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a [[protein folding|protein misfolding]] disease ([[proteopathy]]), caused by [[senile plaque|plaque]] accumulation of abnormally folded [[amyloid beta]] protein, and [[tau (protein)|tau]] protein in the brain.<ref name="pmid14528050">{{vcite journal | author = Hashimoto M, Rockenstein E, Crews L, Masliah E | title = Role of Protein Aggregation in Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases | journal = Neuromolecular Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 21–36 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14528050 | doi = 10.1385/NMM:4:1-2:21 }}</ref> Plaques are made up of small [[peptide]]s, 39–43&nbsp;[[amino acid]]s in length, called [[amyloid beta]] (A<sub>β</sub>).

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]]. Every neuron has a [[cytoskeleton]], an internal support structure partly made up of structures called [[microtubules]]. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the [[axon]] and back. A protein called ''tau'' stabilises the microtubules when [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]], and is therefore called a [[microtubule-associated protein]]. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming [[Hyperphosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]]; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.<ref name="pmid17604998">{{vcite journal | author = Hernández F, Avila J | title = Tauopathies | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 64 | issue = 17 | pages = 2219–33 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17604998 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-007-7220-x | month = September }}</ref>

The amyloid hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of beta-amyloid [[peptide]]s as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid [[fibril]]s, which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's [[calcium]] [[ion]] [[homeostasis]], induces [[programmed cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]).<ref name="pmid2218531">{{vcite journal | author = Yankner BA, Duffy LK, Kirschner DA | title = Neurotrophic and Neurotoxic Effects of Amyloid Beta Protein: Reversal by Tachykinin Neuropeptides | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4978 | pages = 279–82 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2218531 | doi = 10.1126/science.2218531 | month = October }}</ref> It is also known that A<sub>β</sub> selectively builds up in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain [[enzyme]] functions and the utilisation of [[glucose]] by neurons.<ref name="pmid17424907">{{vcite journal | author = Chen X, Yan SD | title = Mitochondrial Abeta: A Potential Cause of Metabolic Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 58 | issue = 12 | pages = 686–94 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17424907 | doi = 10.1080/15216540601047767 | month = December }}</ref>

Various inflammatory processes and [[cytokine]]s may also have a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.

===Psychosocial intervention===

Emotion-oriented interventions include [[reminiscence therapy]], [[validation therapy]], supportive [[psychotherapy]], [[sensory integration therapy|sensory integration]], also called [[snoezelen]], and [[simulated presence therapy]]. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness.<ref name="pracGuideAPA"/> Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past.

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|cognitive retraining]], is the reduction of [[cognitive deficit]]s. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities,<ref name="pmid17636652">{{vcite journal | author = Spector A, Orrell M, Davies S, Woods B | title = Withdrawn: reality orientation for dementia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD001119 | year = 2000 | pmid = 17636652 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001119.pub2 | editor1-last = Spector | editor1-first = Aimee E }}</ref><ref name="pmid12948999">{{vcite journal | author = Spector A, Thorgrimsen L, Woods B, et a; | title = Efficacy of an evidence-based cognitive stimulation therapy programme for people with dementia: randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 183 | issue = 3 | pages = 248–254 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12948999 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.183.3.248 }}</ref> although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.<ref name="pracGuideAPA"/>

Stimulation-oriented treatments include [[Art therapy|art]], [[Music therapy for Alzheimer's disease|music]] and [[Animal-assisted therapy|pet]] therapies, [[Physical therapy|exercise]], and any other kind of [[Recreational therapy|recreational activities]]. Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function.

===Caregiving===

Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving essentially is the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.

===Feeding tubes===
People with Alzheimer's disease (and other forms of [[dementia]]) often develop problems with eating, due to difficulties in swallowing, reduced appetite or the inability to recognise food. Their carers and families often request they have some form of [[feeding tube]]. However, there is no evidence that this helps people with advanced Alzheimer's to gain weight, regain strength or improve their quality of life. In fact, their use might carry an increased risk of [[aspiration pneumonia]], use of physical restraints, and increased risk of [[pressure ulcers]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Sampson EL, Candy B, Jones L |date=2009|title=Enteral tube feeding for older people with advanced dementia (Intervention Review)|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007209.pub2/pdf/standard | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007209.pub2|pmid=19370678|pages=CD007209}}</ref><!-- cites previous three sentences -->

The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

Two main measures are used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies: incidence and prevalence. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while [[prevalence]] is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.

Regarding incidence, [[cohort study|cohort]] [[longitudinal studies]] (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD,<ref name="pmid17727890">{{vcite journal | author = Bermejo-Pareja F, Benito-León J, Vega S, Medrano MJ, Román GC | title = Incidence and subtypes of dementia in three elderly populations of central Spain | journal = Journal of the Neurological Sciences | volume = 264 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 63–72 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17727890 | doi = 10.1016/j.jns.2007.07.021 | month = January }}</ref><ref name="pmid12028245">{{vcite journal | author = Di Carlo A, Baldereschi M, Amaducci L, et al | title = Incidence of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia in Italy.

Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 both overall and in the 65–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 19% in the 75–84 group and to 42% in the greater than 84 group.<ref>2000 U.S. estimates:

These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important [[social issue|social problem]]. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as [[nursing home care]], direct nonmedical costs such as in-home [[day care]], and indirect costs such as lost [[productivity]] of both patient and caregiver.<ref name="pmid9543467"/> Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160&nbsp;billion,<ref name="pmid16401889">{{vcite journal | author = Wimo A, Jonsson L, Winblad B | title = An Estimate of the Worldwide Prevalence and Direct Costs of Dementia in 2003 | journal = Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–81 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16401889 | doi = 10.1159/000090733 }}</ref> while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100&nbsp;billion each year.<ref name="pmid9543467"/>

It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.<ref name="pmid18445747">{{vcite journal | author = O'Brien JT | title = Role of Imaging Techniques in the Diagnosis of Dementia | journal = The British Journal of Radiology | volume = 80 | issue = Spec No 2 | pages = S71–7 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18445747 | doi = 10.1259/bjr/33117326 }}</ref>

In 2011 An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of [[18F-AV-45|florbetapir]], which is currently used in an investigational study. The imaging agent can help to detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research before it can be made available commercially.<ref>{{vcite journal | author = Clark CM, Schneider JA, Bedell BJ, et al | title = FDA Recommends Approval of New Compound in Alzheimer's Detection | journal = JAMA | volume = 305 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–83 | date = 19 January 2011 | pmid = 21245183 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.2008 | laysource = http://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/medical/alzheimers/2011-01-22-alzheimersfda21_ST_N.htm }}</ref>
