'''Indigenous Australians''' are the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] people of [[Australia]], descended from groups that existed in Australia and surrounding islands prior to European colonisation. The earliest definite human remains found in Australia are those of [[Mungo Man]], which have been dated at about 40,000 years old,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitmungo.com.au/how-old-are-they|title=Mungo Lady and Mungo Man {{!}} Share Mungo Culture {{!}} Visit Mungo National Park|last=design@grafx.com.au|first=Richard Czeiger:|website=www.visitmungo.com.au|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref> although the time of arrival of the first Indigenous Australians is a matter of debate among researchers, with estimates dating back as far as 125,000 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bindon|first=P.

There is great diversity among different Indigenous communities and societies in Australia, each with its own mixture of cultures, customs and languages. In present-day Australia these groups are further divided into local communities.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hodge, Robert |url=http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/3.2/Hodge.html |title=Aboriginal truth and white media: Eric Michaels meets the spirit of Aboriginalism|journal=The Australian Journal of Media & Culture|volume=  3|issue=3|year= 1990}}</ref> At the time of initial European settlement, over 250 languages were spoken; it is currently estimated that 120 to 145 of these remain in use, and all but 13 are considered to be endangered.<ref name=ABS/><ref name="aiatsis.gov.au">[http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/community-identity-wellbeing-report-second-national-indigenous-languages "Community, identity, wellbeing: The report of the Second National Indigenous Languages Survey" ''AIATSIS''], 2014.

===Terminology===
[[File:Bathurst Island men.jpg|thumb|right|Men from [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]], 1939]]
Though Indigenous Australians are seen as being broadly related as part of what has been called the [[Australoid race]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Huxley, Thomas |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/SM3/GeoDis.html|year=1870|title= On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind|journal=Journal of the Ethnological Society of London}}</ref> there are significant differences in social, cultural and linguistic customs between the various Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups.

The word [[wikt:aboriginal|aboriginal]] has been in the English language since at least the 16th century, to mean, "first or earliest known, indigenous". It comes from the Latin word ''aborigines'', derived from ''ab'' (from) and ''origo'' (origin, beginning).<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aborigine Aborigine – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (31 August 2012). Retrieved 2 August 2013.</ref> The word was used in Australia to describe its [[indigenous peoples]] as early as 1789. It soon became capitalised and employed as the common name to refer to all Indigenous Australians.

Strictly speaking, ''Aborigine'' is the noun and ''Aboriginal'' the adjectival form; however, the latter is often also employed as a noun. Use of either ''Aborigine(s) ''or ''Aboriginal(s)'' to refer to individuals has acquired negative connotations in some sectors of the community, and it is generally regarded as insensitive and even offensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/aboriginal/Publications/pub-terminology.pdf |title=Communicating Positively: A guide to appropriate Aboriginal terminology |publisher=NSW Health |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/dead_reckoning/private_archives/a-f/aboriginal_people|title = Dead Reckoning: a guide to family history research in WA: Aboriginal People|publisher = State Library of Western Australia|accessdate = 3 August 2013}}</ref> The more acceptable and correct expression is ''Aboriginal Australians'' or ''Aboriginal people.'' The term ''Indigenous Australians'', which also includes Torres Strait Islander peoples, has found increasing acceptance, particularly since the 1980s.<ref name=terminology-flinders>{{cite web|title=Appropriate Terminology, Indigenous Australian Peoples|url=http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/documents/community/appropriate_indigenous_terminoloy.pdf|work=General Information Folio 5|publisher=Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia|accessdate=10 May 2011|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Regional groups===

{{Main|List of Indigenous Australian group names}}
The broad term Aboriginal Australians includes many regional groups that often identify under names from local Indigenous languages. These include:
[[File:Men and boys playing a game of gorri - NMA-11726.jpg|thumb|Men and boys playing a game of [[gorri]], 1922]]
* [[Koori]] (or Koorie) in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] ([[Victorian Aborigines]]);
* [[Ngunnawal people|Ngunnawal]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and surrounding areas of New South Wales;
* Goorie in South East Queensland and some parts of northern New South Wales; 
* [[Murrdi]] in Southwest and Central Queensland;
* [[Murri (people)|Murri]] in other parts of Queensland where specific collective names (such as Gorrie or Murrdi) are not used;
* [[Nyungar]] in southern Western Australia;
* [[Yamatji]] in central Western Australia;
* [[Wangai]] in the Western Australian [[gold mining|Goldfields]];
* [[Nunga]] in southern South Australia;
* [[Anangu]] in northern South Australia, and neighbouring parts of Western Australia and [[Northern Territory]];
* [[Yapa]] in western central Northern Territory;
* [[Yolngu]] in eastern [[Arnhem Land]] (NT);
* [[Bininj]] in Western [[Arnhem Land]] (NT);
* [[Tiwi people|Tiwi]] on [[Tiwi Islands]] off [[Arnhem Land]].
* [[Enindhilyagwa language|Anindilyakwa]] on [[Groote Eylandt]] off [[Arnhem Land]];
* [[Palawah]] (or ''Pallawah'') in [[Tasmania]].
These larger groups may be further subdivided; for example, Anangu (meaning a person from Australia's central desert region) recognises localised subdivisions such as [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]], [[Yankunytjatjara]], [[Ngaanyatjarra]], [[Luritja]] and [[Antikirinya]]. It is estimated that prior to the arrival of British settlers, the population of Indigenous Australians was approximately 318,000–750,000 across the continent.<ref name="pop_abs" />

===Torres Strait Islanders===
[[File:TorresStraitIslandsMap.png|thumb|Map of [[Torres Strait Islands]]]]

{{Main|Torres Strait Islanders}}
The Torres Strait Islanders possess a heritage and cultural history distinct from Aboriginal traditions. The eastern Torres Strait Islanders in particular are related to the Papuan peoples of [[New Guinea]], and speak a [[Papuan language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ulk |title=Ethnologue report for language code: ulk |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=9 August 2009}}</ref> Accordingly, they are not generally included under the designation "Aboriginal Australians". This has been another factor in the promotion of the more inclusive term "Indigenous Australians". Six percent of Indigenous Australians identify themselves fully as [[Torres Strait]] Islanders. A further 4% of Indigenous Australians identify themselves as having both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal heritage.<ref name="ATSI population">''[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/1301.0Feature%20Article52004?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=1301.0&issue=2004&num=&view= Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population]'', Australian Bureau of Statistics 2004. Retrieved 21 June 2007.</ref>

The [[Torres Strait Islands]] comprise over 100 islands<ref name="TSI">''[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/pacific/places/country/torres_strait_islands.htm Places – Torres Strait Islands]'' [[ABC Radio (Australia)|ABC Radio Australia website]], 2005. Retrieved 21 June 2007.</ref> which were annexed by Queensland in 1879.<ref name="TSI"/> Many Indigenous organisations incorporate the phrase "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander" to highlight the distinctiveness and importance of Torres Strait Islanders in Australia's Indigenous population.

[[Eddie Mabo]] was from "Mer" or [[Murray Island, Queensland|Murray Island]] in the Torres Strait, which the famous [[Mabo v Queensland|Mabo decision]] of 1992 involved.<ref name="TSI"/>

===Black===
The term "blacks" has been used to refer to Indigenous Australians since European settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/4219798 |title=08 Nov 1828 – Classified Advertising |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> While originally related to [[skin colour]], the term is used today to indicate Aboriginal heritage or culture in general and refers to people of any skin pigmentation.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dylan Bird |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/aboriginal-identity-goes-beyond-skin-colour-20110406-1d40r.html |title=Andrew Bolt On Trial On Racism Charges |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> In the 1970s, many Aboriginal activists, such as [[Gary Foley]], proudly embraced the term "black", and writer [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]]'s ground-breaking book from the time was entitled ''Living Black''. The book included interviews with several members of the Aboriginal community including [[Robert Jabanungga]] reflecting on contemporary Aboriginal culture. A less formal term, used by Indigenous Australians themselves and not normally derogatory, is "[[blackfella]]s", along with "whitefellas".

===Before European contact===
Aboriginal people mainly lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s, hunting and foraging for food from the land. Although Aboriginal society was generally mobile, or [[nomadic|semi-nomadic]], moving according to the changing food availability found across different areas as seasons changed, the mode of life and material cultures varied greatly from region to region, and there were permanent settlements<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/budj-bim/|title = National Heritage Places – Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape|publisher = Australian Government Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities|accessdate = 13 August 2013}}</ref> and agriculture<ref>Flood, Josephine (1984), "Archaeology of the Dreamtime" (Uni of Hawaii Press)</ref> in some areas. The greatest population density was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, the [[River Murray]] valley in particular.

There is evidence that some Aboriginal populations in northern Australia regularly [[Makassan contact with Australia|traded]] with [[Makassar|Makassan]] fishermen from Indonesia before the arrival of Europeans.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/j.1834-4453.1986.tb00126.x| title = Macassans and the Aboriginal past| journal = Archaeology in Oceania| volume = 21| pages = 69–75| year = 1986| last1 = MacKnight | first1 = C.

At the time of first European contact, it is generally estimated that the pre-1788 population was 314,000, while recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 500,000 to 750,000 could have been sustained, with some [[ecology|ecologists]] estimating a population of up to a million people was possible.<ref name="pop_abs" /><ref name="NCCARF">[http://web.archive.org/web/20131113121606/http://www.nccarf.edu.au/wwwold/settlements-infrastructure/sites/www.nccarf.edu.au.settlements-infrastructure/files/file/ACCARNSI%20Node%202%20Discussion%20Paper%20-%20Population%20Distribution%20Migration%20and%20Climate%20Change%20in%20Australia%20%20Final.pdf ''Population Distribution, Migration and Climate Change in Australia: An Exploration''].

All evidence suggests that the section of the Australian continent now occupied by Queensland was the single most densely populated area of pre-contact Australia.

The evidence based on two independent sources thus suggests that the territory of Queensland had a pre-contact Indigenous population density twice that of New South Wales, at least six times that of Victoria and more than twenty times that of Tasmania. Equally, there are signs that the population density of Indigenous Australia was comparatively higher in the north-eastern sections of New South Wales, and along the northern coast from the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] and westward including certain sections of Northern Territory and Western Australia.

British colonisation of Australia began with the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in [[Botany Bay]] in 1788.

One immediate consequence of British settlement was a series of European epidemic diseases such as [[measles]], [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. In the 19th century, smallpox was the principal cause of Aboriginal deaths.<ref>{{Cite book

Another consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources, which continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries as rural lands were converted for sheep and cattle grazing. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the 1860s, [[Tasmanian Aboriginal]] skulls were particularly sought internationally for studies into [[craniofacial anthropometry]]. [[Truganini]], a Tasmanian Aboriginal, had her skeleton exhumed within two years of her death in 1876 by the [[Royal Society of Tasmania]], and later placed on display. Campaigns continue to have Aboriginal body parts returned to Australia for burial; Truganini's body was returned in 1976, cremated and her ashes scattered according to her wishes.<!--in her article linked above-->

Although, as British subjects, all Indigenous Australians were nominally entitled to vote, generally only those who merged into mainstream society did so. Only Western Australia and Queensland specifically excluded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from the electoral rolls.  Despite the [[Commonwealth Franchise Act]] of 1902 that excluded "Aboriginal natives of Australia, Asia, Africa and Pacific Islands except New Zealand" from voting unless they were on the roll before 1901, South Australia insisted that all voters enfranchised within its borders would remain eligible to vote in the Commonwealth, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people continued to be added to their rolls, albeit haphazardly.<ref name="Hughes"/>

In the [[Australian federal election, 2010|general election of 2010]], [[Ken Wyatt]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] became the first indigenous Australian elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]].

In 2010 the federal government appointed a panel comprising Indigenous leaders, other legal experts and some members of parliament (including Ken Wyatt) to provide advice on how best to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the federal constitution. The panel issued a discussion paper and launched a website, under the heading "You Me Unity". These invited submissions and participation in consultation sessions. More than 3,500 submissions were received and more than 200 public consultations and other meetings were held, including meetings in remote communities. An interim communiqué in December 2010 indicated majority support for constitutional recognition and for removing the sections of the federal constitution that permit discrimination on the basis of race. The panel provided the final report to the federal government in January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youmeunity.org.au/uploads/assets/html-report/index.html|title=Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution: Report of the Expert Panel|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=January 2012|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> The panel made a number of recommendations for constitutional reform. The recommendations included the deletion of [[Section 25 of the Constitution of Australia]], which permits any State to disqualify "persons of any race" from voting (and excluding those people when "reckoning the number of the people") and [[Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution|Section 51(xxvi)]], which empowers the federal parliament to make special laws for people of any particular race. The repeal of these sections would remove the word "race" from the [[Constitution of Australia]] entirely. It was also recommended that three new sections be included: sections 51A, 116A and 127A to ensure meaningful recognition and further protection from discrimination.

The policy intends to address key issues that exist within Aboriginal communities of the [[Northern Territory]] such as unemployment, school attendance and enrolment, alcohol abuse, community safety and child protection, food security and housing and land reforms. The policy has been criticised by organisations such as [[Amnesty International]] and Concerned Citizens of Australia. The Stand for Freedom campaign leads the public movement against this legislation and criticises many measures of the legislation since they maintain "racially-discriminatory" elements of the [[Northern Territory Emergency Response|Northern Territory Emergency Response Act]] and continue control of the [[Australian Government]] over "Aboriginal people and their lands".<ref name=SFF>{{cite web|title=About- Stand for Freedom|url=http://standforfreedom.org.au/about/|publisher=Our Generation|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Stand for Freedom|year=2012}}</ref> However, several prominent members of the [[Australian Government]] continue to voice support for the Stronger Futures policy.

[[File:1981 event Australian aboriginals.jpg|thumb|Aboriginal dancers in 1981]]
There are a large number of [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|tribal divisions]] and [[Australian Aboriginal language|language groups]] in Aboriginal Australia, and, correspondingly, a wide variety of diversity exists within cultural practices. However, there are some similarities between cultures.

===Languages===
{{Main|Australian Aboriginal English|Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian Aboriginal sign languages}}
According to the 2005 National Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS), at the time the Australian continent was colonised, there were around 250 different Indigenous languages, with the larger language groups each having up to 100 related dialects. Some of these languages were only ever spoken by perhaps 50 to 100 people. Indigenous languages are divided into language groups with from ten to twenty-four language families identified.<ref name=ABS>{{cite web|title=LANGUAGES OF ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER PEOPLES - A UNIQUELY AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/1301.0Feature%20Article42009%E2%80%9310?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=1301.0&issue=2009%9610&num=&view=|website=Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> It is currently estimated that up to 145 Indigenous languages remain in use, of which fewer than 20 are considered to be strong in the sense that they are still spoken by all age groups.<ref name=ABS/><ref>Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (26 August 2009) [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25980525-25192,00.html "Aboriginal languages deserve revival"], ''The Australian Higher Education''.</ref> All but 13 Indigenous languages are considered to be endangered.<ref name="aiatsis.gov.au"/> Several extinct Indigenous languages are being reconstructed. For example, the last fluent speaker of the [[Ngarrindjeri language]] died in the late 1960s; using recordings and written records as a guide, a Ngarrindjeri dictionary was published in 2009,<ref name=revival>''University of South Australia'', "Preserving Indigenous culture through language", 26 May 2015,[http://www.unisa.edu.au/news/2008/160508.asp] Accessed 15 January 2010.</ref> and the Ngarrindjeri language is today being spoken in complete sentences.<ref name=ABS/>

Linguists classify many of the mainland Australian languages into one large group, the [[Pama–Nyungan languages]]. The rest are sometimes lumped under the term "non-Pama–Nyungan". The Pama–Nyungan languages comprise the majority, covering most of Australia, and are generally thought to be a family of related languages. In the north, stretching from the Western [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]] to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], are found a number of non-Pama–Nyungan groups of languages which have not been shown to be related to the Pama–Nyungan family nor to each other.<ref>{{cite book|title = The non-Pama-Nyungan languages of northern Australia: comparative studies of the continent's most linguistically complex region|last = Evans|first = Nicholas|publisher = Australian National University|year = 2003|isbn = 9780858835382|location = Canberra Australia}}</ref>
While it has sometimes proven difficult to work out familial relationships within the Pama–Nyungan language family, many Australian linguists feel there has been substantial success.<ref>Bowern, Claire and Harold Koch (eds.). 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CUhQfoMARvgC&printsec=frontcover Australian Languages: Classification and the comparative method]. John Benjamins, Sydney ISBN 90-272-4761-7</ref> Against this, some linguists, such as [[R. M. W. Dixon]], suggest that the Pama–Nyungan group – and indeed the entire Australian linguistic area – is rather a ''[[sprachbund]]'', or group of languages having very long and intimate contact, rather than a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] language family.<ref>Dixon, R. M. W. (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qsyudSYieaQC&printsec=frontcover The Rise and Fall of Languages]. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-62654-4</ref>

It has been suggested that, given their long presence in Australia, Aboriginal languages form one specific sub-grouping. The position of Tasmanian languages is unknown, and it is also unknown whether they comprised one or more than one specific language family.

Aboriginal people traditionally adhered to [[animist]] spiritual frameworks. Within Aboriginal belief systems, a formative epoch known as 'the [[Dreamtime]]' stretches back into the distant past when the creator ancestors known as the [[First Peoples]] travelled across the land, creating and naming as they went.<ref>Andrews, M. (2004) ''The Seven Sisters'', Spinifex Press, North Melbourne. ISBN 1876756454. p. 424</ref> Indigenous Australia's [[oral tradition]] and religious values are based upon reverence for the land and a belief in this [[Dreamtime]].

The Dreaming is at once both the ancient time of creation and the present-day reality of Dreaming. There were a great many different groups, each with its own individual culture, belief structure, and language. These cultures overlapped to a greater or lesser extent, and evolved over time. Major [[ancestral]] spirits include the [[Rainbow Serpent]], [[Baiame]], [[Dirawong]] and [[Bunjil]].

Traditional healers (known as ''Ngangkari'' in the [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western desert]] areas of [[Central Australia]]) were highly respected men and women who not only acted as healers or doctors, but were generally also custodians of important [[Dreamtime]] stories.<ref>''Traditional Healers of Central Australia: Ngangkari''.

The various Indigenous Australian communities developed unique musical instruments and folk styles. The [[didgeridoo]], which is widely thought to be a stereotypical instrument of Aboriginal people, was traditionally played by people of only the eastern [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region and [[Arnhem Land]] (such as the Yolngu), and then by only the men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalarts.co.uk/historyofthedidgeridoo.html |title=History of the Didgeridoo Yidaki |publisher=Aboriginalarts.co.uk |accessdate=9 August 2009}}</ref>

These designs generally carry significance linked to the spirituality of the [[Dreamtime]].<ref name=art/> Paintings were usually created in earthy colours, from paint made from ochre. Such ochres were also used to paint their bodies for ceremonial purposes.

Modern Aboriginal artists continue the tradition, using modern materials in their artworks. Several styles of Aboriginal art have developed in modern times, including the watercolour paintings of the [[Hermannsburg School]], and the acrylic [[Papunya Tula]] "dot art" movement. [[William Barak]] (c.1824–1903) was one of the last traditionally educated of the [[Wurundjeri]]-willam, people who come from the district now incorporating the city of Melbourne. He remains notable for his artworks which recorded traditional Aboriginal ways for the education of Westerners (which remain on permanent exhibition at the [[Ian Potter Centre]] of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and at the [[Ballarat Fine Art Gallery]]. [[Margaret Preston]] (1875–1963) was among the early non-indigenous painters to incorporate Aboriginal influences in her works. [[Albert Namatjira]] (1902–1959) is one of the most famous Australian artists and an [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] man. His landscapes inspired the [[Hermannsburg School]] of art. The works of [[Elizabeth Durack]] are notable for their fusion of Western and indigenous influences. Since the 1970s, indigenous artists have employed the use of acrylic paints – with styles such as that of the [[Western Desert Art Movement]] becoming globally renowned 20th-century art movements.

The [[National Gallery of Australia]] exhibits a great many indigenous art works, including those of the [[Torres Strait Islands]] who are known for their traditional sculpture and headgear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/ATSIArt/Index.cfm |title=National Gallery of Australia |publisher=Nga.gov.au |accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref>

By 1788, Indigenous Australians had not developed a system of writing{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, so the first literary accounts of Aborigines come from the journals of early European explorers, which contain descriptions of first contact, both violent and friendly. Early accounts by Dutch explorers and the English buccaneer [[William Dampier]] wrote of the "natives of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]" as being "barbarous savages", but by the time of Captain [[James Cook]] and [[First Fleet]] marine [[Watkin Tench]] (the era of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), accounts of Aborigines were more sympathetic and romantic: "these people may truly be said to be in the pure state of nature, and may appear to some to be the most wretched upon the earth; but in reality they are far happier than ... we Europeans", wrote Cook in his journal on 23 August 1770.

Letters written by early Aboriginal leaders like [[Bennelong]] and Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] are retained as treasures of Australian literature, as is the historic [[Yirrkala bark petitions]] of 1963 which is the first traditional Aboriginal document recognised by the [[Australian Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=104 |title=Documenting Democracy |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> [[David Unaipon]] (1872–1967) is credited as providing the first accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by an Aboriginal: ''[[Legendary Tales of the Aborigines]]''; he is known as the first Aboriginal author.

Though lost to history, many traditional forms of recreation were played and while these varied from tribe to tribe, there were often similarities. Ball games were quite popular and played by tribes across Australia, as were games based on use of weapons. There is extensive documented evidence of traditional football games being played. Perhaps the most documented is a game popularly played by tribes in western [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]n regions of the [[Wimmera]], [[Mallee (Victoria)|Mallee]] and [[Millewa]] by the [[Djab wurrung]], [[Jardwadjali]] and [[Jarijari]] people. Known as [[Marn Grook]], it was a type of kick and catch football game played with a ball made of possum hide, the existence of which was corroborated in accounts from European eyewitnesses and depicted in illustration.<ref>[http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/21/2039577.htm?section=australia Kids play "kick to kick" −1850s style] from abc.net.au</ref> According to some accounts, it was played as far away as the [[Yarra Valley]] by the [[Wurundjeri]] people,<ref>Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, pp45 People of the Merri Merri.

A team of Aboriginal cricketers [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|toured England in 1868]], making it the first Australian sports team to travel overseas. Cricketer and Australian rules football pioneer [[Tom Wills]] coached the team in an Aboriginal language he learnt as a child, and [[Charles Lawrence (cricketer)|Charles Lawrence]] accompanied them to England. [[Johnny Mullagh]], the team's star player, was regarded as one of the era's finest batsmen.

===Technology===
{{further|Australian Aboriginal fibrecraft}}
Technology used by indigenous Australian societies before European contact included weapons, tools, shelters, watercraft, and the [[message stick]].  Weapons included [[boomerang]]s, spears (sometimes thrown with a [[woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]]) with stone or fishbone tips, clubs, and (less commonly) axes.  The [[stone age]] tools available included knives with ground edges, grinding devices, and eating containers.  Fibre nets, baskets, and bags were used for fishing, hunting, and carrying liquids.  Trade networks spanned the continent, and transportation included [[canoe]]s.  Shelters varied regionally, and included [[wiltja]]s in the [[Atherton Tablelands]], [[paperbark]] and [[stringybark]] sheets and raised platforms in [[Arnhem Land]], whalebone [[hut]]s in what is now South Australia, stone shelters in what is now western Victoria, and a multi-room pole and bark structure found in [[Corranderrk]].<ref>http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-indigenous-tools-and-technology/</ref>  A bark tent or lean-to is known as a [[humpy]], gunyah, or wurley.

Clothing included the [[possum-skin cloak]] in the southeast and [[riji]] (pearl shells) in the northeast.

==Population==

=== Definition ===
Over time Australia has used various means to determine membership of ethnic groups such as [[Lineage (genetic)|lineage]], [[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]], birth and [[self-determination]]. From 1869 until well into the 1970s, Indigenous children under 12 years of age, with 25% or less Aboriginal blood were considered "white" and were often [[Stolen generations|removed from their families]] by the Australian [[Australian government|Federal]] and [[Australian states and territories|State]] government agencies and [[Mission (Christian)|church missions]], under [[act of parliament|acts]] of their respective parliaments in order that they would have "a reasonable chance of absorption into the white community to which they rightly belong".<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Aboriginals and Half-Castes of Central Australia and North Australia.|last = Bleakley|first = John William|publisher = Government Printer.|year = 1929|location = Melbourne|pages = 17|url = http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/doview/nla.aus-vn4969615-p.pdf}}</ref> Grey areas in determination of ethnicity led to people of mixed ancestry being caught in the middle of divisive policies which often led to absurd situations:<ref name="Spencer">{{cite book | last = Spencer | first = Stephen | year = 2006 | title = Race And Ethnicity: Culture, identity and representation | publisher = Routledge | location = Pg 33–34| isbn = 1-134-26639-1 }}</ref><blockquote>In 1935, an Australian of part Indigenous descent left his home on a reserve to visit a nearby hotel where he was ejected for being Aboriginal.

He then walked to the next town where he was arrested for being an Aboriginal vagrant and sent to the reserve there. During [[World War II]] he tried to enlist but was rejected because he was an Aborigine so he moved to another state where he enlisted as a non-Aborigine. After the end of the war he applied for a [[passport]] but was rejected as he was an Aborigine, he obtained an exemption under the Aborigines Protection Act but was now told he could no longer visit his relatives as he was not an Aborigine. He was later told he could not join the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Servicemens Club]] because he was an Aborigine.<ref name="Spencer"/></blockquote>

In 1983 the [[High Court of Australia]]<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/21.html?query=title(Commonwealth%20%20and%20.%20Tasmania%201983) Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983, HCA 21; (1983) 158 CLR 1 (1 July 1983)].</ref> defined an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander as "a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives".

The ruling was a three-part definition comprising descent, self-identification and community identification. The first part – descent – was genetic descent and unambiguous, but led to cases where a lack of records to prove ancestry excluded some. Self- and community identification were more problematic as they meant that an Indigenous person separated from her or his community due to a family dispute could no longer identify as Aboriginal.

As a result, there arose court cases throughout the 1990s where excluded people demanded that their Aboriginality be recognised. In 1995, Justice Drummond ruled "..either genuine self-identification as Aboriginal alone or Aboriginal communal recognition as such by itself may suffice, according to the circumstances." This contributed to an increase of 31% in the number of people identifying as Indigenous Australians in the 1996 census when compared to the 1991 census.<ref name=" Bourke ">{{cite web | last = Greg Gardiner | first = Eleanor Bourke: | year = 2002 | title = Indigenous Populations, Mixed Discourses and Identities pdf | work=People and Place Volume 8 No 2 [[Monash University]] | url = http://elecpress.monash.edu.au/pnp/free/pnpv8n2/v8n2_5gardiner.pdf | accessdate =16 December 2009 }}</ref>

Judge Merkel in 1998 defined Aboriginal descent as technical rather than real – thereby eliminating a genetic requirement. This decision established that anyone can classify him or herself legally as an Aboriginal, provided he or she is accepted as such by his or her community.<ref>[http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/36-kinship-and-identity/legal-definitions-aboriginality "Legal definitions of Aboriginality | ALRC"]. alrc.gov.au.</ref>

As there is no formal procedure for any community to record acceptance, the primary method of determining Indigenous population is from self-identification on census forms.

Until 1967, official Australian population statistics excluded "full-blood aboriginal natives" in accordance with section 127 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], even though many such people were actually counted. The size of the excluded population was generally separately estimated. "Half-caste aboriginal natives" were shown separately up to the 1966 census, but since 1971 there has been no provision on the forms to differentiate 'full' from 'part' Indigenous or to identify non-Indigenous persons who are accepted by Indigenous communities but have no genetic descent.<ref name="Gardiner-Garden">{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/LIBRARY/pubs/rn/2000-01/01RN18.htm |title=The Definition of Aboriginality |accessdate=5 February 2008 |author=John Gardiner-Garden |work=Parliamentary Library |publisher=Parliament of Australia |date=5 October 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207071332/http://www.aph.gov.au/LIBRARY/pubs/rn/2000-01/01RN18.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 }}</ref>

In the recent 2011 Census, there was 20% rise in people who identify as Aboriginal. One explanation for this is: "the definition being the way it is, it's quite elastic. You can find out that your great-great grandmother was Aboriginal and therefore under that definition you can identify. It's that person's right to identify so [...] that's what explains the large increase."<ref>[http://www.sbs.com.au/insight/episode/transcript/490/Aboriginal-or-not "Aboriginal or not"].

====State distribution and identification growth rate====
The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] 2005 census of [[Demographics of Australia|Australian demographics]] showed that the Indigenous population had grown at twice the rate of the overall population since 1996 when the Indigenous population stood at 283,000. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the total resident Indigenous population to be 458,520 in June 2001 (2.4% of Australia's total), 90% of whom identified as Aboriginal, 6% Torres Strait Islander and the remaining 4% being of dual Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parentage. Much of the increase since 1996 can be attributed to greater numbers of people identifying themselves as Aboriginal or of Aboriginal descent. Changed definitions of Aboriginality and positive discrimination via material benefits have been cited as contributing to a movement to indigenous identification.<ref name="Hughes">{{cite web | last = Hughes | first = Helen | date = November 2008 | title = Who Are Indigenous Australians? | work=[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]] | url = https://www.quadrant.org.au/magazine/issue/2008/451/who-are-indigenous-australians | accessdate =16 December 2009 }}</ref>

In the 2006 Census, 407,700 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 29,512 declared they were [[Torres Strait Islander]], and a further 17,811 declared they were both Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/a0dbf953e41d83d3ca257306000d514b!OpenDocument |title=2914.0.55.002–2006 Census of Population and Housing: Media Releases and Fact Sheets, 2006 |publisher=Abs.gov.au |accessdate=12 October 2009}}</ref> After adjustments for undercount, the indigenous population at the end of June 2006 was estimated to be 517,200, representing about 2.5% of the population.<ref name=ABS2008YBindigenous>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/68AE74ED632E17A6CA2573D200110075?opendocument|title=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2008|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009}}</ref>

Based on Census data at 30 June 2006, the preliminary estimate of Indigenous resident population of Australia <!-- This isn't quite the same as the Census figure itself – estimated population includes an adjustment for undercount, and because the reference date is about a month before the actual Census date --> was 517,200, broken down as follows:
* [[New South Wales]] – 148,200
* [[Queensland]] – 146,400
* [[Western Australia]] – 77,900
* [[Northern Territory]] – 66,600
* [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] – 30,800
* [[South Australia]] – 26,000
* [[Tasmania]] – 16,900
* [[Australian Capital Territory]] – 4,000

The state with the largest total Indigenous population is New South Wales. Indigenous Australians constitute 2.2% of the overall population of the State. The [[Northern Territory]] has the largest Indigenous population in percentage terms for a State or Territory, with 31.6% of the population being Indigenous.

In all of the other states and territories, less than 4% of their total population identifies as Indigenous; Victoria has the lowest percentage at 0.6%.<ref name="ausstats.abs.gov.au"/>

====Urbanisation rate====
In 2006 about 31% of the Indigenous population was living in 'major cities' (as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics/Australian Standard Geographical Classification) and another 45% in 'regional Australia', with the remaining 24% in remote areas. The populations in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales are more likely to be urbanised.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4705.0Main+Features12006?OpenDocument Population Distribution, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians], Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006.</ref>

==Groups and communities==
{{Main|List of Indigenous Australian group names|Australian Aboriginal kinship|Australian Aboriginal language}}
[[File:Aboriginal farmers at Franklinford 1858.jpg|thumb|left|Aboriginal farmers in Victoria, 1858]]
Throughout the history of the continent, there have been many different [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Aboriginal groups]], each with its own individual [[Australian Aboriginal languages|language]], culture, and belief structure.
At the time of British settlement, there were over 200 distinct languages.<!-- TRANSLATION PLEASE: (in the technical linguistic sense of non-mutually intelligible speech varieties) --><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/43873/Australian-Aboriginal-languages Australian Aboriginal languages]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''</ref>

There are an indeterminate number of Indigenous communities, comprising several hundred groupings. Some communities, cultures or groups may be inclusive of others and alter or overlap; significant changes have occurred in the generations after colonisation.

The word "community" is often used to describe groups identifying by kinship, language or belonging to a particular place or "country". A community may draw on separate cultural values and individuals can conceivably belong to a number of communities within Australia; identification within them may be adopted or rejected.

An individual community may identify itself by many names, each of which can have alternate English spellings. The largest Aboriginal communities – the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]], the [[Luritja]] and the [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] – are all from Central Australia.

Indigenous "communities" in remote Australia are typically small, isolated towns with basic facilities, on traditionally owned land. These communities have between 20 – 300 inhabitants and are often closed to outsiders for cultural reasons. The long term viability and resilience of Indigenous communities has been debated by scholars<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1071/RJ07048| title = The 'viability' and resilience of communities and settlements in desert Australia| journal = The Rangeland Journal| volume = 30| pages = 123| year = 2008| last1 = Smith | first1 = M.

A woman named Trugernanner (often rendered as [[Truganini]]) who died in 1876, was, and still is, widely believed to be the very last of the full-blooded Aborigines.

===Identity===
Who has the right to identify as indigenous has become an issue of controversy. The prominent Aboriginal activist [[Noel Pearson]] has stated: "The essence of indigeneity … is that people have a connection with their ancestors whose bones are in the soil. Whose dust is part of the sand. I had to come to the somewhat uncomfortable conclusion that even Andrew Bolt was becoming Indigenous because the bones of his ancestors are now becoming part of the territory."<ref>Seed, Daniel ''Live: Woodford Folk Festival 2015/16: Fire event and New Year's Day: News: Noel Pearson says Andrew Bolt 'becoming Indigenous''', Brisbane Times, 1:28pm on 1 Jan 2016;http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/live-woodford-folk-festival-201516-fire-event-and-new-years-day-20160101-glxrx2.html</ref>

Under Section 41 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], Aboriginal Australians always had the legal right to vote in Australian Commonwealth elections if their State granted them that right. This meant that all Aboriginal peoples outside Queensland and Western Australia had a legal right to vote. The right of Indigenous ex-servicemen to vote was affirmed in 1949 and all Indigenous Australians gained the unqualified right to vote in Federal elections in 1962.<ref name="aec.gov.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> Unlike other Australians, however, voting was not made compulsory for Indigenous people.

It was not until the repeal of Section 127 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] in 1967 that Indigenous Australians were counted in the population for the purposes of distribution of electoral seats. Only four Indigenous Australians have been elected to the [[Australian Senate]]: [[Neville Bonner]] (Liberal, 1971–1983), [[Aden Ridgeway]] (Democrat, 1999–2005), [[Nova Peris]] and [[Jacqui Lambie]] (both 2014–''incumbent''). Following the [[2010 Australian Federal Election]], [[Ken Wyatt]] of the Liberal Party won the Western Australian seat of Hasluck, becoming the first Indigenous person elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]].<ref>[http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7842012/wyatt-claims-victory-in-hasluck/ The West Australian].

A number of [[List of Indigenous Australian politicians|Indigenous people represent electorates at State and Territorial level]] and South Australia has had an Aboriginal Governor, Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]]. The first Indigenous Australian to serve as a minister in any government was [[Ernie Bridge]], who entered the Western Australian Parliament in 1980. [[Carol Martin (politician)|Carol Martin]] was the first Aboriginal woman elected to an Australian parliament (the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]) in 2001, and the first woman minister was [[Marion Scrymgour]], who was appointed to the Northern Territory ministry in 2002 (she became Deputy Chief Minister in 2008).<ref name="aec.gov.au"/>  Representation in the Northern Territory has been relatively high, reflecting the high proportion of Aboriginal voters. The 2012 Territory election saw large swings to the conservative [[Country Liberal Party]] achieved in remote Territory electorates and a total of five Aboriginal CLP candidates won election to the Assembly (along with one Labor candidate) in a chamber of 25 members. Among those elected for the CLP were high profile activists [[Bess Price]] and [[Alison Anderson]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/indigenous-vote-decided-outcome-in-the-territory/story-e6frgd0x-1226479040753 | work=The Australian | title=Indigenous vote decided outcome in the Territory | date=22 September 2012}}</ref>

The [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), a representative body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, was set up in 1990 under the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] government. In 2004, the [[Howard government]] disbanded ATSIC and replaced it with an appointed network of 30 Indigenous Coordination Centres that administer Shared Responsibility Agreements and Regional Partnership Agreements with Aboriginal communities at a local level.<ref name="rcc">{{cite web|url=http://www.oipc.gov.au/About_OIPC/Indigenous_Affairs_Arrangements/4Administration.asp |title=Coordination and engagement at regional and national levels |accessdate=17 May 2006 |work=Administration |publisher=Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220100654/http://www.oipc.gov.au/About_OIPC/Indigenous_Affairs_Arrangements/4Administration.asp |archivedate=20 February 2008 }}</ref>

In October 2007, just prior to the calling of a [[Australian general election, 2007|federal election]], the then Prime Minister, John Howard, revisited the idea of bringing a referendum to seek recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Constitution (his government first sought to include recognition of Aboriginal peoples in the Preamble to the Constitution in a 1999 referendum). His 2007 announcement was seen by some as a surprising adoption of the importance of the symbolic aspects of the reconciliation process, and reaction was mixed. The ALP initially supported the idea, however [[Kevin Rudd]] withdrew this support just prior to the election – earning stern rebuke from activist [[Noel Pearson (Australian lawyer)|Noel Pearson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22809264-601,00.html |title=Noel Pearson's statement on Kevin Rudd , The Australian |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2009}}</ref> Critical sections of the Australian public and media<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=3581 |title=Eurekastreet.com.au |publisher=Eurekastreet.com.au |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> meanwhile suggested that Howard's raising of the issue was a "cynical" attempt in the lead-up to an election to "whitewash" his handling of this issue during his term in office. David Ross of the Central Land Council was sceptical, saying "it's a new skin for an old snake",<ref>(ABC Television News 12 October 2007)</ref> while former Chairman of the Reconciliation Council [[Patrick Dodson]] gave qualified support, saying: "I think it's a positive contribution to the process of national reconciliation...It's obviously got to be well discussed and considered and weighed, and it's got to be about meaningful and proper negotiations that can lead to the achievement of constitutional reconciliation."<ref>(ABC radio 12 October 2007)</ref> The [[Gillard Government]], with bi-partisan support, convened an expert panel to consider changes to the [[Australian Constitution]] that would see recognition for Indigenous Australians.

====Australian politicians of Indigenous ancestry====
Only [[List of Indigenous Australian politicians|32 people]] recognised to be of Indigenous Australian ancestry have been members of the ten Australian legislatures.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}{{when|date=November 2015}}

The [[Northern Territory]] has an exceptionally high Indigenous proportion{{snd}}about one third of its population{{snd}} and a greater rate of Indigenous politicians within the Northern Territory parliament. [[Adam Giles]], who became [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]] in 2013, is the first Indigenous head of government in Australia.

Major political parties in Australia have tried to increase the number of Indigenous representation within their parties. A suggestion for increasing the number of Indigenous representation has been the introduction of [[Reserved political positions|seat quotas]] like the [[Maori electorates]] in [[New Zealand]].

===Age characteristics===
The Indigenous population of Australia is much younger than the non-Indigenous population, with an estimated [[median age]] of 21 years (37 years for non-Indigenous), due to higher rates of birth and death.<ref name="h_and_w">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/39433889d406eeb9ca2570610019e9a5/D5D682247B842263CA25743900149BB7?opendocument|title=4704.0 – The Health and Welfare of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, 2008
|accessdate=8 January 2009|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|year=2008}}</ref> For this reason, [[age adjustment|age standardisation]] is often used when comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous statistics.<ref name="2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey" />

===Life expectancy===
The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is difficult to quantify accurately. Indigenous deaths are poorly identified, and the official figures for the size of the population at risk include large adjustment factors. Two estimates of Indigenous life expectancy in 2008 differed by as much as five years.<ref>'Death forms undermine promises', NIT 157, 10 July 2008</ref>

In some regions the median age at death was identified in 1973 to be as low as 47 years and the life expectancy gap between Aboriginal people and the rest of the Australian population as a whole, to be 25 years.

From 1996 to 2001, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) used indirect methods for its calculations, because census results were deemed to be unreliable.,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} and figures published in 2005 (59.4 years for males and 64.8 years for females) indicated a widely quoted gap of 17 years between indigenous and non-indigenous life expectancy, though the ABS does not now consider the 2005 figures to be reliable.

Using a new method based on tracing the deaths of people identified as Indigenous at the 2006 census, in 2009 the ABS estimated life expectancy at 67.2 years for Indigenous men (11.5 years less than for non-Indigenous) and 72.9 years for Indigenous women (9.7 years less than for non-Indigenous). Estimated life expectancy of Indigenous men ranges from 61.5 years for those living in the Northern Territory to a high of 69.9 years for those living in New South Wales, and for Indigenous women, 69.2 years for those living in the Northern Territory to a high of 75.0 years for those living in New South Wales.<ref>{{cite web|title=3302.0.55.003 – Experimental Life Tables for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, 2005–2007|url=http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyCatalogue/C65F4C150DD0497ACA2575BE002656BC?Opendocument|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=25 May 2009|accessdate=28 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24708205-601,00.html|title=Life gap figures not black and white|author=Lunn, Stephen |work=The Australian |date=26 November 2008|accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/indigenous-health-gap-closes-by-five-years-20090409-a27x.html|title=Indigenous health gap closes by five years|author=Joel Gibson|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=10 April 2009|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref><ref>Australian Indigenous Health Vol 9 No 2, April 2009 – June 2009 [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]</ref>

===Education===
Aboriginal students generally leave school earlier—and live with a lower standard of education—than their cohorts, although the situation is improving, with significant gains between 1994 and 2002.<ref name="2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey" />

* 39% of indigenous students stayed on to year 12 at high school, compared with 75% for the Australian population as a whole.<ref name="d2641">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/A03CAD8F1C3F813BCA256E7D00002641 |title=1370.0 – Measures of Australia's Progress, 2004 |publisher=Abs.gov.au |accessdate=12 October 2009}}</ref>
* 22% of indigenous adults had a vocational or higher education qualification, compared with 48% for the Australian population as a whole.<ref name="d2641"/>
* 4% of Indigenous Australians held a bachelor's degree or higher, compared with 21% for the population as a whole. This proportion is increasing, but at a slower rate than for the Australian population as a whole.<ref name="d2641"/>

The performance of indigenous students in national literacy and numeracy tests conducted in school years three, five, and seven is also inferior to that of their cohorts. The following table displays the performance of indigenous students against the general Australian student population as reported in the National Report on Schooling in Australia 2004.<ref name="National Report on Schooling in Australia 2004, Chapter 10 Indigenous education">{{cite web|url=http://cms.curriculum.edu.au/anr2004/ch10_literacy.htm |title=Chapter 10: Indigenous education |publisher=Cms.curriculum.edu.au |accessdate=9 August 2009}}</ref>

In response to this problem, the Commonwealth Government formulated a [[National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy]]. A number of government initiatives have resulted, some of which are listed at the Commonwealth Government's website.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20091223040305/http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/indigenous_education Indigenous Education]. dest.gov.au</ref>

The [[Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts]] was established as a training centre by the State and Federal Governments in 1997.

===Employment===
Indigenous Australians as a group generally experience high unemployment compared to the national average. This can be correlated to lower educational outcomes (ABS 2010).

In 2002, the average household income for Indigenous Australian adults (adjusted for household size and composition) was 60% of the non-Indigenous average.<ref name="2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey" />

Each of these indicators is expected to underestimate the true prevalence of disease in the population due to reduced levels of diagnosis.<ref name="The health and welfare of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 2003" />

In addition, the following factors have been at least partially implicated in the inequality in life expectancy:<ref name="The health and welfare of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 2003" />
* poverty
* insufficient education
* substance abuse<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/health/library/stories/2005/11/24/1831506.htm Petrol Sniffing – Health & Wellbeing]. abc.net.au</ref><ref>[http://www.nt.gov.au/health/healthdev/health_promotion/bushbook/volume2/chap1/petrol.htm Alcohol and Other Drugs – Petrol]. nt.gov.au</ref>
* for remote communities poor access to health services
* for urbanised Indigenous Australians, cultural pressures which prevent access to health services
* cultural differences resulting in poor communication between Indigenous Australians and health workers.

Successive Federal Governments have responded to these issues by implementing programs such as the [[Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health]] (OATSIH).

In 2007, the Northern Territory Government commissioned a study into sexual abuse crimes being committed on children in aboriginal communities. The study, Ampe Akelyernemane Meke Mekarle “Little Children are Sacred”, found that, children in Aboriginal communities were being widely exposed to inappropriate sexual activity such as pornography, adult films and adults having sex within their view. The report indicated that this exposure has likely  produced a number of effects, particularly the “sexualisation” of childhood and the creation of normalcy around sexual activity that may be used to engage children in sexual activity. This sexualisation of children and the wider community has led to a breakdown in traditional aboriginal law. Due to the nature of the issue, quantitative data was difficult to collect however a large amount of anecdotal evidence was relied upon which lead the author to the conclusion that issues such as rape and incest are widespread particularly within regional aboriginal communities however they are drastically under reported to local government or police.<ref>[http://www.inquirysaac.nt.gov.au/pdf/bipacsa_final_report.pdf Ampe Akelyernemane Meke Mekarle].

===Substance abuse===
{{Further|Indigenous health in Australia}}
[[File:kava.JPG|thumb|250px|A signpost outside [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]], NT, where [[kava]] was introduced as a safer alternative to alcohol, but was withdrawn in 2007.]]

Many Indigenous communities suffer from a range of health, social and legal problems associated with [[substance abuse]] of both legal and illegal drugs.

The 2004–05 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey (NATSIHS) by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|ABS]] found that the proportion of the Indigenous adult population engaged in 'risky' and 'high-risk' alcohol consumption (15%) was comparable with that of the non-Indigenous population (14%), based on age-standardised data.<ref>{{cite journal |title=National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey, 2004–05 (ABS Cat. 4715.0), Table 6 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |year=2006 |version=pdf |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/B1BCF4E6DD320A0BCA25714C001822BC/$File/47150_2004-05.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=1 June 2006}}</ref> The definition of "risky" and "high-risk" consumption used is four or more standard drinks per day average for males, two or more for females.

The 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey<ref>{{cite journal|author=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare |title=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2008. 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey: detailed findings. Drug statistics series no. 22. Cat. no. PHE 107. Canberra: AIHW|publisher=[[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] |year=2008 |version=pdf |url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/phe/ndshs07-df/ndshs07-df.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref> reported that Indigenous peoples were "more likely than other Australians to abstain from alcohol consumption (23.4% versus 16.8%) and also more likely to consume alcohol at risky or high-risk levels for harm in the short term (27.4% versus 20.1%)". These NDSHS comparisons are non-age-standardised; the paper notes that Indigenous figures are based on a sample of 372 people and care should be exercised when using Indigenous figures.

NATSIHS 2004/5 also found that, after adjusting for age differences between the two populations, Indigenous adults were more than twice as likely as non-Indigenous adults to be current daily smokers of tobacco.<ref>{{cite journal|title=National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey, 2004–05 (ABS Cat. 4715.0), Table 1 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |year=2006 |version=pdf |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/B1BCF4E6DD320A0BCA25714C001822BC/$File/47150_2004-05.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=23 June 2008}}</ref>

To combat the problem, a number of programs to prevent or mitigate alcohol abuse have been attempted in different regions, many initiated from within the communities themselves. These strategies include such actions as the declaration of "Dry Zones" within indigenous communities, prohibition and restriction on point-of-sale access, and community policing and licensing.

Some communities (particularly in the Northern Territory) introduced [[kava]] as a safer alternative to alcohol, as over-indulgence in kava produces sleepiness, in contrast to the violence that can result from over-indulgence in alcohol. These and other measures met with variable success, and while a number of communities have seen decreases in associated social problems caused by excessive drinking, others continue to struggle with the issue and it remains an ongoing concern.

The ANCD study notes that in order to be effective, programs in general need also to address "...the underlying structural determinants that have a significant impact on alcohol and drug misuse" (''Op. cit.'', p.&nbsp;26). In 2007, [[Kava]] was banned in the Northern Territory.<ref>Australian Broadcasting Commission (2007) [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/23/2012707.htm?site=darwin Kava Ban 'Sparks Black Market Boom'], ''ABC Darwin'' 23 August 2007.

[[Petrol sniffing in Australia|Petrol sniffing]] is also a problem among some remote Indigenous communities. Petrol vapour produces euphoria and dulling effect in those who inhale it, and due to its previously low price and widespread availability, is an increasingly popular substance of abuse.

In 1992, in ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No. 2)]]'', the High Court of Australia recognised native title in Australia for the first time. The majority in the High Court rejected the doctrine of ''terra nullius'', in favour of the concept of native title.<ref>http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr1.html?stem=0&synonyms=0&query=~mabo</ref>

In 2013 an Indigenous group describing itself as the [[Murrawarri Republic]] declared independence from Australia, claiming territory straddling the border between the states of New South Wales and Queensland.<ref name="Time">{{cite news| title=Australia’s Aborigines Launch a Bold Legal Push for Independence| author=Neubauer, Ian Lloyd | url=http://world.time.com/2013/05/30/australias-aborigines-launch-a-bold-legal-push-for-independence/| date=30 May 2013| newspaper=Time| accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref> Australia's Attorney General's Department indicated it did not consider the declaration to have any meaning in law.<ref name="Time"/>

After the arrival of European settlers in New South Wales, some Indigenous Australians became translators and go-betweens; the best-known was [[Bennelong]], who eventually adopted European dress and customs and travelled to England where he was presented to [[King George III]]. Others, such as [[Pemulwuy]], [[Yagan]], and [[Windradyne]], became famous for armed resistance to the European settlers.

During the twentieth century, as social attitudes shifted and interest in Indigenous culture increased, there were more opportunities for Indigenous Australians to gain recognition. [[Albert Namatjira]] became a painter, and actors such as [[David Gulpilil]], [[Ernie Dingo]], and [[Deborah Mailman]] became well known. Bands such as [[Yothu Yindi]], and singers [[Christine Anu]], [[Jessica Mauboy]] and [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]], have combined Indigenous musical styles and instruments with pop/rock, gaining appreciation amongst non-Indigenous audiences. Polymath [[David Unaipon]] is commemorated on the [[Banknotes of the Australian dollar|Australian $50 note]].

While relatively few [[List of Indigenous Australian politicians|Indigenous Australians have been elected to political office]] ([[Neville Bonner]], [[Aden Ridgeway]], [[Ken Wyatt]], [[Nova Peris]] and [[Jacqui Lambie]] remain the only Indigenous Australians to have been elected to the [[Australian Federal Parliament]]), Aboriginal rights campaigner Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] was appointed Governor of the State of South Australia in 1976, and many others have become famous through political activism – for instance, [[Charles N. Perkins|Charles Perkins]]' involvement in the [[Freedom Ride (Australia)|Freedom Ride]] of 1965 and subsequent work; or Torres Strait Islander [[Eddie Mabo]]'s part in the landmark [[native title]] decision that bears his name. The voices of Cape York activists [[Noel Pearson (Australian lawyer)|Noel Pearson]] and [[Jean Aileen Little|Jean Little]], and academics [[Marcia Langton]] and [[Mick Dodson]], today loom large in national debates. Some Indigenous people who initially became famous in other spheres – for instance, poet [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] – have used their celebrity to draw attention to Indigenous issues.

In health services, [[Kelvin Kong]] became the first Indigenous surgeon in 2006 and is an advocate of Indigenous health issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/inspire-kelvin-kong/story-e6frg8h6-1111117082124 |title=INSPIRE: Kelvin Kong |work=The Australian |date=2 August 2008 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lifematters/stories/2008/2176627.htm |title=2020 Summiteer Dr Kelvin Kong – Life Matters |publisher=ABC |location=Australia |date=3 March 2008 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/gnt/health/Transcripts/s966677.htm |title=Kong Family – Koori doctors: |publisher=ABC |location=Australia |date=14 October 2003 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/04/1041566268546.html |title=Aborigine stitches up role as surgeon |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=5 January 2003 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>
