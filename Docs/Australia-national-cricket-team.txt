{{main|History of the Australian cricket team}}

===Early history===
[[File:Australia cricket team 1878.jpg|thumb|right|250px||The Australian team that toured England in 1878.]]
{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1876–77 to 1890}}

The Australian cricket team participated in the [[History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883|first Test match]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] in 1877, defeating an [[England cricket team|English team]] by 45 runs, with [[Charles Bannerman]] making the first Test century, a score of 165 [[Retired hurt (cricket)|retired hurt]]. [[Test cricket]], which only occurred between Australia and England at the time, was limited by the long distance between the two countries, which would take several months by sea. Despite Australia's much smaller population, the team was very competitive in early games, producing stars such as [[Jack Blackham]], [[Billy Murdoch]], [[Fred Spofforth|Fred "The Demon" Spofforth]], [[George Bonnor]], [[Percy McDonnell]], [[George Giffen]] and [[Charles Turner (cricketer)|Charles "The Terror" Turner]]. Most cricketers at the time were either from [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] or [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]], with the notable exception of [[George Giffen]], the star [[South Australia Redbacks|South Australian]] [[all-rounder]].

A highlight of Australia's early history was the 1882 Test match against [[England cricket team|England]] at [[The Oval]]. In this match [[Fred Spofforth]] took 7/44 in the game's fourth innings to save the match by preventing England from making their 85-run target. After this match ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', a major newspaper in London at the time, printed a mock obituary in which the death of English cricket was proclaimed and the announcement made that "the body was cremated and the ashes taken to Australia." This was the start of the famous [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series in which Australia and England play a [[Test cricket|Test match series]] to decide the holder of the Ashes. To this day, the contest is one of the fiercest rivalries in sport.

===Golden Age===
{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1890–91 to 1900|History of Australian cricket from 1900–01 to 1918}}

The so-called 'Golden Age' of Australian test cricket occurred around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, with the team under the captaincy of [[Joe Darling]], [[Monty Noble]] and [[Clem Hill]] winning eight of ten tours. It participated in between the 1897–98 English tour of Australia and the 1910–11 South African tour of Australia. Outstanding batsman such as [[Joe Darling]], [[Clem Hill]], [[Reggie Duff]], [[Syd Gregory]], [[Warren Bardsley]] and [[Victor Trumper]], brilliant all-rounders including [[Monty Noble]], [[George Giffen]], [[Harry Trott]] and [[Warwick Armstrong]] and excellent bowlers including [[Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman)|Ernie Jones]], [[Hugh Trumble]], [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Bill Howell (cricketer)|Bill Howell]], [[Jack Saunders (cricketer, born 1876)|Jack Saunders]] and [[Bill Whitty]], all helped Australia to become the dominant cricketing nation for most of this period.

[[Victor Trumper]] became one of Australia's first sporting heroes, and was widely considered Australia's greatest batsman before [[Don Bradman|Bradman]] and one of the most popular players. He played a record (at the time) number of tests at 49 and scored 3163 (another record) runs at a high for the time average of 39.04. His early death in 1915 at the age of 37 from kidney disease caused national mourning. The ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', in its obituary for him, called him Australia's greatest batsman:  "''Of all the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper was by general consent the best and most brilliant.''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/7980.html |title=Victor Trumper &#124; Cricket Players and Officials |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

The years leading up to the start of World War I were marred by [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|conflict]] between the players, led by Clem Hill, Victor Trumper and [[Frank Laver]], the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control for International Cricket]]. Led by [[Peter McAlister]], who was attempting to gain more control of tours from the players. This led to six leading players (the so-called "Big Six") walking out on the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]] in England, with Australia fielding what was generally considered a second-rate side. This was the last series before the war, and no more cricket was played by Australia for eight years, with [[Tibby Cotter]] being killed in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the war.

===Cricket between the wars===
{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1918–19 to 1930}}
Test cricket resumed in the 1920/21 season in Australia with a [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920–21|touring English team]], [[List of England cricket captains|captained]] by [[Johnny Douglas]] losing all five Tests to Australia, captained by the "Big Ship" [[Warwick Armstrong]]. Several players from before the war, including Warwick Armstrong, [[Charlie Macartney]], [[Charles Kelleway]], [[Warren Bardsley]] and the wicket-keeper [[Sammy Carter]], were instrumental in the team's success, as well as new players [[Herbie Collins]], [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], [[Bert Oldfield]], the spinner [[Arthur Mailey]] and the so-called "twin destroyers" [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]]. The team continued its success on the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1921|1921 Tour of England]], winning three out of the five Tests in [[Warwick Armstrong]]'s last series. The side was, on the whole, inconsistent in the latter half of the 1920s, losing its first home [[The Ashes|Ashes series]] since the 1911–12 season in 1928–29.

===The Bradman Era===
{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1930–31 to 1945}}
The [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930 Tour of England]] heralded a new age of success for the Australian team. The team, led by [[Bill Woodfull]] – the "Great Un-bowlable" – featured legends of the game including [[Bill Ponsford]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Clarrie Grimmett]] and the young pair of [[Archie Jackson]] and [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]]. Bradman was the outstanding batsman of the series, scoring a record 974 runs, including one century, two double centuries and one [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century]], a massive score of 334 at Leeds which including 309 runs in a day. Jackson died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 24 three years later, after playing eight tests. The team was widely considered unstoppable, winning nine of its next ten Tests.

The 1932–33 England tour of Australia is considered one of the most infamous episodes of cricket, due to the England team's use of [[bodyline]], where captain [[Douglas Jardine]] instructed his bowlers [[Bill Voce]] and [[Harold Larwood]] to bowl fast, short-pitched deliveries aimed at the bodies of the Australian batsmen. The tactic, although effective, was widely considered by Australian crowds as vicious and unsporting. Injuries to [[Bill Woodfull]], who was struck over the heart, and [[Bert Oldfield]], who received a fractured skull (although from a non-Bodyline ball), exacerbated the situation, almost causing a full-scale riot from the 50 000 fans at the [[Adelaide Oval]] for the Third Test. The conflict almost escalated into a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as leading Australian political figures, including the [[Governors of South Australia|Governor of South Australia]], [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Alexander Hore-Ruthven]], protested to their English counterparts. The series ended in a 4–1 win for England but the Bodyline tactics used were banned the year after.

The Australian team managed to overcome the damaging series, winning their next tour of England in 1934. The team was led by [[Bill Woodfull]] on his final tour, and was notably dominated by Ponsford and Bradman, who twice put on partnerships of over 380 runs, with Bradman once again scoring a triple-century at Leeds. The bowling was dominated by the [[Spin bowling|spin]] pair of [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Clarrie Grimmett]], who took 53 wickets between them, with O'Reilly twice taking seven-wicket hauls.

Sir [[Donald Bradman]] is widely considered the greatest batsman of all time.<ref>{{cite web|author=mohankaus |url=http://i3j3cricket.com/2009/01/17/icc-best-ever-batsmen-and-bowlers/ |title=ICC's "Best Ever" batsmen and bowlers! |publisher=i3j3Cricket :: A blog for fans of Indian cricket... |date=17 January 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/the-10-greatest-batsmen-ever/ |title=The 10 Greatest Batsmen Ever |publisher=World Cricket Watch |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110211234312/http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/the-10-greatest-batsmen-ever/| archivedate= 11 February 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref> He dominated the sport from 1930 until his retirement in 1948, setting new records for the highest score in a test innings (334 vs England at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in 1930), the most number of runs (6996), the most number of [[Century (cricket)|centuries]] (29), the most number of double centuries and the greatest Test and [[first-class cricket|first-class]] batting averages. His record for the highest Test batting average – 99.94 – has never been beaten. It is almost 40 runs above the next highest average. He would have finished with an average of over 100 runs per innings if he had not been dismissed for a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] in his last Test. He was [[knight]]ed in 1949 for services to cricket. He is generally considered one of Australia's greatest sporting heroes.

Test cricket was again [[Cricket in World War II|interrupted by war]], with the last Test series in 1938 made notable by [[Len Hutton]] making a world record 364 for England, with [[Chuck Fleetwood-Smith]] conceding 298 runs in England's world record total of 7–903. [[Ross Gregory]], a notable young batsman who played two Tests before the war, was killed in the war.

===Cricket after World War II===
{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1945–46 to 1960}}
The team continued its success after the end of the [[Second World War]], with the first Test (also Australia's first against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]]) being played in the 1945–46 season against New Zealand. Australia was by far the most successful team of the 1940s, being undefeated throughout the decade, winning two Ashes series against England and its first Test series against [[India national cricket team|India]]. The team capitalised on its ageing stars Bradman, [[Sid Barnes]], [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] and [[Lindsay Hassett]] while new talent, including [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]], [[Don Tallon]], [[Arthur Morris]], [[Neil Harvey]], [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and the [[fast bowling]] pair of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], who all made their debut in the latter half of the 1940s, and were to form the basis of the team for a good part of the next decade. The [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|team that Don Bradman led to England in 1948]] gained the moniker ''The Invincibles'', after going through the tour without losing a single game. Of 31 first-class games played during the tour, they won 23 and drew 8, including winning the five-match Test series 4–0, with one draw. The tour was particularly notable for the [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth Test]] of the series, in which Australia won by seven wickets chasing a target of 404, setting a new record for the highest [[List of cricket terms#R|runchase]] in Test cricket, with [[Arthur Morris]] and Bradman both scoring centuries, as well as for the final Test in the series, Bradman's last, where he finished with a duck in his last innings after needing only four runs to secure a career average of 100.

Australia was less successful in the 1950s, losing three consecutive Ashes series to England, including a horrendous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956 Tour of England]], where the 'spin twins' [[Jim Laker|Laker]] and [[Tony Lock|Lock]] destroyed Australia, taking 61 wickets between them, including Laker taking 19 wickets in the game (a first-class record) at [[Headingley Stadium|Leeds]], a game dubbed '''Laker's Match'''.

However, the team rebounded to win five consecutive series in the latter half of the 1950s, first under the leadership of [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]], then [[Ian Craig]] and [[Richie Benaud]]. The [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1960–61|series against the West Indies in the 1960–61 season]] was notable for the [[Tied Test]] in the first game at [[The Gabba]], which was the first in Test cricket. Australia ended up winning the series 2–1 after a hard fought series that was praised for its excellent standards and sense of fair-play. Stand-out players in that series as well as through the early part of the 1960s were [[Richie Benaud]], who took a then-record number of wickets as a [[Leg spin|leg-spinner]], and who also captained Australia in 28 Tests, including 24 without defeat; [[Alan Davidson (cricketer, born 1929)|Alan Davidson]], who became the first player to take 10 wickets and make 100 runs in the same game in the first Test, and was also a notable fast-bowler; [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]], who also later captained Australia for two different periods of time; [[Colin McDonald (Australian cricketer)|Colin McDonald]], the first-choice opening batsman for most of the 1950s and early '60s; [[Norm O'Neill]], who made 181 in the Tied Test; [[Neil Harvey]], towards the end of his long career; and [[Wally Grout]], an excellent [[wicket-keeper]] who died at the age of 41.

===1970s and onward===
The [[Centenary Test]] was played in March 1977 at the [[MCG]] to celebrate 100 years since the first Test was played. Australia ended winning by 45 runs, an identical result to the first Test match.<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/11/01/the-1977-centenary-test/ Remembering the 1977 Centenary Test] – The Roar. Published 1 November 2009. Retrieved 4 May 2011.</ref>

In May 1977 [[Kerry Packer]] announced he was organising a breakaway competition – [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) – after the [[Australian Cricket Board]] (ACB) refused to accept [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]]'s bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia's Test matches in 1976. Packer secretly signed leading international cricketers to his competition, including 28 Australians. Almost all of the Australian Test team at the time were signed to WSC – notable exceptions including [[Gary Cosier]], [[Geoff Dymock]], [[Kim Hughes]] and [[Craig Serjeant]] – and the Australian selectors were forced to pick what was generally considered a third-rate team from players in the [[Sheffield Shield]]. Former player [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]], who had retired 10 years previously after a conflict with the board, was recalled at the age of 41 to captain Australia against India. [[Jeff Thomson]] was named deputy in a team that included seven debutants. Australia managed to win the series 3–2, mainly thanks to the batting of Simpson, who scored 539 runs, including two centuries; and the bowling of [[Wayne Clark (cricketer)|Wayne Clark]], who took 28 wickets. Australia lost the next series—against the West Indies, which was fielding a full team—3–1, and also lost the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1978–79|1978–79 Ashes series]] 5–1, the team's worst Ashes result in Australia. [[Graham Yallop]] was named as captain for the Ashes, with Kim Hughes taking over for the 1979–80 tour of India. [[Rodney Hogg]] still managed to take 41 wickets in his debut series, an Australian record. WSC players returned to the team for the 1979–80 season after a settlement between the ACB and Kerry Packer. [[Greg Chappell]] was reinstated as captain.

The [[underarm bowling incident of 1981]] occurred when, in a {{Cric ODI}} against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]], Greg Chappell instructed his brother [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]] to bowl an [[underarm bowling|underarm delivery]] to New Zealand batsman [[Brian McKechnie (sportsman)|Brian McKechnie]], with New Zealand needing a [[Six (cricket)|six]] to tie off the last ball. The aftermath of the incident soured political relations between Australia and New Zealand, with several leading political and cricketing figures calling it "unsportsmanlike" and "[[not in the spirit of cricket]]".

Australia continued its success up until the early 1980s, built around Bob Simpson, the Chappell brothers, [[Dennis Lillee]], [[Jeff Thomson]] and [[Rod Marsh]]. The 1980s was a period of relative mediocrity after the turmoil caused by the [[Rebel tours of South Africa#Australian tours, 1985/86 & 1986/87|Rebel Tours of South Africa]] and the subsequent retirement of several key players. The rebel tours were funded by the [[South African Cricket Board]] to compete against its national side, which had been banned—along with many other sports, including Olympic athletes—from competing internationally, due to the South African government's racist apartheid policies. Some of Australia's best players were poached: Graham Yallop, [[Carl Rackemann]], [[Terry Alderman]], Rodney Hogg, Kim Hughes, [[John Dyson (cricketer)|John Dyson]], [[Greg Shipperd]], [[Steve Rixon]] and [[Steve Smith (cricketer born 1961)|Steve Smith]] amongst others. These players were handed three-year suspensions by the Australian Cricket Board which greatly weakened the player pool for the national sides, as most were either current representative players or on the verge of gaining honours.

Under the captaincy of [[Allan Border]] and the new fielding standards put in place by new coach Bob Simpson, the team was restructured and gradually rebuilt their cricketing stocks. Some of the rebel players returned to the national side after serving their suspensions, including [[Trevor Hohns]], Carl Rackemann and Terry Alderman. During these lean years, it was the batsmen Border, [[David Boon]], [[Dean Jones (cricketer)|Dean Jones]], the young Steve Waugh and the bowling feats of Alderman, [[Bruce Reid]], [[Craig McDermott]], [[Merv Hughes]] and to a lesser extent, [[Geoff Lawson (cricketer)|Geoff Lawson]] who kept the Australian side afloat.

With the emergence of players such as [[Ian Healy]], [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Geoff Marsh]], [[Mark Waugh]], [[Greg Matthews]], [[Damien Martyn]] and [[Matthew Hayden]] in the late 1980s, Australia was on the way back from the doldrums. Winning [[1989 Ashes series|the Ashes in 1989]], the Australians got a roll on beating [[Pakistani cricket team in Australia in 1989–90|Pakistan]], [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia in 1989–90|Sri Lanka]] and then followed it up with another Ashes win on home soil [[1990–91 Ashes series|in 1991]]. The Australians went on [[Australian cricket team in West Indies in 1990–91|to the West Indies]] and had their chances but ended up losing the series. However, they bounced back and beat the Indians in their next Test series. With the retirement of the champion but defensive, Allan Border, a new era of attacking cricket had begun under the leadership of firstly Mark Taylor and then [[Steve Waugh]].

[[File:Australia 5th Time World Champions.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Australia won the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]]]]
The 1990s and early 21st century were arguably Australia's most successful period, unbeaten in all Ashes series played bar the famous [[2005 Ashes series|2005 series]] and achieving a hat-trick of [[Cricket World Cup|World Cups]]. This success has been attributed to the restructuring of the team and system by Border, successive aggressive captains, and the effectiveness of several key players, most notably [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Shane Warne]], [[Justin Langer]], [[Matthew Hayden]], [[Steve Waugh]], [[Adam Gilchrist]], [[Michael Hussey]] and [[Ricky Ponting]]. Following the 2006/07 Ashes series which Australia won 5 nill, Australia slipped in the rankings after the retirements of key players. In the 2013/14 Ashes series, Australia again defeated England 5 nil, and climbed back to 3rd on the ICC International Test Rankings. In February & March 2014 Australia beat the number 1 team in the world, South Africa, 2–1, and were re-ranked number 1 in the world.

The sponsor's (currently [[Commonwealth Bank]] for Home Test matches and [[Qantas]] for Away Test matches) logo is displayed on the right side of the chest while the [[Cricket Australia]] coat-of-arms is displayed on the left.

In [[One Day International]] cricket and [[Twenty20 International]] cricket, the team wears uniforms usually coloured [[green and gold]], the [[national colours of Australia]]. There has been a variety of different styles and layouts used in both forms of the limited-overs game, with coloured clothing (sometimes known as "pyjamas") being introduced for [[World Series Cricket]] in the late 1970s. The sponsors' logos (the [[Victoria Bitter]] for Home ODIs, [[KFC]] for Home Twenty20s and [[Qantas]] for Away ODIs and Away Twenty20) are prominently displayed on the shirts and other gears. The Current Home ODI Kit consists of green as the primary colour and gold as the secondary colour.

The authorship of this "Under the Southern Cross I Stand" is credited to former wicketkeeper [[Rod Marsh]], who was apparently inspired by [[Henry Lawson]]'s 1887 poem, "Flag of the Southern Cross".<ref name="Southern Cross"/> Marsh initially had the role of leading the team in singing it, and on his retirement he passed it on to [[Allan Border]]. The other players to have taken on the role are [[David Boon]] (when Border took over the captaincy), [[Ian Healy]] (on Boon's retirement), [[Ricky Ponting]] (on Healy's retirement), [[Justin Langer]] (when Ponting took over the captaincy). The role was then passed on to [[Michael Hussey]], who took it on when Langer retired in January 2007. At Hussey's retirement on 6 January 2013, he announced that he would be handing the duties over to [[Nathan Lyon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-sri-lanka-2012/content/current/story/599810.html |title=Australia v Sri Lanka, 3rd Test, Sydney, 4th day Report : Retiring Hussey steers Australia to victory &#124; Cricket News |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>
