'''Abbey Road Studios''' (formerly known as '''EMI Studios''') is a [[recording studio]] located at 3 [[Abbey Road (street)|Abbey Road]], [[St John's Wood]], [[City of Westminster]], [[London]], [[England]].<ref>{{cite web|author = UK|url = http://www.abbeyroad.com/studios/studio1/|title = DEAD LINK|publisher = Abbeyroad.com|date = |accessdate = 2011-08-19|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110714120039/http://www.abbeyroad.com/studios/studio1/|archivedate = 14 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl = yes}}</ref> It was established November 1931 by the [[Gramophone Company]], a predecessor of [[United Kingdom|British]] music company [[EMI]], which owned it until Universal Music took control of part of EMI in 2012.

Abbey Road Studios is most notable as being the 1960s' venue for innovative recording techniques adopted by [[the Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[the Hollies]], [[Badfinger]] and others. One of its earliest world-famous-artist clients was [[Paul Robeson]], who recorded December 1931 and went on to record many of his best-known songs there.

Towards the end of 2009, the studio came under threat of sale to property developers. However, the British Government protected the site, granting it [[English Heritage]] [[Listed building|Grade II listed]] status in 2010, thereby preserving the building from any major alterations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8531054.stm |title=Abbey Road studios given listed building status |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-02-23 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref>

[[File:Abbey Rd Studios.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Abbey Road Studios]]

Originally a nine-bedroom [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[townhouse]] built in the 1830s on the footpath leading to [[Kilburn Priory|Kilburn Abbey]], the building was later converted to flats where the most flamboyant resident was [[Maundy Gregory]].

In 1931, the premises were acquired by the [[Gramophone Company]]  and converted into studios. [[Pathé]] filmed the opening of the studios when [[Sir Edward Elgar]] conducted the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in recording sessions of his music.<ref name="saga">[http://www.malonedigital.com/starwars.pdf "Recording the Star Wars Saga"] Retrieved 2012-08-04.</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpDP9VTamZY Sir Edward Elgar, 1931 "Land of hope & glory"] [http://www.britishpathe.com/thumbnails.php?id=94678&searchword=Edward%20Elgar&searchword=Edward%20Elgar THE MASTER OF THE KING'S MUSIC]</ref> In 1934, inventor of [[stereophonic sound|stereo sound]], [[Alan Blumlein]], recorded [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Jupiter Symphony]]'' which was conducted by Sir [[Thomas Beecham]] at the studios.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7537782.stm "Early stereo recordings restored"]. BBC. Retrieved 9 January 2015</ref>

The neighboring house is also owned by the studio and used to house musicians. During the mid-20th century, the studio was extensively used by leading British [[conducting|conductor]] Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], whose house was just around the corner from the studio building.<ref>Discography in ''Sir Malcolm Sargent: a Tribute''.</ref>

The Gramophone Company amalgamated with [[Columbia Graphophone Company]] to form [[EMI]], which took over the studios and dubbed them EMI Studios. It was under this name that in 1936 cellist [[Pablo Casals]] became the first to record [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[Cello Suites]] No. 1 & 2 at the command of EMI head [[Fred Gaisberg]]. The recordings went on to spur a revolution among Bach aficionados and cellists alike.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Siblin, Eric|title=The Cello Suites: J. S.

In 1958, Studio Two at Abbey Road became a centre for rock and roll music when [[Cliff Richard]] and the Drifters (later Cliff Richard and [[The Shadows]]) recorded "[[Move It]]" there,<ref>{{Cite news|title=EMI puts Abbey Road up for sale: Ten things you need to know about the iconic recording studio|date=16 February 2010|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|location=London|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/emi-puts-abbey-road-up-201857|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6RAnP0aVm|archivedate=18 July 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> and later [[pop music]] material.

Abbey Road Studios is closely associated with the Beatles, who recorded almost all of their albums and [[single (music)|singles]] there between 1962 and 1970 using the four-track REDD mixing console designed by Peter K. Burkowitz.<ref>[http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/jaes.obit/JAES_V60_7_8_PG639.pdf Peter Karl Burkowitz 1920-2012] Obituary by the AES</ref> The Beatles named their [[1969 in music|1969 album]] ''[[Abbey Road]]'', after the street where the studio is located.

It has been a long-standing tradition for visitors to pay homage to the band by writing on the wall in front of the building even though it is painted over every three months.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence|last=Pollard|date=7 August 2009|title=Revisiting Abbey Road 40 Years On|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8188475.stm|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=2010-11-02 }}</ref> December 2010, the zebra crossing at Abbey Road was given a Grade II [[Listed building|listed status]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jan/02/ringo-starr-childhood-home |title=Housing minister tries to save Ringo Starr's childhood home |work=The Guardian |date=2011-01-02 |accessdate=2011-08-19 |location=London}}</ref>

[[Pink Floyd]] recorded most of their late 1960s to mid-1970s albums here, returning only in 1988 for mixing and overdubbing subsequent albums.

The Shadows named their ''Live at Abbey Road'' album after the studio, with the cover spoofing the Beatles' album.

Notable [[record producer|producers]] and [[sound engineer]]s who have worked at Abbey Road include [[George Martin|Sir George Martin]], [[Geoff Emerick]], [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman "Hurricane" Smith]], [[Ken Scott]], [[Mike "Clay" Stone|Mike Stone]], [[Alan Parsons]], [[Peter Vince]], Malcolm Addey, Peter Brown, Richard Langham, Phil McDonald, John Kurlander, Richard Lush and [[Ken Townsend]], who invented the groundbreaking studio effect known as [[automatic double tracking]] (ADT). The chief mastering engineer at Abbey Road was Chris "Vinyl" Blair, who started his career early on as a [[tape recorder|tape deck]] operator.

In 1979, EMI commissioned the British jazz fusion band [[Morrissey-Mullen]] to record Britain's first [[digital recording|digitally recorded]] single record at Abbey Road Studios.<ref>''DEAD LINK Gramophone'' AUDIO NEWS: "EMI digital recording" July 1979.

From July 18 to September 11, 1983, the public had a rare opportunity to see inside the legendary Studio Two where The Beatles made most of their records. While a new mixing console was being installed in the control room, the studio was used to host a video presentation called "The Beatles at Abbey Road." The soundtrack to the video contained a number of recordings that were not made commercially available until the release of ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' project over a decade later.<ref>''[[The Beatles Book]]'' July & August 1983.</ref>

The [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] used a photograph of the band walking across the zebra crossing naked (except for strategically placed socks) on the front of ''[[The Abbey Road E.P.]]'', which was released in 1988.

In June 2011, South Korean boy band [[Shinee]] performed at the studio as part of its Japanese debut showcase in partnership with EMI and the group's local record label [[S.M. Entertainment|SM Entertainment]], becoming the first-ever Asian artist to perform in the studio.<ref>{{Cite news|title=샤이니, 英 애비로드 쇼케이스 성공리 마쳐 (Shinee, Lee finishes British showcase success)|language=Korean|newspaper=Nate News (SK Communications)|date=21 June 2011|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20110621n03720 }}</ref> In November 2011, Australian recording artist [[Kylie Minogue]] recorded some of her most famous songs with a full orchestra at Abbey Road Studios. The album called ''[[The Abbey Road Sessions (Kylie Minogue album)|The Abbey Road Sessions]]'' was released October 2012.

In September 2012, with the takeover of EMI, the studio became the property of [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]. It was ''not'' one of the entities that was sold to Warner Music as part of [[Parlophone]].

== Location ==
[[File:Abbey Road Sign Sander Lamme.jpg|right|thumb|Abbey Road has become a London tourist attraction.]]
Abbey Road Studios is a five to ten-minute walk away from [[St. John's Wood tube station]]. From [[central London]], it is accessible using the [[Jubilee line]]. When exiting the station, the visitor faces south at the junction of [[A41 road|A41]] (Finchley Road/Wellington Road) and Acacia Road (to the left)/Grove End Road (to the right). The studio is along Grove End Road, passing Waverley Place and Loudon Street on the right; addresses decrease in number along the way. As Grove End Road veers sharply to the left, Abbey Road is to the immediate right. The first pedestrian crossing is the crossing featured on the album. The studio, at 3 Abbey Road, is the unaddressed white building across the street between Hill Road and Garden Road.

==Film scores==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Abbey Road Studios got its start in the [[film score|film scoring]] business in 1980 when Anvil Post Production formed a partnership with the studio, called Anvil-Abbey Road Screen Sound. The partnership started when Anvil was left without a scoring stage when [[Korda Studios]] were demolished. It ended in 1984 when EMI merged with [[Thorn Electrical Industries]] to become [[Thorn EMI]].

Abbey Road's success in the scoring business continued after the partnership ended.

[[John Williams]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] used the studios to record the scores of four films from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise beginning with ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' in 1983.

All three film scores for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] (''The Fellowship of the Ring'', ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King''), composed by [[Howard Shore]] and performed by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], were mixed at Abbey Road Studios. The recordings themselves were done by CTS-Lansdowne Studios at their permanent studios in the old Watford Town Hall with engineer John Kurlander. All technical support by CTS engineers. All recordings up to 96 tracks were in the digital domain.

[[James Horner]] had also frequently used Abbey Road Studios as his recording base when recording scores in the UK. Abbey Road sound engineer Simon Rhodes had for over a decade served as his scoring mixer, both when recording in Britain and in the U.S.

Apple's [[iMovie]] 11's soundtracks of its trailers were recorded at the studio in early 2010.

==Controversy over sale==
On February 17, 2010, it was reported that the studio's owners [[EMI]] had put the world-famous studios up for sale because of increasing debts. There was reported interest by property developers in redeveloping the site into luxury flats.<ref name="Times AR Sale">{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article7029140.ece|title=End for Abbey Road?

[[Paul McCartney]], speaking to BBC ''[[Newsnight]]'' on 16 February 2010, said that there had been efforts to save Abbey Road by, "a few people who have been associated with the studio for a long time," although he did not name those people or include himself among them. "I have so many memories there with the Beatles," McCartney said, "It still is a great studio. So it would be lovely for someone to get a thing together to save it."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E3DE1E3FF93BA25751C0A9669D8B63 | title =  McCartney Expresses Hopes for Abbey Road | last = Sisario | first = Ben | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 18 February 2010 | accessdate = 27 March 2010}}</ref>
