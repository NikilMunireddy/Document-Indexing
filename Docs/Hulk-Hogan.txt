Bollea enjoyed mainstream popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as the [[all-American]] character Hulk Hogan in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]), and as "Hollywood" Hulk Hogan, the villainous [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] leader, in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). A regular [[pay-per-view]] headliner in both organizations, he main-evented the respective premier annual events of the WWF and WCW, [[WrestleMania]] and [[Starrcade]], multiple times. Hogan was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2005. He was signed with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) from 2009 until 2013, in which he was the on-screen General Manager and an occasional wrestler.<ref name="TNA">{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/1770/84/|title=Hulk Hogan Joins TNA Wrestling!|date=October 27, 2009|accessdate=October 27, 2009|publisher=[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029133223/http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/1770/84/|archivedate=October 29, 2009}}</ref> [[IGN]] described Hogan as "the most recognized wrestling star worldwide and the most popular wrestler of the '80s".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/02/top-50-wrestlers-of-all-time?page=5|title=Top 50 Wrestlers of All Time|publisher=ign.com|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}</ref>

Hogan is a twelve-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]]; a [[List of WWE Heavyweight Champions|six-time]] [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF/E World Heavyweight Champion]] and [[List of WCW World Heavyweight Champions|six-time]] [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Heavyweight Champion]]. He was the first wrestler to win consecutive [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble]]s, in [[Royal Rumble (1990)|1990]] and [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991]].

== Early life ==
Hogan was born Terry Eugene Bollea in [[Augusta, Georgia]] in 1953,<ref name="OWW">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/hulk-hogan.html|title=Hulk Hogan's profile|accessdate=December 10, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> the son of construction foreman Pietro "Peter" Bollea (December 6, 1913 - December 18, 2001), and his wife Ruth V.

As a boy, he was a pitcher in [[Little League Baseball]]. He attracted scouts from the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Cincinnati Reds]], but an injury ended his baseball career. He began watching professional wrestling at 16 years old. While in high school, he revered [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]],<ref name=lk45/> and he regularly attended cards at the [[Tampa Sportatorium]]. It was at one of those wrestling cards where he first turned his attention towards [[Superstar Billy Graham]] and looked to him for inspiration;<ref name=lk45>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=45|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> since he first saw Graham on TV,<ref name=lk45/> Hogan wanted to match his "inhuman" look.<ref name=lk45/>

Hogan was also a musician, spending ten years playing [[Bass guitar#Fretted and fretless basses|fretless bass guitar]] in several Florida-based [[rock and roll|rock]] bands.<ref name=james>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200552|title=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|author=Patrick Jones|accessdate=October 25, 2007|year=2002}}</ref> He went on to study at [[Hillsborough Community College]] and the [[University of South Florida]]. After music gigs began to get in the way of his time in college, Hogan decided to drop out of the University of South Florida before receiving a degree.<ref name=lk457u>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=41|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> Eventually, Hogan and two local musicians formed a band called Ruckus in 1976.<ref name=lk4544>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=44|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> The band soon became popular in the Tampa Bay region.<ref name=lk4544 />

During his spare time, Hogan worked out at Hector's Gym in the Tampa Bay area, where he began lifting.<ref name= lk457u5>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=42|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> Many of the wrestlers who were competing in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing.<ref name= lk45/> Among those attending his performances were [[Jack Brisco|Jack]] and [[Gerald Brisco]],<ref name= lk45/> two brothers who wrestled together as a tag team in the Florida region. Impressed by Hogan's physical stature, the Brisco brothers asked [[Yasuhiro Kojima|Hiro Matsuda]]{{snd}} the man who trained wrestlers working for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF){{snd}} to make him a potential trainee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/geraldbrisco|title=Gerald Brisco's profile|accessdate=June 4, 2012|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> In 1976, the two brothers asked Hogan to try wrestling. Having been a wrestling fan since childhood,<ref name= lk45/> Hogan eventually agreed.<ref name= lk455147>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=47|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> At first, however, [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]], the son of CWF promoter [[Eddie Graham]], refused to put Hogan in the ring;<ref name= lk4551>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=51|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> according to Hogan, he met Graham while in high school and the two did not get along.<ref name="lk4551"/> However, after Hogan quit Ruckus and started telling people in town that he was going to be a wrestler,<ref name= lk4551/> Graham finally agreed to accept the Brisco Brothers' request.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early years (1977–1979) ===
In mid-1977, after training for more than a year with Matsuda, the Brisco brothers dropped by Matsuda's gym to see Hogan.<ref name=lk455156h>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=56|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> During this visit, Jack Brisco handed Hogan a pair of wrestling boots and informed him that he was scheduled to wrestle his first match the following week.<ref name=lk455156h/> In his professional wrestling debut, Eddie Graham booked him against [[Brian Blair]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] on August 10, 1977, in [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldschool-wrestling.com/geeklog/article.php/20061017223545426|title=Old School Wrestling – Florida results 1977 (August 10)}}</ref><ref name= 7uiomnx>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=57|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> A short time later, Bollea donned a mask and assumed the persona of "The Super Destroyer", a hooded character first played by [[Don Jardine]] and subsequently used by other wrestlers.

Hogan eventually could no longer work with Hiro Matsuda, whom he felt was an overbearing trainer, and left Championship Wrestling from Florida.<ref name="765yuiomnfx">{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|pages=61–62|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> After declining an offer to wrestle for the Kansas City circuit,<ref name="765yuiomnfx"/> Hogan took a hiatus from wrestling and managed The Anchor club, a private club in [[Cocoa Beach, Florida]], for a man named Whitey Bridges.<ref name="765yuiomnfx"/> Eventually, Whitey and Hogan became close friends, and decided to open a gym together;<ref name="765yuiomnfx"/> the gym became known as Whitey and Terry's Olympic gym.<ref name="765yuiomnfx"/>

Soon after, Hogan's friend Ed Leslie (later known as [[Brutus Beefcake]]) came to Cocoa Beach to help Hogan and Bridges manage both the Anchor Club and the Whitey and Terry's Olympic Gym.<ref name="765yuiomnfx"/> On his spare time, he and Leslie worked out in the gym together,<ref name="765yuiomnfx"/> and eventually, Beefcake developed a muscular physique;<ref name=765yu8omnfx>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=67|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> Hogan was impressed by Beefcake's physical stature and became convinced that the two of them should wrestle together as [[tag team]] partners.<ref name=765yu8omnfx/> Depressed and yearning to return to wrestling,<ref name=765yu8omnfx/> Hogan called Superstar Billy Graham in 1978 with hopes that Graham could find him a job wrestling outside of Florida;<ref name=765yu8omnfx/> Graham agreed and Hogan soon joined Louie Tillet's [[Alabama]] territory.<ref name=765yu8omnfx/> Hogan also convinced Leslie, who had yet to become a wrestler,<ref name=765yu8omnfx/> to come with him and promised to teach him everything he knew about the sport.<ref name=765yu8omnfx/>

In Alabama, Bollea and Leslie wrestled as Terry and Ed Boulder, known as the Boulder Brothers.<ref name=76hbw8omnfx>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=73|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> These early matches as a tag team with the surname Boulder being used by both men prompted a rumor among wrestling fans unaware of the inner workings of the sport that Hogan and Leslie were brothers,<ref name=76hbw8omnfx/> as few people actually knew their real names outside of immediate friends, family, and of course the various promoters the two worked for. After wrestling a show for [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) in Memphis,<ref name= 7oubw8omnfx>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=75|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> Jerry Jarrett, the promoter for the (CWA), approached Hogan and Leslie and offered them a job in his promotion for $800.00 a week;<ref name=7oubw8omnfx/> this was far more than the $175.00 a week they would make working for Tillet.<ref name= 7oubw8omnfx /> Hogan and Leslie accepted this offer and left Tillet's territory.<ref name=7oubw8omnfx/>

During his time in Memphis, Hogan appeared on a local talk show, where he sat beside [[Lou Ferrigno]], star of the television series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=76|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> The host commented on how Terry, who stood 6&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in (201&nbsp;cm) and weighed 295&nbsp;pounds with 24&nbsp;inch biceps, actually dwarfed "The Hulk". Watching the show backstage, Mary Jarrett noticed that Hogan was actually bigger than Ferrigno, who was well known at the time for having large muscles.<ref name= 79nmbx>{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=77|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}</ref> As a result, Bollea began performing as Terry "The Hulk" Boulder<ref name=79nmbx/> and sometimes wrestled as Sterling Golden.<ref name=james/>

In May 1979, Bollea had an early shot at the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], which at the time was generally recognized as the highest honor in wrestling, against [[Harley Race]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} On December 1, 1979, Bollea won his first [[professional wrestling championship]], the [[NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship (Northern Division)]], recognized in [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]], when he defeated [[Bob Roop]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville, TN]]. Bollea would drop the title in January 1980 to [[Bob Armstrong]]. Bollea briefly wrestled in the [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) territory from September thru December 1979 as Sterling Golden.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1979–1980) ===
Later that year, former [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] World Heavyweight Champion [[Terry Funk]] introduced Bollea to the company head [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vincent J. McMahon]], who was impressed with his charisma and physical stature. McMahon, who wanted to use an Irish name, gave Bollea the last name Hogan, and also wanted him to dye his hair red. Hogan claims his hair was already beginning to fall out by that time, and he refused to dye it, simply replying, "I'll be a blond Irish".<ref>Fifteen Greatest Superstars of the '80s DVD</ref> Hogan wrestled his first match in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) on November 17 defeating Harry Valdez on ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]''. He made his first appearance at [[Madison Square Garden]], defeating [[Ted DiBiase]] after a [[bearhug]]. McMahon gave Hogan former tag team champion [[Tony Altomare]] as chaperone and guide.<ref name=albano>{{cite book|title=Often Imitated, Never Duplicated: Captain Lou Albano|last=Albano|first=Lou|pages=104|publisher=GEAN Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-615-18998-7}}</ref> At this time, Hogan wrestled [[Bob Backlund]] for the World Championship,<ref>{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1980|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/80.htm|year=1980|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}</ref> and he started his first big feud with [[André the Giant]], which culminated in a [[Showdown at Shea#1980|match]] with André at [[Shea Stadium]] in August 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1980|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/80.htm|accessdate=May 18, 2015|date=August 9, 1980}}</ref> During his initial heel run in the WWF, Hogan was paired with [[Freddie Blassie|"Classy" Freddie Blassie]], a wrestler-turned-manager.

=== New Japan Pro Wrestling (1980–1985) ===
In 1980, Hogan began appearing in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) where Japanese wrestling fans nicknamed him "Ichiban" (which translates to "Number One"). Hogan first appeared on May 13, 1980, while he was still with the WWF. He occasionally toured the country over the next few years, facing a wide variety of opponents ranging from [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] to [[Abdullah the Butcher]]. When competing in Japan, Hogan used a vastly different repertoire of wrestling moves, relying on more technical, traditional wrestling holds and maneuvers as opposed to the power-based, brawling style American fans became accustomed to seeing from him. In addition, Hogan used the ''Axe Bomber'', a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Crooked arm lariat|crooked arm lariat]], as his finisher in Japan instead of the [[Leg drop#Running leg drop|running leg drop]] that has been his standard finisher in America. Hogan still made appearances for the WWF, even unsuccessfully challenging [[Pedro Morales]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] on March 26, 1981.<ref name="page39">{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=October 24, 2012|page=39}}</ref> On June 2, 1983, Hogan became the first [[International Wrestling Grand Prix]] (IWGP) tournament winner (although he held the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] belt, this was not the beginning of the actual championship), defeating [[Antonio Inoki]] by knockout in the finals of a 10-man tournament.<ref name="iwgp1983"/> Hogan and Inoki also worked as partners in Japan, winning the MSG Tag League tournament two years in a row: in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, Hogan returned to NJPW to wrestle Inoki in the finals of the IWGP League, in which he lost the belt by countout, thanks to interference from [[Riki Choshu]]. Hogan also defended his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Inoki, [[Seiji Sakaguchi]], and [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] among others, until the WWF ended their relationship with New Japan in October 1985.

=== American Wrestling Association (1981–1983) ===
After filming his scene for ''[[Rocky III]]'' against the elder McMahon's wishes, Hogan made his debut in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), owned by [[Verne Gagne]]. Hogan started his AWA run as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], taking on "Luscious" [[John L. Sullivan (wrestler)|Johnny Valiant]] as his manager. This didn't last for long as the AWA fans fell in love with Hogan's presence and Hogan became the top face of the AWA, battling the [[Heenan Family]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]].

Hogan's turn as a face came at the end of July 1981. During a television taping that aired in August, [[Jerry Blackwell]], after suffering a pinfall loss to [[Brad Rheingans]], began beating down Rheingans and easily fighting off anyone who tried to run in for the save; however, Hogan ran in, got the upper hand and ran Blackwell from the ring. Hogan was eventually victorious in his feud with Blackwell and by the end of 1981, gained his first title matches against Bockwinkel, and as word began spreading about Hogan's prolific role in the soon-to-be-released ''Rocky III'', Hogan's star power only grew.

It was through those encounters that Hogan began matching wits with Heenan, a man that he would feud with throughout the remainder of the 1980s.

=== Return to WWF ===

==== The crowning of Hulkamania (1983–1984) ====
After purchasing the company from his father in 1982, [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] had plans to expand the territory into a nationwide promotion, and he handpicked Hulk Hogan to be the company's showpiece attraction due to his charisma and name recognition. Hogan made his return at a television taping in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on December 27, 1983 defeating Bill Dixon.<ref>{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1983|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/83.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2008}}</ref>

On the January 7, 1984, episode of ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]'', Hogan confirmed his [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] status for the WWF fans by saving [[Bob Backlund]] from a three-way assault by [[The Wild Samoans]].<ref>{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1984|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|accessdate=May 18, 2015|date=January 7, 1984}}</ref> Hogan's turn was explained simply by Backlund: "He's changed his ways. He's a great man. He's told me he's not gonna have Blassie around". The storyline shortcut was necessary because less than three weeks later on January 23, Hogan won his first [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]], pinning [[The Iron Sheik]] (who had Blassie in his [[Cornerman|corner]]) in [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name=james/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454120|title=Hulk Hogan's first WWE Championship reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 12, 2008}}</ref> The storyline accompanying the victory was that Hogan was a "last minute" replacement for the Sheik's original opponent Bob Backlund,<ref name="WWEBio">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/Hulkhogan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717061714/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/hulkhogan|archivedate=July 17, 2015|title=Hulk Hogan bio|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref> and became the champion by way of being the first man to escape the camel clutch (the Iron Sheik's finishing move).<ref>{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1984|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2008|date=January 23, 1984}}</ref> The backstage story was that then champion Bob Backlund had refused to let Hogan win the title from him, demanding that any wrestler to whom he lost the belt have a legitimate wrestling background. As a consequence, The Iron Sheik won the title from Backlund first and then dropped it to Hogan. This was mostly made however, to not make two faces (Backlund was a face at the time) face each other.

[[File:Hulk Hogan And Brutus Beefcake.jpg|thumb|Hogan as the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] with [[Brutus Beefcake]] ]]
Immediately after the title win, commentator [[Gorilla Monsoon]] proclaimed "Hulkamania is here!". Hogan frequently referred to his fans as "Hulkamaniacs" in his interviews and introduced his three "demandments": [[training]], saying prayers, and eating [[vitamin]]s. Eventually, a fourth demandment ([[Self-confidence|believing in oneself]]) was added during his feud with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] in 1990. Hogan's ring gear developed a characteristic yellow-and-red color scheme; his ring entrances involved him [[Ritual]]istically ripping his shirt off his body, [[Posedown|flexing]], and listening for audience cheers in an exaggerated manner. The majority of Hogan's matches during this time involved him wrestling heels who had been [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] as [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#M|unstoppable monsters]], using a format which became near-routine: Hogan would deliver steady offense, but eventually lose momentum, seemingly nearing defeat. After being hit with his opponent's finishing move, he would then experience a sudden [[second wind]], fighting back while "feeding" off the energy of the audience, becoming impervious to attack{{snd}} a process described as "Hulking up". His signature maneuvers{{snd}} pointing at the opponent (which would later be accompanied by a loud "you!" from the audience), shaking his finger to scold him, three punches, an Irish whip, the [[big boot]] and [[Leg drop#Running leg drop|running leg drop]]{{snd}} would follow and ensure him a victory. That finishing sequence would occasionally change depending on the storyline and opponent; for instance, with "giant" wrestlers, the sequence might involve a [[body slam]].

Over the next year, Hulk Hogan became the face of professional wrestling as McMahon pushed the WWF into a [[Popular culture|pop culture]] enterprise with [[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]] on MTV, drawing record houses, [[pay-per-view]] buyrates, and television ratings in the process. The centerpiece attraction for the [[WrestleMania I|first WrestleMania]] on March 31, 1985, Hogan teamed with [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#L|legit]] friend, TV and movie star [[Mr. T]], to defeat his archrival [[Roddy Piper|"Rowdy" Roddy Piper]] and [[Paul Orndorff|"Mr Wonderful" Paul Orndorff]].<ref name=james/><ref>{{cite web|title="Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff & "Rowdy" Roddy Piper w/ Cowboy Bob Orton vs. Hulk Hogan & Mr. T w/ "Superfly" Jimmy Snuka|publisher=[[WWE]]|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/mainevent1/|accessdate=February 27, 2008|date=March 31, 1985}}</ref> On the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event I|first episode]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', Hogan successfully defended the WWF title against [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Cowboy Bob Orton]] in a match which Hogan won by a disqualification (Orton had been in the corner of Piper and Orndorff at WrestleMania and had accidentally caused his team's defeat by knocking out Orndorff after he jumped from the top turnbuckle and hit him in the back of the head with his arm cast in a shot meant for Hogan).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/may111985|title=Saturday Night's Main Event I results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 12, 2008|date=May 11, 1985}}</ref>

Together, Hogan, Savage, and [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Miss Elizabeth]] formed a partnership known as [[The Mega Powers]].<ref name="megapowers">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/megapowers.html|title=Mega Powers Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=June 4, 2012}}</ref> After Savage became WWF Champion at WrestleMania IV, they feuded with [[The Mega Bucks]] (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant) and defeated them at the main event of [[SummerSlam (1988)|the first SummerSlam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/|title=Hulk Hogan & "Macho Man" Randy Savage w/ Elizabeth vs. "Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase & André the Giant w/ Virgil and Bobby "The Brain" Heenan|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 12, 2008|date=August 29, 1988|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724013841/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/|archivedate=July 24, 2008}}</ref> They then went on to feud with [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick's]] Twin Towers: [[One Man Gang|Akeem]] and [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

In mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at house shows in singles competition with his "War Bonnet", a red and yellow [[Galea (helmet)|gladiator helmet]] with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://droptoehold.com/post/4287696459/wwf-fist |title=The Rarely Seen Hulk Hogan Fist Helmet – Boston, MA 9/10/88|publisher=''Drop Toehold''|date=April 2, 2011|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE's online comedy series ''Are You Serious?'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwmania.com/john-cena-debuting-attire-tonight-hulk-hogans-fist-helmet-ays-mick-foley|title=John Cena Debuting New Attire Tonight, Hulk Hogan’s Fist Helmet On "AYS?", Mick Foley|publisher=PWMania|date=November 18, 2012|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref>

The Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage's burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|Royal Rumble]] in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] while eliminating [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]], which caused tension, only to be eliminated by the Twin Towers himself.<ref name="acceleratorbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/hogan.html|title=Hulk Hogan's Bio|work=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref> The duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on the February 3, 1989 [[WWF The Main Event#The Main Event II|episode of ''The Main Event'']].

==== WWF World Heavyweight Champion (1989–1992) ====
Hogan's second run lasted a year, during which time he starred in the movie ''[[No Holds Barred (1989 film)|No Holds Barred]]''. The film was the inspiration of a feud with Hogan's co-star [[Tom Lister, Jr.]], who appeared at wrestling events as his movie character, Zeus. Zeus was a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|monster heel]] who was "jealous" over Hogan's higher billing and wanted revenge. Hogan, however, was easily able to defeat Zeus in a series of matches across the country during late 1989, beginning with a tag team match at [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam]], in which Hogan and Brutus Beefcake topped Zeus and Savage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1989/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan & Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake w/ Elizabeth vs. "Macho Man" Randy Savage & Zeus w/ Sensational Sherri|publisher=[[WWE]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810051117/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1989/mainevent/|archivedate=August 10, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}</ref> Hogan and Zeus would later meet at the [[Survivor Series (1989)|Survivor Series]] where the "Hulkamaniacs" faced the "Million Dollar Team". In the early part of the match, Hogan put Zeus over by hitting him with everything to no effect before Zeus then dominated Hogan until disqualified by referee [[Dave Hebner]]. Hogan and Beefcake then defeated Zeus and Savage in a rematch at the [[No Holds Barred (1989 film)#The match|No Holds Barred]] pay-per-view to end the feud. Hogan also had defeated Savage to retain his WWF World Heavyweight Championship in their WrestleMania rematch on October 10, 1989, at United Kingdom-only pay-per-view [[UK Rampage#1989|First WWF UK Event]] at [[London Arena]].<ref name="Hulkbrutus">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/Hulkbrutus.html|title=Mega-Maniacs Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1980s.html#nhb|title=No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie results|publisher=Wrestling and Tournaments|accessdate=April 13, 2008|date=December 27, 1989}}</ref>

[[File:Hulk Hogan Pointing.jpg|thumb|right|Hogan making his way to the ring in 1989]]
During his second run, Hogan won the [[Royal Rumble (1990)|1990 Royal Rumble match]].<ref name="rumble"/> He [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the title to then [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[The Ultimate Warrior]] in a title versus title match at [[WrestleMania VI]] on April 1, 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm6/mainevent/|title=Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan – Intercontinental and WWE Championship Match|publisher=|accessdate=April 13, 2008|date=April 1, 1990}}</ref>

Hogan soon became embroiled in a heated feud with the 468-pound [[John Tenta|Earthquake]], who had crushed Hogan's ribs in a sneak attack on ''[[Bruce Prichard#Brother Love Show|The Brother Love Show]]'' in May 1990. On television, announcers explained that Hogan's injuries and his WrestleMania VI loss to Warrior both took such a huge toll on his fighting spirit that he wanted to retire. Viewers were asked to write letters to Hogan and send postcards asking for his return (they got a postcard-sized picture in return, autographed by Hogan, as a "thank-you"). Hogan returned by [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam]] and for several months, dominated Earthquake in a series of matches across the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1990/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan w/ Big Bossman vs. Earthquake w/ Jimmy Hart and Dino Bravo|publisher=WWE|accessdate=April 13, 2008|date=August 27, 1990}}</ref> His defeat of this overwhelmingly large foe caused Hogan to add a fourth demandment: believing in yourself.

The WWF Championship was decided at the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]] in the Royal Rumble match.

At this time, news sources began to allege that Dr. George Zahorian, a doctor for the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, had been selling steroids illegally to wrestlers in general and Hogan in particular. Hogan appeared on an episode of ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' to deny the allegations. Due to intense public scrutiny, Hogan took a leave of absence from the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20112274,00.html|title=Incredible Hulk?|publisher=People|accessdate=August 9, 2009|date=March 23, 1992}}</ref>

==== Brief comeback (1993) ====
Hogan returned to the WWF in February 1993, helping out his friend Brutus Beefcake in his feud with [[Money Inc.]] ([[Ted DiBiase|"The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]] and [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]]), and officially renaming themselves [[The Mega-Maniacs]], taking on Money Inc.'s former manager [[Jimmy Hart|"The Mouth of the South" Jimmy Hart]] (a long time friend of Hogan's outside of wrestling) as their manager in what was the first time WWF audiences had seen Hart as a face.<ref name="Hulkbrutus"/> At [[WrestleMania IX]], Hogan and Beefcake took on Money Inc. for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]]. Hogan went into the match sporting a cut above a black eye. The WWF used Hogan's injury in a storyline that had DiBiase allegedly paying a group of thugs in a failed attempt to take Hogan out before WrestleMania.<ref name="Hulkbrutus"/><ref name="wm9">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm9/results/|title=WrestleMania IX official results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 14, 2008|date=April 4, 1993}}</ref> Later that night, Hogan won his fifth WWF Championship by [[pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] only moments after Yokozuna had defeated [[Bret Hart]].<ref name="wm9"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454131|title=Hulk Hogan's fifth WWE Championship reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 14, 2008}}</ref>

McMahon then planned that Hogan and Bret Hart would eventually fight in a big match at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]] in which Hogan would drop the title to Hart. Hogan did not want to drop the title in a clean loss to Hart, due to Hart's size and doubts over whether he could draw. He opted to lose the title to the heel Yokozuna instead. At the first annual [[King of the Ring (1993)|King of the Ring]] pay-per-view on June 13, 1993, Hogan defended the championship against the former champion, Yokozuna, in his first title defense since defeating Yokozuna at WrestleMania IX. Yokozuna kicked out of Hogan's signature [[leg drop]] and scored the pinfall after Hogan was blinded by a fireball shot by a "Japanese photographer" (actually a disguised Harvey Wippleman). This was Hogan's idea as he did not want Yokozuna to gain a clean victory over him. The victorious Yokozuna proceeded to give Hogan a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Seated senton|Banzai Drop]].<ref name="acceleratorbio"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html|title=King of the Ring 1993 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=April 14, 2008|date=June 13, 1993}}</ref> This was Hogan's last WWF pay-per-view appearance until 2002, as both he and [[Jimmy Hart]] were preparing to leave the promotion. Hogan continued his feud on the international house show circuit with Yokozuna until August 1993. After that, Hogan sat out the rest of his contract which expired later that year.

=== Return to NJPW (1993–1994) ===
On May 3, 1993, Hulk Hogan returned to NJPW as WWF Champion, defeating [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]] [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] in a dream match at [[Wrestling Dontaku#1993|Wrestling Dontaku 1993]]. Hogan wrestled against Muta again, under his real name, [[Keiji Mutoh]] on September 26, 1993. Hogan also wrestled [[The Road Warriors|The Hell Raisers]] with Muta and [[Masahiro Chono]] as his partners. His last match in Japan was on January 4, 1994, at [[January 4 Dome Show#Battlefield|Battlefield]], when he defeated [[Tatsumi Fujinami]].

Hogan defended the title until July of that year, when WCW [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] him in a match against newcomer and then [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], who had yet to lose a match in the company. Late in the match, Hogan was distracted by [[Karl Malone]], and Goldberg pinned Hogan to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1998072m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro – Monday, 07/06/98|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=July 6, 1998}}</ref>

Hogan spent the rest of 1998 wrestling celebrity matches. His second tag team match with [[Dennis Rodman]] pitted them against [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and Karl Malone at [[Bash at the Beach#1998|Bash at the Beach]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#98|title=Bash at the Beach 1998 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=July 12, 1998}}</ref> and at [[Road Wild#1998|Road Wild]], he and [[Eric Bischoff]] lost to Page and [[Jay Leno]] thanks to interference from [[Kevin Eubanks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/roadwild.html#98|title=Road Wild 1998 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=August 8, 1998}}</ref> Hogan also had a critically panned rematch with [[The Ultimate Warrior|The Warrior]] at [[Halloween Havoc#1998|Halloween Havoc]], where his nephew [[Horace Hogan|Horace]] aided his victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#98|title=Halloween Havoc 1998 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=October 25, 1998}}</ref>

On the [[Thanksgiving]] episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', Hogan officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling, as well as his candidacy for President of the United States.<ref name=president>{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/nov27_hogan.html|title=Hollywood Hogan retires|author=John Powell|publisher=SLAM!

After some time off from WCW, Hogan returned on the January 4, 1999, episode of ''Nitro'' to challenge Kevin Nash for the WCW title. Hogan won the match for his fifth WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but many people found [[Fingerpoke of Doom|the title change]] to be "scandalous".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411037|title=Hulk Hogan's fifth WCW Championship reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008}}</ref> As a result, the warring factions of the nWo reunited into one group, which began feuding with Goldberg and [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]].

==== Conflicts with Vince Russo (1999–2000) ====
He then lost the title to [[Ric Flair]] at [[WCW Uncensored#1999|Uncensored]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage]] [[Professional wrestling match types#First Blood match|First Blood match]].<ref name="OWW"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#99|title=Uncensored 1999 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=March 14, 1999}}</ref> Later, Hogan was severely injured in a Texas tornado match for the world championship featuring him, [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Diamond Dallas Page]], and Flair at [[Spring Stampede#1999|Spring Stampede]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/stampede.htm|title=Spring Stampede|publisher=Thehistoryofwwe.com|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref>

On the July 12 episode of ''Nitro'', Hogan made his return as a full-fledged face and accepted an open challenge from Savage, who had gained the world title at [[Bash at the Beach#1999|Bash at the Beach]] the night before in a tag team match by pinning Kevin Nash. Thanks to interference from Nash, Hogan defeated Savage to win his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110315|title=Hulk Hogan's sixth WCW Championship reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008}}</ref> Nash turned on him the next week, however, and the two began a feud that lasted until the next pay-per-view.

On August 9, 1999, he started the night dressed in the typical black and white, but after a backstage scene with his [[Nick Hogan|son]], Hogan came out dressed in the traditional red and yellow for his main-event 6-man tag team match. He then defeated Nash in a retirement match at [[Road Wild#1999|Road Wild]] to retain his title. Injuries and frustrations were mounting up however, and he was absent from television from October 1999 to February 2000. In his book ''Hollywood Hulk Hogan'', Bollea said that he was asked to take time off by newly hired head of creative [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booking]] [[Vince Russo]] and was not told when he would be brought back at the time. Despite some reservations, he agreed to do so. On October 24 at [[Halloween Havoc#1999|Halloween Havoc]], Hogan was to face Sting for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#99|title=Fall Brawl 1999 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=September 12, 1999}}</ref> Hogan, however, came to the ring in street clothes, laid down for the pin, and left the ring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#99|title=Halloween Havoc 1999 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=October 24, 1999}}</ref>

[[File:Hogan in wcw.jpg|thumb|Hogan in 2000]]
Soon after his return in February 2000, at [[Bash at the Beach#2000|Bash at the Beach]] on July 9, Hogan was involved in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge [[Jeff Jarrett]] for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000716/ai_n13870868|title=No more Hulkamania?

Russo told Hogan that he was going to have Jarrett lay down for him, simulating a conflict, although Jarrett wasn't told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett laid down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, "Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!". After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, "I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!". This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the "creative control" clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [Hogan] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!".

Since Hogan refused to [[Job (professional wrestling)|job]] to Jeff Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.<ref name="acceleratorbio"/> As a result, Hogan filed a [[Defamation|defamation of character]] lawsuit against Russo soon after,<ref name=lawsuit>{{cite book|title=Eric Bischoff: Controversy Creates Cash|author=Eric Bischoff|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn= 1-4165-2729-X|pages=344–346}}</ref> which was eventually dismissed in 2002.

It was the last time he was seen in WCW.<ref name="OWW"/><ref name=lawsuit/>

=== Post-WCW endeavors (2001) ===
In the months following the eventual demise of WCW in March 2001, Hogan underwent surgery on his knees in order for him to wrestle again. As a test, Hogan worked a match in [[Orlando, Florida]] for the [[Xcitement Wrestling Federation]] (XWF) promotion run by his longtime handler [[Jimmy Hart]]. Hogan defeated [[Curt Hennig]] in this match and felt healthy enough to accept an offer to return to the WWF in February 2002.<ref name="OWW"/>

=== Second return to WWF/E ===

==== Undisputed WWF/E Champion (2002–2003) ====
At [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]] in 2002, Hogan returned to the WWF.<ref name="WWEBio"/> Returning as leader of the original nWo with Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, the three got into a confrontation with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]<ref name="nowayout02"/> and cost [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] a chance at becoming the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|Undisputed WWF Champion]] against [[Chris Jericho]] in the main event.<ref name="nowayout02">{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/nowayout02.htm|title=No Way Out 2002 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=February 17, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327162533/http://www.gerweck.net/nowayout02.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=March 27, 2008}}</ref> The nWo feuded with both Austin and The Rock, and Hogan accepted The Rock's challenge to a match at [[WrestleMania X8]]. At the event, Hogan asked Hall and Nash not to interfere, wanting to defeat The Rock by himself. Despite the fact that Hogan was supposed to be the heel in the match, the crowd cheered for him heavily.

During this period, the "Hulk Rules" logo of the 1980s was redone with the text "Hulk Still Rules". Hogan wore the original "Hulk Rules" attire 12 years earlier, when he headlined [[WrestleMania VI]] at the same arena, in the SkyDome. For a time, he was still known as "Hollywood" Hulk Hogan, notably keeping the Hollywood Hogan style blond mustache with black beard while wearing Hulkamania-like red and yellow tights and using the "[[Voodoo Child (Slight Return)|Voodoo Child]]" theme music he used in WCW. On April 4, Hogan feuded with [[Triple H]] and defeated him for the Undisputed WWF Championship and sixth and final WWF Championship at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/backlash2002/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan defeats Triple H to become new WWE Undisputed Champion|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=April 21, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/30445414114|title=Hulk Hogan's sixth WWE Championship reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008}}</ref> thus becoming the last ever WWF Champion before the initials dispute against the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] For Nature.

On the July 4, 2002, episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Hogan teamed with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] to defeat [[Billy and Chuck]] and capture the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] for the [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|first time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413211222|title=Hollywood Hogan and Edge's first World Tag Team Championship reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008}}</ref> They celebrated by waving the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] as the overjoyed audience sang along to Hogan's theme song "Real American".

Lesnar won by [[Submission (combat sports)|submission]] (the match was called after Hogan became unconscious from a bear hug hold). Lesnar became only the second WWE wrestler to defeat Hogan by submission (after Kurt Angle), and the first to defeat Hogan by having the match called. Following the match, Lesnar continued to beat on Hogan, leaving him bloody and unconscious in the ring. As a result of Lesnar's assault, Hogan went on hiatus and was not able to return until early 2003, shaving off his black beard and dropping "Hollywood" from his name in his return. He battled The Rock (who had turned heel) once again at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/|title=The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=February 23, 2003}}</ref> and defeated [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]] in a match billed as "20 years in the making".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/results/|title=WrestleMania XIX official results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=March 30, 2003}}</ref>

==== Mr. America (2003) ====
[[File:Hogan Enters.jpg|thumb|Hogan performing his signature entrance during the ''Hulkamania Tour'']]
Later, he had a run as the masked Mr. America, who was supposed to be Hogan in [[Deception|disguise]], wearing a mask. He used Hogan's ''Real American'' theme music and all of Hogan's signature gestures, moves, and phrases. He was the subject of a storyline that took place after Hogan was forced by Mr. McMahon to sit out the rest of his contract.<ref name="OWW"/> A WWE pre-debut [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Push|push]] took place with mysterious Mr. America promos airing for weeks during ''SmackDown!''.<ref name="OWW"/> There was also on-screen discussion on ''SmackDown!'' between then General Manager [[Stephanie McMahon]] and other players concerning her hiring Mr. America "sight unseen".<ref name="OWW"/> On May 1, Mr. America debuted on ''SmackDown!'' on a ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' segment. McMahon appeared and claimed that Mr. America was Hogan in disguise; Mr. America shot back by saying, "I am not Hulk Hogan, brother!" (lampooning Hogan's use of "brother" in his promos).<ref name="OWW"/> The [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] continued through the month of May, with a singles match between Mr. America and Hogan's old rival [[Roddy Piper]] at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2003/results/|title=Judgment Day 2003 official results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=May 18, 2003}}</ref>

Mr. America's last WWE appearance was on the June 26 episode of ''SmackDown!'' when [[Big Show]] and [[The World's Greatest Tag Team]] ([[Shelton Benjamin]] and [[Charlie Haas]]) defeated [[Brock Lesnar]], [[Kurt Angle]], and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030626.html|title=SmackDown! results – June 26, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=June 26, 2003}}</ref> After the show went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hogan, putting his finger to his lips telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret.

=== Return to NJPW (2003) ===
Hogan returned to NJPW in October 2003. On October 13, he defeated [[Masahiro Chono]] at Ultimate Crush II in the Tokyo Dome.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2004) ===
Shortly after Hogan left WWE, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) began making overtures to Hogan, culminating in [[Jeff Jarrett]], co-founder of TNA and then [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]], launching an on-air attack on Hogan in Japan in October 2003. The attack was supposed to be a precursor to Hogan battling Jarrett for the NWA title at TNA's first three-hour pay-per-view. However, due to recurring knee and hip problems, Hogan did not appear in TNA. Still, the incident has been shown several times on TNA broadcasts, and was included in the TNA DVD ''TNA's Fifty Greatest Moments''.

=== Legal issues ===

==== Belzer lawsuit ====
On March 27, 1985, just days prior to the inaugural WrestleMania, [[Richard Belzer]] requested on his cable TV talk show ''[[Hot Properties (talk show)|Hot Properties]]'' that Hogan demonstrate one of his signature wrestling moves. After consistently refusing but being egged on by Belzer, Hogan put Belzer in a modified [[Guillotine choke]], which caused Belzer to pass out. When Hogan released him, Belzer hit his head on the floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization. Belzer sued Hogan for $5 million and later settled out of court. On October 20, 2006, on the ''[[Bubba the Love Sponge Show]]'', it was claimed (with Hogan in the studio) that the settlement totaled $5 million, half from Hogan and half from Vince McMahon. During his June 23, 2008, appearance on Sirius Satellite Radio's ''The Howard Stern Show'', Belzer suggested that the real settlement amount was actually closer to $400,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/wrestlings-greatest-shoots-wrestlemania-edition-hulk-hogan-vs-richard-belzer/|title=Wrestling’s Greatest Shoots, ‘WrestleMania’ Edition: Hulk Hogan vs. Richard Belzer «|author=The Masked Man|work=Grantland|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>

====Testimony in McMahon trial====
In 1994, Hogan, having received [[immunity from prosecution]], testified in the trial of [[Vince McMahon]] relating to shipments of steroids received by both parties from WWF physician Dr. George T. Zahorian. Under oath, Hogan admitted that he had used [[anabolic steroid]]s since 1976 to gain size and weight, but that McMahon had neither sold him the drugs, nor ordered him to take them. The evidence given by Hogan proved extremely costly to the government's case against McMahon. Due to this and jurisdictional issues, McMahon was found not guilty.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Keller|first=Wade|newspaper=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=July 18, 1994}}</ref>

==== Gawker lawsuit ====
{{Main|Bollea v. Gawker}}

=== Family ===
[[File:Linda Hogan.jpg|thumb|left|Linda Hogan]]
On December 18, 1983, Bollea married [[Linda Hogan (TV personality)|Linda Claridge]]. They have a daughter [[Brooke Hogan|Brooke]] (born May 5, 1988) and a son [[Nick Hogan|Nick]] (born July 27, 1990). Bollea made his personal life the centerpiece of the television show ''[[Hogan Knows Best]]'', which included his wife and two children.

According to an interview in the ''[[National Enquirer]]'', Christiane Plante claimed that Bollea had an affair with her in 2007 while the Hogan family was shooting ''Hogan Knows Best''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hines, Ree|date=February 28, 2008|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23397552/|title=Hulk Hogan cheated with Brooke’s BFF|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> Plante was 33 years old at the time and had worked with Brooke Hogan on her 2006 album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anythinghollywood.com/2008/02/Hulk-hogan-cheating-on-his-wife-with-daughters-pal|title=Hulk Hogan Cheated On His Wife With Daughter’s Pal!|publisher=Anythinghollywood.com|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref>

Bollea is a Christian. Bollea has spoken about his faith in his life saying, "[I've] leaned on my religion. I was saved when I was 14. I accepted [[Jesus|Christ]] as my savior. He died on the cross and paid for my sins... I could have went {{sic}} the wrong way. I could have self-destructed, but I took the high road".<ref>{{cite web|title=Hulk Hogan Leans on His Faith|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/idolchatter/2009/04/wrestlerreality-tv-star-hulk-h.html}}</ref>

=== Health ===
Bollea has suffered numerous health problems, particularly with his back since retiring as a wrestler following the years of heavyweight training and jolting as a wrestler.<ref name="Decline">{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.com/article/index/96230/Hulk_Hogans_painful_decline|title=Hulk Hogan’s painful decline|publisher=TheWeek.com|date=May 15, 2009|accessdate=May 13, 2009}}</ref>

On January 2013, Bollea filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Laser Spine Institute for $50 million, citing that the medical firm persuaded him to undergo a half-dozen "unnecessary and ineffective" spinal operations that worsened his back problems. He claimed that the six procedures he underwent over a period of 19 months only gave him short-term relief. After the procedures failed to cure his back problems, Bollea underwent a traditional spinal fusion surgery on December 2010, which enabled him to return to his professional activities. In addition, the Laser Spine Institute used his name on their advertisements without his permission.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/hulk-hogan-wrestles-with-laser-spine-center-in-lawsuit.html|title=Hulk Hogan Wrestles with Laser Spine Center in Lawsuit|author=Armstrong, David|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2013}}</ref>
