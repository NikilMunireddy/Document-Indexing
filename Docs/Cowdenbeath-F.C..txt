'''Cowdenbeath Football Club''' are a Scottish semi-professional [[Association football|football]] team based in [[Cowdenbeath]], [[Fife]]. They are members of the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (SPFL) and compete in [[Scottish League Two|League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[Scottish football league system]]. Formed in 1881, the club has played at [[Central Park, Cowdenbeath|Central Park]] since 1917. They first joined the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) in 1905. The club has never won any of the major honours in Scottish football, but have won lower tier divisional titles on five occasions. They competed in the top division of the SFL from 1924 to 1934, but have only completed one further top flight season since, in [[1970–71 Scottish First Division|1970–71]].

==History==
{{See also|List of Cowdenbeath F.C. seasons}}
Cowdenbeath traditionally date their origin to the merger of two local clubs, Cowdenbeath Rangers (formed 1880) and Cowdenbeath Thistle, which occurred in 1881.<ref>This continues to be the official date of foundation given by the club. See [http://www.cowdenbeathfc.com/clubinfo.shtml Club Info], Cowdenbeath F.C. official website</ref> However, research by the club's historian<ref>Letter to the Editor by David Allan, ''Scottish Football Historian'' No.47, May/June 1991</ref> suggests the Cowdenbeath Rangers name continued to be used at this time and the founding of Cowdenbeath F.C. should properly be dated to 1882,<ref>David Allan's history of the club on their website supports the 1882 date, contradicting the official date given elsewhere on the site. See [http://www.cowdenbeathfc.com/clubinfo/history.shtml Club Info&nbsp;– History], Cowdenbeath F.C. official website</ref> when another merger saw Rangers combine with a local club called Raith Rovers (formed 1881 and unrelated to [[Raith Rovers F.C.|the present Kirkcaldy club]]). The establishment of one club to represent the town thus coincided with the establishment of the Fifeshire Football Association that year. Cowdenbeath, who are the oldest surviving football club in Fife, lost in the inaugural [[Fife Cup]] final in 1883 but won the Cup for the first time in 1885.

In 1888 the club moved to [[North End Park]], and in 1905 were admitted to Division Two of the [[Scottish Football League]]. They won Division Two in [[1913–14 Scottish Football League|1913–14]] and [[1914–15 Scottish Football League|1914–15]], but were not promoted to Division One on either occasion. The SFL was suspended due to [[World War I]] in 1915, and the club moved to [[Central Park, Cowdenbeath|Central Park]] in 1917. They were placed in Division Two when it was reformed in 1921, and after finishing as runners-up in [[1923–24 Scottish Football League|1923–24]], the club were promoted to Division One for the first time.

The club remained in Division One until being relegated at the end of the [[1933–34 Scottish Football League|1933–34 season]] but claimed their third Division Two championship in [[1938–39 Scottish Football League|1938–39]]. This feat was in no small part aided by Rab Walls' 54 League goals&nbsp;– the second highest seasonal total in Scottish League history. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] cut short Cowden's return to Division One, and the club closed down for the duration of hostilities. When peacetime football resumed in 1946, the club were controversially placed in the new (second tier) B Division.

While a 1949 [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] success over [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] was a highlight of the early post-war period, Cowden struggled to return to the elite level of Scottish football. This was finally achieved under popular manager [[Andy Matthew]] in the [[1969–70 in Scottish football|1969–70 season]], but the solitary season in Division One that followed remains the club's only top flight campaign since the 1930s. More recently, hopes for the future were raised when Cowden were promoted to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1991–92 in Scottish football|season 1991–92]], but they soon slumped back to the basement of the Scottish League amidst a run of 38 League games without a win at [[Central Park, Cowdenbeath|Central Park]].

A more professional approach was ushered in with the appointment of former Scotland defender [[Craig Levein]], who had begun his playing career with Cowdenbeath, as manager in 1997. Promotion from the Third Division was achieved in the [[2000–01 in Scottish football|2000–01 season]], although they would be relegated again two years later. After a third-place finish in the [[2004–05 in Scottish football|2004–05 season]]. The [[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06 campaign]] saw the team achieve their first divisional title win for 67 years with player-manager [[Mixu Paatelainen]] when they won the Third Division.  Season 2008–09 saw Danny Lennon's side miss out on promotion in a penalty shoot-out after a scoreless two-legged match and extra time against Stenhousemuir. However, they were promoted to the second division for the 2009–10 season as [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] were demoted to the [[Scottish Third Division]] after breaching the league's rules on insolvency. After a tough start to life in the [[Scottish Second Division]], Cowden soon found their feet and finished in third place. Amazingly they went on to defeat Alloa and Brechin in the play-offs to secure promotion.

Prior to the 2010–11 season [[Jimmy Nicholl]] was appointed new manager.<ref name="manager">{{cite news|url=http://www.cowdenbeathfc.com/index.php?act=viewNews&id=381|title=Jimmy Nicholl appointed as new Blue Brazil manager|publisher=Cowdenbeath website|author=Cowdenbeath FC}}</ref> They were relegated from the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] on Saturday 14 May 2011 after losing their relegation/promotion play-off semi-final tie 4–2 on aggregate to [[Brechin City F.C.|Brechin City]] with the first leg at [[Glebe Park, Brechin|Glebe Park]] ending 2–2 and the second leg at [[Central Park, Cowdenbeath|Central Park]] ending 2–0 to [[Brechin City F.C.|Brechin City]]. It was a massive blow to the club especially after being 2–0 up at half time in the first leg in Brechin.

Under new manager [[Colin Cameron (footballer)|Colin Cameron]],<ref name="Cam">{{cite news | url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/colin_cameron_named_as_manager_by_new_look_board_at_cowdenbeath_1_1668261 | title=Colin Cameron named as manager by new-look board at Cowdenbeath | work=[[The Scotsman]] | agency=5 June 2011 | accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> Cowdenbeath immediately regained promotion the following season, winning the league with two games remaining.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/leaguedivision2/4272739/Spotlight-on-Division-Two.html | title=Cowdenbeath 2 Forfar 0 | work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | date=23 April 2012 | accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref> The season after, they ensured survival on the final matchday with a 3–1 away win over [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scottishfootballleague.com/football/first/results/3520375/ | title=Hamilton 1–3 Cowdenbeath | work=[[Scottish Football League]] | date=4 May 2013 | accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref>
The following season they avoided relegation again by defeating local rivals Dunfermline Athletic 4–1 on aggregate in the Championship Play Off final thanks to goals from Kane Hemmings, Greg Stewart and Thomas O'Brien.

The following season they finished bottom of the Championship after losing 3–0 on the final day to fellow strugglers Alloa Athletic. Before kick off Cowdenbeath had sat in eighth place but were overtaken by Alloa and Livingston who also won.  Jimmy Nicholl handed in his resignation shortly after the match leaving Colin Nish to rebuild the team for life in Ladbrokes League One. Unfortunately Nish was unable to stop the slide and Cowdenbeath suffered successive relegations, finishing 9th but being defeated 2-1 on aggregate by [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] in the semi-finals of the play-offs. Nish was sacked on the 12th of May 2016.
