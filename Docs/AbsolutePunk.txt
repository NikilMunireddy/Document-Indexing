'''AbsolutePunk''' was a [[website]], [[online community]], and [[alternative music]] [[news]] source founded by Jason Tate (the current [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]).<ref>no byline (2008-10-14). "People", ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', p. 8.</ref> The website mainly focused on artists who are relatively unknown to [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] audiences, but it was known to feature artists who have eventually achieved crossover success, including [[Blink-182]], [[Fall Out Boy]],<ref>Martens, Todd (2007-01-27).

"Falling Out", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' '''119''' (4): 24.</ref> [[My Chemical Romance]], [[New Found Glory]], [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]], [[Taking Back Sunday]], [[The Gaslight Anthem]], [[Anberlin]], [[Thrice]], [[All Time Low]], [[Jack's Mannequin]], [[Yellowcard]], [[Paramore]], [[Relient K]], and [[A Day to Remember]]. The primary musical genres of focus were [[Emo (music)|emo]] and [[pop punk]], but other genres were included.

On March 31, 2016, it was announced that founder Jason Tate would be re-acquiring AbsolutePunk from [[SpinMedia]] (the parent company of [[Buzznet]]) and the website would be shuttered and folded into Tate's new music and social platform, Chorus.fm. The very next day on April 1,  all of the domain names and social media accounts associated with AbsolutePunk were being redirected to Chorus.fm, thus bringing an end to AbsolutePunk.

== Website ==
Founded June 6, 2000 by Jason Tate, the website focused on music industry news, and included album reviews,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/121265739917730.xml&coll=1 |title=Popular names in music part of Faith Nights at Joe Davis|publisher=''[[The Huntsville Times]]''|date=5 June 2008|accessdate=2008-06-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080609233048/http://www.al.com/entertainment/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/121265739917730.xml&coll=1| archivedate= 9 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> interviews, articles, journals and photo galleries. The site also allowed user interaction via a [[vBulletin]] [[Internet Forum]] system; users could register their own personalized account, create a profile, and comment on nearly every portion of the site. Special accounts were afforded to industry figures (such as record label representatives) and band members denoting them as such, with threads often created specifically to allow users to interact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/tags/index.php?tag=/apnet-chat/ |title=AP.net Chats |publisher=''AbsolutePunk''}}</ref>

The website originally started as a [[Blink-182]]/[[MxPx]] fan site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=136183 |title=Interview: Jason Tate (AbsolutePunk.net Webmaster) - 05.14.06|publisher=''AbsolutePunk''|date=14 May 2006|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> In 2005, the site was drawing six million hits daily.<ref>Gundersen, Edna (2005-03-10). "Music fans reach for the stars: Online selections include pop radio hits, but also explore Internet jukebox", ''[[USA Today]]'', p. D1.</ref> By 2006, the website was noted for engaging teenagers, and was beginning to chip away at the dominance of [[MySpace]], according to OMMA online media magazine.<ref>Bainbridge, Jim (2006-06-04). "Gaggle of new networking sites may put end to MySpace's reign", ''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]'', p. L5.</ref>

The social media network [[Buzznet]] purchased AbsolutePunk in May 2008.<ref>Harding, Cortney (2008-07-26). "Under the Influence", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' '''120''' (30): 10.</ref> AbsolutePunk's community included over 500,000 music fans, making it one of the largest alternative music zines on the Internet.<ref>no byline (2008-05-20). "Buzznet Acquires Alternative Music Community Absolute Punk", ''Science Letter'', p. 3577.</ref>

The site was essentially run by contributor-turned-moderators who worked for the site but were not paid. They added news posts, wrote reviews and conducted interviews all in their free time.

==Content==
Even though it lost some content because of numerous server switches over the years, AbsolutePunk still featured over 55,000 news articles, 2500 reviews, 500 interviews, and 52,000 files in its multimedia gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/gallery/index.php? |title=Media Gallery Statistics for AbsolutePunk.net |publisher=''AbsolutePunk''|date=2 November 2008|accessdate=2008-11-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081217033725/http://www.absolutepunk.net/gallery/index.php?| archivedate= 17 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> ABSOLUTExclusives (content exclusive to the website) and recent album reviews were often displayed prominently at the top of the site's news feed, while other stories were simply listed in descending chronological order. The staff conducted frequent interviews with bands and often asked the AbsolutePunk community to contribute questions in advance. They also ran numerous contests via both an opt-in lottery system and through news items, with the latter usually awarding prizes to the users who replied the fastest while meeting certain criteria [such as being able to provide their own transportation to a concert venue].

===Forums===
One of AbsolutePunk's main purposes was to connect music fans with one another through its extensive online forums.<ref>Martens, Todd (2005-04-30). "Site Turns Up 'Purevolume' On Indie Rock Acts", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' '''117''' (18): 24.</ref> The forums featured over 318,500 registered members. They were divided into a number of different sections, split into categories such as [[entertainment]], [[sports]], [[politics]], and [[education]]. Users were encouraged to contribute their own media to the site, such as album reviews and news submissions. As most of the site functioned on the same [[bulletin board system]], forum activity would often spill out into album reviews and news stories as well.

===Accomplishments===
[[Image:I Will Fight wristband.jpg|thumb|200px|AbsolutePunk's orange "I Will Fight" silicone charity wristband]]The website gained a strong following in the alternative music scene over the years, allowing it to sponsor various tours and host or premiere exclusive content from many bands. In the August 2007 issue of ''[[Blender Magazine|Blender]]'', owner Jason Tate was named #18 in their list of Top 25 "Most Influential People in Online Music".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2752|title=The Powergeek 25 — the Most Influential People in Online Music|first=Jon|last=Dolan|author2=Rob Levine|author3=Ben Sisario|author4=Douglas Wolk|date=August 2007|publisher=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref>

On June 1, 2005 vocalist and pianist [[Andrew McMahon]] of the bands [[Something Corporate]] and [[Jack's Mannequin]] was diagnosed with leukemia. AbsolutePunk raised approximately $16,400 for the Leukemia Research Foundation by selling over 6,000 orange [[gel bracelet]]s online. The wristbands read "I Will Fight" in reference to a well-known song ("Watch the Sky") by [[Something Corporate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/index.php?sub=nonprofit|title=Absolute Non-Profit|publisher=AbsolutePunk|accessdate=2008-07-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080721053347/http://www.absolutepunk.net/index.php?sub=nonprofit| archivedate= 21 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
