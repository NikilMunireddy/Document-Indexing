== Career ==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2015}}

=== Acting career ===
[[File:Adamsandler(cannesPhotocall).jpg|thumb|Sandler at 2002 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Early in his career, Sandler played [[Theo Huxtable]]'s friend, Smitty in ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and a stud boy or Trivia Delinquent in the [[Game show|MTV game show]] ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]''. After his film debut ''[[Going Overboard]]'' in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian [[Dennis Miller]], who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]]. Sandler was hired as a writer for ''SNL'' in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including "[[The Thanksgiving Song]]" and "[[The Chanukah Song]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.biography.com/people/adam-sandler-9542505|title= Adam Sandler Biography: Film Actor, Singer, Songwriter, Comedian, Screenwriter (1966–)| publisher=Biography.com ([[A&E Networks]])| accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> Sandler told [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' that [[NBC]] fired him and [[Chris Farley]] from the show in 1995.<ref name="Sandler fired">{{cite news| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_youre_not_alone_conan_obrien_adam_sandler_says_nbc_fired_him_and_chris_farley_fr.html | title= You're not alone, Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler says NBC fired him and Chris Farley from 'SNL'| first= Joe |last=Dziemianowicz| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location=New York City |date= January 21, 2010}}</ref>

In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' with Chris Farley, [[David Spade]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jane Curtin]]. In 1994, he co-starred in ''[[Airheads]]'' with [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Steve Buscemi]]. He starred in ''Billy Madison'' (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father's respect and the right to inherit his father's multimillion-dollar hotel empire; the film received mixed reviews. He followed this film with ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' (1996), and the financially successful comedies ''Happy Gilmore'' (1996) and ''The Wedding Singer'' (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor party-themed comedy/thriller ''[[Very Bad Things]]'' (1998), but had to back out due to his involvement in ''The Waterboy'' (1998), one of his first hits.

Although his earliest films did not receive critical praise, he started to receive more positive reviews, beginning with ''Punch-Drunk Love'' in 2002. [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of ''Punch-Drunk Love'' concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development.<ref>Ebert, Roger. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180308/1023 "Punch-Drunk Love."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''. October 18, 2002.</ref> Sandler has moved outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious parts such as the aforementioned ''Punch-Drunk Love'' (for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]), ''Spanglish'' (2004) and ''Reign Over Me'' (2007). He played a loving father figure in ''Big Daddy'' (1999).

At one point, Sandler was considered for the part that went to [[Jamie Foxx]] in ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'' (2004). He also was one of the finalists along with [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Johnny Depp]] for the role of [[Willy Wonka]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005).<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://splitsider.com/2012/06/the-lost-roles-of-adam-sandler/|title= The Lost Roles of Adam Sandler |author= Bradford Evans|publisher= [[Splitsider]] |date = June 14, 2012 }}</ref> He returned to more dramatic fare with [[Mike Binder]]'s ''Reign Over Me'' (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family in [[9/11]] and rekindles a friendship with his old college roommate ([[Don Cheadle]]). He starred with [[Kevin James]] in the film ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'' (2007), as a New York City fireman pretending to be gay to keep up an insurance scam so that his best friend's children can have benefits. Sandler headlined ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008), a comedy about a [[Mossad]] agent who fakes his own death and moves to the United States to become a hair stylist. The film was written by Sandler, ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' writer-director [[Judd Apatow]] (who was an old roommate of Sandler's when both were starting out), and ''[[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]]'' creator [[Robert Smigel]], and was directed by ''Happy Gilmore'' director [[Dennis Dugan]].

"Like [[Will Ferrell]], Sandler has layers of tenderness under layers of irony under layers of tenderness—plus a floating anger like Jupiter’s great red spot," wrote [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in a review of ''You Don't Mess with the Zohan''. "Some performers become stars because we can read them instantly, others—like Sandler—because we never tire of trying to get a fix on them."<ref>{{cite web |last=Edelstein |first=David |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/47552/ |title=Israeli Stud, Aspiring Hairdresser: Adam Sandler makes his Jewish mother proud.
