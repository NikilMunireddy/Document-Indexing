'''Harlem''' is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. Since the 1920s, Harlem has been known as a major [[African-American]] residential, cultural and business center. Originally a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] village, formally organized in 1658,<ref>Pierce, Carl Horton, et al. ''New Harlem Past and Present: the Story of an Amazing Civic Wrong, Now at Last to be Righted.'' New York: New Harlem Pub. Co., 1903.</ref> it is named after the city of [[Haarlem]] in the Netherlands. Harlem's history has been defined by a series of economic [[boom-and-bust]] cycles, with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harlemworldmag.com/harlemhistory/ |title=Harlem History &#124; |publisher=Harlemworldmag.com |date=January 26, 1934 |accessdate=February 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121213083348/http://harlemworldmag.com:80/harlemhistory/ |archivedate=December 13, 2012 }}</ref>

African-American residents began to arrive en masse in 1905, with numbers fed by the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. In the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West Harlem were the focus of the "[[Harlem Renaissance]]", an outpouring of artistic work without precedent in the American black community. However, with job losses in the time of the [[Great Depression]] and the [[deindustrialization]] of New York City after [[World War II]], rates of [[Crime in Harlem|crime and poverty]] increased significantly. Harlem's African-American population peaked in the 1950s.<ref name="nytimes.com">[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/nyregion/06harlem.html?pagewanted=all "No Longer Majority Black, Harlem Is in Transition." 2010.

New York Times. 2010.]</ref>

Since New York City's revival in the late 20th century, long-time residents of Harlem have been experiencing the effects of [[gentrification]] and new wealth.

[[File:Harlem map2.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Upper Manhattan, with Harlem and its subsections highlighted]]
Harlem is located in [[Upper Manhattan]], often referred to as Uptown by locals. It stretches from the [[East River]] in the east, to the [[Hudson River]] to the west; and between 155th Street in the north, where it meets [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], and an uneven boundary along the south that runs along either [[96th Street (Manhattan)|96th Street]] east of [[Fifth Avenue]] or [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]] west of Fifth Avenue.

'''Central Harlem''' is bounded by [[Fifth Avenue]] on the east, [[Central Park]] on the south, [[Morningside Park (New York City)|Morningside Park]], [[St. Nicholas Avenue]] and Edgecombe Avenue on the west, and the [[Harlem River]] on the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neigh_info/mn10_info.shtml|title=nyc.gov Harlem Community District Profile|publisher=}}</ref> A chain of three large linear parks — Morningside Park, [[St. Nicholas Park]] and [[Jackie Robinson]] Park — are situated on steeply rising banks and form most of the district's western boundary.

{{Main|History of Harlem}}

Before the arrival of European settlers, the area that would become Harlem (originally Haarlem) was inhabited by the Manhattans, a native tribe, who along with other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], most likely [[Lenape]]<ref>{{cite book |title=The Epic of New York City |author=Ellis, Edward Robb |publisher=Old Town Books |year=1966 |page=52}}</ref> occupied the area on a semi-nomadic basis.

However, by the 1930s, the neighborhood was hit hard by job losses in the [[Great Depression]]. In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were out of work, and employment prospects for Harlemites stayed bad for decades. Employment among black New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, including domestic service and some types of manual labor, were taken over by other ethnic groups. Major industries left New York City altogether, especially after 1950. Several riots happened in this period, including in [[1935 Harlem riot|1935]] and [[Harlem riot of 1943|1943]].

There were major changes following [[World War II]]. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harlem was the scene of a series of [[rent strike]]s by neighborhood tenants, led by local activist [[Jesse Gray]], together with the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], [[Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited]] (HARYOU), and other groups. These groups wanted the city to force landlords to improve the quality of housing by bringing them up to code, to take action against [[rat]]s and [[cockroach|roaches]], to provide heat during the winter, and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations.<ref>"Harlem Stirs", 1966, p. 27.</ref> The largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem.<ref>[http://www.nationaltrust.org/magazine/archives/arch_story/112103.htm "A Landmark Struggle,"] Lisa Davis, ''Preservation Online'', November 21, 2003 {{wayback|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org/magazine/archives/arch_story/112103.htm |date=20080204130305 }}</ref> Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords.

By the 1970s, many of those Harlemites who were able to escape from poverty left the neighborhood in search of safer streets, better schools and homes. Those who remained were the poorest and least skilled, with the fewest opportunities for success. Though the federal government's [[Model Cities Program]] spent $100 million on job training, health care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects over a ten-year period, Harlem showed no improvement.<ref>"Harlem's Dreams Have Died in Last Decade, Leaders Say," ''New York Times,'' March 1, 1978, p. A1.</ref> The city began auctioning its enormous portfolio of Harlem properties to the public in 1985.

After the 1990s, Harlem began to grow again. Between 1990 and 2006 the neighborhood's population grew by 16.9%, with the percentage of blacks decreasing from 87.6% to 69.3%,<ref name="gothamgazette.com"/> then dropping to 54.4% by 2010,<ref name="dailyNews201012">[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-12-26/local/27085558_1_whites-million-dollar-homes-black-harlem-residents "Census trends: Young, white Harlem newcomers aren't always welcomed,"] ''New York Daily News'', December 26, 2010</ref> and the percentage of whites increasing from 1.5% to 6.6% by 2006,<ref name="gothamgazette.com"/> and to "almost 10%" by 2010.<ref name="dailyNews201012"/> A renovation of 125th Street and new properties along the thoroughfare<ref>Stern, Fishman & Tilove, ''New York 2000'' (2006), p. 1013.</ref><ref>[http://travel.guardian.co.uk/article/2001/aug/05/newyork.unitedstates.observerescapesection "New boy in the 'hood,"] ''The Observer,'' August 5, 2001 {{wayback|url=http://travel.guardian.co.uk/article/2001/aug/05/newyork.unitedstates.observerescapesection |date=20070227142720 }}</ref> also helped to revitalize Harlem.<ref>[http://www.urban.columbia.edu/people/alumni/2004thesis_pdf/EGothelfThesis.pdf ''The Economic Redevelopment of Harlem''], PhD Thesis of Eldad Gothelf, submitted to Columbia University in May 2004</ref>

In the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West Harlem was the focus of the "[[Harlem Renaissance]]", an outpouring of artistic work without precedent in the American Black community. Though Harlem musicians and writers are particularly well remembered, the community has also hosted numerous actors and theater companies, including the New Heritage Repertory Theater,<ref name="ng1977">"To Live In Harlem," Frank Hercules, ''National Geographic,'' February 1977, p.178+</ref> National Black Theater, Lafayette Players, Harlem Suitcase Theater, The Negro Playwrights, [[American Negro Theater]], and the Rose McClendon Players.<ref>Jim Williams, "Need for Harlem Theater", in ''Harlem: A Community in Transition'', 1964. p.158</ref>

The [[Apollo Theater]] opened on 125th Street on January 26, 1934, in a former [[burlesque house]].  The [[Savoy Ballroom]], on [[Lenox Avenue]], was a renowned venue for [[Swing (dance)|swing]] dancing, and was immortalized in a popular song of the era, "Stompin' At The Savoy".

The company has toured nationally and internationally.  Generations of theater artists have gotten a start at the school.

Manhattan's contributions to [[hip-hop]] stems largely from artists with Harlem roots such as [[Big L]], [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Immortal Technique]]. Harlem is also the birthplace of popular hip-hop dances such as the [[Harlem shake (dance)|Harlem shake]], toe wop, and [[Chicken Noodle Soup (Song)|Chicken Noodle Soup]].

Harlem is currently experiencing a gourmet renaissance with new dining hotspots popping up uptown around Frederick Douglass Boulevard.<ref>[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/video/#!/shows/newyorklive/Harlems-Restaurant-Row/103478474 Nbcnewyork.com]</ref> At the same time, some residents are fighting back against the powerful waves of gentrification the neighborhood is experiencing. On October 17, 2013, residents staged a sidewalk [[sit-in]] to protest a five-days-a-week [[farmers market]] that would shut down Macombs Place at 150th Street.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131018/hamilton-heights/harlem-residents-protest-farmers-market-temporary-pedestrian-plaza|title=Harlem Residents Hold Sit-In to Protest Farmers Market Takeover of Plaza|last=Mays|first=Jeff|date=Oct 18, 2013|publisher=DNAinfo.com}}</ref>

Religious life has historically had a strong presence in Black Harlem.  The area is home to over 400 churches.<ref>"The New Heyday of Harlem," Tessa Souter, ''The Independent'', Sunday, June 8, 1997</ref> Major Christian denominations include [[Baptists]], Pentecostals, [[Methodism|Methodists]] (generally [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|African Methodist Episcopalian]], or "AME"), [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalians]], and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. The [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] has long been influential because of its large congregation, and recently wealthy on account of its extensive real estate holdings. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] built a chapel on 128th Street in 2005. Previously the Church had had a branch meeting around the corner in a former Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall. As of 2015 there are 3 LDS Wards meeting at the Harlem Chapel.

Many of the area's churches are "[[storefront church]]es", which operate in an empty store, or a basement, or a converted brownstone townhouse. These congregations may have fewer than 30–50 members each, but there are hundreds of them.<ref>''Fact Not Fiction In Harlem,'' John H. Johnson, St. Martin's Church, 1980. p.69+</ref> Others are old, large, and designated landmarks. Especially in the years before World War II, Harlem produced popular Christian charismatic "cult" leaders, including [[George Wilson Becton]] and [[Father Divine]].<ref name="HUSAintro">''Harlem U.S.A.,'' ed. John Henrik Clarke, introduction to 1971 edition</ref>
Mosques in Harlem include the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque No. 7 (formerly [[Mosque No. 7]] [[Nation of Islam]], and the location of the [[1972 Harlem Mosque incident]]), the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood and Masjid Aqsa. Judaism, too, maintains a presence in Harlem through the [[Old Broadway Synagogue]]. A non-mainstream synagogue of black Jews known as [[Commandment Keepers]], was based in a synagogue at 1 West 123rd Street until 2008.

== Population and demographics ==
Like most neighborhoods in New York, the demographics of Harlem's communities have changed rapidly throughout the history of New York.

In 1910, 10% of Harlem's population was black but by 1930, they had become a 70% majority.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> The period between 1910 and 1930 marks a huge point in the great migration of [[African Americans]] from the South to New York. This point also marks an influx from downtown Manhattan neighborhoods where blacks were feeling less welcome, to the Harlem area.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> The black population in Harlem peaked in 1950 with a 98% share of the population (population 233,000).

As of 2000, Central Harlem had a black community comprising 77% of the population; however, the majority of African Americans moved out as more and more foreigners began to move in.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/pub/mnneeds_2012.pdf#mn10 Nyc.gov]</ref> Central Harlem is the most famous section of Harlem and thus is commonly referred to simply as Harlem. Central Harlem is home to the famous [[Apollo Theater]].

===Central Harlem===
In 2010, the population of Central Harlem was at 115,000 according to a regional census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neigh_info/mn10_info.shtml |title=Manhattan Community District 10 - New York City Department of City Planning |publisher=Nyc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-28}}</ref> Central Harlem is home to the [[Mount Morris Park Historic District|Mount Morris Park]] neighborhood.

===West Harlem===
In 2010, the population of West Harlem was at 110,193 according to a regional census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neigh_info/mn09_info.shtml|title=Nyc.gov West Harlem Community District Profil.|publisher=}}</ref>

West Harlem, consisting of [[Morningside Heights]], [[Manhattanville]], and [[Hamilton Heights]], as a whole is predominately Hispanic. African Americans make up about a quarter of the West Harlem population.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, Morningside Heights has a large number of [[White Americans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyctouristguide.com/morningside-heights-manhattan.asp |title=Morningside Heights, Manhattan New York City |publisher=Nyctouristguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref> Morningside Heights is known as the "Academic Acropolis of New York". Educational institutions in the neighborhood include [[Columbia University]], [[Barnard College]], and [[New York Theological Seminary]].

===East Harlem===
In 2010, the population of East Harlem was at 120,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neigh_info/mn11_info.shtml|title=Nyc.org Harlem Manhattan Community District Profile}}</ref>

[[East Harlem]] originally formed as a predominately Italian American neighborhood, but its demographics have changed over the years. and it is now known as a predominately Hispanic neighborhood. [[Italian Harlem]] formed when [[Southern Italian]] immigration began in the late 19th century.<ref>[http://www.nycteachingfellows.org/mypersonalinfo/downloads/M.HarlemHistory.pdf Nycteachingfellows.org]</ref> Italian Harlem is notable as the founding location of the [[Genovese crime family]], one of the [[Five Families]] that dominated Italian organized crime in New York City as part of the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] (or ''Cosa Nostra'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanmafiahistory.com/genovese-family/ |title=Genovese Crime Family-One of the "Five Families" |publisher=American Mafia History |date=2012-05-06 |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref>

=== Crime ===
[[File:Harlem riots - 1964.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harlem Riot of 1964]]]]
{{main|Crime in Harlem}}
In the early 20th century, Harlem was a stronghold of the Italian Mafia. As the ethnic composition of the neighborhood changed, black criminals began to organize themselves similarly. However, rather than compete with the established mobs, gangs concentrated on the "policy racket," also called the [[Numbers game]], or ''bolita'' in East Harlem. This was a gambling scheme similar to a lottery that could be played, illegally, from countless locations around Harlem. According to Francis Ianni, "By 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in Harlem, several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city blocks and across three or four avenues."<ref name="ianni">Francis A.J. Ianni, ''Black Mafia,'' 1974</ref>

By the early 1950s, the total money at play amounted to billions of dollars, and the police force had been thoroughly corrupted by bribes from numbers bosses.<ref>"Inside Story of Numbers Racket", ''[[Amsterdam News]]'', August 21, 1954</ref>  These bosses became financial powerhouses, providing capital for loans for those who could not qualify for them from traditional financial institutions, and investing in legitimate businesses and real estate.  One of the powerful early numbers bosses was a woman, Madame [[Stephanie St. Clair]].
The popularity of playing the numbers waned with the introduction of the [[Lotteries in the United States|state lottery]], which has higher payouts and is legal.  The practice continues on a smaller scale among those who prefer the numbers tradition or who prefer to trust their local numbers bank to the state.

Statistics from 1940 show about 100 murders per year in Harlem, "but rape is very rare."<ref name="look1940">"244,000 Native Sons", ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' Magazine, May 21, 1940, p.8+</ref> By 1950, essentially all of the whites had left Harlem and by 1960, much of the black middle class had departed.  At the same time, control of organized crime shifted from Jewish and Italian syndicates to local black, Puerto Rican, and Cuban groups that were somewhat less formally organized.<ref name="ianni"/>  At the time of the 1964 riots, the drug addiction rate in Harlem was ten times higher than the New York City average, and twelve times higher than the United States as a whole. Of the 30,000 drug addicts then estimated to live in New York City, 15,000 to 20,000 lived in Harlem. Property crime was pervasive, and the murder rate was six times higher than New York's average. Half of the children in Harlem grew up with one parent, or none, and lack of supervision contributed to juvenile delinquency; between 1953 and 1962, the crime rate among young people increased throughout New York City, but was consistently 50% higher in Harlem than in New York City as a whole.<ref>''Poverty and Politics in Harlem'', Alphonso Pinkney & Roger Woock, College & University Press Services, Inc., 1970, p.33</ref>

Injecting heroin grew in popularity in Harlem through the 1950s and 1960s, though the use of this drug then leveled off.  In the 1980s, use of [[crack cocaine]] became widespread, which produced collateral crime as addicts stole to finance their purchasing of additional drugs, and as dealers fought for the right to sell in particular regions, or over deals gone bad.<ref>"Harlem Speaks: A Living History of the Harlem Renaissance." Wintz, Cary.</ref>

With the end of the "[[crack epidemic|crack wars]]" in the mid-1990s and with the initiation of aggressive policing under mayors [[David Dinkins]] and subsequently  [[Rudolph Giuliani]], crime in Harlem plummeted. In 1981, 6,500 robberies were reported in Harlem. The number dropped to 4,800 in 1990, during [[David Dinkins]]' mayoralty.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} By 2000, only 1,700 robberies were reported, and by 2010, only 1,100 were reported. There have been similar changes in all categories of crimes tracked by the [[New York City Police Department]].<ref>[http://www.reform.co.uk/filestore/pdf/How%20NY%20cut%20crime.pdf "How New York Cut Crime"], ''Reform Magazine'', Autumn 2002 p.11 {{wayback|url=http://www.reform.co.uk/filestore/pdf/How%20NY%20cut%20crime.pdf |date=20080308165611 }}</ref> In the 32nd Precinct, which services Central Harlem above 127th Street, for example, between 1990 and 2013, the murder rate dropped 89.4%, the rape rate dropped 67.5%, the robbery rate dropped 74.2%, burglary dropped 93.4%, and the total number of crime complaints dropped 77.6%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs032pct.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rwz7n6Cm|archivedate=2010-08-13|title=Compstat – Volume 16 No.4 – 32nd Precinct|date=October 26, 2014|publisher=NYPD Compstat unit|work=Nyc.gov|accessdate=November 5, 2014|format=PDF}}</ref>

== Education ==

In 1977, Isiah Robinson, president of the [[New York City Board of Education]], was quoted as saying that "the quality of education in Harlem has degenerated to the level of a custodial service."<ref name="ng1977"/> Currently the [[New York City Department of Education]] operates district public schools.

{{as of|2006|5}}, Harlem was the heart of the [[charter schools]] movement in Manhattan; of the 25 charter schools operating in Manhattan, 18 were in Harlem.<ref>[http://nycsa.org/NYCS.asp New York Charter Schools Association]</ref> In 2010, about one age-eligible Harlem child in five was enrolled in charter schools.<ref name="NYT-LastStand">[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23Race-t.html?ref=magazine&pagewanted=all ''The Teachers' Unions' Last Stand'', by Steven Brill (Single Page online URL), in ''The New York Times'', in the ''Magazine'', Sunday, May 23, 2010, p.
