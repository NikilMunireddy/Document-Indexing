The '''Atlanta Hawks''' are a professional [[basketball]] team based in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The Hawks compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member team of the league's [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[Southeast Division (NBA)|Southeast Division]]. The team plays its home games at [[Philips Arena]].

The team's origins can be traced to the establishment of the '''Tri-Cities Blackhawks''' in 1946, a member of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) and owned by [[Ben Kerner]] & [[Leo Ferris]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Markazi|first=Arash|title=Long-forgotten Leo Ferris helped devise NBA's 24-second clock, first used 61 years ago today|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14007640/long-forgotten-leo-ferris-helped-devise-nba-24-second-clock-first-used-61-years-ago-today|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}</ref> In 1949, they joined the NBA as part of the merger between the NBL and the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA), and had [[Red Auerbach]] as coach briefly. In 1951, Kerner moved the team to [[Milwaukee]], where they changed their name to the '''Hawks'''. Kerner and the team moved again in 1955 to [[St. Louis]], where they won their only [[List of NBA champions|NBA championship]] in 1958 and qualified to play in the [[NBA Finals]] in 1957 and 1960. The Hawks played the [[Boston Celtics]] in all three of their trips to the NBA Finals.  The St. Louis Hawks moved to Atlanta in 1968, when Kerner sold the franchise to Thomas Cousins and former Georgia Governor [[Carl Sanders]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1966-68: "Sweet Lou" Makes His Debut–Franchise History|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/history/season-by-season-recaps.html#12|publisher=Atlanta Hawks|accessdate=May 5, 2016|quote=On May 3, 1968, owner Ben Kerner shocked residents of both St. Louis and Atlanta when he announced that the Hawks had been sold to Georgia real estate developer Thomas Cousins and former Georgia Governor Carl Sanders. Kerner believed that a St. Louis franchise could no longer compete financially in the NBA; the league now consisted of 14 teams and had to compete with the ABA for supremacy.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=St. Louis Hawks (1955-1968)|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/stlhawks/stlhawks.html|website=SportsECyclopedia.com|date=March 11, 2003|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}</ref>

The Hawks currently own the [[List of NBA franchise post-season droughts|second-longest drought]] (behind the [[Sacramento Kings]]) of not winning an NBA championship at 57 seasons. The franchise's lone NBA championship, as well as all four NBA Finals appearances, occurred when the team was based in St. Louis. Meanwhile, they went 48 years without advancing past the second round of the [[NBA playoffs|playoffs]] in any format, until finally breaking through in 2015. Much of the failure they've experienced in the postseason can be traced back to their poor history in the [[NBA draft]]. Since 1980, the Hawks have drafted only four players who have been chosen to play in an [[NBA All-Star Game]] ([[Doc Rivers]], [[Kevin Willis]], [[Al Horford]], and [[Jeff Teague (basketball)|Jeff Teague]]; [[Dominique Wilkins]] was actually selected by the [[Utah Jazz]] and traded to the Hawks a few months after the draft). Horford and Teague are the only All-Star Hawks to have been drafted since Willis was selected in 1984, and Horford is also the only first-rounder the Hawks selected in their nine-year playoff drought to play in an NBA All-Star Game.

==Franchise history==

===1946–53: Tri-Cities & Milwaukee===
[[File:TriCitiesBlackhawks.png|left|thumb|Original Tri-Cities Blackhawks logo]]
The origins of the Atlanta Hawks can be traced to the '''Tri-Cities Blackhawks''' franchise, which was founded in 1946. The Blackhawks were a member of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]]. They played home games at [[Wharton Field House]], a 6,000-seat arena located in [[Moline, Illinois]], which at that time was part of an area then known as the "[[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]]": Moline, [[Rock Island, Illinois]], and [[Davenport, Iowa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=A Franchise Rich With Tradition: From Pettit To "Pistol Pete" To The "Human Highlight Film" |url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/history/00400483.html |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2008-02-28| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406131013/http://www.nba.com/hawks/history/00400483.html| archivedate= April 6, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> The team featured [[Basketball position#Back court|guard]]/[[Basketball position#Frontcourt (forwards and center)|forward]] and coach Deanglo King, and was owned by [[Ben Kerner]]. Also on the Blackhawks roster was William [[Pop Gates]], who finished second on the team in scoring behind future 1948 [[NBL Most Valuable Player Award|NBL MVP]] [[Don Otten]]. A [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]] member, Gates helped to integrate the league and later become the first African-American coach in a major sports league, coaching Dayton in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/william-p-gates|title=The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame - Hall of Famers|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todaysfastbreak.com/from-the-courts/have-you-ever-heard-of-william-pop-gates/|title=Have You Ever Heard of - William 'Pop' Gates - TFB|author=Kelly Scaletta|work=Today's FastBreak|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>

In 1949 the Blackhawks became one of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s 17 original teams after a merger of the 12-year-old NBL and the three-year-old [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA). They reached the [[NBA playoffs|playoffs]] in the NBA's inaugural year under the leadership of coach [[Red Auerbach]]. The following season, they drafted three-time All-American [[Bob Cousy]], but they were unable to reach a deal and traded him to the [[Chicago Stags]] (who would later surrender him in a dispersal draft to the [[Boston Celtics]] when the Stags folded). The Blackhawks finished last in the Western Division and missed the playoffs. By then, it was obvious that the Tri-Cities area was too small to support an NBA team. After the season, the franchise relocated to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and became the '''Milwaukee Hawks'''.

===1954–65: Bob Pettit era===
[[File:Bob Pettit 1957.jpeg|thumb|180px|Pettit in 1957]]

In 1954, the Hawks drafted [[Bob Pettit]], a future NBA MVP. Despite this, the Hawks were one of the league's worst teams, and in 1955 the Hawks moved, this time to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], Milwaukee's rival in the beer industry, and became the '''St. Louis Hawks'''.

In 1956, the St. Louis Hawks drafted legendary [[Bill Russell]] in the first round (#2 pick). They immediately traded Russell to the Boston Celtics for [[Cliff Hagan]] and [[Ed Macauley]], both Hall of Fame members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html|title=NBA.com: Bill Russell Bio|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/executives/kernebe99x.html|title=Ben Kerner|work=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/russebi01c.html|title=Bill Russell|work=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>

In 1957, the Hawks finished four games under .500.  However, the Western Division was extremely weak that year; no team in the division had a winning record.  They won the division title and a bye to the division finals after defeating the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Minneapolis Lakers]] and [[Detroit Pistons|Fort Wayne Pistons]] in one-game tiebreakers.  They then defeated the Lakers in the division finals to advance to the [[1957 NBA Finals|Finals]], losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in a double-overtime thriller in game seven. In 1958, after tallying their first winning record, they again advanced to the [[1958 NBA Finals|Finals]], where they avenged their defeat against the Celtics from the previous year, winning the series 4–2 and giving the Hawks their first and only NBA Championship. Bob Pettit scored 50 points in the final game of the series.

The Hawks remained one of the NBA's premier teams for the next decade. In 1960, under coach [[Ed Macauley]], the team advanced to [[1960 NBA Finals|the Finals]], but lost to the Celtics in another game seven thriller. The following year, with the acquisition of rookie [[Lenny Wilkens]], the Hawks repeated their success, but met the Celtics in [[1961 NBA Finals|the Finals]] again and lost in five games. They would remain contenders for most of the 1960s, advancing deep into the playoffs and also capturing several division titles.

===1965–75: Relocation to Atlanta===
Despite the success, Kerner became weary of the Hawks' longtime home, [[Kiel Auditorium]]. The 33-year-old arena seated only 10,000 people and was starting to show its age. The Hawks occasionally played at the larger [[St. Louis Arena]], mostly against popular opponents, but Kerner was not willing to move the team there full-time because it had not been well-maintained since the 1940s.  Even though it was being heavily renovated to accommodate the arrival of the [[NHL]]'s [[St. Louis Blues|Blues]] in 1967, Kerner was still not willing to move to the St. Louis Arena.  He wanted a new arena to increase revenue. However, Kerner was rebuffed by the city on several occasions.

[[File:AtlantaHawks1970.png|left|thumb|100px|Logo 1970–1972]] Unable to resolve the arena situation, Kerner sold the Hawks to Atlanta real estate developer [[Tom Cousins]] and former [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia governor]] [[Carl Sanders]], who moved the team to [[Atlanta]] in 1968.  While a new arena was being constructed, the team spent its first four seasons playing in Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum (now the [[Hank McCamish Pavilion]]), winning their first Division title in the 1969–70 season with a 48–34 record in the Western Division.  Cousins' firm soon developed the [[Omni Coliseum]], a 16,500-seat, state-of-the-art downtown Atlanta arena, for the Hawks and the expansion [[Atlanta Flames]] hockey franchise, which opened in 1972 as the first phase of a massive sports, office, hotel and retail complex, most of which is now the [[CNN Center]]. Also in 1972, the Hawks debuted a new logo and new colors, trading the green and blue color scheme that the team had used for two years, in favor of white, gold, and red, the same colors the Flames used. The hawk head silhouette inside a circle remained as the team's logo, albeit simplified.

The years after the move showcased a talented Hawks team, including [[Pete Maravich]] and [[Lou Hudson]]. However, after this period of success, the team experienced some years of rebuilding. Despite appearing to be moving in the right direction when they ended up with the 1st and 3rd picks overall in the [[1975 NBA draft]], the players drafted with those two picks, [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] of North Carolina State and [[Marvin Webster]] of Morgan State, both signed with the [[Denver Nuggets]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] and never played for the Hawks.

====Ted Turner's ownership====
Cable network entrepreneur and [[Atlanta Braves]] owner [[Ted Turner]] bought the team in 1977 and hired [[Hubie Brown]] to become head coach. The Hawks were the only NBA team in the Deep South, just as the Atlanta Braves were the only [[Major League Baseball]] team in the region for many years to come. Turner's ownership was instrumental in keeping both teams in the region. Coach Brown won coach of the year in 1978. In the 1979–80 season, the Hawks finished with a 50-32 record and won the Central Division. It was their first division title in the Central Division and second in the city of Atlanta.

===1982–94: The Dominique Wilkins era===
In 1982, the franchise acquired superstar [[Dominique Wilkins]] and promoted [[Mike Fratello]] to head coach a year later. Due to sagging attendance, 12 home games during the [[1984–85 NBA season|1984–85 season]] were played at the [[Lakefront Arena]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. The New Orleans games were paid for by Barry Mendelson for $1.2&nbsp;million with the Hawks going 6–6 in Louisiana. [[Dominique Wilkins]] won the [[Slam Dunk Contest]] in 1985 and 1990, engaging in an iconic rivalry with [[Michael Jordan]]. [[Spud Webb]] won the Slam Dunk Contest and Fratello won the Coach of the Year Award in 1986.

[[File:Hawks80slogo.gif|90px|left|thumb|"Pac-Man" Hawks logo (1972–1995)]]From 1985 to 1989, the Hawks were among the league's elite, winning 50 games or more each season. They won a division title in 1986–87 with a franchise record 57–25. However, the team could not advance past the semifinals of the Eastern Conference playoffs, losing to the eventual Eastern Conference (and in some years, NBA champions) [[Boston Celtics|Boston]] and [[Detroit Pistons|Detroit]]. The Hawks drafted [[Stacey Augmon]] with their ninth overall pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], who would make the NBA Rookie First Team. However, Wilkins had a season-ending injury in the middle of the season, and without him, the Hawks were unable to make it to the playoffs. In 1992, the Hawks acquired guard [[Mookie Blaylock]] from the [[New Jersey Nets]]; he would spend seven years of his career as a Hawk, leading them in career steals and three-point field goals while earning an All-Star appearance in 1994. After seasons of mediocrity, [[Lenny Wilkens]] was hired as head coach in 1993. In [[1993–94 NBA season|1993–94]], the Hawks won 57 games, tying a team record. They also won a fourth division title in Atlanta, and third in the Central Division. Coach Wilkens was named Coach of the Year for his work with the team. However, the team fell short again in the playoffs, losing to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the Eastern semis in six games. The season was also marred by the trading of Dominique Wilkins, who remains the franchise all-time leading scorer, to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for [[Danny Manning]], who quickly left via free agency to Phoenix after the season ended. On March 6, 2015, Dominique Wilkins received a statue in front of Phillips Arena.

===1994–2007: Average times===
[[File:Steve Smith hawks jersey.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Steve Smith was one of the Hawks' cornerstone players during the mid-to-late 1990s, helping lead Atlanta to three [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Conference]] [[NBA Playoffs|Semi-Finals]] appearances]]
In November 1994, the Hawks traded All-Star forward [[Kevin Willis]] to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[Steve Smith (basketball)|Steve Smith]] and [[Grant Long]]. During the 1995 season, coach Wilkens broke the record (previously held by coach [[Red Auerbach]]) for most victories by an NBA head coach with victory number 939. They ended up fifth in the Central Division with a 42–40 record, they would be swept by the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the first round of the playoffs. The Hawks finished the 1995–96 season with a 46–36 record, fourth in the Central Division. During the regular season, they acquired [[Christian Laettner]] from the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]; Laettner would get an All-Star appearance in 1997. They upset the Pacers in the first round in five games, however lost in five games to the [[Orlando Magic]] in the semifinals.

Around this time, it was decided that the Omni should be replaced by a new arena. The Omni was designed with [[weathering steel]] that was intended to rust into a seal around the arena so it could last for decades. However, the designers and architects didn't reckon on Atlanta's humid subtropical climate.  As a result, it never stopped rusting, and looked somewhat dated despite being 25 years old.  When Turner won an NHL franchise, the [[Atlanta Thrashers]], one condition was that a new arena had to be in place before the new team took the ice for the first time, as The Omni was unusable even for temporary use. Eventually, it was decided that The Omni would be demolished and a new arena for the Hawks and the expansion NHL Thrashers would be built on the same area. Following the 1997 playoffs, the Hawks moved back to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum, with the [[Georgia Dome]] used for larger-capacity games, until [[Phillips Arena]] opened before the 1999-2000 season.

The Hawks had two 50+ win seasons in 1996–97 (56–26) and 1997–98 (50–32), with center [[Dikembe Mutombo]] winning defensive player of the year awards back to back. The Hawks defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs, but lost in five games in the second round to the defending champs [[Chicago Bulls]]. Game 4, an 89-80 loss, would be the last game at The Omni. In 1997–98, forward [[Alan Henderson]] won Most Improved Player award. However, the Hawks would lose in four games in the first round of the playoffs to the [[Charlotte Hornets]]. The Hawks would end up with a 31-win campaign in the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. In the first round they defeated the Pistons in five games again, but they couldn't advance past the second round of the playoffs, as they were swept by the [[New York Knicks]].

In [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999]], their first season at Phillips Arena, the Hawks traded [[Steve Smith (basketball)|Steve Smith]] and [[Ed Gray]] to [[Portland Trail Blazers|Portland]] for [[Isaiah Rider]] and [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]], and sent [[Mookie Blaylock]] and a first round draft pick to the [[Golden State Warriors]] for [[Bimbo Coles]], [[Duane Ferrell]] (who used to play for Atlanta, was waived nearly two months later), and a first round draft pick. Smith and Blaylock had been one of the Hawks' most popular players during the 1990s, and Smith had recently been awarded the [[J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award]] for his charitable endeavors, as well as being selected in the [[1998 NBA All-Star Game]]. By contrast, Rider had a history of behavioral problems both on and off the court.  Rider's troubled conduct continued after his arrival in Atlanta.  Rider missed the first day of training camp and was late for two games.  After reports that he smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in an [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]] hotel room during a January road trip, the league demanded that he attend drug counseling, and fined him a total of $200,000 until he agreed to go.  When he showed up late for a March game, the Hawks released him.<ref>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/text/2000/aug/04/510593978.html Archive for August 4, 2000Las Vegas Sun<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Hawks later traded Jackson away to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] the following season, and Coles joined the Cavaliers during off-season before Jackson was traded. The Smith/Rider trade sent the Hawks into a downward spiral.  After only missing the playoffs four times since 1977, they fell to last place in the Central with a 28–54 record; they would not return to the playoffs for eight years.

[[File:AtlantaHawks1995.png|left|thumb|150px|Hawks logo (1995–2007)]]
Point guard [[Jason Terry]] became the team's scoring leader during the 2000–01 season, leading them with 19.7 ppg. After the All-Star break, the Hawks traded Mutombo to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] for [[Theo Ratliff]] (who did not play for the rest of the season, because of injuries), [[Toni Kukoc]], and [[Nazr Mohammed]]. The Hawks ended the season with a 25–57 record. In 2001, the Hawks drafted Spanish star [[Pau Gasol]] 3rd, but his rights were ceded to the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in a trade involving [[Shareef Abdur-Rahim]]. Abdur-Rahim became the team's scoring leader, and made his only All-Star appearance in 2002. The team ended up 33–49 for the 2001–02 season. The Hawks sent Kukoc to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for All-Star [[Glenn Robinson]] in 2002, Robinson lead the team with 20.8 ppg. But the Hawks still failed to make the playoffs for the 2002–03 season, finishing with a 35–47 record.

In February 2004, the Hawks had the distinction of having NBA All-Star [[Rasheed Wallace]] play one game for the team.  Wallace was traded from [[Portland Trail Blazers|Portland]] to the Hawks along with [[Wesley Person]] for Abdur-Rahim, Ratliff, and [[Dan Dickau]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/02/10/hawks-trailblazers040209.html |title=Blazers trade Wallace to Hawks |date=2004-02-11 |publisher=CBC |location=Canada  |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>  In his lone game for the Hawks, Wallace scored 20 points, had 6 rebounds, 5 blocks, 2 assists and a steal in a loss to the [[New Jersey Nets]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20040218/ATLNJN/boxscore.html |title=Atlanta at New Jersey |date=2004-02-18 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> After the game he was dealt to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in a three-way trade with the [[Boston Celtics]].  In turn, Detroit sent guard [[Bob Sura]], center [[Zeljko Rebraca]], and a first-round draft pick to the Hawks.  The Boston Celtics also sent forward [[Chris Mills]] to Atlanta to complete the deal, but Mills never had a chance to play in a Hawks uniform. The Hawks ended their 2003–04 season with a 28–54 record.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1739128 |title=Wallace lands in Detroit in three-team deal |date=2004-02-20 |publisher=ESPN  |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> In 2003, Atlanta hosted the All-Star game, the last an East team would host for nine years.

====Atlanta Spirit LLC's ownership====
On March 31, 2004, the team was sold to a group of executives by the name of [[Atlanta Spirit|Atlanta Spirit LLC]] <ref>{{cite press release|title=Atlanta Spirit LLC Announces Close of Sale for Teams, Arena|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/news/atlanta_spirit_sale_040331.html|publisher=Atlanta Hawks|date=March 31, 2004|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}</ref> by [[Time Warner]] (who inherited the Hawks, Braves and Thrashers upon its merger with [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]] in 1996). During the off-season, the Hawks sent [[Jason Terry]], [[Alan Henderson]], and a future first round draft pick to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Tony Delk]]. After the change in ownership, the Hawks still struggled. In the [[2004–05 NBA season|2004–05 season]], the Hawks were the league's worst team with a mere 13 victories (five fewer than even the expansion [[Charlotte Bobcats]] and the struggling [[New Orleans Hornets]]). It was also the year Josh Smith won the 2005 Slam Dunk Contest.

Despite their league-worst record, the Hawks only landed the number two pick in the [[2005 NBA draft]] lottery (the first pick went to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]). With the second pick, the Hawks selected [[Marvin Williams]] of [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]. The previous year, the Hawks had drafted [[Josh Childress]] and [[Josh Smith]]. In the [[2006 NBA draft|2006 draft]], the Hawks selected former [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] star [[Shelden Williams]] with the fifth overall pick.

===2005–12: The Joe Johnson era===
[[File:Atlanta Hawks.svg|150px|left|thumb|Primary logo (2007–2015).]]
In the summer of 2005, the Hawks completed a sign and trade deal with the [[Phoenix Suns]] to acquire [[Joe Johnson (basketball)|Joe Johnson]] in return for [[Boris Diaw]] and two future 1st round picks. They also signed [[Zaza Pachulia]] from the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. These changes occurred after an apparent power struggle between the owners for nearly three weeks before the moves were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/news/Hawks_Ownership_Dispute_Resolved_081905.html|title=Hawks Ownership Dispute Resolved|publisher=|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>

Hope and redemption appeared to be on the horizon for the Hawks beginning in 2007.  With the third pick of the NBA draft, they selected [[Al Horford]]. Horford nearly averaged a double-double during his rookie season, and is the only unanimous selection to the All-Rookie First Team as well as being runner-up for Rookie of the Year honors. The season started with a victory against the [[Dallas Mavericks]] 101–94, sending hope to Hawks fans. The last time they won a season opener was in 1998, also the last time they made the playoffs. For the 2007–08 season, the Atlanta Hawks updated the colors and uniforms to navy blue, red, and silver, marking the first time in team history that they had used those colors.

A midseason trade for point guard [[Mike Bibby]] boosted the Hawks' playoff hopes. At the time of the trade the Hawks were 22–28; afterwards they won 15 of their last 32 games to finish 37–45. Although they finished with a losing record, they managed to make the playoffs for the first time since [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]. In the playoffs the Hawks started to show improvement, pushing the eventual NBA Champions, [[Boston Celtics]], to a [[List of NBA game sevens|Game 7]] before losing in a blowout in Boston. The Hawks won all three games at Philips Arena, which hosted its first playoff games and earned its first sellout.

The 2008–09 season saw the Hawks win 47 games, their first winning season since 1999. With almost an intact lineup from the previous year the Hawks manage to take a step forward in their development. Again they were pushed to a Game 7 in the first round but capitalized on home-court advantage earning their first playoff series win since 1999 against the [[Miami Heat]]. The Hawks were swept by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] 4–0 in the Conference Semifinals.

The 2009–10 season saw the Hawks improve further, winning 53 games, their first 50-win season since 1997–98. Al Horford earned his first All-Star selection, and along with Joe Johnson, this marked the first time since 1998 that the Hawks sent two players to the All-Star Game. The playoffs, however, were a reprise from the previous year. They won a hard-fought seven-game series against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], but they were swept by the [[Orlando Magic]] in the second round, with every game a one-sided contest. After the season, the Hawks dismissed head coach Mike Woodson and was replaced by [[Larry Drew]].

The Hawks took a step back in the 2010–11 season, finishing with 44 wins, even though Horford and Johnson were named to the All-Star team. In midseason the Hawks traded Mike Bibby to the [[Washington Wizards]] for [[Kirk Hinrich]], in hopes of bringing a defensive guard to replace the defensively liable Bibby. The Hawks finished the season losing their final six games. In the playoffs the Hawks beat the Magic in six games; however, they subsequently lost to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in six games.

In August 2011, it was announced that California-based businessman [[Alex Meruelo]] was buying a majority stake of the Hawks,<ref name=meruelo>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-hawks/report-atlanta-hawks-philips-1083775.html|title=Report: Atlanta Hawks, Philips Arena sold|first=George|last=Mathis|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=2011-08-02|accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/hawks/2011-08-08-hawks-sale-alex-meruelo_n.htm|title=Alex Meruelo has agreement to purchase Atlanta Hawks|agency=Associated Press  |work=USA Today|date=2011-08-08|accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> but in November he backed out of his intentions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/news/Meruelo_Hawks_Agreement.html|title=Hawks and Meruelo Terminate Agreement - THE OFFICIAL SITE OF THE ATLANTA HAWKS|publisher=|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>

In December 2011, The Hawks signed [[Tracy McGrady]], [[Jerry Stackhouse]], [[Jason Collins]], [[Vladimir Radmanovic]], [[Jannero Pargo]], and [[Willie Green]]. They also picked up rookies [[Donald Sloan (basketball)|Donald Sloan]] and 27-year-old [[Ivan Johnson (basketball)|Ivan Johnson]]. Sloan was waived a month later.

The Hawks finished the 2011–12 season with the fourth best record in the Eastern Conference with 40 wins,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/standings/2011/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Div.html|title=NBA.com - 2011-2012 Division Standings|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref> clinching the playoffs for the fifth straight season. However, the Hawks would be eliminated in the first round by the [[Boston Celtics]] in six games, ending the Hawks' three-year streak of advancing to the second round.

===2012–13===
On June 25, 2012, the Hawks hired [[San Antonio Spurs]] Vice President of Basketball Operations Danny Ferry as President of Basketball Operations and General Manager. During the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Hawks chose guard [[John Jenkins (basketball)|John Jenkins]] with the 23rd pick and power forward [[Mike Scott (basketball)|Mike Scott]] with the 43rd pick. On July 2, 2012, the Hawks traded leading scorer and All-Star Joe Johnson to the [[Brooklyn Nets]] for [[Jordan Farmar]], [[Anthony Morrow]], [[DeShawn Stevenson]], [[Jordan Williams (basketball)|Jordan Williams]] and [[Johan Petro]], as well as a 2013 first-round pick. That same day, the Hawks traded small forward [[Marvin Williams]] to the [[Utah Jazz]] for point guard [[Devin Harris]].

On July 10, 2012, the Hawks signed guard Lou Williams. Six days later, the Hawks acquired Charlie Spaugh from the [[Chicago Bulls]].

On January 21, 2013, following Lou Williams' season-ending injury in a game against the Brooklyn Nets,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2013/01/19/hawks-lose-lou-williams-for-the-season/ |title=Hawks Lose Lou Williams For The Season « NBA.com &#124; Hang Time Blog |publisher=Hangtime.blogs.nba.com |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}</ref> the Hawks signed guard [[Jannero Pargo]] to a 10-day contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/transactions/2012_13/ |title=Transactions: 2012-13 season |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}</ref>

On February 21, 2013, the Hawks traded Morrow to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for [[Dahntay Jones]]. That same day, the Hawks traded a future 2nd-round pick to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in exchange for [[Jeremy Tyler]], who was waived 15 days later.

The Hawks ended the 2012–13 season with a 44–38 record, making a playoff appearance for the sixth straight season. However, they were eliminated by the [[Indiana Pacers]] in six games in the first round.

===2013–present: Mike Budenholzer era===
On May 28, 2013, the Hawks hired [[San Antonio Spurs]] assistant coach [[Mike Budenholzer]] as the new head coach.

The Hawks entered the [[2013 NBA draft]] with four draft picks. They drafted point guards [[Dennis Schröder]] (17th pick) and [[Shane Larkin]] (18th pick). They also chose point guard [[Raulzinho Neto]] with the 47th pick and small forward [[James Ennis (basketball)|James Ennis]] with the 50th pick. However, the Hawks traded Larkin to the Dallas Mavericks for the draft rights of [[Mike Muscala]] and [[Lucas Nogueira]] (originally drafted by the [[Boston Celtics]]), as well as guard [[Jared Cunningham]]. They also traded Ennis's draft rights to the [[Miami Heat]] and Neto's to the Utah Jazz for a future second-round pick.

The 2013 free agency period marked the end of the [[Josh Smith]] era for Atlanta, with the Hawks signing power forward [[Paul Millsap]] to a two-year, $19 million deal and Smith choosing to sign a contract with the [[Detroit Pistons]]. Longtime Hawk [[Zaza Pachulia]] also moved on and signed with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. The Hawks brought back [[Kyle Korver]] with a four-year, $24 million deal. On December 26, 2013, Horford tore his right pectoral muscle, and on December 30, the Hawks announced that he would undergo surgery the next day and would miss the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/12/30/hawks-horford-done.ap/index.html|title=Hawks' Horford to have season-ending surgery|date=December 31, 2013|work=NBA.com|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> The Hawks finished 38-44, their first losing season since 2008. However, due to the weakness of the Eastern Conference, they finished as the 8th seed in the playoffs, and just like 2008, the Hawks would not go down easy, as they took the top-seeded Pacers to 7 games in before a 92-80 loss in Game 7.

{{Main|List of Atlanta Hawks seasons}}

==Logos and uniforms==
Throughout the club's history, the team has undergone several logo and uniform changes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infographic: History of the Hawks Logo and Jersey|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/infographic-history-hawks-logos-and-jerseys|publisher=Atlanta Hawks|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref> On May 1, 2014, the club adopted a stylized version of the 'Pac-Man' logo that it used from 1972 to 1995.<ref name="PacIsBack"/> The 'Pac-Man' logo (placed in a [[roundel]]) would become the team's primary logo after the conclusion of the team's [[2014–15 Atlanta Hawks season|2014–15 season]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome To The Club!|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/welcome-club|publisher=Atlanta Hawks|date=June 1, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref> On June 24, 2015, the team unveiled its new home, road and alternate uniforms, along with its updated logos and colors.

==Rivalries==

===Boston Celtics===
The '''[[Boston Celtics|Celtics]]-Hawks rivalry''' is a [[List of sports rivalries|rivalry]] in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949-50 season, when the then-'''[[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]] Blackhawks''' joined the NBA as part of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] and the [[Basketball Association of America]] merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to [[St. Louis]] as the '''St. Louis Hawks''' after a four-year stopover at [[Milwaukee]]. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the [[NBA Finals]], with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals.<ref name="celticsrecap1950s">[http://www.nba.com/celtics/history/Recap_1950s.html  Boston Celtics Franchise History], nba.com/celtics. Retrieved November 8th, 2012.</ref>  While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable.

===Orlando Magic===
The Atlanta Hawks and the [[Orlando Magic]] have an intense rivalry, mostly stemming from playoff competitions and the rising stardom of [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Josh Smith]], both from the [[2004 NBA draft]] and who were both raised in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The two teams faced each other twice in the [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]] and [[2011 NBA Playoffs|2011 NBA playoffs]]. The Magic had swept the Hawks in the second round of the 2010 playoffs and the Hawks eliminated the Magic 4-2 in the first round of the 2011 playoffs.
