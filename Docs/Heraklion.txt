'''Heraklion''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɨ|ˈ|r|æ|k|l|i|ən}}, {{lang-el|Ηράκλειο}}, ''Irákleio'', {{IPA-el|iˈracʎo|pron}}) is the largest city and the administrative [[capital city|capital]] of the island of [[Crete]], [[Greece]]. It is one of the largest cities in Greece. According to the results of the 2011 census, the population of the city proper was 140,730 inhabitants, the municipality's was 173,993 while the Heraklion urban area  has a population of 225,574{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and it extends over an area of {{convert|684.3|km2|1|abbr=on}}.

Heraklion is the capital of [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion]] regional unit.

The [[Bronze Age]] palace of [[Knossos]], also known as the Palace of Minos, is located nearby.

== Names ==
The Arab raiders from [[Andalusia]] (Iberia) who founded the [[Emirate of Crete]] moved the island's capital from [[Gortyna]] to a new castle they called {{lang|ar|ربض الخندق}} ''rabḍ al-ḫandaq'' 'Castle of the Moat' in the 820s.<ref>''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', ''s.v.'' Iķrīṭish</ref> This was hellenized as Χάνδαξ (''Khándax'') or Χάνδακας (''Khándakas'') and Latinized as '''''Candia''''', which was taken into other European languages: in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''Candia'', in French as ''Candie'', in English as ''Candy'', all of which could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]] name was ''Kandiye''.

After the Byzantine reconquest, the city was locally known as ''Megalo Kastro'' ({{lang|el|Μεγάλο Κάστρο}},{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 'Big Castle' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) or Castro and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi or Castrini ('castle-dwellers' in [[Greek language|Greek]]).

The ancient name Ηράκλειον was revived in the 19th century<ref>it was in use by the local people by 1867, see Samuel Gridley Howe, ''The Cretan refugees and their American helpers'', 1867 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TXcKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA33#v=onepage&q=heraclion&f=false]</ref> and comes from the nearby [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] port of Heracleum ("[[Heracles]]'s city"), whose exact location is unknown. English usage formerly preferred the classicizing transliterations "Heraklion" or "Heraclion", but the form "Iraklion" is becoming more common.

==History==
[[File:Θεά των Όφεων 6393.JPG|thumb|140px|The snake goddess (c.1600 BCE) in [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]].]]
Heraklion is close to the ruins of the palace of [[Knossos]], which in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] times was the largest centre of population on [[Crete]]. Though there is no archaeological evidence of it, Knossos may well have had a port at the site of Heraklion as early as 2000 BC.

===Founding===
The present city of Heraklion was founded in 824 by the [[Saracen]]s under [[Abu Hafs Umar]] who had been expelled from [[Al-Andalus]] by Emir [[Al-Hakam I]] and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a [[moat]] around the city for protection, and named the city  ربض الخندق, ''rabḍ al-ḫandaq'' ("Castle of the Moat"). It became the capital of the [[Emirate of Crete]] (ca. 827–961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.

===Byzantine era===
{{Further|Byzantine Crete}}
[[File:St Matthew of the Sinaites 5313056.JPG|thumb|200px|''St. Matthew of the Sinaites'' Byzantine church]]

In 961, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces under the command of [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]], later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged [[siege]], the city fell. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town was renamed Χάνδαξ, ''Chandax'', and remained under  Greek control for the next 243 years.

===Venetian era===
{{Further|Kingdom of Candia}}
[[File:Gran muralla a Herakleion2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Α part of the Venetian harbour (used as shipyards).]]
[[File:Arsenał Heraklion 931.JPG|thumb|200px|The arsenal]]

In 1204, the city was bought by the [[Republic of Venice]] as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor [[Isaac II Angelus]] to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 m thick, with 7 bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed ''Candia'' and became the seat of the [[Duke of Candia]], and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as "regno di Candia" ([[kingdom of Candia]]). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole [[List of islands of Greece|island]] of Crete as well. To secure their rule, Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from [[Venice]] on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of [[Italian Renaissance]] led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the ''[[Cretan Renaissance]]''.

===Ottoman era===
{{Further|Siege of Candia}}

[[File:Iraklion Agios Titos R01.jpg|thumb|200px|The Ottoman Vezir Mosque (1856), built on the site of the church of St Titus, and now the basilica of [[St Titus]].]]

After the Venetians came the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)]], the Ottomans [[Siege of Candia|besieged the city]] for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, perhaps the longest siege in history. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished.<ref>[http://www.msc.gr/veniva/uk/main/p2.htm The War for Candia]</ref> The Ottoman army under an [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[grand vizier]], [[Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha]] conquered the city in 1669. Under the Ottomans, the city was known officially as '''Kandiye''' (again also applied to the whole island of Crete) but informally in Greek as ''Megalo Castro'' (Μεγάλο Κάστρο; "Big Castle"). During the Ottoman period, the [[harbour]] silted up, so most shipping shifted to [[Chania]] in the west of the island.

===Modern era===

In 1898, the autonomous [[Cretan State]] was created, under Ottoman [[suzerainty]], with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898–1908), Candia was part of the [[United Kingdom|British]] zone. At this time, the city was renamed "Heraklion", after the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] port of Heracleum ("[[Heracles]]' city"), whose exact location is unknown.

In 1913, with the rest of [[Crete]], Heraklion was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Greece]]. Heraklion became capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.<ref>

==Architecture and urban sculpture==

[[File:Kreta - Iraklion - Agios Minas Kathedrale1.jpg|thumb|[[Agios Minas Cathedral]] in honour of [[Saint Menas]], patron saint of the city.]]

At the port of the city dominate the Venetian constructions, such as the [[Koules Fortress]] (''Rocca al Mare''), [[Fortifications of Heraklion|the ramparts]] and the arsenal.

Around the city can be found several sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like [[El Greco]], [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] and [[Eleftherios Venizelos]].

Also, many fountains of the Venetian-era are preserved, such as the ''Bembo'' fountain, the ''Priuli'' fountain, ''Palmeti'' fountain, ''Sagredo'' fountain and ''Morosini'' fountain (in [[Lions Square]]).

==Municipality==
The municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref>

==Transportation==

===Port===
[[File:Boats in the harbour - Heraklion, Crete.jpg|thumb|View of the port]]

Heraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including [[Santorini]], [[Ios Island]], [[Paros]], [[Mykonos]], and [[Rhodes]]. There are also several daily ferries to [[Piraeus]], the port of [[Athens]] in mainland Greece.

===Airport===
[[Heraklion International Airport]], or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], a writer and philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece, because of Crete being a major holiday destination.

The airfield is shared with the 126 Combat Group of the [[Hellenic Air Force]].

===Highway network===
[[European route E75]] runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]], [[Chania]], and [[Rethymno]].

===Public transit===
There are a number of buses serving the city (more information visit [http://www.astiko-irakleiou.gr]) and connecting it to many major destinations in Crete.

===Railway===
From 1922 to 1937, there was a working industrial railway, which connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos, for the construction of the harbor.

A study from the year 2000 investigated the feasibility for two tram lines in Heraklion. The first line would link the Stadium to the airport, and the second the center of Heraklion and Knossos.  No approval has yet been given for this proposal.

In the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymnon and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymnon, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymnon) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Aghios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.

==Climate==
Heraklion has a [[Subtropics|Subtropical]]-[[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are very mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than [[Athens]], it has a milder climate.

Heraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant spirits, including the novelist [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] (perhaps best known for his novel ''[[Zorba the Greek]]''), the poet and  Nobel Prize winner [[Odysseas Elytis]] and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos ([[El Greco]]).
