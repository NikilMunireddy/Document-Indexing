For most boxing organizations, the maximum weight for a [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]] is 200 pounds. Thus, a fighter whose weight is over 200&nbsp;lb (14 st 3 lb, 90 kg) may not fight as anything but a heavyweight.

[[Joe Louis]] holds the record for most consecutive title defenses at this division, with 25 defenses of the Universal title. This is also the record for most consecutive title defenses in boxing history.

===Historical development===
Because this division had no weight limit, it has been historically vaguely defined.  In the 19th century, for example, many [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champions]] weighed 170 [[Pound (mass)|pound]]s (12 st 2&nbsp;lb, 77&nbsp;kg) or less (although others weighed 200 pounds).

The first [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] was [[John L. Sullivan]], known as "The Boston Strong Boy".  He weighed around 200 pounds when in shape and was a bare-knuckle champion.  He was defeated by [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]] on September 7, 1892, in 21 rounds.

In 1920, the minimum weight for a heavyweight was set at 175 pounds (12 st 7&nbsp;lb, 79&nbsp;kg), which today is the [[light heavyweight]] division maximum.  Since 1980, for most boxing organizations, the maximum weight for a [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]] has been 200 pounds.

Since the 1960s, the heavyweight title has become fractured amongst various sanctioning organizations, and so what was once known as the single "Heavyweight Champion", is now referred to as the "[[Undisputed Champion]]" as the one fighter that has defeated all the other titlists.

Other boxing analogies include "punching above his [their] weight" to denote a person or entity (''e.g.'' a country) whose influence is arguably greater than his/its basic attributes would suggest.
