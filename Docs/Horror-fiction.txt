'''Horror''' is a [[genre]] of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of [[horror and terror]]. Literary historian [[J. A. Cuddon]] has defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing".<ref>{{cite book |first=J.A. |last=Cuddon |chapter=Introduction |title=The Penguin Book of Horror Stories |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |year=1984 |isbn=0-14-006799-X |page=11 }}</ref> It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a [[metaphor]] for the larger fears of a society.

==History==
The genre of horror has ancient origins with roots in [[folklore]] and religious traditions, focusing on [[death]], the [[afterlife]], [[evil]], the [[demon]]ic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rosemary Jackson |year=1981|title=Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]]|place=London|pages=53–5, 68–9}}</ref> These were manifested in stories of beings such as witches, [[vampire]]s, [[Werewolf|werewolves]] and [[ghost]]s.

===Gothic horror in the 18th century===

18th century [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror]] drew on these sources with the seminal and controversial ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764) by [[Horace Walpole]]. This marked the first time a modern novel incorporated elements of the [[supernatural]] instead of pure [[Literary realism|realism]]. In fact, the first edition was published disguised as an actual medieval romance from Italy discovered and republished by a fictitious translator. Once revealed as contemporary, many found it [[anachronism|anachronistic]], [[reactionary]], or simply in poor taste&nbsp;— but it proved to be immediately popular. That first novel of Gothic horror inspired such works as ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786) by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]], ''[[A Sicilian Romance]]'' (1790), ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794) and ''[[The Italian (novel)|The Italian]]'' (1796) by [[Ann Radcliffe]] and ''[[The Monk]]'' (1797) by [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]. A significant amount of horror fiction of this era was written by women and marketed at a female audience, a typical scenario being a resourceful female [[protagonist]] menaced in a gloomy castle.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Davenport-Hines|year=1998|title=Gothic: 1500 Years of Excess, Horror, Evil and Ruin|place=London|publisher=Fourth Estate}}</ref>

===Horror in the 19th century===

The Gothic tradition blossomed into the genre modern readers call horror literature in the 19th century. Influential works and characters that continue resonating with film and cinema today saw their genesis in such works as [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], the works of [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890), and [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897). Each of these novels and [[novella]]s created an enduring icon of horror seen in modern re-imaginings on the stage and screen.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |year=1996|title=''Nightmare: The Birth of Horror''|place=London|publisher=BBC Books}}</ref>

===Horror in the 20th century===
The proliferation of cheap periodicals, as early as the turn of the century, led to a boom in horror writing. One writer who specialized in horror fiction for mainstream pulps such as ''[[Argosy (magazine)|All-Story Magazine]]'' was [[Tod Robbins]], whose fiction dealt with themes of madness and cruelty.<ref>[[Brian Stableford]], "Robbins, Tod", in [[David Pringle]], ed., ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers'' (London: St. James Press, 1998) ISBN 1558622063 (pp. 480–1).</ref><ref>[[Lee Server]]. ''Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers''. New York: Facts On File, 2002. ISBN 978-0-8160-4578-5 (pp. 223–224).</ref> Later, specialist publications emerged to give horror writers an outlet, including ''[[Weird Tales]]''<ref>[[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]], "Weird Tales" in M.B Tymn and Mike Ashley, ''Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Weird Fiction Magazines''. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1985.ISBN 0-313-21221-X (pp. 727–736).</ref> and ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown Worlds]]''.<ref>"Unknown". in: M.B. Tymn and Mike Ashley, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Weird Fiction Magazines. Westport: Greenwood, 1985. pp.694-698. ISBN 0-313-21221-X</ref>

Influential horror writers of the early 20th century made inroads in these mediums. Particularly, the venerated horror author [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and his enduring [[Cthulhu Mythos]] pioneered the genre of [[cosmic horror]], and [[M. R. James]] is credited with redefining the [[ghost story]] in that era.

Early cinema was inspired by many aspects of horror literature, and early [[horror cinema]] started a strong tradition of horror films and subgenres based on horror fiction that continues to this day. Up until the graphic depictions of violence and gore on the screen commonly associated with the 1960s and 1970s [[slasher film]]s and [[splatter film]]s, [[comic books]] such as those published by [[EC Comics]] (famous for series such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales From The Crypt]]'') in the 1950s satisfied readers' quests for horror imagery that the [[silver screen]] could not provide.<ref name="Hutchings 2009">{{cite book|last1=Hutchings|first1=Peter|title=The A to Z of Horror Cinema|series=The A to Z Guide Series|volume=100|year=2008|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-8108-6887-8|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> This imagery made these comics controversial, and as a consequence they were frequently censored.

Many modern novels claim an early description of the living dead in a precursor to the modern [[zombie]] tale, including [[Dennis Wheatley]]'s "Strange Conflict" (1941), [[H.P. Lovecraft]] stories such as "Cool Air," (1925) "In The Vault," (1926) and "The Outsider," (1926). [[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'' (1954) would also influence an entire genre of apocalyptic zombie fiction emblematic of the films of [[George A. Romero]].

===Contemporary horror fiction===
One of the best-known contemporary horror writers is [[Stephen King]], known for writing ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'', ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'' and many more.<ref>[[Richard Bleiler]], "Stephen King" in: Bleiler, Ed.

Best-selling book series of contemporary times exist in related genres to horror fiction, such as the [[werewolf fiction]] [[urban fantasy]] [[Kitty Norville]] books from [[Carrie Vaughn]], the [[erotic]] [[Gothic fiction]] of [[Anne Rice]], and [[Goosebumps]] by [[R.L. Stine]]. Elements of the horror genre continue to expand outside the genre. The [[alternate history]] of more traditional historical horror in a novel such as ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'' exists on bookstore shelves next to genre [[Mashup (book)|mash up]]s such as ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'' and the [[historical fantasy]] and [[horror comics]] such as ''[[Hellblazer]]'' and [[Mike Mignola]]'s [[Hellboy]]. Horror serves as one of the central genres in more complex modern works such as [[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'', a finalist for the [[National Book Award]].

==Characteristics==
One of the defining traits of the genre of horror is that it provokes a response; emotional, [[psychology|psychological]] or physical, within readers that causes them to react with fear. One of H.P. Lovecraft's most famous quotes about the genre is that: "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenproverbs.com/au_lovecraft.html|title=Golden Proverbs|accessdate = 15 December 2012}}</ref> the first sentence from his seminal essay, "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]".

In her essay "Elements of Aversion", Elizabeth Barrette articulates the need by some for horror tales in a modern world:
{{quote|text=The old "fight or flight" reaction of our evolutionary heritage once played a major role in the life of every human. Our ancestors lived and died by it. Then someone invented the fascinating game of civilization, and things began to calm down. Development pushed wilderness back from settled lands. War, crime, and other forms of social violence came with civilization and humans started preying on each other, but by and large daily life calmed down. We began to feel restless, to feel something missing: the excitement of living on the edge, the tension between hunter and hunted. So we told each other stories through the long, dark nights...when the fires burned low, we did our best to scare the daylights out of each other. The rush of adrenaline feels good. Our hearts pound, our breath quickens, and we can imagine ourselves on the edge. Yet we also appreciate the insightful aspects of horror. Sometimes a story intends to shock and disgust, but the best horror intends to rattle our cages and shake us out of our complacency. It makes us think, forces us to confront ideas we might rather ignore, and challenges preconceptions of all kinds. Horror reminds us that the world is not always as safe as it seems, which exercises our mental muscles and reminds us to keep a little healthy caution close at hand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://horror.fictionfactor.com/articles/aversion.html |title=Elements of Aversion |accessdate = 2 November 2012}}</ref>}}

In a sense similar to the reason a person seeks out the controlled thrill of a [[roller coaster]], readers in the modern era seek out feelings of horror and terror to feel a sense of excitement. However, she adds that horror fiction is one of the few mediums where readers seek out a form of art that forces themselves to confront ideas and images they "might rather ignore ... [to challenge] preconceptions of all kinds."

One can see the confrontation of ideas readers and characters would "rather ignore" throughout literature, in famous moments such as [[Hamlet]]'s musings about the skull of [[Yorick]] and its implications of the mortality of humanity and the gruesome end that bodies inevitably come to. In horror fiction, the confrontation with the gruesome is often a [[metaphor]] for the problems facing the current generation of the author.

Stephanie Demetrakopoulos illustrates a common interpretation of one of the benchmarks of the canon of horror literature.<ref name="Demetrakopoulos">{{cite journal|title=Feminism, Sex Role Exchanges, and Other Subliminal Fantasies in Bram Stoker's "Dracula"
|author=Stephanie Demetrakopoulos
|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies
|volume= 2|issue= 3|date=Autumn 1977|pages= 104–113|publisher= University of Nebraska Press
|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3346355|jstor=3346355}}</ref> Tina Broussard in an [[annotated bibliography]] of [[Dracula]] surmises Demetrakopoulos' thesis:

{{quote|text=This scholarly journal article explores sexuality in ''Dracula'', including overtones of sexuality in the typical aggressive male and female sexuality which is either reflective of the chaste woman or the sexually aggressive female vampire. Demetrakopoulos suggests Dracula was an outlet for Victorian society, breaking through sexual norms with symbolic group orgies, male desire for sexually aggressive women, denial of motherhood, etc. She highlights ways in which the females defy gender boundaries by embodying masculine traits such as intelligence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsu.edu/faculty/jpullia/2593bibex1.pdf |title=Annotated Bibliography, Dracula |accessdate = 2 November 2012}}</ref>}}

It is a now commonly accepted viewpoint that the horror elements of [[Dracula]]'s portrayal of [[vampire|vampirism]] are [[metaphor]]s for sexuality in a repressed [[Victorian era]].<ref name="Demetrakopoulos" /> But this is merely one of many interpretations of the metaphor of Dracula. Judith Halberstam postulates many of these in her essay ''Technologies of Monstrosity: Bram Stoker's Dracula''. She writes:

{{quote|text=[The] image of dusty and unused gold, coins from many nations and old unworn jewels, immediately connects Dracula to the old money of a corrupt class, to a kind of piracy of nations and to the worst excesses of the aristocracy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/30740375/913659240/name/halberstam%2Bdracula.pdf |title=Technologies of Monstrosity |accessdate = 2 November 2012}}</ref>}}

Halberstram articulates a view of Dracula as manifesting the growing perception of the [[aristocracy]] as an evil and outdated notion to be defeated. The depiction of a multinational band of [[protagonists]] using the latest [[technologies]] (such as a [[telegraph]]) to quickly share, collate, and act upon new information is what leads to the destruction of the Vampire. This is one of many interpretations of the metaphor of only one central figure of the canon of horror fiction, as over a dozen possible metaphors are referenced in analysis, from the religious to the [[anti-semitic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsu.edu/faculty/jpullia/dracula.htm |title=Lecture Notes for Dracula |accessdate = 2 November 2012}}</ref>

[[Noël Carroll]]'s ''Philosophy of Horror'' postulates that a modern piece of horror fiction's "[[monster]]", [[villain]], or a more inclusive [[wikt:menace|menace]] must exhibit the following two traits:
* A menace that is threatening&nbsp;— either physically, psychologically, socially, morally, spiritually, or some combination of the aforementioned.
* A menace that is impure&nbsp;— that violates the generally accepted schemes of cultural categorization. "We consider impure that which is categorically contradictory"<ref name=Redlodge>{{cite web |url=http://redlodge.schoolwires.com/59610818143418910/lib/59610818143418910/_files/horror.pdf |publisher=Redlodge |title=Elements of Horror |accessdate = 2 November 2012}}</ref>

==Scholarship and criticism==
In addition to those essays and articles shown above, scholarship on horror fiction is almost as old as horror fiction itself. In 1826, the gothic novelist [[Ann Radcliffe]] published an essay distinguishing two elements of horror fiction, "terror" and "horror." Whereas terror is a feeling of dread that takes place before an event happens, horror is a feeling of revulsion or disgust after an event has happened.<ref>[[Anne Radcliffe]], "On the Supernatural in Poetry", ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' 7 (1826): 145–52.</ref> Radcliffe describes terror as that which "expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life," whereas horror is described as that which "freezes and nearly annihilates them."

Modern scholarship on horror fiction draws upon a range of sources. In their historical studies of the gothic novel, both Devandra Varma<ref>Devandra Varma, ''The Gothic Flame'' (New York: Russell & Russell, 1966.</ref> and S.L. Varnado<ref>S.L. Varnado, "The Idea of the Numinous in Gothic Literature," in The Gothic Imagination, ed. G.R. Thompson (Pullman: Washington State University Press, 1974).</ref> make reference to the theologian [[Rudolf Otto]], whose concept of the "[[numinous]]" was originally used to describe religious experience.

==Awards and associations==
Achievements in horror fiction are recognized by numerous awards. The [[Horror Writer's Association]] presents the [[Bram Stoker Awards]] for Superior Achievement, named in honor of [[Bram Stoker]], author of the seminal horror novel ''[[Dracula]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.horror.org/stokers.htm|title= The Bram Stoker Awards|publisher= Horror Writer's Association |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref> The [[Australian Horror Writers Association]] presents annual [[Australian Shadows Awards]]. The [[International Horror Guild Award]] was presented annually to works of horror and dark fantasy from 1995 to 2008.<ref name="IHG Recipients 1">{{cite web |url=http://www.horroraward.org/prevrec.html |title=IHG Award Recipients 1994–2006 |website=HorrorAward.org |accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="IHG Recipients 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.horroraward.org/index.html |title=IHG Award Recipients 2007 |website=HorrorAward.org |accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> The [[Shirley Jackson Awards]] are literary awards for outstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense, horror and the dark fantastic works. Other important awards for horror literature are as subcategories included within general awards for fantasy and science fiction in such awards as the [[Aurealis Award]].

==Alternate terms==
Some writers of fiction normally classified as "horror" nevertheless dislike the term, considering it too lurid. They instead use the terms [[dark fantasy]] or [[Gothic fiction|Gothic fantasy]] for supernatural horror,<ref>[[Brian Stableford]], "Horror", in ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'' (p. 204), Scarecrow Press, Plymouth. 2005. ISBN 0-8108-6829-6.</ref> or "[[psychological thriller]]" for non-supernatural horror.<ref>Brian Stableford, "The Discovery of Secondary Worlds:Some Notes on the Aesthetics and
Methodology of Heterocosmic Creativity", in ''Heterocosms''. Wildside Press LLC, 2007 ISBN 0809519070 (p. 200).</ref>
