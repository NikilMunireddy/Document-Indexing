==History==
{{prose|section|date=April 2015}}

Idea and Design Works (IDW) was formed in 1999 by a group of entertainment executives and artists that included Ted Adams, Robbie Robbins, Alex Garner, and Kris Oprisko to develop products related to video games, movies, TV, collectible card games, comic books and trading cards. In 2000, Idea and Design Works formed its publishing division, IDW Publishing and in 2007, IDT purchased a majority interest in IDW. Two of the original founders, Adams (CEO and Publisher) and Robbins (EVP), still actively manage the company, which has grown into a fully staffed publishing company.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2007, [[IDT Corp.|IDT Corporation]] purchased a majority interest in IDW. In 2009, [[IDT Corp.|IDT]] created CTM Media Holdings via a tax-free spin-off. This new company consists of the majority interest in IDW and CTM Media Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctmholdings.com/index.html|title=CTM HOLDINGS|author=|date=|work=ctmholdings.com|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>
