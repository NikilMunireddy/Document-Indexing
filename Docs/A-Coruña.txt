'''A Coruña''' ({{IPA-gl|a koˈɾuɲa|lang}} official name, {{lang-es|link=no|La Coruña}} {{IPA-es|la koˈɾuɲa|pron}}, {{lang-en|link=no|Corunna}}) is a city and [[municipality]] of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain. It is the second-largest city in the [[autonomous community]] and [[List of municipalities of Spain|seventeenth]] overall in the country. The city is the provincial capital of the province of the same [[A Coruña (province)|name]], having also served as political capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]<ref>"La Coruña, capital militar y administrativa del Reino..." {{cite book|last=de Artaza|first=Manuel María|title=Rey, reino y representación: la Junta General del Reino de Galicia (1599–1834)|year=1998|publisher=Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-00-07779-2|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4fyNO2JKWAC&lpg=PA455&dq=capital%20del%20reino%20de%20galicia&hl=en&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>"The city of Corunna, Armory, Capital, and Head of the Kingdom of Galicia..."

A Coruña is a busy port located on a [[promontory]] in the entrance of an estuary in a large gulf (the ''Portus Magnus Artabrorum'' of the classical geographers) on the Atlantic Ocean. It provides a distribution point for agricultural goods from the region.

==Name==
In English, use of the Spanish or Galician forms now predominates. However, the traditional form Corunna {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ʌ|n|ə}} can still be found, particularly in reference to the [[Battle of Corunna]] in the [[Peninsular War]]. Archaically, the city was known as The Groyne, probably from French "La Corogne", although this name could also be as much a geographical description given the city occupies a small peninsula protruding out into the Atlantic.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
In Spain, currently the only official form of the name is the [[Galician language|Galician]] one, "A Coruña".<ref>Decree of the ''Xunta de Galicia'' 146/1984, 27 September,[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/l2-1998.html Ley 2/1998, de 3 de marzo, sobre el cambio de denominación de las provincias de La Coruña y Orense.] which follows on the principles of Law 3/1983, 15 June, of Linguistic Normalization, article 10 [http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&id=1983/90056&codmap= BOE.es: Consultas. Documento]</ref> Nonetheless, the Spanish form, La Coruña, is still widespread, and it is the traditional name in Spanish recommended by the ''[[Real Academia Española]]'' for texts in Spanish.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?origen=RAE&lema=La%20Coru%F1a La Coruña] in DPD</ref> Certain groups of people have advocated elevating the [[Reintegrationism|reintegrationist]] spelling "A Corunha" to official status, pointing to the provisions of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] and claiming that it is unconstitutional to stipulate use of the ''[[Royal Galician Academy|Real Academia Galega]]'' spelling, but have not been successful so far.
===Origin===

There is no clear evidence as to what word the name derives from. It seems to be from ''Crunia'', of unknown origin and meaning. At the time of [[Ferdinand II of León]] (12th century) the name ''Crunia'' was documented for the first time. As usual in Galician-Portuguese (as well as in Castilian Spanish), the cluster ''ni'' naturally evolved into the sound {{IPAblink|ɲ}}, written ''n'', ''nn'' or ''nh'' in old Galician orthography, ''nn'' in Spanish (later abbreviated to ''[[ñ]]'', as well as the original Latin cluster "nn"), and ''nh'' in Portuguese and alternative Galician spelling. 'A' is the Galician article equivalent to English ''the''; compare Castilian Spanish ''la'' ("the").

One proposed etymology derives ''Crunia'' from ''[[Cluny]]'', the town and religious order from France. During its height (c. 950–c.1130) the [[Cluniac]] movement was one of the largest religious forces in Europe. There is another town named ''Coruña'' in [[Burgos (province)|Burgos Province]].

Another possibility is that the name means simply "The Crown". The Galician word for crown is ''coroa'', but the Irish word is ''coróin'' with a dative form of ''gcoróin'', similar to the old attested form ''The Groyne''. This form would seem closer to Coruña, and its dative form nearly identical to "Groyne" in pronunciation. It is also possible it came about through changes to the French "La Couronne", also meaning "the Crown". It seems less likely that it traces back to the Galician "clunia" or the Irish "cluain" meaning field or meadow. The city's mythic history as the home of King Breogán (see below), or of the site of Hercules' killing of King Geryon, as well as the crown on the skull and crossbones, may be leftover memories of A Coruña having once been the "seat of the Crown."

A more poetic explanation of the name sustains that "Coruña" derives from Gaelic (the language of Celtic tribes) "Cork Orunnach", which would mean "The harbour of the brave men". This explanation could have some relation to the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]] (The Book of the Taking of Ireland), which recounts the story of how the Celtic or [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]] king [[Breogan|Breogán]] founded the city of Brigantia (now Coruña) and his descendant Ith, who spies Ireland from the top of Breogán's Tower (thought to have been at the current location of the Torre de Hercules, a city landmark), journeys north across the [[Celtic Sea]] to Ireland to investigate his discovery.

A folk etymology incorrectly derives ''Coruña'' from the ancient ''columna'', or [[Tower of Hercules]], which still exists, having been converted into a light-house in 1791.<ref>{{en icon}} Converted into a light-house date and other details taken from  the [[Universal Pronouncing Gazetteer By Thomas Baldwin]], ''Sixth Edition'',  (1847).

==Geography==
A Coruña is located on a peninsula, and its isthmus was at times formed only by a small strip of sand. Erosion and sea currents caused a progressive accumulation of sand, enlarging it to its present dimensions.

A Coruña and [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, constitute one of only [[antipodes#Cities|eight pairs of cities]] in the world that are almost exactly [[antipodes|antipodal]].

===Climate===
The climate of A Coruña is [[Oceanic climate|temperate maritime]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Cfb), heavily moderated by the Atlantic Ocean. Autumn and winter are often unsettled and unpredictable, with strong winds and abundant rainfall coming from Atlantic [[Low pressure area|depressions]], and it is often overcast. The ocean keeps temperatures mild, and frost and snow are rare. In summer, it is quite dry and sunny, with only occasional rainfall; temperatures are warm but rarely uncomfortably hot because of the sea's cooling influence during the day, most often being around {{convert|22|C|F}} between July and September. Spring is usually cool and fairly calm. Even the warmest month on record was relatively subdued, being August 2003 with an average high temperature of {{convert|25|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=gal&l=1387&datos=det&x=1387&m=13&v=TMMA|title=Extreme values for A Coruña|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref> Temperatures above {{convert|25|C|F}} occur many days in the summer, while temperatures above {{convert|30|C|F}} are infrequent.

==History==
{{Main|History of A Coruña}}

===Prehistory===
[[File:La Coruña rosa vientos.JPG|thumb|[[Compass rose]] representing the different [[Celts|Celtic]] peoples (near the Tower of Hercules).]]

[[File:Elviña aceso a croa lado oposto.JPG|thumb|[[Castro culture|Castro de Elviña]]: remnant of a [[Celts|Celtic]] military structure in A Coruña.]]
A Coruña spread from the peninsula where the [[Tower of Hercules]] stands, onto the mainland. The oldest part, known popularly in Galician as Cidade Vella (Old City), Cidade Alta (High City) or the Cidade (City), is built on an ancient Celtic castro. It was supposedly inhabited by the [[Artabrians]], the Celtic tribe of the area.

===Roman times===
The Romans came to the region in the 2nd century BC, and the colonisers made the most of the strategic position and soon the city became quite important in maritime trade. In 62&nbsp;BC Julius Caesar came to the city (known at the time as Brigantium) in pursuit of the metal trade, establishing commerce with what are now France, England and Portugal. The town began growing, mainly during the 1st and 2nd centuries (when the Farum Brigantium [[Tower of Hercules]] was built), but declined after the 4th century and especially with the [[Normans|incursions of the Normans]], which forced the population to flee towards the interior of the Estuary of O Burgo.

===Middle Ages===
After the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], A Coruña still had a commercial port connected to foreign countries, but contacts with the Mediterranean were slowly replaced by a more Atlantic-oriented focus.
The process of deurbanisation that followed the fall of the Roman Empire also affected A Coruña. Between the 7th and 8th centuries, the city was no more than a little village of labourers and sailors.

The 11th-century ''Chronica iriense'' names Faro do Burgo (ancient name of A Coruña) as one of the dioceses that king [[Miro (Suevic king)|Miro]] granted to the episcopate of [[Iria Flavia]] in the year 572:

:''"Mirus Rex Sedi suae Hiriensi contulit Dioceses, scilicet Morratium, Salinensem, (...) Bregantinos, Farum..."''

:"[King Miro granted to his Irienses headquarters the dioceses of Morrazo, Salnés (...). Bergantiños, Faro...]"

The Muslim invasion of the Iberian peninsula left no archaeological evidence in the northwest, so it cannot be said whether or not the Muslim invaders ever reached the city. As Muslim rule in early 8th century Galicia consisted little more than a short-lived overlordship of the remote and rugged region backed by a few garrisons, and the city was no more than a village amidst Roman ruins, the invaders showed the same lack of interest in the ruined city as they did generally for the region.

As the city began to recover during the [[Middle Ages]] the main problem for the inhabitants was the [[Norman people|Norman]] raids, as well as the ever present threat of raids ("razzies") from [[Al-Andalus]] to the south. During 9th century there were several [[Viking]] attacks on the city, called at that time Faro or Faro Bregancio.

In the year 991, King [[Bermudo II of León|Vermudo II]] began the construction of defensive military positions on the coast. At Faro, in the ruins of the [[Tower of Hercules]], a fortress was built, which had a permanent military garrison. To pay for it, he gave power over the city to the bishop of [[Bishopric of Santiago|Santiago]]. The bishop of Santiago became the most important political post in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and remained so until the 15th century.

[[File:Castillo de San Antón 1.jpg|thumb|{{Ill|es|San Antón Castle|Castillo de San Antón (La Coruña)}}]]
In 1208, [[Alfonso IX]] re-founded the city of ''Crunia''. Some privileges, such as those of disembarking and selling [[salt]] without paying taxes, were granted to the city, and it enjoyed a big growth in fishing and mercantile business. The city grew and extended through the isthmus. In 1446 [[John II of Castile]] granted to A Coruña the title of "City". The [[Catholic Monarchs]] established the Royal Audience of the Kingdom of Galicia in the city, instead of [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]]. A Coruña also became the headquarters of the [[Captaincy General]]. Later, in 1522, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] conceded to the city of La Coruña the license to establish the [[:es:Casa de la Especiería|House of Spices]], being this the port chosen by Jofre Garcia de Loysa to set his expedition to conquer the [[Moluccans]].

In the late Middle Ages, before the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews in 1492]], a thriving Jewish community created a rich artistic heritage in the city. The most lavishly illuminated Hebrew Bible in medieval Spain was created in A Coruña in 1476. Known as the Kennicott Bible, it is currently housed in the [[Bodleian Library, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://bodleian.thejewishmuseum.org/?page_id=155 | title = The Kennicott Bible, A Medieval Masterpiece | accessdate = October 16, 2013 | publisher = bodleian.thejewishmuseum}}</ref>

===Modern period===
During the [[Modern history|Modern period]], the city was a port and centre for the manufacturing of textiles. In 1520, king [[Charles I of Spain|Carlos I]] of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], met in the courts of A Coruña and embarked from its harbour to be elected Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (as Charles V). He allowed the government of the Kingdom of Galicia to distribute space in Europe between 1522 and 1529. Commerce with the [[Indies]] was allowed between 1529 and 1575. The Castle of San Antón was built as a defense of the city and its harbour.

From the port of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] in the [[A Coruña (province)|Province of A Coruña]], [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] left to marry [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] in 1554, and much later, in 1588, from the same port the [[Spanish Armada]] would set sail to the [[Low Countries|Spanish Netherlands]] and England.
In the following year, during the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]], [[Francis Drake]] besieged A Coruña, but was repelled, starting the legend of [[María Pita]], a woman who took her dead husband's spear, killed the flag bearer of the British forces and rallied support to deny a breach in the wall to the enemy.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the wars of the Spanish monarchy caused a great increase in taxes and the start of conscription. In 1620, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] created the School of the Boys of the Sea. In 1682 the Tower of Hercules was restored by [[Antúnez]].

===19th century===
[[File:Battle of Corunna.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mosaic]] map to commemorate the Battle of Elviña. The yellow dot shows the location of the mosaic.]]
[[File:Obelisco.La Coruña.004.JPG|thumb|upright|The Obelisk, dedicated to Don Aureliano Linares Rivas in 1895]]

A Coruña was the site of the [[Battle of Corunna]] during the [[Peninsular War]], on 16 January 1809, in which British troops fought against the French to cover the embarkation of British troops after their retreat. In this battle [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]] was killed.

Spanish resistance during the Peninsular War was led by Sinforiano López, and A Coruña was the only [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] city that achieved success against the French troops.  French troops left Galicia at the end of May 1809.

During the 19th century, the city was the centre of anti-monarchist sentiment.
On August 19, 1815, Juan Díaz Porlier, pronounced against [[Fernando VII]] in defense of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]]. He was supported by the [[bourgeoisie]] and the educated people. But on August 22 he was betrayed. He was hanged in the Campo da Leña two months later.
In all the 19th-century rebellions, A Coruña supported the [[Liberalism|liberal]] side.
A Coruña also played an important role in the [[Rexurdimento]], and there were founded the [[Galician Royal Academy]] in 1906 and the Brotherhoods of the Galician Language in 1916.

Regarding the economy, in 1804 the National Cigarette Factory was founded, and there the workers' movement of the city had its origins. During the 19th century other businesses (glass, foundries, textiles, gas, matches, etc.) were slowly established, but it was  maritime trade and migrant travel that attracted Catalan, Belgian, French and English investments. The Bank of A Coruña was founded in 1857. The new provincial division of 1832 also influenced  economic development.

===20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, A Coruña had about 45,000 inhabitants. The Great Depression, Spanish Civil War severely affected the economy through the 1930s to the mid-1950s. The 1960s and early 1970s saw a dramatic economic recovery, which was part of the wider [[Spanish Miracle]]. The international [[1970s energy crisis|oil shocks]] of the mid and late 1970s severely disrupted the economy, causing many bankruptcies and high unemployment until the mid-1980s, when slower but steady economic development was resumed.

====Elections of 1931====
In the [[Spanish general elections, 1931]], all the political parties knew that the electoral results had important political consequences. The campaign of Unión Monárquica was very important in A Coruña and was supported by ''[[El Ideal Gallego]]''. Republicans and socialists constituted a block, made up of ORGA<!--the article linked from ORGA is a company making smart cards-->, independent republicans, [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and the [[Radical Socialist Republican Party]].

In the elections, the republican parties obtained 34 of the 39 council seats. The best results were of the ORGA and of the Partido Radical Socialista, and the [[Radical Republican Party]] lost a lot of support.

====Democracy returns====
From 1983 to 2006, the mayor of the city was Francisco Vázquez Vázquez ([[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]]), and the city became devoted to services, but he also was criticised because of his being openly against [[Galician nationalism]] and his town-planning policies.

On 20 January 2006 Vázquez was named ambassador to the [[Vatican City]], and was later replaced by Francisco Javier Losada de Azpiazu. In 2007 Municipal Elections the local government was a coalition of the [[Socialist Party of Galicia]] and the left-wing nationalist [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] party. The city celebrated its first [[millennium]] in 2008.

In the 2011 Municipal Elections, the conservative candidate Carlos Negreira ([[People's Party (Spain)|PP]]) obtained a majority, the first one for the People's Party in the city since the arrival of democracy.

===The province and city of A Coruña during the 20th century===

After the [[Peninsula War|War of Independence]] (1808–1814), the fortunes of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] began to deteriorate. The largest port in northern Spain, site of one of the three [[Royal Dockyard]]s, together with [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and [[Cádiz]], almost  became a "dead" town during the reign of [[Ferdinand VII]]. By 1833 the City and Naval Station of Ferrol saw its civilian population reduced to 13,000.<ref>{{en icon}} Population figures and other data taken from  the [[Universal Pronouncing Gazetteer By Thomas Baldwin]], ''Sixth Edition'',  (1847). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=-7MBAAAAYAAJ&dq=universal+pronouncing+gazetteer+by+thomas+baldwin&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=QQYLcgizRX&sig=zfw6It6B7cOnYiHWa9FGAv10BVM]
</ref> During the administration of the marquess of [[March of Molina|Molina]], Minister for Naval affairs in the mid-19th century new activities sprang up, but Ferrol never fully returned to its former glory. It should be noted that during those years, most of the [[Latin America|Spanish colonies in Latin America]] succeeded in gaining independence from their former [[metropolis]].

[[File:Torre de Hércules - DivesGallaecia2012-62.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic King Breogan in A Coruña]]
The population of the City of A Coruña in 1900 reached 43,971, while the population of the rest of the province including the City and Naval Station of nearby [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] as well as [[Santiago de Compostela]] was 653,556.<ref>ether data taken from {{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}</ref> A Coruña's miraculous growth happened during the aftermath of the [[Spanish Civil War]] at a similar rate to other major Galician cities, but it was after the death of [[Francisco Franco]] when the city of A Coruña (and Vigo) left all the other Galician cities behind.

The meteoric increase in the population of the City of A Coruña during the years which followed the Spanish Civil War in the mid 20th century was accompanied by the decline in the villages and hamlets of the province as it industrialized.

==Main sights==
[[File:Torre de Hércules, La Coruña, España, 2015-09-25, DD 35-37 HDR.jpg|thumb|The [[Tower of Hercules]], reconstruction and modernization of the famous Roman lighthouse]]
The city is the site of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Tower of Hercules]], a lighthouse which has been in continuous operation since possibly the 2nd century AD. It has been declared by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. It is surrounded by a large public park with a [[golf course]] and a former [[Muslim]] cemetery. The lighthouse features as the main emblem of the city's flag and coat of arms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandeiragalega.com/es/comarca/coruna.htm |title=Comarca de Coruña - Escudo y Bandera de Coruña - Apoya a la Torre como Patrimonio de la Humanidad de la UNESCO! |publisher=Bandeiragalega.com |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>

The city is also well known for its characteristic glazed window balconies, called ''galerías''. Originally, this type of structure came about as a naval architecture solution for the challenging weather, particularly designed for rainy days. This fashion started in [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] in the 18th century when some of the technicians working for the [[Royal Dockyard]]s had the idea of using the shape of the back of a war ship in a modern building. Soon afterwards, most sea ports in northern Spain, including the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque region]] were adding these glazed window balconies to their city-port houses.

The Old Town (''Ciudad Vieja'' in Spanish, ''Cidade Vella'' in Galician) is the name given to the oldest part of A Coruña. During the ninth and tenth centuries, the inhabitants of what was then called Faro Island (peninsula where the Tower of Hercules stands) were leaving the area due to constant attacks by the Viking fleet and settled in the area of Betanzos. In 1208 [[Alfonso IX of León|King Alfonso IX]] refounded the city at the present site of the Old Town and put it under his personal control, free from allegiance to the clergy or feudal lords. In the fourteenth century the scarcely-surviving city walls of the Old Town were built, as well as three harbours: the Parrote and San Miguel. It also preserves the stronghold known as the Old Fortress, now converted into the Garden of San Carlos, in which [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]] is buried. The Old City of A Coruña kept streets and squares that revive the city's history and noble mansions and residences such as Rosalia de Castro's house, located on Prince Street. Notable buildings are the [[Royal Galician Academy]], the institution dedicated to the study of Galician culture and especially the Galician language, the [[Romanic]] churches of Santiago and Saint Mary, As Bárbaras Monastery ([[Romanic]] and [[Baroque]]) and the headquarters of the Operational Logistics Force of the [[Spanish Army]]. In July, a Medieval Fair takes place in the streets of the Old City.

The city has several museums, such as the Castle of San Antón Archaeological Museum, Fine Arts Museum, Unión Fenosa Museum of Contemporary Art (MACUF) and the network of scientific museums (Casa das Ciencias, which also includes a planetarium, DOMUS, made by [[Arata Isozaki]] and [[Aquarium Finisterrae]]). In 2012, the National Museum of Science and Technology (MUNCYT) opened a branch in the city. A Coruña's social scene is most popular on Summer nights. Most bars and clubs are on Calle Orzan, which runs directly parallel to Paseo Maritimo on the beach side. Another popular destination, for mostly a more youthful crowd, is Los Jardines (''The Gardens''), a park near the beginning of Calle Real and the Los Cantones Village Shopping Centre.

===Squares, parks and beaches===
[[File:Ayuntamiento, La Coruña, España, 2015-09-25, DD 141-143 HDR.jpg|thumb|City Hall]]
* '''María Pita Square''', the most important square in the city. Notable landmarks are the City Hall and the statue of the local heroine [[Maria Pita]].

* '''The promenade''' (Paseo Marítimo) is nine kilometres long (when completed, it will be 13&nbsp;km), one of the largest in [[Europe]]. It runs around the city's headland, passing sights such as its Aquarium, the [[Estadio Riazor]] and the Tower of Hercules. There is a touristic tramway that covers the stretch between the Parrote and the Esclavas School.
* In the summertime, the  '''Orzan''' and '''Riazor''' beaches are immensely popular destinations, located directly opposite of the port in the central part of the city. During María Pita festivity, which takes place all through August, Riazor is the venue of Noroeste Pop Rock Festival, a free music festival with groups from Spain and abroad ([[Amaral (band)|Amaral]], [[David Bisbal]], [[Joe Cocker]] or [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] have played on it in last editions).

==Economy==
[[File:Port La Coruña.JPG|thumb|left|Harbour of A Coruña]]
[[File:Parque dos menhires, Torre de Hércules, A Coruña.jpg|thumb|left|Menhirs in A Coruña]]
A Coruña is nowadays the richest region of Galicia and its economic engine. There have been various changes in the city's structure over the last few decades—it now shares some administrative functions with the nearby city of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. Companies have grown, especially in sectors such as finance, communication, planning, sales, manufacturing and technical services, making A Coruña the wealthiest metropolitan area of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The port itself unloads large amounts of fresh fish, and with the increase in other port activities like crude oil and solid bulk, which make up 75% of Galician port traffic.

In 1975, the clothing company [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], founded by [[Amancio Ortega Gaona]], opened its first store in the city and has since become a national and international clothing chain.

[[Inditex]], the main textile manufacturer of the world, has its headquarters in the nearby town of [[Arteixo]]. A Coruña concentrates the 30% of the GDP of Galicia and in the period between 1999 and 2001 it grew 35%, surpassing [[Vigo]] which was traditionally economically stronger. Other important companies of the city are [[Banco Pastor]] (owned by [[Banco Popular Español]]), [[Banco Etcheverría]] (oldest in Spain), [[Hijos de Rivera Brewery]], [[Abanca]], [[R (cable operator)|R Cable Operator]], the [[Repsol]] refinery, [[Gas Natural]] combined cycle power plant, [[General Dynamics]] factory, [[Alcoa]] aluminium plant and [[La Voz de Galicia]], the main daily newspaper of Galicia.

Over the last few years, emphasis has been placed upon better access and infrastructure, especially cultural, sporting, leisure and scientific areas. Following a spectacular [[oil spill]] when the ''[[Aegean Sea (oil spill)|Aegean Sea]]'' wrecked and exploded, considerable resources have been used in the recovery of the shoreline and strengthening the tourist sector. All this has reaffirmed the city's existing character as a centre for administration, sales, port activities, culture and tourism. The city also has a [[A Coruña Airport|regional airport]], used by 1.025.688 passengers in 2015.
