'''Art Deco'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑr|t|_|ˈ|d|ɛ|k|oʊ}}), or '''Deco''', is an influential [[visual arts]] design style that first appeared in [[France]] just before [[World War I]] {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=128}} and began flourishing internationally in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s before its popularity waned after [[World War II]].<ref name="Hillier1">{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]] | publisher=Studio Vista | year=1968 | page=12 | isbn= 978-0-289-27788-1}}</ref>  It took its name, short for ''Arts Décoratifs'',  from the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] (International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925.<ref name="Benton 2003 16">{{cite book | last=Benton | first=Charlotte | last2=Benton | first2=Tim | last3=Wood | first3=Ghislaine | title=Art Deco: 1910–1939 | publisher=Bulfinch | year=2003 | page=16 | isbn=978-0-8212-2834-0}}</ref>
It is an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style that combines traditional [[craft]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] with [[Machine Age]] imagery and materials. The style is often characterized by rich colours, bold [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and lavish ornamentation.

Deco emerged from the [[interwar period]] when rapid industrialisation was transforming culture. One of its major attributes is an embrace of technology. This distinguishes Deco from the [[Organic (model)|organic]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] favoured by its predecessor [[Art Nouveau]].

Historian [[Bevis Hillier]] defined Art Deco as "an assertively modern style [that] ran to symmetry rather than asymmetry, and to the rectilinear rather than the curvilinear; it responded to the demands of the machine and of new material [and] the requirements of mass production".<ref name="Hillier1" />

During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance and faith in social and technological progress.

==Etymology==
[[File:Lempicka musician.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tamara de Lempicka]], "The Musician", 1929 ([[oil painting|oil on canvas]])]]

The first use of the term ''Art Deco'' is sometimes attributed to architect [[Le Corbusier]], who penned a series of articles in his journal ''L'Esprit nouveau'' under the headline "1925 Expo: Arts Déco". He was referring to the 1925 [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] (International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts).<ref name="Benton 2003 16">{{cite book | last=Benton | first=Charlotte | last2=Benton | first2=Tim | last3=Wood | first3=Ghislaine | title=Art Deco: 1910–1939 | publisher=Bulfinch | year=2003 | page=16 | isbn=978-0-8212-2834-0}}</ref>

The term came into more general use in 1966, when a French exhibition celebrating the 1925 event was held under the title ''Les Années 25: Art Déco/Bauhaus/Stijl/Esprit Nouveau''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Bayer | first=Patricia | title=[[Art Deco Architecture: Design, Decoration and Detail from the Twenties and Thirties]] | publisher=Thames & Hudson | location=London | year=1992 | page=12}}</ref> Here the term was used to distinguish the new styles of French decorative crafts that had emerged since the [[Belle Epoque]].<ref name="Benton 2003 16"/> The term Art Deco has since been applied to a wide variety of works produced during the [[Interwar period]] (''L'Entre Deux Guerres''), and even to those of the [[Bauhaus]] in Germany. However, Art Deco originated in France. It has been argued that the term should be applied to French works and those produced in countries directly influenced by France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10453 |title=Suzanne Tise, Museum of Modern Art, MoMA, Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>

Art Deco gained currency as a broadly applied stylistic label in 1968 when historian [[Bevis Hillier]] published the first book on the subject: ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''.<ref name="Hillier1" /> Hillier noted that the term was already being used by art dealers and cites ''The Times'' (2 November 1966) and an essay named "Les Arts Déco" in ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine (November 1967) as examples of prior usage.<ref>{{cite book | last=Benton | first=Charlotte | last2=Benton | first2=Tim | last3=Wood | first3=Ghislaine | title=Art Deco: 1910–1939 | publisher=Bulfinch | year=2003 | page=430 | isbn=978-0-8212-2834-0}}</ref> In 1971, Hillier organised an exhibition at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], which he details in his book about it, ''The World of Art Deco''.<ref name="Hillier4">{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=The World of Art Deco: An Exhibition Organized by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, June- September 1971 | publisher=E.P.

Some historians trace Deco's roots to the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exposition of 1900]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/soci-t-des-artistes-d-corateurs  |title=Société des Artistes Décorateurs: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com | accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> After this show a group of artists established an informal collective known as ''[[La Société des artistes décorateurs]]'' (Society of Decorative Artists) to promote French crafts. Among them were [[Hector Guimard]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Raoul Lachenal]], [[Paul Bellot]], [[Maurice Dufrêne]] and Emile Decoeur. These artists are said to have influenced the principles of Art Deco.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Art Deco">{{cite book |last=Duncan | first=Alastair |title=Encyclopedia of Art Deco |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |year= 1988 |isbn= 978-0-7472-0083-3 }}</ref>

The Art Deco era is often anecdotally dated from 1925 when the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] was organized to showcase new ideas in [[applied arts]],<ref name="Benton 2003 16"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Scarlett |last2=Townley |title=Arts Décoratifs 1925: A Personal Recollection of the Paris Exhibition |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=1975 |isbn=0-85670-257-9 }}</ref><ref name="Design Handbook">{{cite book |last=Fell | first=Charlotte |first2=Peter |last2=Fell |title=Design Handbook: Concepts, Materials and Styles |publisher=Taschen |year=2006 |edition=1 }}</ref><ref name="Paris 1925 Exhibition">{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1157_art_deco/virtual/gallery1/paris1925.htm|title=The Paris 1925 Exhibition |publisher=V&A Publishers | accessdate=30 October 2008 | archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20081104151656/http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1157_art_deco/virtual/gallery1/paris1925.htm  |archivedate=4 November 2008   |deadurl=no}}</ref> although the style had been in full force in France for several years before that date. Deco was heavily influenced by pre-modern art from around the world and observable at the [[Musée du Louvre]], [[Musée de l'Homme]] and the [[Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie]]. During the 1920s, affordable travel permitted ''in situ'' exposure to other cultures. There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at [[Pompeii]], [[Troy]], the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], etc. Artists and designers integrated [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], Asia, [[Mesoamerica]] and [[Oceania]] with [[Machine Age]] elements.<ref name="Essential Art Deco">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Ghislaine |title=Essential Art Deco |publisher=VA&A Publications |location=London |isbn=0-8212-2833-1}}</ref><ref name="Design: A Concise History">{{cite book |last=Hauffe |first=Thomas |title=Design: A Concise History |publisher=Laurence King |location=London |year=1998 |edition=1 }}</ref><ref name="Art Deco Style">{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm  |title=Art Deco Style |publisher=Museum of London |accessdate=6 November 2008 | archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20081026194631/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm  | archivedate=26 October 2008  | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html |title=Art Deco Study Guide |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum | accessdate=1 November 2008 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081025210428/http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html  | archivedate=25 October 2008   |deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html  |title=Introduction to Art Deco|last=Juster |first=Randy |publisher=decopix.com |accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081029202446/http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html  |archivedate=29 October 2008  | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="University Times">{{cite journal |date=9 October 2003 |title=How Art Deco came to be |journal=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh |volume=36 |issue=4 |url=http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&-lay=a&-format=d.html&storyid=1754&-Find | accessdate=7 November 2008}}</ref>

Deco was also influenced by [[Cubism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], [[Modernism]], and [[Futurism]].<ref name="Art Deco Style" /><ref name="Art, Design and Visual Thinking">{{cite web|url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm  |title=Art, Design and Visual Thinking |last=Jirousek |first=Charlotte |year=1995 | accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081202040916/http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm  |archivedate=2 December 2008   |deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1905, before the onset of Cubism, [[Eugène Grasset]] wrote and published ''Méthode de Composition Ornementale, Éléments Rectilignes,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6109619d |title=Eugène Grasset, '&#39;Méthode de composition ornementale, Éléments rectilignes'&#39;, 1905, Librarie Centrale des Beaux-Arts, Paris (in French) |language=fr |publisher=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> within which he systematically explored the decorative (ornamental) aspects of [[geometry|geometric]] elements, forms, motifs and their variations, in contrast with (and as a departure from) the undulating [[Art Nouveau]] style of [[Hector Guimard]], so popular in Paris a few years earlier. Grasset stresses the principle that various simple geometric shapes like triangles and squares are the basis of all compositional arrangements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/mthodedecomposit01gras |title=Eugène Grasset, '&#39;Méthode de composition ornementale'&#39;, 1905, Full Text (in French) |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>

At the 1907 [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris, [[Georges Braque]] exhibited ''Viaduc à l'Estaque'' (a proto-Cubist work), now at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]. Simultaneously, there was a retrospective exhibition of 56 works by [[Paul Cézanne]], as a tribute to the artist who died in 1906. Cézanne was interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials: the cylinder, the sphere, the cone.

[[Paul Iribe]] created for the couturier [[Paul Poiret]] esthetic designs that shocked the Parisian milieu with its novelty. These illustrations were compiled into an album, ''Les Robes de Paul Poiret racontée par Paul Iribe'', published in 1908.<ref>''Les Robes de Paul Poiret racontée par Paul Iribe'', P. Poiret, 1908, Paris</ref>

At the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], shown together in Room 18, elaborated upon Cézannian syntax, revealing to the general public for the first time a "mobile perspective" in their art, soon to become known as [[Cubism]]. Several months later, the Salon d'Automne saw the invitation of Munich artists who for several years had been working with simple geometric shapes. Leading up to 1910 and culminating in 1912, the French designers [[André Mare]] and Louis Sue turned towards the quasi-mystical [[Golden ratio]], in accord with Pythagorean and Platonic traditions, giving their works a Cubist sensibility.

The artists of the [[Section d'Or]] exhibited (in 1912) works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion, furniture and interior designers.<ref>''La Section d'or, 1912-1920-1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000</ref>

These revolutionary changes occurring at the outset of the 20th century are summarized in the 1912 writings of [[André Vera]]. ''Le Nouveau style'', published in the journal ''L'Art décoratif'', expressed the rejection of Art Nouveau forms (asymmetric, polychrome and picturesque) and called for ''simplicité volontaire, symétrie manifeste, l'ordre et l'harmonie'', themes that would eventually become ubiquitous within the context of Art Deco.<ref>André Vera, ''Le Nouveau style'', published in L'Art décoratif, January 1912, pp. 21–32</ref>

Between 1910 and 1913, Paris saw the construction of the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], 15 [[avenue Montaigne]], another sign of the radical aesthetic change experienced by the Parisian milieu of the time. The rigorous composition of its facade, designed by [[Auguste Perret]], is a major example of early Art Deco.<ref>[http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/france/paris/review-97513.html Théâtre des Champs-Élysées Review] Fodor's Travel Guide</ref><ref>Peter Collins, ''Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture'', New York: Horizon Press, 1959</ref> The building includes exterior [[bas relief]]s by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], a dome by [[Maurice Denis]], paintings by [[Édouard Vuillard]] and Jacqueline Marval, and a stage curtain design by [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]].  It took its inspiration from classical architecture, and featured straight lines,  geometric forms, and decoration in the form of sculptured plaques attached to the exterior.{{Sfn|Plum|1914|page=134}}

Another important figure of early French art deco architecture was [[Henri Sauvage]], who switched from art nouveau to art deco in designing the Majorelle building in Paris for furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]]  (1912–1914); the studio building in 1926–28;  the Gambetta Palace movie theater in 1920, and a new facade for the [[La Samaritaine]] department store (1925–28). {{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages=318–319}}

By the 1930s the style had become much more flamboyant, and added much more decoration on the facade.  It was particularly popular for movie theaters, such as the [[Grand Rex]] in Paris (1932), and [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City; and in the decoration of skyscrapers.

The art deco style was not limited to buildings on land;  the ocean liner [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']], whose first voyage was in 1935, featured art deco design, including a dining room whose ceiling and decoration was made of glass by [[Lalique]].

==Interior design==

===''La Maison Cubiste'' (The Cubist House)===

In the ''Art Décoratif'' section of the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]], an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as ''La Maison Cubiste'' (''The Cubist House''). The facade was designed by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and the interior by [[André Mare]] along with a group of collaborators. "Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of [[Marie Laurencin]], the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]]".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&pg=PA161&lpg=PA161&dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&source=bl&ots=jv-hGOpwJc&sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22maison%20cubiste%22%201912&f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France: 1900–1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000]</ref>

''La Maison Cubiste'' was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the ''Salon Bourgeois'', where paintings by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marie Laurencin]] and [[Fernand Léger]] were hung—and a bedroom. It was an early example of ''L'art décoratif'', a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade.<ref>[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324a.html La Maison Cubiste, 1912]</ref> This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]], New York, Chicago and Boston,<ref>[http://www.kubisme.info/kt315s.html Kubistische werken op de Armory Show]</ref> listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled ''"Facade architectural, plaster"'' (''Façade architecturale'').<ref>[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/detail-duchampvillons-faade-architecturale-14604 Duchamp-Villon's ''Façade architecturale'', 1913]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/catnter00unse/catnter00unse_djvu.txt "Catalogue of international exhibition of modern art: at the Armory of the Sixty-ninth Infantry, 1913, Duchamp-Villon, Raymond, ''Facade Architectural'']</ref>

Several years after [[World War I]], in 1927, Cubists [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Henri Laurens]], the sculptor [[Gustave Miklos]], and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House, rue Saint-James, [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and owned by the French fashion designer [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]], also a collector of [[Post-Impressionist]] and [[Cubist]] paintings (including [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], which he bought directly from Picasso's studio).

Deco emphasizes [[Geometry|geometric]] forms: spheres, polygons, rectangles, [[trapezoid]]<nowiki/>s, zigzags, [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]], and [[sunburst]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]]. Elements are often arranged in [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] patterns. Modern materials, such as [[Aluminium|aluminum]], [[stainless steel]], [[Bakelite]], [[Chrome plating|chrome]], and plastics, are frequently used. [[Stained glass]], [[inlay]]s, and [[lacquer]] are also common.

==Influence==
[[File:Duofold Desk Set.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Parker Pen Company|Parker]] [[Duofold]] desk set, {{circa|1930}}]]
Art Deco was a globally popular style and affected many areas of design. It was used widely in consumer products such as automobiles, furniture, cookware, china, textiles, jewelry, clocks, and electronic items such as radios, telephones, and [[jukebox]]es. It also influenced architecture, interior design, [[industrial design]], fashion, [[graphic arts]], and cinema.

During the 1930s, Art Deco was used extensively for [[public works]] projects, railway stations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agilitynut.com/train.html|title=Art Deco Train Stations |publisher=agilitynut.com |accessdate=7 November 2008 | archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20081217095832/http://www.agilitynut.com/train.html  |archivedate=17 December 2008   |deadurl= no}}</ref> [[ocean liner]]s (including the [[SS Île de France|''Île de France'']], [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']], and [[SS Normandie|''Normandie'']]), [[movie palace]]s, and [[amusement park]]s.

The austerities imposed by [[World War II]] caused Art Deco to decline in popularity: it was perceived by some as gaudy and inappropriately luxurious.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} A resurgence of interest began during the 1960s.<ref name="Design Handbook" /><ref name="Art Deco Style" /><ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)">{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm  |title=Art Deco (1920s to 1930s) |last=Heindorf |first=Anne |date=24 July 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2008 | archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20081026194631/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm  |archivedate=26 October 2008  | deadurl= no}}</ref> Deco continues to inspire designers and is often used in contemporary fashion, jewelry, and toiletries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf  |title=The Decorative in Twentieth Century Art: A Story of Decline and Resurgence |first=Pamela |last=Gaunt |date=August 2005 |format=PDF}}</ref>

==Streamline Moderne==

{{main |Streamline Moderne}}

A style related to Art Deco is Streamline Moderne (or Streamline) which emerged during the mid-1930s. Streamline was influenced by modern [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] principles developed for aviation and [[ballistics]] to reduce air friction at high velocities. Designers applied these principles to cars, trains, ships, and even objects not intended to move, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[Fuel dispenser|gas pumps]], and buildings.<ref name="Design: A Concise History" />

One of the first production vehicles in this style was the [[Chrysler Airflow]] of 1933. It was unsuccessful commercially, but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gartman |first=David |title=Auto Opium |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |pages=122–124 | isbn=978-0-415-10572-9}}</ref>

Streamlining quickly influenced [[automotive design]] and evolved the rectangular [[Brass Era car|"horseless carriage"]] into sleek vehicles with aerodynamic lines, [[symmetry]], and V-shapes. These designs continued to be popular after [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitioncurves.aspx |title=Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design |publisher=Phoenix Art Museum |year=2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Armi |first=C.

===Central and South America===
[[File:Kavanagh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kavanagh building]], Buenos Aires. 1934 design by Gregorio Sánchez, Ernesto Lagos, Luis María de la Torre|312x312px]]
*In Argentina, architect [[Alejandro Virasoro]] introduced Art Deco in 1926 and developed the use of reinforced concrete, with the Banco El Hogar Argentino and the Casa del Teatro (both in [[Buenos Aires]]) being his most important works. The [[Kavanagh building]] (1934), by Sánchez, Lagos and de la Torre, was the tallest reinforced concrete structure at its time, and a notable example of late Art Deco style. In the [[Buenos Aires Province]], architect [[Francisco Salamone]] designed cemetery portals, city halls and slaughterhouses commissioned by the provincial government in the 1930s; his designs combined Art Deco with futurism.
*Another country with many examples of Art Deco architecture is Brazil, especially in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Goiânia]] and cities like [[Cipó]] ([[Bahia]]), [[Iraí]] ([[Rio Grande do Sul]]) and [[Rio de Janeiro]], especially in [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] (see [[Belmond Copacabana Palace]]). Also in the Brazil's north-east – notably in cities such as [[Campina Grande]] in the state of [[Paraíba]] – there are Art Deco buildings which have been termed "Sertanejo Art Deco" because of their peculiar architectural features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://art-deco-sertanejo.com/english//|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20041207160622/http://art-deco-sertanejo.com/english//|archivedate=7 December 2004|title=Art Deco Sertanejo|last=Rossi|first=Lia|author2=José Marconi de Souza|year=2002|accessdate=7 November 2008}}</ref> The reason for the style being so widespread in Brazil is its coincidence with the fast growth and radical economic changes of the country during the 1930s.
*In [[Santiago, Chile]], the Hotel Carrera (no longer a hotel) is a good example of Art Deco architecture.
*Art deco buildings are also numerous in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, including the [[Palacio Salvo]], which was South America's tallest building when it was built in the late 1920s.

===Cuba===
*Some of the finest examples of Art Deco art and architecture are found in Cuba, especially in [[Havana]]. The [[Bacardi Building (Havana)|Bacardi Building]] is noted for its particular Art Deco style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n18/Bacardi.html|title=Bacardi Building Sports Spirited Design|last=Fernandez|first=Enrique|year=2005|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=4 November 2008|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081017043339/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n18/Bacardi.html|archivedate= 17 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The style is expressed by the architecture of residences, businesses, hotels, and many pieces of decorative art, furniture, and utensils in public buildings, as well as in private homes.<ref name="Hillier1"/>

One of the largest Art Deco buildings in Western Europe is the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in Koekelberg, [[Brussels]]. In 1925, architect Albert van Huffel won the Grand Prize for Architecture with his scale model of the basilica at the ''Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes'' in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basilicakoekelberg.be/documents/home.xml?lang=en |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Koekelberg |publisher=Basilicakoekelberg.be |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>

Another prominent Art Deco landmark in Brussels is the 1938-built former National Radio Institute of Belgium, more commonly known as the Flagey building after [[Place Flagey|its location]].

The [[Brussels Central station]], a late work of architect [[Victor Horta]], also has many Art Deco elements, although Horta has become better known for his earlier [[Art Nouveau]] work.

====Germany====
[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Schuetzenstrasse, Mosse-Zentrum 05.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Mossehaus]] with Art Deco elements by [[Erich Mendelsohn]] from 1923. Jerusalemer Str., [[Berlin]]]]

In Germany two variations of Art Deco flourished in the 1920s and 30s: The [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neue Sachlichkeit]] (New Objectivity) employed the same curving horizontal lines and nautical motifs that are known as [[Streamline Moderne]] in the Anglophone world. While Neue Sachlichkeit was rather austere and reduced (eventually merging with the [[Bauhaus]] style), [[Expressionist architecture]] came up with a more emotional use of shapes, colors and textures, partly reinterpreting shapes from the German and Baltic [[Brick Gothic]] style. Notable examples are [[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s ''[[Mossehaus]]'' and ''[[Schaubühne]]'' theater in [[Berlin]], [[Fritz Höger]]'s ''[[Chilehaus]]'' in [[Hamburg]] and his ''[[Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz]]'' in Berlin, the ''Anzeiger Tower'' in [[Hannover]] and the ''Borsig Tower'' in Berlin. Art deco architecture was revived in the late-20th century by architects like [[Hans Kollhoff]] (see his tower on [[Potsdamer Platz]]), Jan Kleihues and Tobias Nöfer.

The 1921 [[Mossehaus]] in [[Berlin]] by [[Erich Mendelsohn]] was a pioneering design in Art Deco and Streamline Moderne, that displays how the Deco style spread and evolved in Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Kathleen|title=Erich Mendelsohn and the Architecture of German Modernism|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521571685}}</ref>

====Greece====
Art Deco in [[Athens]] incorporated insolently many of the structural and formal characteristics of the Classical idiom, at times transforming them to mere decorative elements, or oppositely, imprinting to them a functionality. Thematically it moved beyond the Classical period and looked for its models in the [[Mycenaean art|Mycenaean]], [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]], [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] arts. The classicizing trends however, as one would expect in the city of [[Parthenon]], held strongly, and despite what it has been sometimes suggested, Art Deco was never really independent in Athens. Rather, it accommodated itself in the midst of a strong and ideologically charged classicizing tradition and produced some of the most original and less expected works of the Greek architectural heritage.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/481398/Art_Deco_in_Athens_modernizing_the_Classical= Sideris A., "Art Deco in Athens: Modernizing the Classical"], ''Studia Hercynia'' 13, 2009, pp. 76-91.</ref>

====Lithuania====
Like Romania, [[Lithuania]] too experienced booming industrial growth during the [[Interwar period]]. This resulted in the rapid modernization of the city of [[Kaunas]] in particular. At this time it became the temporary capital of Lithuania. [[Vytautas the Great War Museum]], built in 1936 and located in downtown Kaunas, along with the Central Post Building and the Pienocentras HQ Building (1934) are the three most prominent Art Deco structures in the city. Today many of these buildings still stand, and apartment complexes and large government buildings alike survive from this time, even through the [[Nazi]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet occupations]] of Kaunas. Many other buildings around the city were built in the [[Bauhaus]] style.

====Norway====
An example of Art Deco in Norway is found in the [[Student Society in Trondheim]] (built 1927–29). Its interior is based on an abandoned circus, so that the exterior exhibits a characteristic round shape.

====Romania====
As a result of the inter-war period of rapid development, cities in Romania have numerous Art Deco buildings, including government buildings, hotels, and private houses. The best representative in this regard is the capital, [[Bucharest]], which, despite the widespread destruction of its architecture during [[Communism in Romania#Heavy industrialisation|Communist times]], still has many Art Deco examples, both on its main boulevards and in the lesser known parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rezistenta.net/2010/08/perspective-21-art-deco-bucurestean.html |title=Bucharest Art Deco |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100823224530/http://www.rezistenta.net/2010/08/perspective-21-art-deco-bucurestean.html|archivedate= 23 August 2010 |deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.com/2010/05/arhitectura-interbelica-modernista-in.html |title=Inter-war modernist architecture |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.com/2010/03/bijuterii-art-deco-in-bucuresti.html |title=Art Deco jewels in Bucharest  |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Moscow Metro Station platform.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)]] (1938)]]
[[File:Museum-art-deco.jpg|alt=The Exposition Museum Art Deco|left|thumb|The Art Deco Museum in Moscow.]]
Art Deco made a huge impact to an early Soviet architecture. For instance best known [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]] in Moscow were inspired by the US skyscrapers [[Chrysler Building]] and [[Empire State Building]]. There are also some stations in [[Moscow Metro]] in Art Deco style.

The [[Art Deco Museum]] in Moscow represents one of the largest collections of art deco end art nouveau objects in Russia. The collection includes more than 800 sculptures in bronze and ivory of the 1920s and 30s, more than 500 items of furniture, as well as a significant number of objects of decorative and applied arts and graphics.

====Spain====
[[Valencia]] was built profusely in Art Deco style during the period of economic bounty between wars in which Spain remained neutral. Particularly remarkable are the famous bath house Las Arenas, the building hosting the rectorship of the [[University of Valencia]], and the cinemas Rialto (currently the Filmoteca de la [[Generalitat Valenciana]]) and Capitol (reconverted into an office building).

====United Kingdom====
[[File:Express Building Manchester.jpg|thumb|right|Former [[Daily Express Building, Manchester|Express Building]] (1939) in Manchester, designed by Sir [[Owen Williams (engineer)|Owen Williams]]]]

During the 1930s, Art Deco had a noticeable effect on house design in the United Kingdom,<ref name="Art Deco Style" /> as well as the design of various public buildings.<ref name="Design Handbook" /> Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex-curved metal corner windows, were all characteristic of that period.<ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm|title=Art Deco Buildings|year=2007|publisher=london-footprints.co.uk|accessdate=6 November 2008|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081211074839/http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm|archivedate= 11 December 2008 |deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php|title=Art Deco in Frinton on sea|year=2006|publisher=Art Deco Classics|accessdate=6 November 2008|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081201132519/http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php|archivedate= 1 December 2008 |deadurl= no}}</ref>

*The [[London Underground]] is famous for many examples of Art Deco architecture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00npm4g/Art_Deco_Icons_London_Transport |title=Four Programmes – Art Deco Icons |publisher=BBC  |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> and there are a number of buildings in the style situated along the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Golden Mile]] in Brentford. Also in West London is the [[Hoover Building]], which was originally built for [[The Hoover Company]] and was converted into a superstore in the early 1990s.
*The former [[Arsenal Stadium]] has the famous East Stand facade. It remains at the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal football club]]'s old home at [[Highbury]], [[London Borough of Islington]], which was vacated in the summer of 2006. Opened in October 1936, the structure now has [[Listed building|Grade II listed status]] and has been converted into [[Highbury Square|apartments]]. William Bennie, the organizer of the project, famously used the Art Deco style in the final design which was considered one of the most opulent and impressive stands of world football.
*[[Du Cane Court]], in Balham, south-west London, is a good example of the Art Deco style. It was thought to be possibly the largest block of privately owned apartments under one roof in Britain at the time it was built, and the first to employ pre-stressed concrete. It has a grand reception area and is surrounded by Japanese-style gardens; and it has had many famous residents, especially from the performing arts. Elsewhere in south-west London, is [[Battersea Power Station]], which has appeared in films and artwork including the cover of Pink Floyd's 1977 album ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''. Partially built in the 1930s, the building retains its powerful Art Deco facade. In the middle of [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] is the Sunlight Laundry, one of the few surviving Art Deco buildings which is still owned by the commissioning firm and still used for its original purpose.
*In [[North East England]], the [[Wills Building]], an old cigarette factory, is a fine Art Deco building built in the late 1940s in Newcastle upon Tyne.
*In [[North West England]], the [[Midland Hotel, Morecambe]] is considered one of the finest surviving examples from this period, with sculptures by artist [[Eric Gill]]. The buildings and structures related to the [[Queensway Tunnel]] which connects [[Liverpool]] and [[Birkenhead]] are also distinctly Art Deco. Other notable Art Deco buildings in Liverpool include [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool|Philharmonic Hall]] and the former terminal building at Liverpool Airport—now the [[Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport Hotel|Crowne Plaza LJLA]]. See [[:Category:Art Deco architecture in Liverpool|Art Deco architecture in Liverpool]].
* In [[Yorkshire]], Leeds Central Station and the adjoining Queens Hotel are both major examples of Art Deco buildings which have been preserved for 21st century usage.
*The [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] in Norwich is a fine example of the Art Deco style. It has a 206&nbsp;ft clock tower and the balcony is the longest in the UK at 365&nbsp;ft long.

===North America===

====Canada====
In Canada Art Deco structures that survive are mainly in urban centres like [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and [[Vancouver]]. They range from public buildings like [[Vancouver City Hall]] to commercial buildings ([[College Park (Toronto)|College Park]]) to public works ([[R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant]]).

*Hamilton boasts a collection of Art Deco buildings. The [[Hamilton GO Centre]], the [[Pigott Building]], an 18-storey condominium (1929), The Sunlife Building, The Bell Telephone Baker Exchange, [[Dominion Public Building]] refurbished into the John Sopinka Courthouse (1936), and [[Hamilton Port Authority#Hamilton Port Authority Building|The Hamilton Port Authority]] (1953).

The U.S. has many examples of Art Deco architecture. Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York have many Art Deco buildings. The famous skyscrapers are the best-known, but notable Art Deco buildings can be found in various neighborhoods. Art deco was popular during the later years of the [[movie palace]] era of theatre construction.  Excellent examples of Art Deco theatres still exist throughout the United States, such as the [[Fargo Theatre]] in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], and [[The Campus Theatre]] in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]].

*In 2005, work began on the conversion of the former [[Jersey City Medical Center]] in [[Beacon, Jersey City]], now a national historic site, to a residential enclave. The development is situated on {{convert|14|acre|ha}} and hosts the largest collection of Art Deco buildings in [[New Jersey]].

The park is 277 acres and is the last surviving pre-1950 [[World's Fair]] site. Fair Park hosts the annual [[State Fair of Texas]], the largest state fair in the United States.
*[[Detroit]]'s many examples of Art Deco architecture include the [[Fisher Building]], [[Fox Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Fox Theatre]], and [[Guardian Building]], all of which are now [[National Historic Landmark]]s, as well as the [[David Stott Building|David Stott]] and [[Penobscot Building]]s.
*[[Flint, Michigan]] is home to [[The Paterson Building]] which has extensive Art Deco features throughout the interior and exterior.
*The [[Hoover Dam]] features Art Deco motifs throughout, including its concrete water intake towers and brass elevator doors.
*[[Houston]]'s Deco survivors include the [[Houston City Hall]], the [[JPMorgan Chase Building (Houston, Texas)|JPMorgan Chase Building]], [[Ezekiel W. Cullen Building]], and the [[1940 Air Terminal Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstondeco.org |title=Houston Deco |publisher=Houston Deco |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref>
*[[Kansas City, Missouri]] is home to the [[Kansas City Power and Light Building]], completed in 1931. This building is a good example of the [[Great Depression]]'s effect on Art Deco construction. Original plans were for a twin tower to go next to it on its west side. However, it was never built due to financial constraints. As a result, the {{convert|476|ft|m|adj=on}} tower has a bare west side with no windows. Other examples of Deco in Kansas City include the [[909 Walnut]], the [[Jackson County Courthouse (Kansas City, Missouri)|Jackson County Courthouse]], [[Kansas City City Hall]], and the [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)|Municipal Auditorium]].
* The recently opened [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts|Smith Center]] in [[Downtown Las Vegas]] incorporates many design elements from Hoover Dam and, therefore, is a contemporary example of the use of Art Deco style.
* Los Angeles' Art Deco architecture is particularly found along [[Wilshire Boulevard]], a main thoroughfare that experienced a period of intense construction activity during the 1920s. Notable examples include the [[Bullocks Wilshire]] building and the [[Pellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre]], built in 1929 and 1931 respectively. Both buildings experienced recent restoration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/no-56-bullocks-wilshire-building.html|title=Big Orange Landmarks No. 56 |last=Bariscale|first=Floyd|year=2007|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2008/02/no-118-pellissier-building.html|title=Big Orange Landmarks No. 118 |last=Bariscale|first=Floyd|year=2008|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>
*[[Miami Beach, Florida]] has a large collection of Art Deco buildings, with some 30 blocks of hotels and apartment houses dating from the 1920s to the 1940s. In 1979, the [[Miami Beach Architectural District]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpl.org/ |title=Our Mission Statemente |publisher=Miami Design Preservation League |date= |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

*[[Milwaukee]] is home to the [[Wisconsin Gas Building]], a classic stepped Art Deco design completed in 1930, which replaced a Prohibition-era speakeasy formally on the site. Another prime example of Art Deco architecture, the [[Wisconsin Tower]], was completed that same year.
*[[Minneapolis]] has the [[Foshay Tower]] which was finished in 1929, built immediately before the [[Great Depression]]. It is the only obelisk-shaped office building in the world.  Minneapolis also has the [[Rand Tower]], the [[CenturyLink Building]], the [[Minneapolis Post Office]], and the [[Wells Fargo Center (Minneapolis)|Wells Fargo Center]], an example of modern Art Deco architecture.
*[[New York City|New York]]'s borough of the [[The Bronx|Bronx]] has several Art Deco buildings in the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], including the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], 888 Grand Concourse, designed by [[Emery Roth]], and 1150 Grand Concourse, the "Fish Building." <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2403.pdf|title=New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, "Grand Concourse Historic District"|last=|first=|date=October 25, 2011|website=New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|publisher=New York City|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref> 
*[[Rochester, Minnesota]] has the [[Plummer Building]] from 1927, the original building for the world-famous [[Mayo Clinic]].

*[[St. Paul, Minnesota]] is home to the [[First National Bank Building (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|First National Bank Building]] and the [[Saint Paul City Hall]].
*The [[Guadalupe County Courthouse (Texas)|Guadalupe County Courthouse]] and the nearby [[Municipal Building (Texas)|Municipal Building]] in [[Seguin, Texas]] show successful use of the style in public buildings erected as make-work projects in small towns during the [[New Deal]].
*[[Syracuse, New York]] is home to the [[Niagara Mohawk Building]], completed in 1932 and listed as a National Historic Landmark. Niagara Mohawk was considered at the time to be the nation's most powerful electricity supplier; thus, the building emphasized a vast futuristic look with an electric style embedded into it.
*Much of the Art Deco heritage of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] remains from that city's [[History of Tulsa, Oklahoma#Second main era of oil production: 1915-1930|oil boom days]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsapreservationcommission.org/artdeco/|title=Tulsa's Art Deco Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Tulsa Reservation Commission|accessdate=7 November 2008|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081023195740/http://tulsapreservationcommission.org/artdeco/|archivedate= 23 October 2008 |deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[File:RussellStreetPoliceHQ.JPG|thumb|rught|Former [[Russell Street Police Headquarters]], 1940–43, Melbourne, Australia]]

Australia also has many surviving examples of Art Deco architecture. Among the most notable are:

*The [[Manchester Unity Building]] (Melbourne) features purely decorative towers to circumvent the [[height restriction laws]] of the time, and the former [[Russell Street Police Headquarters]] in Melbourne, with its main multi-storey brick building designed by architect [[Percy Edgar Everett]], is reminiscent of the design of the [[Empire State Building]].
*In [[St Kilda, Victoria]], the [[Palais Theatre|Palais]] and the [[The Astor Theatre|Astor]] theatres are considered some of the finest surviving Art Deco buildings in Australia, while many rural towns such as [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]], [[Albury]] and [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] also have significant amounts of Art Deco buildings and homes.
* Sydney's [[ANZAC War Memorial]] and "mini-skyscrapers", such as the [[Grace Building (Sydney)]] and the [[AWA Tower]] in Sydney, which consists of a radio transmission tower atop a 15-story building.
* Sydney has a large number of survining art deco houses, particularly in its inner suburbs.

====New Zealand====
[[File:Central Hotel, Napier 05.jpg|thumb|left|Central Hotel, one of the many heritage buildings of Napier registered by the [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]]<ref>{{NZHPT|1114|Central Hotel|12 July 2014}}</ref>]]

*[[Hastings, New Zealand]] was also rebuilt in Art Deco style after the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake]], and many fine Art Deco buildings survive.
*The city of [[Napier, New Zealand]], was rebuilt in the Art Deco style after being largely razed by the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake|Hawke's Bay earthquake]] of 3 February 1931 and is the world's most consistently Art Deco city. Although a few Art Deco buildings were replaced with contemporary structures during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, most of the centre remained intact long enough to become recognized as architecturally unique, and from the 1990s onwards had been protected and restored. As of 2007, Napier has been nominated for UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] status, the first cultural site in New Zealand to be nominated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx |title=Napier Earthquake |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |date=3 February 1931 |accessdate=8 July 2010|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100706013856/http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx|archivedate= 6 July 2010 |deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/ |title=Home – Art Deco Trust |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |accessdate=8 July 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100630211317/http://www.artdeconapier.com/|archivedate= 30 June 2010 |deadurl= no}}</ref> According to the [[World Heritage Trust]], when Napier is compared to the other cites noted for their Art Deco architecture, such as Miami Beach, Santa Barbara, [[Bandung]] in Indonesia (planned originally as the future capital of Java), and Asmara in [[Eritrea]] (built by the Italians as a model colonial city), "none&nbsp;... surpass Napier in style and coherence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5125/ |title=Napier Art Deco historic precinct – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref>
*[[Wellington]] has retained a sizeable number of Art Deco buildings, in spite of constant post-[[World War II]] development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways/across-the-city/art-deco-heritage-trail |title=Art Deco heritage trail |publisher=wellington.gov.nz |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref>
