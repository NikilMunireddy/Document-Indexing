Action film

'''Action film''' is a [[film genre]] in which the [[protagonist]](s) is/are thrust into a series of challenges that involve [[violence]], [[close combat]], physical feats and frantic chases. Action films tend to feature a resourceful [[hero]] struggling against incredible odds, which include life-threatening situations, a villain, or a pursuit which generally concludes in victory for the hero.

Advancements in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other [[visual effect]]s that required the efforts of professional [[stunt]] crews in the past. However, reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic, highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/action-d646 |title=Action Top rated Most Viewed - AllMovie |publisher=Allrovi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref> While action has long been a recurring component in films, the "action film" [[genre]] began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of [[stunts]] and [[special effects]]. 

The genre is closely associated with the [[thriller film|thriller]] and [[adventure film]] genres, and it may also contain elements of [[spy fiction]] and [[espionage]].<ref>{{cite news|title= FILM COMMENT : Endangered Species : The American action-fantasy epic is in danger of becoming terminally musclebound and knuckle-headed|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=June 27, 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-27/entertainment/ca-7586_1_action-hero|accessdate=2010-10-27|first=Peter|last=Rainer}}</ref>

==History==

===Early action films===
Some historians consider ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]''|<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Great Train Robbery|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-great-train-robbery1903/|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=14 December 2014}}</ref> to be the first action film.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the First Action Film?|url=http://theactionelite.com/2013/11/whats-the-first-action-movie-ever-made/}}</ref> During the 1920s and 1930s, action-based films were often "[[swashbuckler films|swashbuckling]]" [[adventure films]] in which actors, such as [[Douglas Fairbanks]], wielded swords in period pieces or [[Western (genre)|Westerns]].

The 1940s and 1950s saw "action" in a new form through [[War film|war]] and cowboy movies. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] ushered in the spy-adventure genre while also establishing the use of action-oriented "set pieces" like the famous crop-duster scene and the Mount Rushmore finale in ''[[North by Northwest]]''. The film, along with a war-adventure called ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'', inspired producers [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] to invest in their own spy-adventure, based on the novels of [[Ian Fleming]].

The long-running success of the [[James Bond]] films or series (which dominated the action films of the 1960s) introduced a staple of the modern-day action film: the resourceful hero.  Such larger-than-life characters were a veritable “one-man army”; able to dispatch villainous masterminds after cutting through their disposable henchmen in increasingly creative ways. Such heroes are ready with one-liners, puns, and dry quips. 

The Bond films also used fast [[editing|cutting]], [[Car chase#In film|car chases]], fist fights, a variety of weapons and gadgets, and elaborate action sequences.

===1970s===
During the 1970s, gritty detective stories and urban crime dramas began to evolve and fuse themselves with the new "action" style, leading to a string of maverick police officer films, such as ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Seven-Ups]]'' (1973).  ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971) essentially lifted its star, [[Clint Eastwood]], out of his cowboy typecasting, and framed him as the archetypal hero of the urban action film.   In many countries, restrictions on language, adult content, and violence had loosened up, and these elements became more widespread.

In the 1970s, martial-arts films from [[Hong Kong]] became popular with Western audiences and inspired big budget films such as [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973). [[Chuck Norris]] blended martial arts with 'cops and robbers' in films such as ''[[Good Guys Wear Black]]'' (1977) and ''[[A Force of One]]'' (1979).

From [[Japan]], [[Sonny Chiba]] starred in his first [[martial arts]] movie in 1973 called the ''[[Karate Kiba]]''. His breakthrough international hit was ''[[The Street Fighter]] series'' (1974), which established him as the reigning Japanese martial arts actor in international cinema. He also played the role of [[Mas Oyama]] in ''[[Champion of Death]]'', ''[[Karate Bearfighter]],'' and ''[[Karate for Life]]'' (1975–1977). Chiba's action films were not only bounded by martial arts, but also action thriller (''[[Doberman Cop]]'' and ''[[Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon]]'' - both of 1977), [[jidaigeki]] (''[[Shogun's Samurai]]'' - 1978, ''[[Samurai Reincarnation]]'' - 1981), and science fiction (''[[G.I. Samurai]]'' - 1979).{{Clear}}

===1980s===
In the 1980s Hollywood produced many big budget action blockbusters with actors such as [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Lorenzo Lamas]], [[Michael Dudikoff]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Bruce Willis]].<ref>{{cite news|title= FILM; Wanted: New Action Stars  |publisher= The New York Times|date=January 10, 1993|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D71E39F933A25752C0A965958260|accessdate=2011-01-12|first=Pat H.|last=Broeske}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= New Hunks Move Over, Arnold.

1984 saw the beginning of the [[Terminator (franchise)]] starring [[Linda Hamilton]] and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  This story provides one of the grittiest roles for a woman in action and Hamilton was required to put in extensive effort to develop a strong physique.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/hamilton_006.htm|title=The transformation of Linda Hamilton|publisher=}}</ref>

1987's [[Lethal Weapon]] starring [[Mel Gibson]], [[Danny Glover]] and [[Darlene Love]] was another significant action film hit of the decade, and another "buddy-cop" genre classic, launching a franchise that spawned 3 sequels.

The 1988 film, ''[[Die Hard]]'', was particularly influential on the development of the action genre. In the film, [[Bruce Willis]] plays a [[New York]] police detective who inadvertently becomes embroiled in a terrorist take-over of a [[Los Angeles]] office building high-rise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Die Hard|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/die_hard/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> The use of a maverick, resourceful lone hero has always been a common thread from James Bond to John Rambo, but [[John McClane]] in ''Die Hard'' is much more of an 'everyday' person whom circumstance turns into a reluctant hero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jul/19/die-hard-25th-anniversary-action-film|title=How Die Hard set the stage for 25 years of action films|date=19 July 2013|first=Tom|last=Shone|publisher=Guardian}}</ref> The film set a pattern for a host of imitators, like  ''[[Under Siege]]'' (1992), which used the same formula in a different setting.

By the end of the 1980s, the influence of the successful action film could be felt in almost every genre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Greydanus|first=Steven D.|title=Die Hard|url=http://www.decentfilms.com/reviews/diehard|publisher=Decent Films Guide}}</ref>

===1990s===
Like the Western genre, spy-movies, as well as urban-action films, were starting to parody themselves, and with the growing revolution in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] (computer generated imagery), the "real-world" settings began to give way to increasingly fantastic environments.<ref>{{cite web|last=VREESWIJK|first=Simon|title=A History of CGI in Movies|url=http://www.stikkymedia.com/blog/history-cgi-movies|publisher=Stikky Media}}</ref>   This new era of action films often had budgets unlike any in the history of motion pictures.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Film The 1990s The Era of Mainstream Films and "Indie" Cinema, the Rise of Computer-Generated Imagery, the Decade of Re-makes, Re-releases, and More Sequels|url=http://www.filmsite.org/90sintro.html|publisher=AMC Filmsite}}</ref>  The success of the many Dirty Harry and James Bond sequels had proven that a single successful action film could lead to a continuing action franchise. Thus, the 1980s and 1990s saw a rise in both budgets and the number of sequels a film could generally have.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robbins|first=Shawn|title=Analysis: Why Action Franchises Really Do 'Die Hard'|url=http://www.boxoffice.com/articles/2013-02-number-crunch-the-fiscal-opportunity-beyond-trilogies|publisher=Box Office: The Business of Movies}}</ref> This led to an increasing number of filmmakers to create new technologies that would allow them to beat the competition and take audiences to new heights.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=What's the next technology that will change the way you watch movies?|url=http://io9.com/5940385/whats-the-next-technology-that-will-change-the-way-you-watch-movies|publisher=io9}}</ref>   The success of [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) led to a string of financially successful sequels. Within a single decade, they proved the viability of a novel subgenre of action film: the comic-book movie.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowes|first=Danny|title=Big Screen Batman: Batman (1989)|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/02/big-screen-batman-batman-1989|publisher=Tor.com}}</ref>

===2000s===
While action films continued to flourish as the medium-budget genre movie,{{example?}} it also fused with [[Tent-pole (entertainment)|tent-pole pictures]] in other genres.<ref>{{cite web|last=Binder|first=Jack|title=Summer 2012 Studio Tentpole Film Budget List|url=http://www.filmbudget.com/blog/page/3/|publisher=Film Budget Inc. Blog}}</ref>  For example, 2009's ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' had several science fiction tropes and concepts like time travel through a black hole. However, most of the film was structured around action sequences, many of them quite conventional (hand-to-hand, shooting). While the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' featured some of this kind of fighting, there was just as much emphasis on star-ship chases and dog fights in outer space. The newer films featured more light-saber duels, sometimes more intense and acrobatic than the originals. Some [[Star Wars fan films|fan films]] also have similar duel scenes like those the prequel trilogy. It was action with a science fiction twist. The trend with films such as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy|The Dark Knight]]'' series, is that hand-to-hand fighting and Asian martial-arts techniques are now widely used in science fiction and superhero movies.

Sylvester Stallone's ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' used nostalgia for a perceived golden age of action films by casting 1980s action stars alongside new actors in the genre such as [[Jason Statham]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Webster|first=Andy|title=Action Star With Savoir-Faire and a Killer Kick|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/movies/jason-statham-action-star-with-savoir-faire-and-a-killer-kick.html?_r=1&|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 18, 2013}}</ref>

In [[The Fast and the Furious|''The Fast and the Furious'' series]] the action film staple of the car chase is the central plot driver as it had been in [[Smokey and the Bandit]] films in the 1970s.

===2010s===

The cross-over of action with science fiction and superhero films continues with many [[Marvel Comics]] characters and settings being used for big budget films.

==Hong Kong action cinema==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
{{main|Hong Kong action cinema}}

Currently, action films requiring extensive [[Stunt|stunt work]] and [[special effect]]s tend to be expensive. As such, they are regarded as mostly a large-studio genre in [[Hollywood]], although this is not the case in [[Hong Kong action cinema]], where action films are often modern variations of [[martial arts film]]s. Because of their roots and lower budgets, Hong Kong action films typically center on physical acrobatics, [[martial arts]] fight scenes, stylized [[Gun fu|gun-play]], and dangerous stunt work performed by leading [[stunt actor]]s. On the other hand, American action films typically feature big explosions, car chases, [[stunt double]]s and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[special effects]].

Hong Kong action cinema was at its peak from the 1970s to 1990s, when its action movies were experimenting with and popularizing various new techniques that would eventually be adopted by Hollywood action movies. This began in the early 1970s with the martial arts movies of [[Bruce Lee]], which led to a wave of [[Bruceploitation]] movies that eventually gave way to the comedy [[kung fu]] films of [[Jackie Chan]] by the end of the decade. During the 1980s, Hong Kong action cinema re-invented itself with various new movies. These included the modern martial arts action movies featuring physical acrobatics and dangerous stunt work of [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team|Jackie Chan and his stunt team]], as well as [[Yuen Biao]] and [[Sammo Hung]]; the [[wire fu]] and [[wuxia]] films of [[Jet Li]], [[Donnie Yen]], [[Yuen Woo-Ping]] and [[Tsui Hark]]; the [[gun fu]], [[heroic bloodshed]] and [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] films of [[Chow Yun-Fat]], [[Ringo Lam]] and [[John Woo]]; and the [[girls with guns]] films of [[Michelle Yeoh]] and [[Moon Lee]].

* '''[[Martial arts film|Martial arts]]''' - A subgenre of the action film, [[martial arts]] films contain numerous [[fight]]s between characters.  They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value, and are often the method of storytelling, character expression and development. Martial arts films contain many characters who are martial artists. These roles are often played by actors who are real martial artists. If not, actors usually fervently train in preparation for their roles.  Another method of going around this issue is that the action director may rely more on stylized action or film making tricks. Martial films include ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'', ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'', ''[[Ninja Assassin]]'', ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior|Ong-Bak]]'', ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'', ''[[Kill Bill]]'', ''[[Fist of Legend]]'', ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'', ''[[Drunken Master]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[The Raid: Redemption]]'', ''[[Flash Point (film)|Flash Point]]'', ''[[Champion of Death]]'', ''[[Karate Bearfighter]]'', ''[[Doberman Cop]]'', ''[[Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon]]'', ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'', ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' [[Charlie's Angels (film)]] and ''[[The Street Fighter]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/street-fighter-v134008 |title=Street Fighter (1994) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref> A variant of the genre is [[Wuxia]], a stylized action fantasy period genre typically set in Ancient Asia where skill in the martial arts can enable fantastic abilities like flying and magic like abilities.
* '''Sci-fi action''' - Sharing many of the conventions of a [[science fiction film]], sci-fi action films emphasizes gun-play, space battles, invented weaponry, and other sci-fi elements weaved into action film premises. Examples include ''[[G.I. Samurai]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[The Island (1980 film)|The Island]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', the ''[[Men in Black (film series)|Men in Black franchise]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[I, Robot (film)|I Robot]]'', ''[[Transformers (2007 film)|Transformers]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[The Maze Runner (film)|The Maze Runner]]'', ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]'',  ''[[District 9]]'',  ''[[Serenity (film)|Serenity]]'',  ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'',  ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'',  ''[[Robocop]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Mad Max 2]]'', ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'', ''[[They Live]]'', ''[[Escape From New York]]'', [[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]] and ''[[The Fifth Element]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v154944 |title=The Fifth Element (1997) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date=1997-05-07 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>
* '''[[Spy film]]''': In which the hero is generally a government agent who must take violent action against agents of a rival government or (in recent years) terrorists. They often revolve around spies who are involved in investigating various events, often on a global scale. This subgenre deals with the subject of fictional [[espionage]], either in a realistic way (such as the adaptations of [[John Le Carré]]) or as a basis for fantasy (such as [[James Bond]]). It is a significant aspect of [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]],<ref>"The Spying Game: British Cinema and the Secret State", 2009 [[Cambridge Film Festival]], pp54-57 of the [http://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/CFF09-_brochure_low_res.pdf festival brochure.]</ref> with leading British directors, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Carol Reed]], making notable contributions and many films set in the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]].

* '''Action thriller''' - Featuring guns, cool explosions, and amazing set pieces, this movie type first developed in the 1970s in such films as ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]],'' and became the exemplar of the Hollywood mega-blockbuster in the 1980s in such works as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Lethal Weapon]]''. These films often feature a race against the clock, lots of violence, and a clear—often flamboyantly evil—antagonist. Though they may involve elements of crime or mystery films, those aspects take a back seat to the action. Other significant works include ''[[Hard Boiled]]'', ''[[True Romance]]'', ''[[Point Break (1991 film)|Point Break]]'', ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', ''[[Bullitt]]'', ''[[The Seven-Ups]]'',  ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', ''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/action-thriller-d509|title=Subgenre - Action Thriller - AllMovie|work=AllMovie}}</ref> The story takes place in limited location; a single building, plane, or vessel - which is seized or under threat by enemy agents, but are opposed by a single hero who fights an extended battle within the location using stealth and cunning to attempt to defeat them.<ref name="HardStuff">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299795,00.html |title=The 'Hard' Stuff |last1=Broeske |first1=Pat H. |last2=Wells |first2=Jeffrey |date=December 1, 1995 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher= |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref> The ''[[Die Hard]]'' subgenre has become popular in Hollywood because of its crowd appeal and the relative simplicity of building sets for such a constrained piece. Examples include ''[[Under Siege]]'' (terrorists take over a ship), ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (terrorists hijack a nuclear weapon from a B-2 bomber), ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (poisonous snakes take over a passenger plane), ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'' and ''[[Derailed (2002 film)|Derailed]]'' (hostages are trapped on trains and buses), ''[[Sudden Death (1995 film)|Sudden Death]]'' (terrorists take over an Ice Hockey stadium), ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Executive Decision]]'' and ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (hostages are trapped on a plane), ''[[Con Air]]'' (criminals take over a transport plane), and ''[[Half Past Dead]]'' and ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (criminals or terrorists take over a prison). ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]'' is a recent [[Parody|spoof]] of this trend (as ''Die Hard'' in a mall).
