'''''Adult Video News''''' (also called '''''AVN''''' or '''''AVN Magazine''''') is an [[United States|American]] [[trade journal]] that covers the adult video industry. ''[[The New York Times]]'' notes that ''AVN'' is to [[pornographic film]]s what ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' is to records. ''AVN'' sponsors an annual convention, called the [[Adult Entertainment Expo]] or AEE, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] along with an award show for the adult industry modeled after the [[Oscars]].<ref>{{cite web| author = Timothy Egan | title = Wall Street Meets Pornography | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/23/technology/23PORN.html?ei=5070&en=cf2eac8f093695d5&ex=1199422800&pagewanted=all | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]'' | date = 2000-10-23 | accessdate = 2014-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author = Steve Kroft | title = Porn In The U.S.A. | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/21/60minutes/main585049.shtml | publisher = ''[[60 Minutes]]'' | date = 2004-09-05 | accessdate = 2008-01-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080103014218/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/21/60minutes/main585049.shtml| archivedate= 3 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

''AVN'' rates adult films and tracks news developments in the industry. An ''AVN'' issue can feature over 500 movie reviews.<ref>{{cite web| author = Frank Rich | title = Finally, Porn Does Prime Time | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/arts/27RICH.html?ei=5007&en=00eab4b1b37e54de&ex=1374638400&partner=USERLAND&pagewanted=all&position= | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]'' | date = 2003-07-27 | accessdate = 2014-08-09}} </ref><ref>{{cite web| author = DPA, Los Angeles | title = Porn loses seedy image, becomes mainstream in US | url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2003/07/17/2003059757 | publisher = ''[[Taipei Times]]'' | date = 2003-07-17 | accessdate = 2008-01-02}}</ref> The magazine is about 80% ads and is targeted at adult-video retailers.

==History==
Paul Fishbein, Irv Slifkin, and Barry Rosenblatt founded ''AVN'' in 1983 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Slifkin left in 1984; having lost interest in reviewing adult movies due to the industry's transition from [[Film stock|film]] to [[videotape|videos]]. Rosenblatt and Fishbein had a falling out in 1987. Eventually, Fishbein moved the magazine to the [[San Fernando Valley]] where it operates to this day.<ref>{{cite web| author = Anthony Layser | title = Porn Supremecy | url = http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/16173 | publisher = ''[[Philadelphia Weekly]]'' | date = 2008-01-09 | accessdate = 2008-01-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080112175057/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/16173| archivedate= 12 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Fishbein sold the company in 2010.<ref name="gadget">{{cite news|url=http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/silicon-and-silicone-split-as-c-e-s-and-porn-show-part-ways/|title=Silicon and Silicone Split, as C.E.S. and Adult Entertainment Expo Part Ways|last=Nick Wingfield|date=2012-01-09|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>

''AVN'' is widely quoted for various figures about the adult industry and its revenues.<ref name=ackman /><ref name=keveney>{{cite web| author = Bill Keveney | title = Hollywood gets in bed with porn  | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/2003-10-16-porn_x.htm | publisher = ''[[USA Today]]'' | date = 2003-10-16 | accessdate = 2008-01-02}}</ref><ref name=silverstein /> ''AVN'' estimated that the sales and rentals of adult videos topped four billion dollars in 2000<ref name=ackman /> and 2002.<ref name=keveney /> ''[[Forbes]]'' has called this figure "baseless and wildly inflated". When ''Forbes'' asked ''AVN'' how it arrived at this figure, the managing editor responded, "I don't know the exact methodology... It's a pie chart." When asked to separate the figures for sales versus rentals, a standard practice among those who cover the video industry, the editor did not think those figures were available. [[Adams Media Research]] noted that no one tracked the adult video business with rigor or precision and that the most generous estimate of sales and rentals combined was $1.8 billion.<ref name=ackman>{{cite web| author = Dan Ackman | title = How Big Is Porn?  | url = http://www.forbes.com/2001/05/25/0524porn.html | publisher = ''[[Forbes]]'' | date = 2001-05-25 | accessdate = 2008-01-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213075014/http://www.forbes.com/2001/05/25/0524porn.html%20| archivedate= 13 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> ''AVN'' estimated that adult industry revenue in 2005 was $12.6 billion with $2.5 billion of that coming from the Internet.

== AVN Europe ==
In October 2007, AVN launched the first ever pan-European, English-language adult industry trade-magazine, ''AVN Europe'', with editorial offices based in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. For about two years, AVN Europe published monthly issues with reviews and news items as well as in-depth background articles on such topics as historical development, distribution patterns and women's erotica. By mid-2009, following a change of editorial staff, the publication lowered its ambitions somewhat, focusing more on photos from trade shows and other light-weight content. It folded soon after; the last issue was June 2009.

== Adult Entertainment Expo ==
