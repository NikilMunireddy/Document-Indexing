'''Daytona International Speedway''' is a [[race track]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], [[United States]].  Since opening in 1959, it has been the home of the [[Daytona 500]], the most prestigious race in [[NASCAR]]. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]], [[AMA Superbike]], [[United SportsCar Championship|USCC]], [[SCCA]], and [[Motocross]]. The track features multiple layouts including the primary {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} high speed [[tri-oval]], a {{convert|3.56|mi|km}} [[sports car]] course, a {{convert|2.95|mi|km}} motorcycle course, and a {{convert|.25|mi|km}} karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's {{convert|180|acre|adj=on}} infield includes the {{convert|29|acre|adj=on}} Lake Lloyd, which has hosted [[powerboat]] racing. The speedway is owned and operated by [[International Speedway Corporation]].

The track was built in 1959 by NASCAR founder [[William France, Sr.|William "Bill" France, Sr.]] to host racing that was held at the former [[Daytona Beach Road Course]]. His banked design permitted higher speeds and gave fans a better view of the cars. Lights were installed around the track in 1998, and today it is the third-largest single lit outdoor sports facility. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004 and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.

On January 22, 2013, the track unveiled artist depictions of a renovated speedway. On July 5, 2013, ground was broken on the project that will remove backstretch seating and completely redevelop the frontstretch seating. The renovation to the speedway is being completed by Design-Builder Barton Malow Company in partnership with Rossetti Architects. The project, named "Daytona Rising", was completed in January 2016, and cost [[United States dollar|US $]]400 million, placing emphasis on improving fan experience with five expanded and redesigned fan entrances (called "injectors"), as well as wider and more comfortable seating with more restrooms and concession stands. After the renovations were completed, the track's grandstands include 101,000 permanent seats with the ability to increase permanent seating to 125,000.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Steve|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/news/daytona-international-unveils-plans-upgrade-215431071--nascar.html|title=Daytona International unveils plans for upgrade|publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Track history==

===Construction===
[[NASCAR]] founder [[William France Sr.]] began planning for the track in 1953 as a way to promote the series, which at the time was racing on the [[Daytona Beach Road Course]].<ref name="Hawkins&nbsp;— Tales from 500">{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Jim|title=Tales from the Daytona 500|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2003|edition=illustrated|pages=13–14 of 200|chapter=Big Bill's Dream for America's Speed Capital|isbn=978-1-58261-530-1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UGbf0A2G10gC&pg=PA1&dq=1959+Daytona+500+qualify#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=September 28, 2009}}</ref> France met with Daytona Beach engineer Charles Moneypenny to discuss his plans for the speedway. He wanted the track to have the highest banking possible to allow the cars to reach high speeds and to give fans a better view of the cars on track. Moneypenny traveled to [[Detroit, Michigan]] to visit the [[Ford Proving Grounds]] which had a high speed test track with banked corners. Ford shared their engineering reports of the track with Moneypenny, providing the needed details of how to transition the pavement from a flat straightaway to a banked corner. France took the plans to the Daytona Beach city commission, who supported his idea and formed the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority.<ref name="created">{{cite web|last=Aumann|first=Mark|title=How Daytona International Speedway was created|url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/headlines/cup/02/04/daytona.500.dis.history/story_single.html|publisher=Nascar.com}}</ref>
[[File:Daytona International Speedway 2011.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The tri-oval after the 2010-2011 repaving]]
The city commission agreed to lease the {{convert|447|acre}} parcel of land adjacent to [[Daytona Beach International Airport|Daytona Beach Municipal Airport]] to France's corporation for $10,000 a year over a 50-year period. France then began working on building funding for the project and found support from a [[Texas]] oil millionaire, Clint Murchison. Murchison loaned France $600,000 along with the construction equipment necessary to build the track. France was also able to secure funding from [[Pepsi-Cola]], [[General Motors]] designer [[Harley Earl]], a second mortgage on his home and selling 300,000 stock shares to local residents. Ground broke on construction of the {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} speedway on November 25, 1957.<ref name="created" />

To build the high banking, crews had to dig out millions{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} of tons of soil from the track's infield. Because of the high water table in the area, the excavated hole filled with water to form what is now known as Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph "Sax" Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake would be stocked with 65,000 fish, and France would arrange [[speedboat]] races on it.)<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. "Daytona", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.503.</ref> 22 tons of [[lime mortar]] had to be brought in to form the track's [[base course|binding base]], over which [[asphalt]] would be laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny had to come up with a way to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored at the top of the banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed [[Talladega Superspeedway]] and [[Michigan International Speedway]]. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.<ref name="created" />

[[File:Daytona International Speedway on the day of the Daytona 500.JPG|thumb|left|The tri-oval during the [[2015 Daytona 500]].|200px]]
The first practice run on the new track began on February 6, 1959. On February 22, 1959, 42,000 people attended the inaugural Daytona 500,<ref name="created" /> and its finish was as startling as the track itself: [[Lee Petty]] beat [[Johnny Beauchamp]] in a [[photo finish]] that took three days to adjudicate.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.503">Kettlewell, p.503.</ref> When the track opened it was the fastest race track to ever host a stock car race, until [[Talladega Superspeedway]] opened 10 years later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} April 4, it would host a {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[Champ Car]] event, also, which saw [[Jim Rathmann]] beat [[Dick Rathmann]] and [[Rodger Ward]], and, with an average speed {{convert|170.26|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, was at the time the fastest motor race ever.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"/> It was also the occasion of Daytona's first fatality: [[George Amick]], attempting to overtake for third late in the race, hit a wall and was killed.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"/> April 5, a scheduled {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[sports car racing|sports car]] event (shortened to {{convert|560|mi|km|abbr=on}} by darkness) was won by [[Roberto Mieres]] and [[Fritz d'Orey]], who shared a [[Porsche 718|Porsche RSK]], which proved more durable than more potent competition.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"/>

Lights were installed around the track in 1998 to run NASCAR's July race, the [[Coke Zero 400]] at night. The track was the world's largest single lighted outdoor sports facility until being surpassed by [[Losail International Circuit]] in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Musco Lighting]] installed the lighting system, which took into account glare and visibility for aircraft arriving and departing nearby Daytona Beach International Airport, and costs about $240 per hour when in operation.<ref name="musco">{{cite web|title=Daytona International Speedway|url=http://www.musco.com/projshow/project.php?id=138+motorsports|publisher=Musco Lighting|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref>

===Layouts===

====Tri-Oval====
[[Image:Daytona International Speedway.svg|thumb|left|Map of the speedway]]
Daytona's [[tri-oval]] is {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long with 31° banking in the turns and 18° banking at the start/finish line.  The front straight is {{convert|3800|ft|m}} long and the back straight (or "superstretch") is {{convert|3000|ft|m}} long.  The tri-oval shape was revolutionary at the time as it greatly improved sight lines for fans. It is one of the two tracks on the Sprint Cup Series circuit that uses [[restrictor plate]]s to slow the cars down due to the high speeds, the other being [[Talladega Superspeedway]].<ref name="trackfacts">{{cite web|title=Track Facts|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/Track-Facts.aspx|publisher=Daytonainternationalspeedway.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref>

On July 15, 2010, repaving of the track began. This came almost a year earlier than planned due to the track coming apart during the [[2010 Daytona 500]]. The project used an estimated 50,000 tons{{vague|date=April 2014}}<!--long, short or metric?--> of asphalt to repave {{convert|1400000|sqft|m2}} including the racing surface, apron, skid pads and pit road. Because of good weather, the project was completed ahead of schedule.<ref name=goodyear>{{cite web|title=Goodyear Tire Test on Daytona's New Racing Surface Set For Dec. 15–16|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2010/11/Homestead-Miami-Update.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=November 20, 2010}}</ref>

On October 9, 2013, [[Colin Braun]] drove a [[Daytona Prototype]] car prepared by [[Michael Shank Racing]] to set a single-lap record on the tri-oval configuration of {{convert|222.971|mph}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/GRAND-AM/News/Articles/2013/09/Braun-Sets-Daytona-Speed-Record.aspx|title=Braun Sets Daytona Speed Record|date=October 9, 2013|work=[[Motor Racing Network]]|accessdate=October 10, 2013|location=Concord, NC}}</ref>

====Road courses====
[[Image:Daytona International Speedway - Road Course.svg|thumb|left|Map of the 24-hour road course configuration]]
The 3.81-mile (6.13&nbsp;km) road course was built in 1959 and first hosted a three-hour sports car race called the Daytona Continental in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.na-motorsports.com/Tracks/FL/Daytona.html|title=Daytona International Speedway|work=na-motorsports.com|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}</ref> The race length became {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1964,<ref name="Kettlewell, p.503" /> and in 1966 was extended to a 24-hour endurance race known as the [[Rolex 24 at Daytona]]. It was shortened again to six hours in 1972 and cancelled entirely in 1974.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.503"/>

In 1973, a sharp chicane was added at the end of the backstretch, approaching oval turn three.

In 1984<ref>http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1984.html#1</ref> and 1985,<ref>http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1985.html#1</ref> the layout was modified, re-profiling turns 1 and 2, and moving what is now turn 3 closer to its adjacent turns. In addition, the chicane on the backstretch was modified. A new entry leg was constructed approximately {{Convert|400|ft|m}} earlier, resulting in a longer, three-legged, "bus stop" shape. Cars would now enter in the first leg, bypass the second leg, and exit out of the existing third leg. Passing would now be possible inside the longer chicane. The construction resulted in a final length of {{convert|3.81|mi|km}} for the complete road course.

In 2003, the chicane was modified once again. The middle leg was repaved and widened, and now cars would enter through the first leg, and exit out of the second leg. The existing third leg was abandoned. This allowed cars a cleaner entry into oval turn three. After favorable results, in 2010 the third leg was dug up, and removed permanently.

While the more famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] is held near the [[summer solstice]], Daytona's endurance race is held in winter (meaning more of the race is run at night). The track's lighting system is limited to 20% of its maximum output for the race to keep cars dependent on their headlights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race Profile&nbsp;– 24 Hours of Daytona|url=http://www.sportscardigest.com/race-profile-%E2%80%93-24-hours-of-daytona/|publisher=Sports Car Digest|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=January 23, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Daytona International Speedway - Moto Course.png|thumb|left|Map of the Moto-Course]]
In 2005, a second infield road course configuration was constructed, primarily [[Daytona 200|for motorcycles]]. Due to fears of tire wear on the banked oval sections, oval turns 1 and 2 were bypassed giving the new course a length of {{convert|2.95|mi}}. The Daytona SportBike that runs the Daytona 200 however, uses the main road course except for the motorcycle [[Pedro Rodríguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodríguez]] Hairpin (tighter than the one used for cars; the car version is used as an acceleration lane for motorcycles).<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Dean|title=Daytona Changes Course|url=http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2004/Aug/040811a.htm|publisher=Superbikeplanet.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=August 12, 2004}}</ref>

On September 26 and 27, 2006, the [[IndyCar Series]] held a compatibility test on the 10-turn, {{convert|2.73|mi|km|sing=on}} modified road course, and the 12-turn {{convert|2.95|mi|km|sing=on}} motorcycle road course with 5 drivers. The drivers who tested at the track were [[Vitor Meira]], [[Sam Hornish Jr.]], [[Tony Kanaan]], [[Scott Dixon]] and [[Dan Wheldon]]. This marked the first time since 1984 that open wheel cars have taken to the track at Daytona.<ref>{{cite web|title=IRL Begins Testing at Daytona Road Course|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2006/09/IRL-Begins-Testing-At-Daytona-Road-Course.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=September 26, 2006}}</ref> On January 31&nbsp;– February 1, 2007, IndyCar returned for a full test involving 17 cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=IndyCar Series Kicks Off Two-Day Test at Daytona |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2007/01/Indycar-Series-Kicks-Off-Two-Day-Test-At-Daytona.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=January 31, 2007}}</ref>

====Supercross====
During [[Daytona Beach Bike Week]], a supercross track is built between pit road and the tri-oval section of the track.  Historically the track has used more sand than dirt, providing unique challenges to riders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The 2008-2013 track configurations were designed by former champion, [[Ricky Carmichael]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ricky Carmichael Designs Daytona Supercross By Honda Course For Second Straight Year|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2009/01/Ricky-Carmichael-To-Design-Daytona-Supercross-By-Honda-Course-For-Second-Straight-Year.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=January 30, 2010}}</ref>

Daytona has hosted an [[AMA Supercross Championship]] round uninterruptedly since 1971.<ref>[http://www.amasupercross.com/MediaGuide/SXMediaGuide_15_lores.pdf 2015 AMA Supercross media guide]</ref>

====Daytona Flat Track and Infield Kart Track====
Popular dirt-track races in karting and flat-track motorcycle racing had been held at [[Municipal Stadium (Daytona Beach)|Daytona Beach Municipal Stadium]] but in 2009, the city announced the stadium was replacing its entire surface with [[FieldTurf]], and thereby eliminating the flat-track racing at the stadium. To continue racing, speedway officials built the Daytona Flat Track, a new quarter-mile dirt track outside of turns 1 & 2 of the main superspeedway. It seats 5,000 in temporary grandstands and opened in December 2009 for WKA KartWeek.<ref>{{cite web|title=AMA FLAT TRACK: DIS To Construct Dirt Track|url=http://moto-racing.speedtv.com/article/ama-flat-track-dis-to-construct-dirt-track/|publisher=Speed|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=July 31, 2009}}</ref>

There is also a short paved kart/autocross track in the infield just inside of turn 3. The [[SCCA]] holds autocross on this track.

===Short track===
In February 2012, it was announced that a {{convert|0.4|mi|m|adj=on}} [[Short track motor racing|short track]] would be constructed along the backstretch of the Speedway's main course, for NASCAR's lower-tier series to compete at during Speedweeks called the [[UNOH Battle at the Beach]], which is similar to the [[Toyota All-Star Showdown]], formerly held at [[Irwindale Speedway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/story/_/id/7578503/source-daytona-adding-short-track-races-2013-daytona-500-week|title=Source: Daytona building short track|last=Haddock|first=Tim|date=February 15, 2012|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}</ref> The first races were held on that track in February 2013. The track was shorten to {{convert|0.375|mi|m|adj=on}} oval in 2014 by shorter straightaways. The future of racing at the short track is unknown after 2015 with the grandstands on the back straightaway being demolished as a part of the Daytona Rising project.

====Football====
In the fall of 1959, the track hosted several high school football games for the [[Father Lopez Catholic High School|Father Lopez Green Wave]] in their first year of their football program.

The track hosted four [[college football]] games featuring the Daytona-based [[Bethune-Cookman Wildcats]] in 1974 and 1975. In early 2014 track president Joie Chitwood expressed a desire to bring football back to the track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://college-football.si.com/2014/01/21/daytona-international-speedway-college-football/|title=Source: Daytona International Speedway hopes to host college football game after renovation|last=Newcomb|first=Tim|date=January 21, 2012|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}</ref>

==Video games==
In 1994, [[SEGA]] released an arcade game called ''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona USA]]'', using their Model 2 hardware. It involved vocals by [[Takenobu Mitsuyoshi]].

[[iRacing.com]] have laser-scanned the facility twice. The first in 2008, and 2011 once the repave was completed. Both are available in official racing series. There has been no word to when and if it will be re-scanned now that the Daytona Rising project has now been completed.<ref>http://www.iracing.com/tracks/</ref>

In 2016, [[Electronic Arts]] released an update for the mobile game ''[[Real Racing 3]]'' called "Daytona Update".

==Fatalities==
{{main|List of Daytona International Speedway fatalities}}
A total of 40 people have been fatally injured in on-track incidents: 23 car drivers, twelve motorcyclists, three go-kart drivers, one powerboat racer, and one track worker. The most notable death may have been that of [[Dale Earnhardt]], who [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|was killed]] on the last lap of the [[2001 Daytona 500]] on February 18, 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/earnhardt/list.htm#daytona|title=Auto racing fatalities list|publisher=[[USA Today|Usatoday.Com]]|date=February 18, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153103/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/earnhardt/list.htm#daytona|archivedate=October 10, 2012|dead-url=no}}</ref>

==Fan amenities==

===Sprint Fanzone===
The '''Sprint Fanzone''' is an access package similar to pit passes for fans to get closer to drivers and race teams. The fanzone was built in 2004 as part of a renovation of the track's infield.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hembree|first=Mike|title=NASCAR fans get in the 'zone' at Daytona International Speedway|url=http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/sprintcupseries/NASCAR_fans_get_in_the_zone_at_Daytona_International_Speedway.html|publisher=Scene|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=July 28, 2009}}</ref> Fans are able to walk on top of the garages, known as the "fandeck", and view track and garage activity. Fans can also view race teams working in the garage, including NASCAR technical inspection, through windows. The garage windows also include slots for fans to hand merchandise to drivers for autographs. The fanzone also includes a live entertainment stage, additional food and drink areas and various other activities and displays.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sprint FANZONE|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Tickets-Events/Events/2011/Speedweeks-2011/Sprint-FANZONE.aspx|publisher=Daytona international Speedway|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref>

The 2004 renovation of the infield, headed by design firm [[HNTB]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Daytona Speedway|url=http://www.hntb.com/our-work/market/sports#/ajax/project/976|publisher=HNTB|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> was the first major renovation of the infield in the history of the track.<ref name=aia-award>{{cite web|last=Engdahl|first=David|title=Daytona International Speedway Renovation|url=http://info.aia.org/nwsltr_db.cfm?pagename=db_a_200603_engdahl|publisher=American Institute of Architects|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> In addition to the fanzone, a new vehicle and pedestrian tunnel was built under turn 1.  The tunnel posed a challenge to engineers because it was to be built under the water table. Another challenge came during construction when three named hurricanes passed by the track, flooding much of the excavation work. The infield renovation involved landscaping and hardscaping, such as a new walkway along the shore of Lake Lloyd, and the construction of 34 new buildings, including garages and fueling stations, offices and inspection facilities, and a club. The renovation project received a 2005 Award for Excellence from Design-Build Institute of America.<ref name="aia-award"/> Following the success of the Sprint Fanzone at Daytona, [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] and [[Kansas Speedway]] each built a similar infield fanzone.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Budweiser Party Porch===
The '''Budweiser Party Porch''' was a {{convert|46|ft}} high porch located along the backstretch of the track. It was built on top of a portion of the backstretch grandstands and includes a {{convert|277|ft}} wide, {{convert|33|ft}} tall sign, the largest sign in motorsports.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The porch featured tables, food and drinks, offering fans a "fun-filled" atmosphere that breaks fans away from the confines of grandstand seating without sacrificing on the view. Below the porch was an interactive fan zone featuring amusement rides, a go-kart track, show cars and merchandise trailers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Budweiser Party Porch Is The Place To Be on the Superstretch for the 52nd Annual Daytona 500|url=http://www.catchfence.com/2010/sprintcup/02/09/budweiser-party-porch-is-the-place-to-be-on-the-superstretch-for-the-52nd-annual-daytona-500/|publisher=The Catchfence|accessdate=November 22, 2010|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> After the 2015 racing season, the Party Porch was torn down with the backstretch grandstands as part of the DAYTONA Rising project.
