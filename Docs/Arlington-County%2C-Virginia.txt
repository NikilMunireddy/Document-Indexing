'''Arlington County''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] in the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]]. It is coterminous with the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]]-[[census-designated place]] of Arlington, which is the second-largest [[principal city]] of the [[Washington metropolitan area]].<ref name=omb1301>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b-13-01.pdf|title=OMB BULLETIN NO. 13-01|publisher=[[WhiteHouse.gov]]}}</ref> As a result, the county is often referred to in the region simply as "'''Arlington'''" or "'''Arlington, Virginia'''". In 2014, the county's population was estimated to be 229,302,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics/virginia-population-estimates#popestimates |publisher=Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service |author=Demographics Research Group |date=January 27, 2014 |title=July 1, 2014 Estimates |work=Virginia Population Estimates |accessdate=February 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214063231/http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics/virginia-population-estimates#popestimates |archivedate=February 14, 2014 }}</ref> which would make it the fourth-largest city in the Commonwealth if it were incorporated as such.

The land that became Arlington was originally donated by Virginia to the United States government to form part of the new federal [[capital district]] of Columbia. On February 27, 1801, a year after moving from the temporary National Capital at [[Philadelphia]] to the [[Washington, D.C.|City of Washington]], the [[United States Congress]] organized the area as a subdivision of the District named '''Alexandria County'''. In 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|returned the land]] southwest of the Potomac River donated by Virginia due to issues involving [[District of Columbia voting rights|Congressional representation]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The [[General Assembly of Virginia]] changed the county's name to Arlington in 1920 to avoid confusion with the adjacent [[Alexandria, Virginia|City of Alexandria]]. <!-- this seems redundant: Arlington County shares with a portion of the independent [[Alexandria, Virginia|City of Alexandria]] (including the former town of [[Potomac, Virginia|Potomac]]) the distinction of being once in Virginia, then ceded to the U.S. government to form the [[District of Columbia]], and later retroceded to Virginia.-->

The county is situated in [[Northern Virginia]] on the south bank of the [[Potomac River]] directly across from Washington, D.C. Arlington is also bordered by [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and [[Falls Church, Virginia|City of Falls Church]] to the northwest, west and southwest, and the City of Alexandria to the southeast. With a land area of {{convert|26|sqmi|km2}}, Arlington is the geographically smallest [[Political subdivisions of Virginia|self-governing county]] in the United States, and due to state law regarding population density, has no other incorporated towns within its borders. <!--As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 207,627.<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51013.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}</ref> -->

Due to the county's proximity to downtown Washington, D.C., Arlington is headquarters to many departments and agencies of the [[federal government of the United States]], including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA), and [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA). It is also home to [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]]. The many federal agencies, government contractors, and service industries contribute to Arlington's stable economy. Arlington is also the location of national memorials and museums, including [[Arlington National Cemetery]], the [[Pentagon Memorial]], the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]], and the [[United States Air Force Memorial]].

==History==

===Foundation===
The area that now constitutes Arlington County was originally part of [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]]. Land grants from the British monarch were awarded to prominent Englishmen in exchange for political favors and efforts at development. One of the grantees was [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], who lends his name to both Fairfax County and the [[Fairfax, Virginia|City of Fairfax]]. The name Arlington goes back to Earl [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Henry Bennet]] of [[Earldom of Arlington|Arlington]], the namesake of a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]], Arlington Plantation, along the Potomac River, and [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], the family residence on that property. [[George Washington Parke Custis]], grandson of First Lady [[Martha Washington]], acquired this land in 1802. The estate was eventually passed down to [[Mary Anna Custis Lee]], wife of General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/willofgeorgewashingtonparkecustis.htm |title=Will of George Washington Parke Custis |publisher=Nathanielturner.com |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> The property later became [[Arlington National Cemetery]] during the [[American Civil War]], and eventually lent its name to present-day Arlington County.

The area that now contains Arlington County was ceded to the new United States federal government by the Commonwealth of Virginia. With the passage of the [[Residence Act]] in 1790, Congress approved a new permanent capital to be located on the [[Potomac River]], the exact area to be selected by U.S. President [[George Washington]]. The Residence Act originally only allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as what is now the [[Anacostia River]]. However, President Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast in order to include the pre-existing city of Alexandria at the District's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including the territory ceded by Virginia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb|author3=John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

During 1791–92, [[Andrew Ellicott]] and several assistants placed [[Boundary Stones (District of Columbia)|boundary stones]] at every mile point. Fourteen of these markers were in Virginia and many of the stones are still standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/ |title=Boundary Stones of Washington, D.C. |publisher=BoundaryStones.org |accessdate=May 27, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515194639/http://www.boundarystones.org/| archivedate= May 15, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[File:1878 Alexandria County Virginia.jpg|thumb|1878 map of Alexandria County, now Arlington County]]
When Congress arrived in the new capital, they passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801|Organic Act of 1801]] to officially organize the District of Columbia and placed the entire federal territory, including the cities of Washington, [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown]], and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], under the exclusive control of Congress. Further, the unincorporated territory within the District was organized into two counties: the [[Washington County, D.C.|County of Washington]] to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west. It included all of the present Arlington County, plus part of what is now the [[independent city]] of Alexandria.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb|author3=John Wooldridge |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

===Retrocession===
Residents of Alexandria County had expected the federal capital's location to result in land sales and the growth of commerce. Instead the county found itself struggling to compete with the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] at the port of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], which was farther inland and on the northern side of the Potomac River next to the City of Washington.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Washington, D.C |url=http://www.historydc.org/aboutdc.aspx |publisher=[[Historical Society of Washington, D.C.]] |accessdate=October 3, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100918042009/http://www.historydc.org/aboutdc.aspx| archivedate= September 18, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Members of Congress from other areas of Virginia also used their power to prohibit funding for projects, such as the [[Alexandria Canal (Virginia)|Alexandria Canal]], which would have increased competition with their home districts. In addition, Congress had prohibited the federal government from establishing any offices in Alexandria, which made the county less important to the functioning of the national government.<ref name=debates>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Mark David|date=Spring–Summer 2004|title=The Debates over the Retrocession of the District of Columbia, 1801–2004|journal=Washington History|publisher=www.dcvote.org|pages=54–82|url=http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf|accessdate=January 16, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090118053203/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf| archivedate= January 18, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Alexandria had also been a major market in the [[Slavery in the United States|American slave trade]], and rumors circulated that [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] in Congress were attempting to end slavery in the District; such an action would have further depressed Alexandria's slavery-based economy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Greeley |first=Horace |title=The American Conflict: A History of the Great Rebellion in the United States |publisher=G. & C.W. Sherwood |year=1864 |location=Chicago |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZlIMAAAAYAAJ |pages=142–144}}</ref> At the same time, an active abolitionist movement arose in Virginia that created a division on the question of slavery in the Virginia General Assembly. Pro-slavery Virginians recognized that if Alexandria were returned to the Commonwealth, it could provide two new representatives who favored slavery in the state legislature. During the American Civil War, this division led to the formation of the state of [[West Virginia]], which comprised the 55 counties in the northwest that favored abolitionism.<ref name=richards>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Mark David|date=Spring–Summer 2004|title=The Debates over the Retrocession of the District of Columbia, 1801–2004|journal=Washington History|publisher=Historical Society of Washington, D.C.|pages=54–82|url=http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf|accessdate=January 16, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090118053203/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf| archivedate= January 18, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Largely as a result of the economic neglect by Congress, divisions over slavery, and the lack of voting rights for the residents of the District, a movement grew to return Alexandria to Virginia from the District of Columbia. From 1840 to 1846, Alexandrians petitioned Congress and the Virginia legislature to approve this transfer known as [[District of Columbia retrocession|retrocession]]. On February 3, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the retrocession of Alexandria if Congress approved. Following additional lobbying by Alexandrians, [[List of United States federal legislation#1841 to 1851|Congress passed legislation on July 9, 1846]], to return all the District's territory south of the Potomac River back to the Commonwealth of Virginia, pursuant to a referendum; President [[James K. Polk]] signed the legislation the next day. A referendum on retrocession was held on September 1–2, 1846. The residents of the City of Alexandria voted in favor of the retrocession, 734 to 116; however, the residents of Alexandria County voted against retrocession 106 to 29. Despite the objections of those living in Alexandria County, President Polk certified the referendum and issued a proclamation of transfer on September 7, 1846. However, the Virginia legislature did not immediately accept the retrocession offer. Virginia legislators were concerned that the people of Alexandria County had not been properly included in the retrocession proceedings. After months of debate, the Virginia General Assembly voted to formally accept the retrocession legislation on March 13, 1847.<ref name=debates /> In 1852, the Virginia legislature voted to incorporate a portion of Alexandria County to make the City of Alexandria, which until then had been only been considered politically as a town.<ref name=Incorporation_of_Alexandria>{{cite web | url = http://alexandriava.gov/city/about-alexandria/about.html#history | title = Alexandria's History | accessdate =August 30, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829220638/http://alexandriava.gov/city/about-alexandria/about.html| archivedate= August 29, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Civil War===
During the [[Virginia in the American Civil War|American Civil War]], Virginia seceded from the Union as a result of a statewide referendum held on May 23, 1861; the voters from Alexandria County approved secession by a vote of 958–48. This vote indicates the degree to which its only town, Alexandria, was pro-secession and pro-Confederate. The Union loyalists who lived in rural areas outside the town of Alexandria, rejected secession.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bradley E.

In 1862, the [[United States Congress]] passed a law that provided that those districts in which the "insurrection" persisted were to pay their real estate taxes in person.

In 1864, during the war, the federal government confiscated the [[Abingdon (plantation)|Abingdon]] estate, which was located on and near the present [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]], when its owner failed to pay the estate's property tax in person because he was serving in the [[Confederate Army]].<ref name=Wikisource1>[[s: Bennett v.

[[File:Arlington House.jpg|thumb|The façade of [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] appears on Arlington's seal, flag, and logo]]
After the war ended in 1865, the Abingdon estate's heir, Alexander Hunter, started a legal action to recover the property. [[James A. Garfield]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who had been a [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] in the [[Union Army]] during the Civil War and who later became the [[List of Presidents of the United States|20th President of the United States]], was an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] on Hunter's legal team.<ref name=Wikisource1/><ref name=Wallace/>  In 1870, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in a precedential ruling, found that the government had illegally confiscated the property and ordered that it be returned to Hunter.<ref name=Wikisource1/><ref name=Wallace/>

The property containing the home of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s family at and around [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] was subjected to an appraisal of $26,810, on which a tax of $92.07 was assessed. However, Lee's wife, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee]], the owner of the property, did not pay this tax in person.<ref name=tax>{{cite web|accessdate=2011-09-30|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/historical_information/arlington_house.html|title=Arlington House|work= History of Arlington National Cemetery|publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]]}}</ref><ref name=Wikisource2>[[s: United States v.

Confederate incursions from Falls Church, [[Minor's Hill]] and [[Upton's Hill]]—-then securely in Confederate hands—-occurred as far east as the present-day area of [[Ballston, Arlington, Virginia|Ballston]]. On August 17, 1861 an armed force of 600 Confederate soldiers engaged the 23rd New York Infantry near that crossroads, killing one. Another large incursion on August 27 involved between 600 and 800 Confederate soldiers, which clashed with Union soldiers at Ball’s Crossroads, Hall’s Hill and along the modern-day border between the City of Falls Church and Arlington. A number of soldiers on both sides were killed. However, the territory in present-day Arlington was never successfully captured by Confederate forces.<ref>Gernand, ''A Virginia Village Goes to War'', pp. 73–74, 89.</ref>

===Separation from Alexandria===
In 1870, the City of Alexandria became legally separated from Alexandria County by an amendment to the Virginia Constitution that made all Virginia [[incorporated cities]] (but not [[incorporated towns]]) independent of the counties of which they had previously been a part. Because of the confusion between the city and the county having the same name, a movement started to rename Alexandria County. In 1920, the name '''Arlington County''' was adopted, after [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], the home of the [[American Civil War]] general [[Robert E. Lee]], which stands on the grounds of what is now [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The [[Potomac, Virginia|Town of Potomac]] was incorporated as a town in Alexandria County in 1908. The town was annexed by the [[independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in 1930.

In 1896, an electric trolley line was built from Washington through Ballston, which led to growth in the county (see [[Northern Virginia trolleys]]).

===20th century===
[[File:Seal of Arlington County, Virginia (1983-2007).png|thumb|upright|left|The former Arlington County seal, used from June 1983 to May 2007]]

In 1920, the Virginia legislature renamed the area Arlington County to avoid confusion with the City of Alexandria which had become an [[independent city]] in 1870 under the new Virginia Constitution adopted after the Civil War.

In the 1930s, [[Hoover Field]] was established on the present site of the Pentagon; in that decade, Buckingham, Colonial Village
, and other apartment communities also opened. World War II brought a boom to the county, but one that could not be met by new construction due to rationing imposed by the war effort.

In October 1942, not a single rental unit was available in the county.<ref>Arlington Sun Gazette, October 15, 2009, "Arlington history", page 6, quoting from the ''Northern Virginia Sun''</ref> The [[Henry G. Shirley]] Highway (now [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia–Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) was constructed during World War II, along with adjacent developments such as [[Shirlington, Arlington, Virginia|Shirlington]], [[Fairlington, Arlington, Virginia|Fairlington]], and [[Parkfairfax, Virginia|Parkfairfax]].

In February 1959, Arlington County Schools [[desegregated]] racially at Stratford Junior High School (now H-B Woodlawn) with the admission of black pupils Donald Deskins, Michael Jones, Lance Newman, and Gloria Thompson.  The [[US Supreme Court]]'s ruling in 1954, [[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka, Kansas had struck down the previous ruling on racial segregation [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] that held that facilities could be racially "separate but equal."  ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruled that "racially separate educational facilities were inherently unequal." The elected Arlington County School Board presumed that the state would defer to localities and in January 1956 announced plans to integrate Arlington schools.  The state responded by suspending the county's right to an elected school board. The Arlington County Board, the ruling body for the county, appointed conservatives to the school board and blocked plans for desegregation.  Lawyers for the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) filed suit on behalf of a group of parents of both white and black students to end segregation.  Black pupils were still denied admission to white schools, but the lawsuit went before the U.S. District Court, which ruled that Arlington schools were to be desegregated by the 1958-59 academic year. In January 1959 both the US District Court and the Virginia Supreme Court had ruled against the Commonwealth of Virginia's [[massive resistance]] movement, which opposed racial integration.<ref>Les Shaver, "Crossing the Divide: The Desegregation of Stratford Junior High," ''Arlington Magazine'' November/December 2013, pp. 62-71</ref> The Arlington County Central Library's collections includes written materials as well as accounts in its Oral History Project of the desegregation struggle in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.arlingtonva.us/center-for-local-history/virginiana-collection/|title=Virginiana Collection|work=Arlington Public Library|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>

Arlington during the 1960s was undergoing tremendous change after the huge influx of newcomers in the 1950s. The old commercial districts did not have ample off-street parking and many shoppers were taking their business to new commercial centers, such as Parkington and Seven Corners.  And suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding.  Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar to what happened in other downtown centers.  With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington.  However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the [[Washington Metro]], which included two lines in Arlington.  Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County.  Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon.  A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority.  Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods.  With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit.  Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City.  Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as [[Little Saigon, Arlington, Virginia|Little Saigon]], and now is a vibrant urban village. Arlington's careful planning for the Metro has transformed the county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.<ref>Kevin Craft, "When Metro Came to Town: How the fight for mass transit was won.

On [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], five [[al-Qaeda]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]] deliberately crashed [[American Airlines Flight 77]] into [[the Pentagon]], killing 115 Pentagon employees and 10 contractors in the building, as well as all 53 passengers, six crew members, and five hijackers on board the aircraft.

In 2009, the construction of Turnberry Tower, the tallest residential building in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], was completed in the [[Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia|Rosslyn]] neighborhood.<ref name=turnberry1>{{cite web|url=http://capitolfile-magazine.com/living/articles/living-the-high-life-1|title=Arlington's Turnberry Tower|publisher=Capitol File}}</ref>

[[File:ArlingtonTODimage3.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of a growth pattern in Arlington County, Virginia. High density, mixed use development is often concentrated within 1/4 to 1/2 mile from the County's [[Orange Line (Washington Metro)|Metrorail]] [[rapid transit]] stations, such as in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]], [[Courthouse, Virginia|Courthouse]], and [[Clarendon, Virginia|Clarendon]] (shown in red from upper left to lower right).]]

Arlington County is located at {{Coord|38|52|49|N|77|06|30|W|display=inline,title}} and is surrounded by [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] to the southwest, the [[Alexandria, Virginia|City of Alexandria]] to the southeast, and Washington, D.C. to the northeast directly across the [[Potomac River]], which forms the county's northern border. Other landforms also form county borders, particularly [[Minor's Hill]] and [[Upton's Hill]] on the west.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|26.1|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|26.0|sqmi|1}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|1}} (0.4%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  It is the smallest county by area in Virginia and among the [[County statistics of the United States|smallest by land area]] in the United States. About {{convert|4.6|sqmi|1}} of the county is federal property. The county is roughly in the shape of a rectangle {{convert|4|mi}} by {{convert|6|mi}}, with the small end slanting in a northwest-southeast direction. It has no incorporated areas. Its [[county seat]] is the [[census-designated place]] (CDP) of Arlington,<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> which is coterminous with the boundaries of the county; however, the county courthouse and most government offices are located in the [[Courthouse, Virginia|Courthouse]] neighborhood.

For over 30 years, the government has pursued a [[Urban planning|development strategy]] of concentrating much of its new development near transit facilities, such as [[Washington Metro|Metrorail]] stations and the high-volume bus lines of [[Virginia State Route 244|Columbia Pike]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/CPHD/planning/CPHDPlanningSmartGrowth.aspx |title=Smart Growth&nbsp;: Planning Division&nbsp;: Arlington, Virginia |publisher=Arlingtonva.us |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>  Within the transit areas, the government has a policy of encouraging [[mixed-use development|mixed-use]] and [[Walkability|pedestrian-]] and [[transit-oriented development]].<ref name="arlingtonva.us">{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/CPHD/planning/powerpoint/rbpresentation/rbpresentation_060107.pdf |title=Department of Community Planning, Housing and Development - Departments & Offices |publisher=Arlingtonva.us |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> Some of these "[[urban village]]" communities include:

Arlington elects four members of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] and two members of the [[Virginia State Senate]]. State Senators are elected for four-year terms, while Delegates are elected for two-year terms.

In the Virginia State Senate, Arlington is split between the 30th and 31st districts, represented by [[Adam Ebbin]] and [[Barbara Favola]] , respectively. In the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], Arlington is divided between the 45th, 46th, 47th, 48th districts, represented by [[Rob Krupicka]], [[Patrick Hope]],  [[Rip Sullivan]], and [[Alfonso H. Lopez|Alfonso Lopez]], respectively.  All are Democrats.

At the federal level, Arlington was once a GOP stronghold, supporting the Republican candidate in every election, but one, from 1948 to 1980.  However, in 1984, it supported Democrat [[Walter Mondale]], despite Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]'s electoral landslide.  It has gone Democratic in every presidential election since then.  Arlington is part of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], represented by Democrat [[Don Beyer]]. 

The [[United States Postal Service]] designates [[zip code]]s starting with "222" for exclusive use in Arlington County. However, federal institutions, like [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] and [[The Pentagon]] use Washington zip codes.

===Arlington National Cemetery===
{{Main|Arlington National Cemetery}}

Arlington National Cemetery is an American [[military cemetery]] established during the [[American Civil War]] on the grounds of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s home, [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] (also known as the Custis-Lee Mansion). It is directly across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C., north of [[the Pentagon]]. With nearly 300,000 graves, Arlington National Cemetery is the second-largest national cemetery in the United States.

Arlington House was named after the Custis family's homestead on Virginia's Eastern Shore. It is associated with the families of Washington, Custis, and Lee. Begun in 1802 and completed in 1817, it was built by [[George Washington Parke Custis]]. After his father died, young Custis was raised by his grandmother and her second husband, the first [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George Washington]], at [[Mount Vernon]]. Custis, a far-sighted agricultural pioneer, painter, playwright, and orator, was interested in perpetuating the memory and principles of George Washington. His house became a "treasury" of Washington heirlooms.

In 1804, Custis married [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. Their only child to survive infancy was Mary Anna Randolph Custis, born in 1808. Young Robert E. Lee, whose mother was a cousin of Mrs. Custis, frequently visited Arlington. Two years after graduating from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], Lieutenant Lee married Mary Custis at Arlington on June 30, 1831. For 30 years, Arlington House was home to the Lees. They spent much of their married life traveling between [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] duty stations and Arlington, where six of their seven children were born. They shared this home with Mary's parents, the Custis family.

When George Washington Parke Custis died in 1857, he left the Arlington estate to Mrs. Lee for her lifetime and afterward to the Lees' eldest son, [[George Washington Custis Lee]].

The U.S. government confiscated Arlington House and {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of ground immediately from the wife of General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The government designated the grounds as a military cemetery on June 15, 1864, by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. In 1882, after many years in the lower courts, the matter of the ownership of Arlington National Cemetery was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Court decided that the property rightfully belonged to the Lee family. The [[United States Congress]] then appropriated the sum of $150,000 for the purchase of the property from the Lee family.

Veterans from all the nation's wars are buried in the cemetery, from the [[American Revolution]] through the military actions in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. Pre-Civil War dead were re-interred after 1900.

The [[Tomb of the Unknowns]], also known as the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], stands atop a hill overlooking Washington, DC.  President [[John F. Kennedy]] is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|his wife]] and some of their children. His grave is marked with an "Eternal Flame." His brothers, Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], are also buried nearby. [[William Howard Taft]], who was also a [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court, is the only other [[President of the United States|President]] buried at Arlington.

Other frequently visited sites near the cemetery are the [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]], commonly known as the "Iwo Jima Memorial", the [[United States Air Force Memorial|U.S. Air Force Memorial]], the [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial]], the [[Netherlands Carillon]] and the U.S. Army's [[Fort Myer]].

===The Pentagon===
[[File:The Pentagon US Department of Defense building.jpg|thumb|The Pentagon, looking northeast with the [[Potomac River]] and [[Washington Monument]] in the distance.]]

{{Main|The Pentagon}}
[[The Pentagon]] in Arlington is the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. It was dedicated on January 15, 1943 and it is the world's largest office building. Although it is located in Arlington, the [[United States Postal Service]] requires that "Washington, D.C." be used as the place name in mail addressed to the six [[ZIP code]]s assigned to The Pentagon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/facts-zip.html |title=Facts & Figures: Zip Codes |publisher=Pentagon.afis.osd.mil |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

The building is [[pentagon]]-shaped in plan and houses about 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel. It has five floors and each floor has five ring corridors.  The Pentagon's principal law enforcement arm is the [[United States Pentagon Police]], the agency that protects the Pentagon and various other DoD jurisdictions throughout the National Capital Region.

Built during the early years of [[World War II]], it is still thought of as one of the most efficient office buildings in the world. It has 17.5 miles (28&nbsp;km) of corridors, yet it takes only seven minutes or so to walk between any two points in the building.

It was built from {{convert|680000|ST}} of sand and gravel dredged from the nearby [[Potomac River]] that were processed into 435,000 cubic yards (330,000 m³) of concrete and molded into the pentagon shape. Very little steel was used in its design due to the needs of the war effort.

The open-air central plaza in the Pentagon is the world's largest "no-salute, no-cover" area (where U.S. servicemembers need not wear hats nor salute). The snack bar in the center is informally known as the [[ground zero|Ground Zero Cafe]], a nickname originating during the [[Cold War]] when the Pentagon was targeted by Soviet [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]].

During World War II, the earliest portion of the [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] was built in Arlington in conjunction with the parking and traffic plan for the Pentagon. This early freeway, opened in 1943, and completed to [[Woodbridge, Virginia]] in 1952, is now part of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]].

Arlington forms part of the region's core transportation network. The county is traversed by two [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]], [[Interstate 66]] in the northern part of the county and [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] in the eastern part, both with [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s or restrictions. In addition, the county is served by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]]. In total, Arlington County maintains {{convert|376|mi}} of roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/EnvironmentalServices/uepd/snow/EnvironmentalServicesSnow.aspx |title=County website |publisher=Arlingtonva.us |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

The street names in Arlington generally follow a unified countywide convention.
