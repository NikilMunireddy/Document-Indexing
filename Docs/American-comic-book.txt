An '''[[United States|American]] [[comic book]]''' is a thin (typically 32-page) [[periodical]] containing primarily [[comics]] content.

While the form originated in 1933, American comic books first gained popularity after the 1938 publication of ''[[Action Comics]]'', which included the debut of the [[superhero]] [[Superman]].  This was followed by a superhero boom that lasted until the end of [[World War II]].  After the war, while superheroes were marginalized, the comic book industry rapidly expanded, and genres such as horror, crime, and romance became popular.  The 1950s saw a gradual decline, due to a shift away from print media in the wake of television<ref name="Matthew J. Smith 2009. p. 40">Randy Duncan and Matthew J. Smith. 2009. The Power of Comics. Continuum. p. 40.</ref> and the impact of the Comics Code Authority.<ref name="Matthew J. Smith 2009. p. 40"/>  The late 1950s and the 1960s saw a superhero revival, and superheroes remain the dominant character archetype in the 21st century.

Since the later 19th century, comic books have gained note as collectable items.  [[Comic shop]]s cater to fans, and particularly valuable issues have fetched in excess of a million dollars.  Systems of grading comic books have emerged with plastic sleeves ("bags") and cardboard backing ("boards") available to maintain the condition of comic books.

==Format==
Standard comics are {{convert|6.625|in|cm}} × {{convert|10.25|in|cm}} and about 32 pages long.

== Making comics ==
While comics can be the work of a single creator, the labour of making them is frequently divided between a number of specialists.  There may be a separate writer and [[Comics artist|artist]], or there may be separate artists for the characters and backgrounds.{{sfn|O'Nale|2010|p=384}}

Particularly in superhero comic books,{{sfn|Tondro|2011|p=51}} the art may be divided between:
* a [[penciller]], who lays out the artwork in pencil{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=161}} 
* an [[inker]], who finishes the artwork in ink{{sfnm|1a1=Markstein|1y=2010|2a1=Lyga|2a2=Lyga|2y=2004|2p=161|3a1=Lee|3y=1978|3p=145}} 
* a [[colorist]]{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=315}}
* a [[letterer]], who adds the captions and speech balloons.{{sfn|Lyga|Lyga|2004|p=163}}
The process begins with the creator coming up with an idea or concept, then working it into a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[Storytelling|story]], and finalizing the preliminary writing with a [[Script (comics)|script]].  After the art production, letters are placed on the page and an editor may have the final say before the comic is sent to the printer.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Overview Of The Comic Creation Process|url = http://www.makingcomics.com/2014/01/16/overview-comic-creation-process/|website = MakingComics.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}</ref>

The creative team, the writers and artists, may work with a [[comic book]] [[Publishing|publisher]] for help with marketing, advertising, and other logistics. A distributor like [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], the largest in the U.S., helps to distribute the finished product to retailers.

Another part of the process involved in successful comics is the interaction between the readers/fans and the creator(s).  [[Fan art]] and [[Comic book letter column|letters to the editor]] were commonly printed in the back of the book until the early 21st century, when various Internet forms started to replace them.

==Independent and alternative comics==
{{Main| Alternative comics}}
Comic specialty stores did help encourage several waves of independently-produced comics, beginning in the mid-1970s. Some of the early example of these - generally referred to as "independent" or "alternative" comics - such as ''[[Big Apple Comix]]'', continued somewhat in the tradition of underground comics, while others, such as ''[[Star Reach]]'', resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned ventures or by a single artist; a few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the world of [[fine art]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The "[[small press]]" scene continued to grow and diversify, with a number of small publishers in the 1990s changing the format and distribution of their books to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small presses.

==History==

{{main|History of American comics}}

===Proto-comic books and the Platinum Age===
[[File:YellowKidMcFadden2.jpg|thumb|left|''The Yellow Kid in McFadden's Flats'' (1897)]]
The development of the modern American comic book happened in stages. Publishers had collected [[comic strip]]s in [[hardcover book]] form as early as 1842, with  ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck]]'', a collection of English-language newspaper inserts originally published in Europe as the 1833 book ''Histoire de M. Vieux Bois''.<ref name="HoCB-Platinum" />

The G. W. Dillingham Company published the first known proto-comic-book magazine in the U.S., ''The Yellow Kid in McFadden's Flats'', in 1897. A hardcover book, it reprinted material — primarily the October 18, 1896 to January 10, 1897 sequence titled "McFadden's Row of Flats" — from [[cartoonist]] [[Richard F. Outcault]]'s [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] ''[[Hogan's Alley (comic strip)|Hogan's Alley]]'', starring the [[Yellow Kid]]. The 196-page, square-bound, black-and-white publication, which also includes introductory text by [[E. W. Townsend]], measured 5×7 inches and sold for 50 cents. The neologism "comic book" appears on the back cover.<ref name="HoCB-Platinum" /> Despite the publication of a series of related Hearst comics soon afterward,<ref name="HoCB-Platinum" /> the first monthly proto-comic book, Embee Distributing Company's ''Comic Monthly'', did not appear until 1922. Produced in an 8½-by-9-inch format, it reprinted black-and-white newspaper comic strips and lasted a year.<ref name="HoCB-Platinum" /><ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/35704/ ''Comic Monthly''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>
[[File:Comic-Monthly-1.jpg||thumb|''Comic Monthly'' #1 (Jan. 1922)]]

===''The Funnies'' and ''Funnies on Parade''===
In 1929, [[Dell Publishing]] (founded by [[George T. Delacorte, Jr.]]) published ''[[The Funnies]]'', described by the [[Library of Congress]] as "a short-lived newspaper [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] insert"<ref>U.S. Library of Congress, [http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri046.html "American Treasures of the Library of Congress"] exhibition</ref> and not to be confused with Dell's 1936 comic-book series of the same name. Historian Ron Goulart describes the 16-page, [[Color printing|four-color]] periodical as "more a Sunday comic section without the rest of the newspaper than a true comic book. But it did offer all original material and was sold on [[newsstand]]s".<ref name="ron">{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title = Comic Book Encyclopedia| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York| year= 2004 | isbn=978-0060538163}}</ref> ''The Funnies'' ran for 36 issues, published Saturdays through October 16, 1930.

In 1933, salesperson [[Maxwell Gaines]], sales manager [[Harry I. Wildenberg]], and owner [[George Janosik]] of the [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] company [[Eastern Color Printing]] &ndash; which printed, among other things, Sunday-paper [[comic strip|comic-strip]] sections &ndash; produced ''[[Funnies on Parade]]'' as a way to keep their presses running. Like ''The Funnies'', but only eight pages,<ref name="brown">Brown, Mitchell. {{Wayback|date=20030224164555 |url=http://www.geocities.com/mbrown123/greatest_comics/funniesonparade.html |title=The 100 Greatest Comic Books of the 20th Century: ''Funnies on Parade''}}</ref> this appeared as a [[newsprint]] magazine. Rather than using original material, however, it reprinted in color several comic strips licensed from the [[McNaught Syndicate]] and the [[McClure Syndicate]]. These included such popular strips as  cartoonist [[Al Smith]]'s ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'', [[Ham Fisher]]'s ''[[Joe Palooka]]'', and [[Percy Crosby]]'s ''[[Skippy (comic strip)|Skippy]]''. Eastern Color neither sold this periodical nor made it available on [[newsstands]], but rather sent it out free as a promotional item to consumers who mailed in coupons clipped from [[Procter & Gamble]] soap and toiletries products. The company printed 10,000 copies.<ref name="brown" /> The promotion proved a success, and Eastern Color that year produced similar periodicals for [[Canada Dry]] [[soft drinks]], [[Kinney Shoes]], [[Wheatena]] [[cereal]] and others, with print runs of from 100,000 to 250,000.<ref name="ron" />

===''Famous Funnies'' and ''New Fun''===
[[File:FamousFunnies1933.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern Color Press' ''[[Famous Funnies]]: A Carnival of Comics'' (Eastern Color Printing, 1933).]]

Also in 1933, Gaines and Wildenberg collaborated with Dell to publish the 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'', which historians consider the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it "the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing".<ref name="ron" /> Distribution took place through the [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] [[department store|department-store]] chain, though it remains unclear whether it was sold or given away; the cover displays no price, but Goulart refers, either metaphorically or literally, to "sticking a ten-cent pricetag {{sic}} on the comic books".<ref name="ron" />

When Delacorte declined to continue with ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'', Eastern Color on its own published ''[[Famous Funnies]]'' #1 (cover-dated July 1934), a 68-page giant selling for 10¢. Distributed to newsstands by the mammoth [[American News Company]], it proved a hit with readers during the cash-strapped [[Great Depression]], selling 90 percent of its 200,000 print, although putting Eastern Color more than $4,000 in the red.<ref name="ron" /> That quickly changed, with the book turning a $30,000 profit each issue starting with #12.<ref name="ron" />  ''Famous Funnies'' would eventually run 218 issues, inspire imitators, and largely launch a new [[mass medium]].

When the supply of available existing comic strips began to dwindle, early comic books began to include a small amount of new, original material in comic-strip format. Inevitably, a comic book of all-original material, with no comic-strip reprints, debuted. Fledgling publisher [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]] founded National Allied Publications, which would evolve into [[DC Comics]], to release [[More Fun Comics|''New Fun'']] #1 (Feb. 1935). This came out as a [[Tabloid (paper size)|tabloid]]-sized, 10-inch by 15-inch, 36-page magazine with a card-stock, non-glossy cover. An [[anthology]], it mixed [[humor]] features such as the [[funny animal]] comic "Pelion and Ossa" and the college-set "Jigger and Ginger" with such dramatic fare as the [[Western fiction|Western]] strip "Jack Woods" and the "[[yellow peril|yellow-peril]]" adventure "Barry O'Neill", featuring a [[Fu Manchu]]-styled villain, Fang Gow. Issue #6 (Oct. 1935) brought the comic-book debut of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], the future creators of [[Superman]], who began their careers with the musketeer swashbuckler "Henri Duval" (doing the first two installments before turning it over to others) and, under the [[pseudonym]]s "Leger and Reuths", the [[supernatural]]-crimefighter adventure [[Doctor Occult]].<ref>{{cite book| title = From Krakow to Krypton: Jews and Comic Books | first= Arie | last=Kaplan | isbn= 9780827608436 | publisher = [[Jewish Publication Society]] | year=2008 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aH3H7DC6BQC&pg=PA6&dq=%22Leger+and+Reuths%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Z9GxUsXfLIm0sQSQpoHYCA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Leger%20and%20Reuths%22&f=false 6]}}</ref>

===Superheroes and the Golden Age===
{{Main|Golden Age of Comic Books}}
In 1938, after Wheeler-Nicholson's partner [[Harry Donenfeld]] had ousted him, National Allied editor [[Vin Sullivan]] pulled a Siegel/Shuster creation from the [[slush pile]] and used it as the cover feature (but only as a backup story)<ref>Daniels, Les. ''DC Comics:  60 Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes'' (Little Brown, 1995).</ref> in ''[[Action Comics]]'' [[Action Comics 1|#1]] (June 1938). The duo's alien hero, [[Superman]], dressed in a cape and colorful tights. The costume, influenced by [[Flash Gordon]]'s attire from 1934, evoked [[circus]] aerial performers and circus strongmen, and Superman became the archetype of the "[[superheroes]]" that would follow. ''Action'' would become the American comic book with the second-largest number of issues, next to [[Dell Comics]]' ''[[Four Color]]'', with over 860 issues published {{As of| 2008 | lc = on}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Siegel and Shuster's Superman, influenced by the [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] stories and by the legend of the [[Golem]] of [[Prague]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}<!--Siegel & Shuster consistently denied the following: and by [[Philip Wylie]]'s novel ''Gladiator''--> had [[superhuman]] strength, speed and other abilities, and lived day-to-day in his [[secret identity]] as a mild-mannered [[reporter]] named Clark Kent. Within two years, most comic-book companies had started publishing large lines of superhero titles, and Superman has gone on to become one of the world's most recognizable characters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The period from the late 1930s through roughly the end of the 1940s is referred to by comic book experts as the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. It featured extremely large print-runs, with ''Action Comics'' and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)#Development and inspirations|''Captain Marvel'']] selling over half a million copies a month each;<ref>Daniels {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> comics provided very popular cheap entertainment during [[World War II]] especially among soldiers, but with erratic quality in stories, art, and printing. In the early 1940s over 90 percent of girls and boys from seven to seventeen read comic books.<ref>{{cite book|title= Superheroes!:Capes cowls and the creation of comic book culture|author1=Glen Weldon|author2=Michael Kantor|page=49 }}</ref>

[[Archie Comics|MLJ]]'s ''[[Pep Comics]]'' debuted as a superhero, science-fiction and adventure anthology, but after the title introduced the teen-humor feature "Archie" in 1942, the feature's popularity would soon eclipse all other MLJ properties, leading the publisher to rename itself [[Archie Comics]].

Following the end of [[World War II]], the popularity of superheroes greatly diminished,<ref name="CaM51" /> while the comic-book industry itself expanded.<ref>{{cite book| authorlink=Ron Goulart | first=Ron |last=Goulart | year=1991| title=Over 50 Years of American Comic Books | publisher=Publications International| page=161}} Source notes overall sales of 275 million comics in 1945, 300 million in 1947, and 340 million in 1949.</ref> A few well-established characters such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and Wonder Woman continued to sell, but DC cancelled series starring the Flash and Green Lantern and converted ''All-American Comics'' and ''All-Star Comics'' to [[Western comics|Western]] titles, and ''Star Spangled Comics'' to a [[war comics|war]] title. The publisher also launched such science-fiction titles as ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' and ''[[Mystery in Space]]''. Timely Comics cancelled its Captain America, Human Torch and Sub-Mariner series, briefly reviving the characters in 1954 only to cancel them shortly thereafter and to focus on horror, science fiction, teen humor, romance and Western, genres.  Romance comics became established with Prize Comics' ''[[Young Romance]]'' and ''[[Young Love (comic)|Young Love]]'', produced by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby; those titles' popularity lead to an explosion of romance comics form many publishers.

Dell's comic books accounted for a third of all North American sales in the early 1950s. Its 90 titles averaged a circulation of 800,000 copies each issue, with ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' peaking with a circulation of three million in 1953.  Eleven of the top 25 best-selling comic books at the time were Dell titles.<ref name="CaM40" />  Out of 40 publishers active in 1954, Dell, Atlas (Marvel), DC and Archie were the major players sales-wise.  By this time, former big-time players Fawcett and Fiction house had ceased publishing.<ref name="CaM44" />

Circulation peaked out in 1952, when 3161 issues of various comics were published with total circulation at about one billion.<ref group="note">Actual estimates vary between 840 million and 1.3 billion{{ref|CaM46}}</ref>  After 1952, the number of individual releases dropped every year for the rest of the decade, with the biggest losses coming in 1955–56.<ref name="CaM46" />  These rapid losses followed the introduction of the [[Comics Code Authority]] in the wake of Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency.<ref name="CaM48-49" />  While there was only a 9% drop in the number of releases between 1952 and 1953, circulation plummeted by an estimated 30–40%.<ref name="CaM47-48" />  The cause of the decrease is not entirely certain.  Television had come to provide competition with comic books, or the rise of conservative values that came with the election of [[Dwight Eisenhower]].  The Comics Code Authority, a self-censoring body founded to curb juvenile delinquency believed to be influenced by crime and horror comics, has been targeted as the culprit, though sales had begun to drop the year before it was founded.<ref name="CaM47" />  The major publishers were largely unaffected by the drop, but smaller publishers like EC (the prime target of the CCA) stopped publishing crime and horror titles, and had to focus on other areas.<ref name="CaM49" />  By the 1960s, output stabilized at about 1500 releases per year.<ref name="CaM46" />

The dominant comic book genres of the post-CCA 1950s were funny animals, humor, romance, television properties and Westerns.  Detective, fantasy, teen and war comics were also popular, while adventure, superheroes and comic strip reprints were in decline,<ref name="CaM49" /> with ''Famous Funnies'' seeing its last issue in 1955.<ref name="CaM50" />

===The Comics Code===
{{Main|Comics Code Authority}}
In the late 1940s and early 1950s [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[True crime (genre)|true-crime]] comics flourished, many containing graphic violence and gore.  [[EC Comics]] was a particularly successful publisher of these genres, and was singled out by psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]] in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954.  The book was concerned with what he perceived as [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] and [[homosexual]] undertones in horror comics and in superhero comics respectively, and it raised public anxiety about comics. Soon [[moral panic|moral crusader]]s blamed comic books as a cause of poor grades, [[juvenile delinquency]], drug use.<ref group="note">An example of the sensational coverage of comics in the mass media is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI8IJA8kdkI Confidential File: Horror Comic Books!], broadcast October 9, 1955 on Los Angeles television station [[KTTV]].</ref> This led the [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to take an interest in comic books (April–June, 1954). Schools and parent groups held public comic-book burnings, and some cities [[ban (law)|banned]] comic books.

In the wake of these events, many comics publishers, most notably National and Archie, founded the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the Comics Code, intended as "the most stringent code in existence for any communications media".<ref>{{cite book|title=Comix: A history of comic books in America|page=84|publisher=Bonanza Books|year=1971|author=Daniels, Les}}</ref> A Comic Code Seal of Approval soon appeared on virtually every comic book carried on newsstands. EC, after experimenting with less controversial comic books, dropped its comics line to focus on the satiric ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' — a comic book that changed to magazine format in order to circumvent the Code.<ref>Ron Goulart. 1991.

===Silver Age of Comic Books===
{{Main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}
[[File:Showcase4.JPG|thumb|left|''Showcase'' #4 (Oct. 1956), the launch of comics' [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]]. Cover art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Joe Kubert]].]]
DC started a revival in superhero comics in 1956 with the October 1956 revival of The Flash in ''Showcase'' #4.  Many comics historians peg this as the beginning of the Silver Age of American comic books, although Marvel had started reviving some of its old superheroes as early as 1954.<ref name="CaM51" />  The new Flash is taken symbolically as the beginning of a new era, although his success was not immediate.  It took two years for the Flash to receive his own title, and ''Showcase'' itself was only a bimonthly title, though one that was to introduce a large number of enduring characters.  By 1959, the slowly building superhero revival had become clear to DC's competitors.  Archie jumped on board that year, and Charlton joined the bandwagon in 1960.<ref name="CaM52" />

In 1961, writer/editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]] created the [[Fantastic Four]] for [[Marvel Comics]]. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, ''The Fantastic Four'' #1 initiated a  [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]]  style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons - heroes who squabbled and worried about the likes of rent money. In contrast to the super-heroic do-gooder archetypes of established superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, [[Steve Ditko]], [[Don Heck]], and others complementing Lee's colorful, catchy prose, the new style became very popular among college students who could identify with the angsty and irreverent nature of characters like [[Spider-Man]], [[X-Men]], and the Fantastic Four. This was a time of massive social upheaval that birthed a new generation of hipper and more countercultural young people who found a voice in these books. Marvel was initially restricted in the number of titles it could produce as its books were distributed by rival National, a situation not alleviated until the late 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

While the creators of comics were given credit in the early days of comic books, this all but vanished during the 1940s and 1950s. Comic books were produced by comic book ''companies'' rather than individual creators (EC being a notable exception, a company that not only credited its creative teams, but also featured creators' biographies). Even comic books by revered and collectable artists like [[Carl Barks]] were not known by their creators' names—[[Disney comics]] like Barks' were signed "[[Walt Disney]]." In the 1960s, DC, and then Marvel, began to include writer and artist credits on the comics that they published.<ref name="CaM67" />

Other notable companies included the [[American Comics Group]] (ACG); the low-budget [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]], where many professionals such as [[Dick Giordano]] got their start; [[Dell Comics|Dell]]; [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]]; [[Harvey Comics]], home of the Harvey cartoon-characters ([[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]) and non-animated others ([[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]]); and [[Tower Comics|Tower]], best known for [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Underground comix===
{{Main|Underground comix}}
Sex, drugs and rock 'n roll were featured as the anti-authoritarian [[underground comix]] saw made waves in 1968 following the publication of [[Robert Crumb]]'s irregularly published ''[[Zap Comix]]''.  [[Frank Stack]] had published ''The Adventures of Jesus'' as far back as 1962, and there had been a trickle of such publications until Crumb's success.<ref name="CaM65" />  What had started as a self-publishing scene soon grew into a minor industry, with [[Print Mint]], [[Kitchen Sink Press|Kitchen Sink]], [[Last Gasp]] and [[Apex Novelties]] among the more well-known publishers.  These comix were often extremely graphic, and largely distributed in [[head shop]]s that flourished in the countercultural era.<ref name="CaM66" />

Legal issues and paper shortages led to a decline in underground comix output from its 1972 peak.  The death knell was sounded in 1974, when the passage of [[anti-paraphernalia laws]] led to the closing of most head shops, which throttled underground comix' distribution.  Its readership also dried up as the hippie movement itself petered out around the mid-1970s.<ref name="CaM82" />  Some underground cartoonists stayed in comics, however—[[Robert Crumb]] and [[Art Spiegelman]] would become two of the leading lights of the [[alternative comics]] era, and [[Bill Griffith]] would take to comic strips.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Bronze Age of Comic Books===
{{Main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}

''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' originally used the phrase "Bronze Age" in 1995 to denote the Modern Horror age. But {{As of| 2009 | lc = on}} historians and fans use [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|"Bronze Age"]] to describe the period of American mainstream comics history that begins with a period of concentrated changes to comic books circa 1970. Unlike the Golden/Silver Age transition, the Silver/Bronze transition involved many continually published books, making the transition less sharp; not every book entered the Bronze Age at the same time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Changes commonly considered{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to mark the transition between Silver and Bronze ages include:

* A reshuffling of popular creators, including the retirement of [[Mort Weisinger]], editor of the Superman books, and the movement of [[Jack Kirby]] to DC.
* A boom in non-superhero and borderline superhero comics such as ''[[Conan (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'', ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'', ''[[Kamandi]]'', ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Man-Thing]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'', and the revived ''[[Doctor Strange]]'' and ''[[Phantom Stranger]]''.
* "Relevant" comics which attempted to address serious social issues, such as the drug-abuse issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Green Lantern]]/[[Green Arrow]]''.
* The [[Comics Code Authority]]'s first update, in 1971 &mdash; prompted by [[Stan Lee]]'s defiance  of the code for a story on narcotics at the behest of the [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]].
* Revamping of several popular characters, including a return to a Batman of a darker nature closer to the original late 1930s conception, a reinvention of Superman for the 1970s with the landmark story "Kryptonite Nevermore", and a temporary non-powered era for Wonder Woman - all initiated by author [[Denny O'Neil]].
* The death of major characters such as Spider-Man's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], the [[Doom Patrol]], and several members of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

===The Modern Age===
{{Main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}

The development of the "[[direct market]]" distribution system in the 1970s coincided with the appearance of comic-book [[specialty store]]s across North America. These specialty stores were a haven for more distinct voices and stories, but they also marginalized comics in the public eye. Serialized comic stories became longer and more complex, requiring readers to buy more issues to finish a story.

<!--[[File:Dark knight returns.jpg|thumb|right|The first issue of ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which redefined Batman in the 1980s. Cover art by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].]]-->
Between 1970 and 1990, comic-book prices rose sharply because of a combination of factors: a nationwide paper shortage, increasing production values, and the minimal profit incentive for stores to stock comic books (due to the small unit price of an individual comic book relative to a magazine).{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the mid-to-late 1980s, two series published by [[DC Comics]], ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]'', had a profound impact upon the American comic-book industry. Their popularity, along with mainstream media attention and critical acclaim, combined with changing social tastes, led to a considerably darker tone in comic books during the 1990s nicknamed by fans as the "grim-and-gritty" era.

The growing popularity of [[antihero]]es such as  [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the [[Punisher]] exemplified this change, as did the darker tone of some independent publishers such as [[First Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics]], and (founded in the 1990s) [[Image Comics]]. This tendency towards darkness and nihilism was manifested in DC's production of heavily promoted comic book stories such as "[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]" in the ''[[Batman]]'' series (in which [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] brutally murdered Batman's sidekick [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]), while at Marvel the continuing popularity of the various [[List of X-Men comics|X-Men books]] led to storylines involving the genocide of superpowered "mutants" in allegorical stories about religious and ethnic persecution.

Although a speculator boom in the early 1990s temporarily increased specialty store sales &mdash; collectors "invested" in multiple copies of a single comic to sell at a profit later &mdash; these booms ended in a collectibles glut, and comic sales declined sharply in the mid-1990s, leading to the demise of many hundreds of stores. In the 2000s, fewer comics sell in North America than at any time in their publishing history.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The large superhero-oriented publishers like Marvel and DC are still often referred to as the "mainstream" of comics and are still considered a mass medium like in previous decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

While the actual publications are no longer as widespread, however, [[licensing]] and [[merchandising]] have made many comic-book characters, aside from such perennials as Superman and Batman{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. In particular, several [[movies]] and [[videogames]] based on comic-book characters have been released, and such heavily promoted events as [[Mary Jane Watson#Fictional character biography|Spider-Man's wedding]], the [[death of Superman]], and the [[Captain America#21st century|death of Captain America]] received widespread media coverage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In addition, published formats like the [[graphic novel]] and the related [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] enabled the comic book to gain some respectability as literature. As a result, these formats are now common in [[book retail]] and the collections of [[public libraries]].
