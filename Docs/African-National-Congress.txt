The '''African National Congress''' ('''ANC''') is the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa's]] governing [[social democratic]] political party. It has been the ruling party of [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post-apartheid South Africa]] on the national level since 1994, including the election of [[Nelson Mandela]] as president from 1994 to 1999. In the [[South African general election, 2004|2004]] general election the ANC won 69.7% of the votes, in the [[South African general election, 2009|2009]] general election it won 65.9% of the votes, and in [[South African general election, 2014|2014]] it won 62.15% of the votes.

The ANC defines itself as a "disciplined force of the left",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2498 |title= ANC Party Declaration 51|publisher= the African National Congress|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> and it has been supported by the [[Tripartite Alliance]] with the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU) and the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), since the establishment of a non-racial democracy in April 1994.

Members founded the organisation as the '''South African Native National Congress''' ('''SANNC''') on 8 January 1912 at the Waaihoek Wesleyan Church in [[Bloemfontein]] to work for the rights of the [[black people|black]] South African population. [[John Dube]], its first president, and poet and author [[Sol Plaatje]] were among its founding members. The organisation became the ANC in 1923 and formed a military wing, the [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (Spear of the Nation) in 1961.

==History==
{{Main|History of the African National Congress}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
The founding of the SANNC was in direct response to injustice against black South Africans at the hands of the government then in power. It can be said that the SANNC had its origins in a pronouncement by [[Pixley ka Isaka Seme]] who said in 1911, "Forget all the past differences among Africans and unite in one national organisation." The SANNC was founded the following year on 8 January 1912.<ref>[http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?include=docs/misc/2010/umzabalazo.html The African National Congress]. Anc.org.za. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.</ref>

The government of the newly formed [[Union of South Africa]] began a systematic oppression of black people in South Africa. The [[Natives' Land Act|Land Act]] was promulgated in 1913 forcing many non-whites from their farms into the cities and towns to work, and to restrict their movement within South Africa.

By 1919, the SANNC was leading a campaign against passes (an ID which non-whites had to possess). However, it then became dormant in the mid-1920s. During that time, black people were also represented by the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union|ICU]] and the previously white-only Communist party. In 1923, the organisation became the African National Congress, and in 1929 the ANC supported a militant mineworkers' strike.

By 1927, [[Josiah Tshangana Gumede|J.T. Gumede]] (president of the ANC) proposed co-operation with the Communists in a bid to revitalise the organisation, but he was voted out of power in the 1930s. This led to the ANC becoming largely ineffectual and inactive, until the mid-1940s when the ANC was remodelled as a mass movement.

The ANC responded to attacks on the rights of black South Africans, as well as calling for strikes, boycotts, and defiance. This led to a later [[Defiance Campaign]] in the 1950s, a mass movement of resistance to [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]]. The government tried to stop the ANC by banning party leaders and enacting new laws to stop the ANC, however these measures ultimately proved to be ineffective.

In 1955, the [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] officially adopted the [[Freedom Charter]], stating the core principles of the South African [[Congress Alliance]], which consisted of the African National Congress and its allies the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), the [[South African Indian Congress]], the [[South African Congress of Democrats]] (COD) and the Coloured People's Congress.<ref name="pil-lut">{{cite book|last=Pillay|first=Gerald J.|title=Voices of Liberation: Albert Lutuli|year=1993|publisher=HSRC Press|isbn=0-7969-1356-0|pages=82–91}}</ref> The government claimed that this was a communist document, and consequently leaders of the ANC and Congress were arrested. 1960 saw the [[Sharpeville massacre]], in which 69 people were killed when police opened fire on anti-apartheid protesters.

The ANC and its members were officially removed from the United States terrorism watch list in 2008.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7484517.stm Mandela taken off US terror list], [[BBC News]], 1 July 2008</ref>

===Umkhonto we Sizwe===
{{main|Umkhonto we Sizwe}}
[[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] or MK, translated "The Spear of the Nation", was the military wing of the ANC. Partly in response to the [[Sharpeville massacre]] of 1960, individual members of the ANC found it necessary to consider violence to combat what passive protest had failed to quell. MK commenced the military struggle against apartheid with acts of sabotage aimed at the installations of the state, and in the early stages was reluctant to target civilian targets.<ref>https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02424/04lv02730/05lv02918/06lv02925.htm</ref>

MK was responsible for the deaths of both civilians and members of the military. Acts committed by MK include the [[Church Street bombing]] and the Magoo's Bar bombing.

In co-operation with the [[South African Communist Party]], MK was founded in 1961<ref>[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/umkhonto-we-sizwe-mk SAhistory.org.za] Retrieved 26 July 2012.</ref> and integrated into the [[South African National Defence Force]] by 1994.<!-- Citations on [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] and [[South African National Defence Force]] pages. -->

==Ideology==
The ANC deems itself a force of national liberation in the post-apartheid era; it officially defines its agenda as the ''National Democratic Revolution''. The ANC is a member of the [[Socialist International]].<ref name=socialistinternational/> It also sets forth the redressing of socio-economic differences stemming from colonial- and apartheid-era policies as a central focus of ANC policy.

The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is described as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; a society in which people are intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using contour plots or [[concentric circles]] the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out of the success of the NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include [[Joe Slovo]], [[Joel Netshitenzhe]] and [[Tshilidzi Marwala]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Slovo|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/slovo/1988/national-democratic-revolution.htm |title=The South African Working Class and the National Democratic Revolution}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Joel|last=Netshitenzhe|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo25/tasks.html|title=Understanding the tasks of the moment|work=Umrabulo|volume=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Marwala|first=T|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2844|title=The anatomy of capital and the national democratic revolution|work=Umrabulo|volume=29}}</ref>

In 2004 the ANC declared itself to be a social democratic party.<ref>The Mail & Guardian A-Z of South African Politics by Barbara Ludman, Paul Stober, and Ferial Haffagee</ref>

The 53rd National Conference of the ANC, held in 2015, stated in its "Discussion Document" that "China economic development trajectory remains a leading example of the triumph of humanity over adversity. The exemplary role of the collective leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] in this regard should be a guiding lodestar of our own struggle."<ref>[http://www.anc.org.za/docs/umrabulo/2015/ngc_disc_docsy.pdf page 161]</ref> It went on to state that "The collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]] and socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern European States influenced our transition towards the negotiated political settlement in our country. The cause of events in the world changed tremendously in favour of the US led imperialism."<ref>[http://www.anc.org.za/docs/umrabulo/2015/ngc_disc_docsy.pdf page 189]</ref>

===Tripartite Alliance===
{{main|Tripartite Alliance}}
The ANC holds a historic alliance with the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP) and [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU), known as the ''Tripartite Alliance''. The SACP and COSATU have not contested any election in South Africa, but field candidates through the ANC, hold senior positions in the ANC, and influence party policy and dialogue. During Mbeki's presidency, the government took a more pro-capitalist stance, often running counter to the demands of the SACP and COSATU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ever-fasternews.com/index.php?php_action=read_article&article_id=397|title=ANC 'At Fork in the Road'|author=Paul Trewhela|date=8 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_displaytei&id=21131&title=How%20the%20tripartite%20alliance%20works&creator=|title=How the Tripartite Alliance works|work=Mayibuye|volume=2|year =1991|issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=COSATU and the Tripartite Alliance since 1994|first=Dale|last=McKinley|work=Rethinking the Labour Movement in the 'New' South Africa (T.

===2008 schism===
Following Zuma's accession to the ANC leadership in 2007 and Mbeki's resignation as president in 2008, a number of former ANC leaders led by [[Mosiuoa Lekota]] split away from the ANC to form the [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]].

===2013 NUMSA split from Cosatu===
On 20 December 2013, a special congress of the [[National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa]] (NUMSA), the country's biggest trade union with 338,000 members,<ref name=NUMSA>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/world/africa/south-africas-biggest-union-pulls-support-for-anc.html|title=South Africa's Biggest Trade Union Pulls Its Support for A.N.C.|first=Lydia|last=Polgreen|date=20 December 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref> voted to withdraw support from the ANC and SACP, and form a socialist party to protect the interests of the working class. NUMSA secretary general Irvin Jim condemned the ANC and SACP's support for big business and stated: "It is clear that the working class cannot any longer see the ANC or the SACP as its class allies in any meaningful sense."<ref name=NUMSA/>

==ANC flag==
The ANC flag is composed of three stripes – black, green and gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4|title=The Flag of the African National Congress|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref> Black symbolises the native people of South Africa, green represents the land and gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of South Africa. This flag was also the [[War flag|battle flag]] of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]. An unrelated but identical flag was used by the [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] from 1813.

==Party list==
Politicians in the party win a place in parliament by being on the ''Party List'', which is drawn up before the elections and enumerates, in order, the party's preferred MPs. The number of seats allocated is proportional to the popular national vote, and this determines the cut-off point.

The ANC has also gained members through the controversial [[floor crossing (South Africa)|floor crossing]] process.

Although most South African parties announced their candidate list for provincial premierships in the 2009 election, the ANC did not, as it is not required for parties to do so.<ref>James Myburgh [http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=120071&sn=Detail The ANC's secret premier candidates]. Politicsweb.co.za. 6 March 2009. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.</ref>

==''ANC Today''==
In 2001, the ANC launched an online weekly web-based [[newsletter]], ''ANC Today – Online Voice of the African National Congress'' to offset the alleged bias of the press.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fourie|first=Pieter J.|year=2008|title=Media Studies Volume 2: Policy, management and media representation|edition=second|publisher=Juta and Company|location=Cape Town|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7531OTEpD_wC&pg=PA44 44]|isbn=978-0-7021-7675-3}}</ref> It consists mainly of updates on current programmes and initiatives of the ANC. It is one of the few major online publications from an African political party.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Role of the ANC in resolving the conflict==
The ANC represented the main opposition to the government during apartheid and therefore they played a major role in resolving the conflict through participating in the peacemaking and peace-building processes. Initially intelligence agents of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] met in secret with ANC leaders, including Nelson Mandela, to judge whether conflict resolution was possible.<ref>[http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-226016/apartheid apartheid]. Student.britannica.com (8 May 1996). Retrieved on 23 November 2011.</ref> Discussions and negotiations took place leading to the eventual unbanning of the ANC and other opposing political parties by then President [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|de Klerk]] on 2 February 1990. These initial meetings were the first crucial steps towards resolution.

The next official step towards rebuilding South Africa was the Groote Schuur Minute where the government and the ANC agreed on a common commitment towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and intimidation, as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations. The ANC negotiated the release of political prisoners and the indemnity from prosecution for returning exiles and moreover channels of communication were established between the Government and the ANC.

Later the Pretoria Minute represented another step towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards setting up an interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC – the Umkhonto we Sizwe. This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa. Another agreement that came out of the Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that a new way of governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However, violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.<ref name=concise>{{cite book|title=A concise history of South Africa|first=Robert|last=Ross|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}</ref>

The next significant steps towards resolution were the Repeal of the Population Registration Act, the repeal of the Group Areas and the Native Land Acts and a catch-all [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed.<ref name=concise/> These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.

In December 1991 the Convention for a Democratic South Africa ([[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|CODESA]]) was held with the aim of establishing an interim government. However, a few months later in June 1992 the [[Boipatong massacre]] occurred and all negotiations crumbled as the ANC pulled out. After this negotiations proceeded between two agents, [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] of the ANC, and [[Roelf Meyer]] of the National Party. In over 40 meetings the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system, the fate of over 40,000 government employees and if/how the country would be divided. The result of these negotiations was an interim constitution that meant the transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that the rule of law and state sovereignty remained intact during the transition, which was vital for stability within the country. A date was set for the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994.<ref name=concise/> The ANC won 62.5% of the votes and has been in power ever since.<ref>[http://www.africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheidfaq/f/HowEnded.htm Apartheid FAQ: When Did Apartheid End?].

==Criticism==
{{recentism|section|date=June 2013}}<!--The ANC is 100 years old but this section only covers the recent past-->

===Controversy over corrupt members===
{{details|South African Arms Deal}}
The most prominent corruption case involving the ANC relates to a series of bribes paid to companies involved in the ongoing R55 billion [[South African Arms Deal|Arms Deal saga]], which resulted in a long term jail sentence to then Deputy President [[Jacob Zuma]]'s legal adviser [[Schabir Shaik]]. Shaik was released after nearly two years imprisonment after being diagnosed with a terminal illness. Zuma, now the State president, was charged with fraud, bribery and corruption in the Arms Deal, but the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa due to their delay in prosecution.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pretorianews.co.za/?fSectionId=&fArticleId=vn20081009055615571C284334 |date=9 October 2008 |title=Opposition hails challenge to ANC rule}}</ref> The ANC has also been criticised for its subsequent abolition of the [[Scorpions (South Africa)|Scorpions]], the multidisciplinary agency that investigated and prosecuted organised crime and corruption, and was heavily involved in the investigation into Zuma and Shaik. Tony Yengeni, in his then position as chief whip of the ANC and also head of the Parliaments defence committee has recently been named as being involved in a R6 million bribe with the German company ThyssenKrupp over the purchase of four corvettes for the SANDF.

Other recent corruption issues include the sexual misconduct and criminal charges of [[Beaufort West Municipality, Western Cape|Beaufort West]] municipal manager [[Truman Prince]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1700232,00.html|title=Action against Prince 'a farce' |date=5 May 2005 |first=Ronel |last=Bester |publisher=[[Die Burger]]}}</ref> and the [[Oilgate]] scandal, in which millions of Rand in funds from a state-owned company were allegedly funnelled into ANC coffers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Special Report: Oilgate |url=http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=oilgate |work=Mail & Guardian |accessdate=27 April 2007}}</ref>

The ANC has also been accused of using government and civil society to fight its political battles against opposition parties such as the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]. The result has been a number of complaints and allegations that none of the political parties truly represent the interests of the poor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=6&art_id=vn20080220113540685C199776| title=DA councillor's role in Delft is 'criminal'| publisher=Cape Argus |date =20 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capeargus.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=3571&fArticleId=vn20080228113641490C401174| title=DA's Delft councillor denies claims| publisher=Cape Argus |date =28 February 2008}}</ref> This has resulted in the "No Land!

Campaign which became very prominent during elections.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009 |title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009 |date=5 May 2005 |publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://antieviction.org.za/2005/12/12/indymedia-presents-no-land-no-house-no-vote/| title=IndyMedia Presents: No Land!

===Controversy over wasteful expenditure===
The ANC spent over 1 billion of taxpayers' money on luxury vehicles, expensive hotels, banquets, advertising and other "wasteful expenditure" between August 2009 and April 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/R1bn-blinged-partied-away-20100409| title=R1bn blinged, partied away| publisher=News24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=6&art_id=nw20100408222343563C315491| title=Taxpayers deserve answers on bling – DA| publisher= Independent Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=553&fArticleId=5422285| title=Business Watch: Airlines must be cursing Blatter and the World Cup| publisher=Business Report}}</ref> The main thrust behind this reporting is the official opposition in the country, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which kept a tally of the expenditure called "The Wasteful Expenditure Monitor".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.da.org.za/campaigns.htm?action=view-page&category=7034| title=Introduction: the Wasteful Expenditure Monitor| publisher=Democratic Alliance}}</ref>

According to the DA,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.da.org.za/campaigns.htm?action=view-page&category=7034&sub-page=7036| title=Wasteful expenditure monitor: Total up to R1 003 016 305.44| publisher=Democratic Alliance}}</ref> this money could have:
*Built 18,574 new RDP houses
*Funded 7775 teachers for a year

The ANC Northern Cape premier, [[Sylvia Lucas]], in her first 10 weeks in office, spent R53,159.00 of taxpayers money on "fast food" at outlets such as [[Spur Steak Ranches|Spur]], [[Nandos]], [[KFC]] and [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy]].

===Condemnation over Secrecy Bill===
{{further|Protection of State Information Bill}}
In late 2011 the ANC was heavily criticised over the passage of the [[Protection of State Information Bill]], which opponents claimed would improperly restrict the [[freedom of the press]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Charl |last=du Plessis |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2011/11/22/secrecy-bill-opposition-reaching-fever-pitch |title=Secrecy bill opposition reaching fever pitch |date=22 November 2011 |publisher=Times Live}}</ref> Opposition to the bill included otherwise ANC-aligned groups such as [[COSATU]]. Notably, [[Nelson Mandela]] and other Nobel laureates [[Nadine Gordimer]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], and [[F. W. de Klerk]] have expressed disappointment with the bill for not meeting standards of constitutionality and aspirations for freedom of information and expression.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/11/22/mandelas-office-comments-on-s-africas-secrecy-bill.html|title=Mandela's office comments on S Africa's secrecy bill|date=22 November 2011 |publisher=AFP}}</ref>

===Role in the Marikana killings===
{{further|Marikana miners' strike}}
The ANC have been criticised for its role in failing to prevent 16 August 2012 massacre of Lonmin miners at Marikana in the North West. Some allege that Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega and Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa, a close confidant of Jacob Zuma, may have given the go ahead for the police action against the miners on that day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/companies/who-gave-permission-to-kill-bizos-1.1408535#.UIbgQxLJX_g|title=Who gave permission to kill?|date=22 October 2012 |publisher=AFP}}</ref>

Commissioner Phiyega of the ANC came under further criticism as being insensitive and uncaring when she was caught smiling and laughing during the Farlam Commission's video playback of the 'massacre'.<ref>{{cite news |url=
http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-24-marikana-families-horrified-at-phiyegas-behaviour|title=Marikana families horrified at Phiyegas behaviour|date=24 October 2012 |publisher=M&G}}</ref> Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] has announced that he no longer can bring himself to exercise a vote for the ANC as it is no longer the party that he and Nelson Mandela fought for, and that the party has now lost its way, and is in danger of becoming a corrupt entity in power.

There is also controversy over an email that the ANC deputy president and shareholder in Lonmin, Cyril Ramaphosa sent where he asked for "decisive action" to be taken against the striking miners.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
