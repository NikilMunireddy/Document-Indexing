'''MCA Records''' was an American-based record company owned by [[MCA Inc.]], which later gave way to the larger '''MCA Music Entertainment Group''' (now [[Universal Music Group]]), of which MCA Records was still part. MCA's country division, [[MCA Nashville]], is a still active imprint of [[Universal Music Group Nashville]].

== Pre-history ==
MCA Inc., a powerful talent agency and a television production company, entered the recorded music business in 1962 with the purchase of the [[New York City|New York]]-based US [[Decca Records]] (established in 1934<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Decca+Records|title= Decca Records Profile|publisher=[[Discogs]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907173358/http://www.discogs.com/label/Decca+Records|archivedate=September 7, 2007|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref>), including [[Coral Records]] and [[Brunswick Records]]. MCA was forced to exit the talent agency business in order to complete the merger. As American Decca owned [[Universal Pictures]], MCA assumed full ownership of Universal and made it into the top film studio in town, producing hit after hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896402,00.html?promoid=googlep|title=After the Octopus|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=July 20, 1962|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref> In 1966, MCA formed [[Uni Records]]<ref name="bsnpubs">{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Edwards |author2=Patrice Eyries |author3=Mike Callahan|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/mca/uni.html|title=Universal City Records [UNI&#93; Album Discography|date=April 24, 2007|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref> and in 1967 purchased [[Kapp Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Kapp+Records|title= Kapp Records Profile|publisher=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref> which was placed under Uni Records management.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=uni+%2B+decca+%2B+kapp&hl=en&ei=hr80TMCGLYiCnQfDsuHaAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=uni%20%2B%20decca%20%2B%20kapp&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref>

==History==

=== MCA Records formation in the U.K.===
The U.S. and U.K. Decca companies were forced to sever their ties because of [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14&dq=foresight+hard+work+raise+decca+baby&cd=1#v=onepage&q=foresight%20hard%20work%20raise%20decca%20baby&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref>  MCA's U.S.-based Decca Records had the rights to the Decca name in North and South America and parts of Asia including Japan.  U.K. Decca owned the rights to the Decca name in the rest of the world.  After the war, British Decca formed a new U.S. subsidiary, [[London Records]].

During this time U.S. Decca issued records outside North America on the Brunswick and Coral labels.  In 1967, Brunswick and Coral were replaced by the MCA label to release U.S. Decca and Kapp label material outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/MCA+Records|title= MCA Records Profile|publisher=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=Gallagher+%2B+%22mca+records%22&hl=en&ei=XMI0TOiNHJCmnQfe2ZHdAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Gallagher%20%2B%20%22mca%20records%22&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref> Initial activity as MCA Records was based in [[London]] and MCA Records UK was formally launched on February 16, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA45&dq=mca+%2B+%22united+kingdom%22+%2B+feb.&hl=en&ei=knxXTLKRG4OhnQf0toGfBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=mca%20%2B%20%22united%20kingdom%22%20%2B%20feb.&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref> Among the early artists on the MCA label, around 1971, were groups [[Wishbone Ash]], [[Osibisa]], [[Stackridge]] and [[Budgie (band)|Budgie]], and solo artists [[Tony Christie]], [[Mick Greenwood]] and [[Roy Young (musician)|Roy Young]].<ref>Billboard Magazine, November 13, 1971 - MCA Records advertisement, p. L28 (Spotlight on London)</ref> Early MCA releases were distributed by U.K. Decca but it moved to [[EMI]] in 1974. In 1979, distribution moved to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]], while the last releases in the 1980s were self-distributed.  As the U.S. division of MCA Records was not established until 1972, the earliest U.K. MCA Records material was released in the U.S. on either Kapp or Decca.

MCA U.K. also issued American Brunswick material on the MCA label until MCA lost control of Brunswick in 1970 after which American Brunswick material was issued in the UK on the revived Brunswick label. Uni label material was issued on the Uni label worldwide.

=== MCA Records formation in Canada and the United States ===
In 1970, MCA reorganized its Canadian record company [[Compo Company]] Ltd. into MCA Records (Canada).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/MCA+Records+(Canada)|title= MCA Records (Canada) Profile|publisher=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref> In April 1970, former [[Warner Bros. Records]] president Mike Maitland joined MCA and initially served as Decca's general manager.  Maitland was unsuccessful in his attempt to consolidate Warner Bros. Records with co-owned [[Atlantic Records]] which led to his departure from Warner.

In April 1971, Maitland supervised the consolidation of the [[New York]]-based Decca and Kapp labels plus the [[California]]-based Uni label into MCA Records based in [[Universal City, California]], with Maitland serving as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22mike+maitland%22+%2B+%22mca+records%22+%2B+uni+%2B+decca&source=bl&ots=WE2xXoGG54&sig=wVse-QIJ7qAFOeAcJfu8J9WfP9E&hl=en&ei=uA-dS-_MN4fKNa2-ueYN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref> The three labels maintained their identities for a short time but were retired in favor of the MCA label in 1973.<ref name="bsnpubs"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=kapp+%2B+decca+%2B+logos&hl=en&ei=3sQ0TIT2DZGxngev8qWiCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false|first=Claude|last=Hall|title=MCA Drops Vocalion, Decca, Kapp and Uni|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 10, 1973}}</ref> "[[Drift Away]]" by [[Dobie Gray]] became the final Decca pop label release in the U.S in 1973.  Beginning the same year the catalogs of Decca, Uni and Kapp were reissued in the U.S. on the MCA label under the supervision of veteran Decca producer [[Milt Gabler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3&dq=%22mca+records%22+%2B+maitland+%2B+%22crocodile+rock%22&hl=en&ei=twM3Td_XHcP7lwfcxPXwAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22mca%20records%22%20%2B%20maitland%20%2B%20%22crocodile%20rock%22&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref>

=== Early success ===
The first MCA Records release in the U.S. was former Uni artist [[Elton John]]'s "[[Crocodile Rock]]" single in 1972, which appeared on a plain black and white label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ig8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15&dq=%22mca+records+presents+its+first+single%22&hl=en&ei=t8w2TejtN4G0lQfn9r2KAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22mca%20records%20presents%20its%20first%20single%22&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref> 
Immediately following this the U.S. MCA label used a black with curved rainbow design until the late 1970s. This design was directly inspired by the U.S. Decca label of the 1960s.

In December 1972, [[Neil Diamond]], another Uni artist, reached  superstar status with his first MCA release, the live multi-platinum ''[[Hot August Night]]''.  Elton John's [[double album]] ''[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]'' was released in October 1973 and was number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart for eight straight weeks. The management of former Decca artists [[the Who]] had formed their own label [[Track Records]] in the U.K. but were still under contract with MCA for U.S. distribution.  The Who's double album ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' was  released by Track/MCA also in October 1973.  ''Quadrophenia'' peaked at number 2 as it was held back from the number 1 slot by ''Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.'' 

Other successful artists on MCA after the consolidation included former Kapp artist [[Cher]], and Uni artist [[Olivia Newton-John]]. MCA released the highly successful soundtrack album to the 1973 film ''[[The Sting]]''.  The soundtrack music was arranged and conducted by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] (MCA issued many other soundtracks to films from Universal, along with some non-Universal films).

One of the most successful new MCA artists in this era was the rock band [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]].  Originating from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], the group would go on to become one of the most popular in the [[Southern rock]] genre. The group was discovered and produced by [[Al Kooper]] and the records were initially released on Kooper's yellow "Sounds of the South" label imprint of MCA. The song "[[Free Bird]]" peaked at #19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in edited form, but the full-length version became one of the most popular songs of all time on [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations. On the second album, ''[[Second Helping]]'', the group recorded a song about their relationship with the label called, "Workin' for MCA". Three Lynyrd Skynyrd albums reached the double platinum sales level and at least two others reached platinum or gold levels. The album [[Street Survivors]] was released in October 1977, just prior to a tragic [[1977 Convair CV-240 crash|plane crash]] in rural Mississippi in which members of the group were either killed or severely injured. The original Street Survivors cover had a picture of the band members surrounded by flames, but this was quickly substituted for a revised design without flames. Though a latter version of the group enjoyed success, Lynyrd Skynyrd's streak of hits ended after the crash.

During the 1970s and 1980s MCA profited from reissuing classic early [[rock and roll]] recordings made by artists who recorded for the numerous labels absorbed by MCA over the years. One notable example was the 1954 Decca recording "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], which was featured as the lead track of MCA's No. 1-charting ''[[American Graffiti]]'' soundtrack album, and as a single returned to the American top 40 that year, 20 years after it was recorded.

=== Expansion and struggles ===
In 1977 MCA president [[Sidney Sheinberg]] set up the [[Infinity Records]] division, based in [[New York City]] with Ron Alexenberg as CEO. Alexenberg had been with the [[Epic Records|Epic]] division of CBS Records, now [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. The intention was to give MCA a stronger presence on the east coast. The only big hit the Infinity label had was ''[[Escape (Rupert Holmes song)|Escape]]'' by [[Rupert Holmes]] which was #1 at the end of 1979. Infinity also had some success with [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]], [[Spyro Gyra]], [[New England (band)|New England]] and [[TKO (band)|TKO]]. But MCA pulled the plug on Infinity after it failed to sell most of the 1 million advance copies of an album featuring [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] in October 1979. Infinity was fully absorbed by the parent company in 1980.

In 1979, Bob Siner replaced Maitland as MCA Records president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT16&dq=%22mike+maitland%22+%2B+%22mca+records%22+%2B+%22bob+siner%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22mike%20maitland%22%20%2B%20%22mca%20records%22%20%2B%20%22bob%20siner%22&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, MCA acquired [[ABC Records]] along with its subsidiaries [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount Records]], [[Dunhill Records]], [[Impulse! Records]], [[Westminster Records]], and [[Dot Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiUEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=february+%2B+1979+%2B+billboard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI1vnIjOfJxwIVFhWSCh0a2wmD#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref> ABC had acquired the Paramount and Dot labels when they purchased [[Gulf+Western]]'s record labels, the [[Famous Music]] Group.  Thus MCA now controlled the following material once owned by Paramount Pictures: the music released by Paramount's record labels, and the pre-1950 films by Paramount as well. Also included in the deal were recordings controlled by ABC, including albums by [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] which were originally released by [[Shelter Records]].  Petty was furious  about the reassignment of his contract and refused to record for MCA.  This led to a series of lawsuits, which resulted in his bankruptcy in 1980.  Petty and other ABC/Shelter artists eventually had their contracts transferred to the [[Backstreet Records]] label, which was distributed by MCA.  ABC Records' independent distributors sued ABC and MCA for $1.3 million in damages for being stuck with unsold ABC recordings they could not return to MCA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BM58F-yOS3IC&pg=PA203&dq=abc+records+mca+distributors&cd=6#v=onepage&q=abc%20records%20mca%20distributors&f=false|title=Jimmy Buffett|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT15&lpg=PT15&dq=%22abc+records%22+%2B+losses&source=bl&ots=rTNadUtHfc&sig=N6WryvkGe6UzDyUNUQc3unnjKkE&hl=en&ei=Y7DhS9HUNoL8Nb_62IwD&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22abc%20records%22%20%2B%20losses&f=false|title=Billboard|work=google.com}}</ref>  The better selling ABC Records catalog albums were reissued on the MCA label.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Edwards |author2=Patrice Eyries |author3=Mike Callahan|url=http://bsnpubs.com/abc/abcstory.html|title=ABC-Paramount Records Story|date=July 30, 2007|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref>

The combined effects of the Infinity Records failure, the purchase of ABC Records, rising vinyl costs and a major slump in record sales produced tremendous losses for the company between 1979 and 1982. It was not until the mid-1980s that the record labels returned to significant profitability. In late 1980 MCA received negative publicity when it attempted to raise the list price of new releases by top selling artists from $8.98 to $9.98.  This policy, known as "superstar pricing", ultimately failed. The ''[[Xanadu (soundtrack)|Xanadu]]'' soundtrack album and former ABC artist [[Steely Dan]]'s ''[[Gaucho (album)|Gaucho]]'' were the first $9.98 list albums. Backstreet artist Tom Petty succeeded in his campaign to force MCA to drop prices back to $8.98 for his album ''[[Hard Promises]]'' released in May 1981.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yd2Hm8BlzZUC&pg=PA31&dq=%22tom+petty%22%2B+%22hard+promises%22%2B+price&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ne0zT6CdG6fb0QGTp5WjAg&ved=0CF4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22tom%20petty%22%2B%20%22hard%20promises%22%2B%20price&f=false |title=Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry ... - Steve Knopper - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

=== Recovery, further expansion and MCA Music Entertainment Group formation ===
From 1983 to 1989, MCA Records was headed by [[Irving Azoff]], a record executive who receives credit amongst its management and staff for saving the company from bankruptcy. Azoff resigned from MCA in 1989 to form his own record label, [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]], now defunct.  [[Richard Palmese]] was named president of MCA Records after Azoff in 1990.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-07/business/fi-39_1_mca-records|title=Richard Palmese has been named president of MCA Records. He previously was executive vice president and general manager of MCA Records.| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | date=August 7, 1990}}</ref>

In this period, MCA signed a distribution agreement with WEA international which lasted until 1990.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the late 1980s, MCA formed Mechanic Records as a sub-label for releasing [[heavy metal music]]. Bands signed to Mechanic included [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Bang Tango]], and [[Trixter]]. In 1993 [[William Knoedelseder]], a business writer for the [[Los Angeles Times]], released the book "Stiffed: A True Story of MCA, the Music Business, and the Mafia". This volume detailed MCA's connections to [[organized crime]] during the 1980s.

The [[Chess Records]] catalog was acquired from the remnants of [[Sugar Hill Records (rap)|Sugar Hill Records]] in 1985. [[Motown Records]] was bought in 1988 (and sold to [[PolyGram]] in 1993). [[GRP Records]] and [[Geffen Records]] were acquired in 1990. Unlike most of MCA's previous acquisitions, the GRP (which began managing MCA's jazz holdings) and Geffen (which became a second mainstream subsidiary) labels kept their identities and MCA created a new holding company in 1989 called MCA Music Entertainment Group, headed by [[Al Teller]], former President of United Artists Records, and Co-Chairman of Turf Classics, a concert production company, run by Producer Richard Flanzer; among several other music industry positions Teller held.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/06/business/business-people-mca-music-group-names-new-chairman.html?pagewanted=1 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=BUSINESS PEOPLE; MCA Music Group Names New Chairman | first=Geraldine | last=Fabrikant | date=September 6, 1989 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> with Palmese continuing to run the MCA label. In the same year, the MCA Inc. parent company was purchased by the [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita group]].

=== Universal Music Group ===
In 1995, [[Seagram Company Ltd.]] acquired 80% of MCA.  In November of that year, Teller was fired and replaced by former [[Warner Music Group]] head [[Doug Morris]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-17/business/fi-4210_1_time-warner/2 | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=Chuck | last=Philips | date=November 17, 1995 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | title=Company Town : SHAKE-UP AT TIME WARNER : A Very Bizarre Year at Time Warner : Chronology: Industry waits to see if established and new artists defect to rivals in wake of executive turnover at music giant}}</ref> Palmese left MCA a week later.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/21/business/the-media-business-mca-fills-a-powerful-position-head-of-motion-picture-group.html?pagewanted=1 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS;MCA Fills a Powerful Position, Head of Motion Picture Group | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=November 21, 1995 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> The following year, the new owners dropped the MCA name; the company became [[Universal Studios|Universal Studios, Inc.]] and its music division, MCA Music Entertainment Group, was renamed [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG), headed by Morris.

In 1997, MCA Records adopted a new logo that featured the parent company's former full name. Many younger people had been unaware of what MCA had stood for in the past, hence the new logo.

In 1998 Seagram acquired [[PolyGram]] (owner of British Decca) from [[Philips]] and merged it with its music holdings. When Seagram's drinks business was bought by [[France]]-based [[Pernod Ricard]], its media holdings (including Universal) were sold to [[Vivendi]] which became Vivendi Universal which was later renamed back to Vivendi SA after selling most of the entertainment division (which included [[Universal Pictures]]) to [[General Electric]]. Morris continued to head the combined company, still called Universal Music Group.

=== MCA label phaseout ===
In spring 2003, the MCA label was absorbed by sister UMG label [[Geffen Records]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Billboard|url=http://www.ismsound.net/index/news/id.77|title=MCA & Geffen Merger|publisher=ISM Sound Network|date=May 20, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226220437/http://www.ismsound.net/index/news/id.77|archivedate=December 26, 2005|accessdate=November 22, 2008|authorlink=Billboard (magazine)}}</ref> Today [[Universal Music Enterprises]] manages MCA's rock, pop, and urban back catalogues (including those from ABC Records and Famous Music Group) in conjunction with Geffen - UME and Geffen have re-released various albums from MCA in the years since, as well as several compilations. Its [[country music]] label, [[MCA Nashville Records]] is still in operation. MCA's [[jazz]] catalogue is managed by [[Verve Records]] (through either the [[GRP Records|GRP]] or [[Impulse! Records|Impulse!]] imprints, depending on if the release was acquired from ABC or not), while its [[classical music]] catalogue is managed by [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. MCA's [[musical theatre]] catalogue is managed by [[Decca Records]] on its [[Decca Broadway]] imprint.

Today, the only operation by MCA that lives is the [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] imprint.

The MCA name is still in use in the [[Philippines]] because of a trademark dispute with an unrelated label known as [[Universal Records (Philippines)|Universal Records]], which holds the rights to the word "Universal" for recorded music in the Philippines. As a result, Universal Music Group is instead traded as '''MCA Music Inc.''' in that country. However, the company has adopted the [[moniker]] "MCA-Universal" to simplify identification, even though no formal "Universal" branding is exercised. Despite the naming, the label is known outside the Philippines as '''Universal Music Philippines'''.
