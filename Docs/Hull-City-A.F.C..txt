'''Hull City Association Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʌ|l|_|ˈ|s|ɪ|t|i}}) is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England. It was founded in 1904. The club participates in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[Football in England|English football]] – and their greatest achievement in cup competitions came in 2014, when the team reached the final of the [[FA Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26908665|title=Hull fight back to reach FA Cup final | accessdate=13 April 2014 |work=BBC Sport}}</ref>  In [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] they achieved promotion to the top flight of English football for the first time in their history by winning the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] [[Football League play-offs|play-off]] final at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Their highest league finish was for the [[2013–14 Hull City A.F.C. season|2013–14]] season, in which they finished 16th in the [[Premier League]] table.

Hull City play their home games at [[KC Stadium]]. They previously played at [[Boothferry Park]] and moved to their current home in 2002. Boothferry Park has been demolished and has been replaced by a housing development. They traditionally play in black and amber, often with a striped shirt design, hence their nickname ''The Tigers''. The club's mascots are Roary the Tiger and his sister Amber.

Hull City and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] were the only two professional teams which had official permission to play league football on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] because of the demands of the fish trade.

The following season a new ground was built for Hull City across the road from the cricket ground. Still under the managership of [[Ambrose Langley]], Hull continued to finish consistently in the top half of the table. They came close to promotion in the [[1909–10 in English football|1909–10]] season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal.<ref name="Hull City fchd"/> Hull regularly finished in the top half of the table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] in 1930.<ref name="Hull City fchd"/>

Don Robinson took over as chairman and appointed [[Colin Appleton]] as the new manager. Both had previously held the equivalent roles with non-league [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]]. Promotion to Division Three followed in 1983, with a young team featuring the likes of future England international [[Brian Marwood]], future England manager [[Steve McClaren]], centre-forward [[Billy Whitehurst]], and the prolific goal-scorer Les Mutrie. When Hull City missed out on promotion by one goal the following season, Appleton left to manage [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].

=== Decline in the late 20th century ===
Hull reached the Second Division in 1985 under player-manager [[Brian Horton]]. They remained there for the next six years before finally going down in 1991, by which time the club's manager was [[Terry Dolan (football manager)|Terry Dolan]]. Hull finished 14th in the Third Division in the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]] season, meaning that they would be competing in the new Second Division the following season.<ref name="Hull City fchd"/> In their first season in the rebranded division, Hull narrowly avoided another relegation, but the board kept faith in Dolan and over the next two seasons they achieved mid-table finishes. Financial difficulties hampered City's progress, as key players such as [[Alan Fettis]] and Dean Windass
had to be sold to fend off [[Liquidation|winding-up orders]].<ref name="PremierLeague">{{cite web

Despite briefly being locked out of Boothferry Park by bailiffs and facing the possibility of liquidation,<ref name="PremierLeague"/> Hull qualified for the Third Division play-offs in the [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]] season, losing in the semi-finals to Leyton Orient.<ref name="Hull City fchd"/> A boardroom takeover by former Leeds United commercial director [[Adam Pearson]] had eased the club's precarious financial situation and all fears of closure were banished.<ref name="History Of The Tigers"/>

=== 21st century resurgence ===
The new chairman ploughed funds into the club, allowing Little to rebuild the team. Hull occupied the Third Division promotion and play-off places for much of the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]] season, but Little departed two months before the end of the season and Hull slipped to 11th place under his successor [[Jan Mølby]].<ref name="History Of The Tigers"/>

Hull began the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] season with a number of defeats, which saw relegation look more likely than promotion, and Mølby was sacked in October as Hull languished fifth from bottom in the league. [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] was named as Hull's new manager and in December 2002, just two months after his appointment, Hull relocated to the new 25,400-seater [[KC Stadium]] after 56&nbsp;years at Boothferry Park.<ref name="History Of The Tigers"/> At the end of the season Hull finished 13th.<ref name="Hull City fchd"/>

Hull were Third Division runners-up in [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] and League One runners-up in [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]]; these back-to-back promotions took them into the Championship, the second tier of English football.<ref name="Hull City fchd"/> The [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season, the club's first back in the second tier, saw Hull finish in 18th place, 10&nbsp;points clear of relegation and their highest league finish for 16 years.<ref name="History Of The Tigers"/><ref name="Hull City fchd"/>

== Name change ==

=== 2013: Initial application ===
In August 2013, owner Assem Allam announced that the club has re-registered as "Hull City Tigers Ltd," and that the team would be marketed as "Hull City Tigers,"<ref name="Tigers Mail"/> removing the "Association Football Club" that had been part of the name since the club's formation in 1904.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/09/hull-rebranded-hull-city-tigers-name|title=Hull City to be renamed as Hull City Tigers 'to strengthen identity'
|date=9 August 2013|publisher=Press Association|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> Vice-chairman Ehab Allam said "AFC" would remain on the club badge for the [[2013-14 Premier League|2013–14 season]], but removed thereafter.<ref name=protest/>

In response, a [[Premier League]] spokesman said, "We have not been informed of a change in the name of the actual club. They will still be known as Hull City as far as the Premier League is concerned when results or fixtures are published."<ref name="Tigers Mail">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2387625/Premier-League-refuse-endorse-Hull-City-Tigers-change.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Premier League refuse to approve 'Hull City Tigers' name change as chief's attempts cause outrage with fans|first=Colin|last=Young|date=9 August 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>

According to its Chairman, by 2014, the club would be further renamed "Hull Tigers," because, as  he claimed, "in marketing, the shorter the name the more powerful [it is],"<ref name=id>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/sep/12/hull-city-assem-allam-premier-league|title=Assem Allam courts controversy and hands Hull City an identity crisis|date=12 September 2013|first=David|last=Conn|authorlink=David Conn|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> while "Association Football Club" made the name too long. Allam stated he  dislikes the word "City", as it is too "common" and a "lousy identity", since it is associated also with other clubs, such as [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. He told [[David Conn]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "in a few years many clubs will follow and change their names to something more interesting and I will have proved I am a leader,"<ref name=id/> adding that if he were the owner of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], he would change their name to "Manchester Hunter."<ref name=id/>

Allam justified the intended name change as part of his plans to create "additional sources of revenue" for the club, after [[Hull City Council]] refused to sell him the stadium [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] so he could develop, as he had stated, "a sports park" on the site.<ref name=MY>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2320440/Hull-City-owner-Assem-Allam-snub-civic-reception-hold-celebrations.html |title=It'll be MY promotion party, says Allam|newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]]|date= 6 May 2013|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> The council has refused to sell in order, as they stated, "to preserve the annual [[Hull Fair]] held on the adjacent car park."<ref name=MY/> After the collapse of the negotiations, Allam stated: "I had in mind £30 million to spend on the infrastructure of the club, to increase the stadium by 10,000 and to have commercial activities around the stadium — cafeterias, shops, supermarkets — to have all this to create income for the club so that in the future it can be self-financing and not relying on me." He asked [[Rhetorical question|rhetorically]], "What if I dropped dead tomorrow?"<ref name=MY/>

Supporters' groups expressed opposition to the name change. Bernard Noble, chairman of Hull City's official supporters club said he was disappointed, although he agreed that Allam had saved the club from liquidation and that it was "his club". Blogger Rick Skelton called the name change "a pointless exercise" and said, "Mr Allam's assertion that the name 'Hull City' is irrelevant and too common, is as disgusting a use of the English language as his new name for the club."<ref name="Tigers Mail"/> Before the first home match of the season on 24 August 2013, a group of supporters marched in protest against the name change, and unfurled a banner that read, "Hull City AFC: a club not a brand".<ref name=protest>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-City-protesters-banner-game/story-19709067-detail/story.html|title=

In a comment published on 1 December 2013 in ''[[The Independent]]'' in response to supporters' chants and banners of "City Till (sic) We Die", Allam said, "They can die as soon as they want, as long as they leave the club for the majority who just want to watch good football."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25174266|title=Hull owner Assem Allam: Critics 'can die as soon as they want'|date=1 December 2013|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> The supporters responded with chants of "We're Hull City, we'll die when we want" during that day's home match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

=== 2014: Resistance and rejection ===
Some brand and marketing experts have come out in support of the name change. Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency [http://www.brand-rapport.com/ Brand Rapport], stated that "the whole process has been conducted badly with the supporters, but [the name change] is a pretty sound idea."<ref name=supp>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25749335 |title=Could Assem Allam's Tigers name change benefit club?|work=BBC News|date= 16 January 2014|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the [[Coventry University Business School]], opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." He said, "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends."<ref name=supp/> [[David Stern]], [[Commissioner of the NBA|commissioner]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] in the United States, warned: "I would say a wise owner [of a sports club] would view his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and you really do want to allow the fans a little bit more input than I think is being allowed, with respect to Hull."<ref name=supp/>

On 17 March 2014, the FA membership committee advised that the name change application be rejected at the FA Council meeting on 9 April.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26618670|title=Hull City: FA set to reject name change to Hull Tigers|date=17 March 2014|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref> In response, the club published a statement saying the FA was "prejudiced" and criticised the committee's consultation with the City Till We Die opposition group.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/18/hull-city-fa-prejudice-tigers-name-change|title=Hull City accuse FA of 'prejudice' over bid to change name to Tigers|date=18 March 2014|agency=Press Association|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref> The following week, the club opened a ballot of [[Season ticket#Sport|season ticket holders]] over the name change. Opponents of the name change criticised as "loaded" the questions, which asked respondents to choose between "Yes to Hull Tigers with the Allam family continuing to lead the club", "No to Hull Tigers" and "I am not too concerned and will continue to support the club either way", on the grounds that voters were not given the option to reject the name while keeping the Allam family as owners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hull-City-Tigers-ballot-Fans-group-says-loaded/story-20841707-detail/story.html|title=Hull City 'Tigers' ballot: Fans' group says 'loaded' question will skew result|date=22 March 2014|work=Hull Daily Mail|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref> Of 15,033 season ticket holders, 5,874 voted in all, with 2,565 voting in favour of the change and 2,517 against, while 792 chose the "not too concerned" option.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26921004|title=Hull City: Fans narrowly back Tigers name change in ballot|date=7 April 2014|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>

On 9 April 2014, the FA Council announced its decision, carried by a 63.5% vote of its members, to reject the club's application for a name change.<ref name=rejects>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26960502|title=Hull City: FA Council rejects proposed name change to Tigers|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 April 2014|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref> The club responded by stating it will appeal the decision.<ref name=rejects/> However, since there is no appeal process with the FA and its Council, the decision is final. On 11 September 2014, Allam confirmed an appeal has been submitted to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]. He also held a news conference confirming the club had been put up for sale due to the English FA's decision on 9 April 2014.<ref>{{cite news

=== 2015: Re-application ===
In March 2015, an independent panel appointed by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] ruled that the decision of the Football Association Council to block the name change "cannot stand" on account of the process having been "flawed."<ref name=reapp>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31913338 |title=Hull City told they can reapply for Tigers name change|work=BBC Sport|date= 16 March 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

During the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the strip was constantly changing between the two versions of plain shirts and stripes. During the late 1980s, red was added to the kits but its duration went no further than this.<ref name="1968 - 1990">{{Cite news

In 1935, Hull City's first shirt badge mirrored the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston-upon-Hull, which was displayed on the sky blue shirts worn in the 1935–36 season. Following that season, the team went without wearing a badge until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This was worn up until 1957, when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This was worn for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, a logo with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, ''The Tigers''.<ref name="Hull City Historical Football Kits"/>

Hull changed their crest in June 2014, becoming one of few English league teams without the club name on their crest.<ref>{{cite news

In that year a proposal to build a new multi-purpose sports stadium on the site temporarily halted the club's plans to relocate, but when this plan failed the club resolved to continue with the stalled development of the site, in anticipation of moving to the new stadium in 1940. The outbreak of war, however, meant that the redevelopment again came to a halt, as the site was taken over by the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]].<ref name="Boothferry Park"/>

During the Second World War, Anlaby Road was damaged by enemy bombing, the repair cost of which was in the region of £1,000. The Cricket Club served notice to quit at the same time, and so in 1943 the tenancy was officially ended.<ref name="Anlaby Road"/> Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard Ground from 1944 until 1945 because of the poor condition of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road.<ref name="The Boulevard"/>  The new stadium was finally opened under the revised name of Boothferry Park on 31 August 1946.<ref name="Boothferry Park"/>
