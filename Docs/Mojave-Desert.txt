The '''Mojave Desert''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|m|oʊ|ˈ|h|ɑː|v|i|,_|m|ə|-}}{{refn|{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editors=Peter Roach, James Hartmann and Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=3-12-539683-2 }}}}{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Mojave}}}} {{respell|mo|HAH|vee}}) is a [[Rain shadow|rain-shadow]] arid [[desert]] area that occupies a significant portion of southeastern [[California]] and smaller parts of [[central California]], [[southern Nevada]], southwestern [[Utah]] and northwestern [[Arizona]] in the United States.
<ref>{{cite web|title= Mojave desert Map|url=http://digital-desert.com/regions/ }}</ref> The Mojave Desert's boundaries are generally defined by the presence of ''[[Yucca brevifolia]]'' (Joshua trees), considered an [[indicator species]] for this desert. It is the driest of the [[North American deserts]].<ref name=MDW/> The desert is believed to support between 1,750 and 2,000 species of plants.<ref>Mazzucchelli, Vincent G., "The Southern Limits of the Mohave Desert, California", ''The California Geographer'', 1967, VIII: 127–133. This study provides original maps of the Mohave and adjacent deserts in the southwestern states.</ref>

It is roughly rectangular in shape,<ref name=MDW/> bounded by the [[Great Basin Desert]] to the north,<ref name=MDW>Mojave Desert Wildflowers, Pam MacKay, 2nd Ed. 2013, p. 1</ref> and the [[Sonoran Desert]] to the south<ref name=MDW/> and east{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. The topographical boundaries include the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] to the west, and the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] and [[San Bernardino Mountains]] to the south. The mountain boundaries are quite distinct since they are outlined by the two largest faults in California, the [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]] and [[Garlock Fault|Garlock]] faults. The Mojave Desert displays typical [[basin and range]] topography. Higher elevations above 2,000 feet (610 m) in the Mojave are commonly referred to as the High Desert; however, [[Death Valley]] is the lowest elevation in North America at 282 feet (86 m) below sea level and is one of the Mojave Desert's more notorious places. It occupies less than 50,000 square miles, making it the smallest of the North American deserts.<ref name=MDW/>

The Mojave Desert is often referred to as the "high desert", in contrast to the "low desert", the Sonoran Desert to the south. The Mojave Desert is generally lower than the Great Basin Desert to the north.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The term ''Mojave'' originates from the Spanish language while the spelling ''Mohave'' comes from modern English. Both are used today, although the [[Mohave people|Mohave]] Tribal Nation officially uses the spelling Mojave; the word is a shortened form of '''Hamakhaave''', their [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] in their native language, which means 'beside the water'.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Indian History|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/mojave_kids.htm}}</ref>

While most of the Mojave Desert is sparsely populated, several large cities can be found there including [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]] and [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] in California, [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] (the largest) in Nevada, as well as [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] in Utah. There are some research facilities at [[Mojave Airport]] (also known as Mojave Air and Space Port), located within Mojave Desert.

==Climate==
The Mojave Desert receives less than {{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain a year and is generally between {{convert|2000|and|5000|ft}} in elevation. The Mojave Desert also contains the [[Mojave National Preserve]]; as well as the lowest and hottest place in [[North America]]: [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] at 282 feet below sea level; where the temperature often surpasses {{convert|120|F|C|abbr=on|lk=on}} from late June to early August. [[Zion National Park]] in [[Utah]] lies at the junction of the Mojave, the [[Great Basin Desert]], and the [[Colorado Plateau]]. Despite its aridity, the Mojave (and particularly the [[Antelope Valley]] in its southwest) has long been a center of [[alfalfa]] production; fed by irrigation coming from [[groundwater]] and (in the 20th century) from the [[California Aqueduct]].
[[File:Mustard Blue Sunset.jpg|thumb|left|Mustard blue summer sunset at [[Landers, California]]]]

The Mojave is a desert of temperature extremes and two distinct seasons. Winter months bring temperatures dipping to around {{convert|20|F|C|abbr=on}} on valley floors, and below {{convert|0|F|C|abbr=on}} at higher elevations. Storms moving from the [[Pacific Northwest]] can bring rain and in some places even snow. More often, the [[rain shadow]] created by the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] as well as mountain ranges within the desert such as the [[Spring Mountains]], bring only clouds and wind. In longer periods between storm systems, winter temperatures in valleys can approach {{convert|80|F|C|abbr=on}}.

Spring weather continues to be influenced by Pacific storms, but rainfall is more widespread and occurs less frequently after April. By early June, it is rare for another Pacific storm to have a significant impact on the region's weather; and temperatures after the middle of May are normally above {{convert|90|F|C|abbr=on}} and frequently above {{convert|100|F|C|abbr=on}}.

Summer weather is dominated by heat. Temperatures on valley floors can soar above {{convert|120|F|C|abbr=on}} and above {{convert|130|F|C|abbr=on}} at the lowest elevations. Low humidity, high temperatures, and low pressure, draw in moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] creating thunderstorms across the desert southwest known as the [[North American Monsoon|North American monsoon]]. While the Mojave does not get nearly the amount of rainfall that the [[Sonoran desert]] to the south receives, monsoonal moisture will create thunderstorms as far west as California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] from mid-June through early September.
[[File:Desert Diablo.jpg|thumb|right|Clouds reflecting high wind conditions from [[orographic lift]] in the Mojave Desert]]

Autumn is generally pleasant, with one to two Pacific storm systems creating regional rain events. October is one of the driest and sunniest months in the Mojave; and temperatures usually remain between {{convert|70|F|C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|F|C|abbr=on}} on the valley floors.

After temperature, wind is the most significant weather phenomenon in the Mojave. Across the region windy days are common; and also common in areas near the transition between the Mojave and the California low valleys, including near [[Cajon Pass]], [[Soledad Canyon]] and the [[Tehachapi, California|Tehachapi]] areas. During the [[June Gloom]], cooler air can be pushed out into the desert from Southern California. In [[Santa Ana wind]] events, hot air from the desert blows out into the [[Los Angeles basin]] and other coastal areas. [[Wind farm]]s in these areas generate power from these winds.

The other major weather factor in the region is elevation. The highest peak within the Mojave is [[Charleston Peak]] at {{convert|11918|ft}};<ref name="State of Nevada"/> while the [[Badwater Basin]] in Death Valley is {{convert|279|ft}} below sea level.<ref name=NED/> Accordingly, temperature and precipitation ranges wildly in all seasons across the region.

The Mojave Desert has not historically supported a fire regime because of low fuel loads and connectivity. However, in the last few decades, invasive annual plants (e.g., ''[[Bromus]]'' spp., ''Schismus'' spp., ''[[Brassica]]'' spp.) have facilitated fire; which has significantly altered many areas of the desert. At higher elevations, fire regimes are regular but infrequent.

==Geography==
{{category see also|Mountain ranges of the Mojave Desert|Valleys of the Mojave Desert|Lakes of the Mojave Desert}}

[[File:LakeBadwater.JPG|thumb|left|An [[ephemeral]] lake in [[Badwater Basin]], [[Death Valley National Park]]]]

The Mojave Desert is defined by numerous [[mountain range]]s creating its xeric conditions. These ranges often create valleys, [[endorheic basin]]s, [[salt pan (geology)|salt pans]], and seasonal [[saline lake]]s when precipitation is high enough. These mountain ranges and valleys are part of the [[Basin and Range province]] and the [[Great Basin]]; a geologic area of crustal thinning which pulls open valleys over millions of years. Most of the valleys are internally drained ([[endorheic]] basins), so all precipitation that falls within the valley does not eventually flow to the ocean. Some of the Mojave (toward the east, in and around the [[Colorado River]]/[[Virgin River Gorge]]) is within a different geographic domain called the [[Colorado Plateau]]. This area is known for its incised canyons, high mesas and plateaus, and flat strata; a unique geographic locality found nowhere else on earth.

==Cities and regions==

{{For|a description of the metropolitan areas of the Mojave|High Desert (California)}}
[[File:RidgecrestCA.JPG|thumb|left|A typical Mojave desert valley and city: [[Indian Wells Valley]] and [[Ridgecrest, California]]]]

While the Mojave Desert itself is sparsely populated, it has increasingly become urbanized in recent years. The metropolitan areas include: [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], which is the largest city in the Mojave with a metropolitan population of around 1.9 million in 2006; [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], the largest Utah city and northeastern-most metropolitan area in the Mojave. [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], the largest California city in the desert; and over 850,000 people live in areas of the Mojave attached to the [[Greater Los Angeles area|Greater Los Angeles]] metropolitan area, including Palmdale and Lancaster, (referred to as the Antelope Valley), [[Victorville, California|Victorville]], [[Apple Valley, California|Apple Valley]] and [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] (referred to as the [[Victor Valley, California|Victor Valley]]) attached to the [[Inland Empire (CA)|Inland Empire]] metropolitan area, the 14th largest in the nation.

Smaller cities or [[micropolitan]] areas in the Mojave Desert include [[Helendale, California|Helendale]], [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona|Lake Havasu City]],
[[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]], [[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]], [[Bullhead City, Arizona|Bullhead City]] and [[Pahrump, Nevada|Pahrump]]. All have experienced rapid population growth since 1990.

<!-- TOWNS FEWER THAN 30K: "Includes" is a non-exclusive list, meant to give an idea of the thousands of towns in the Mojave Desert. Not all of them are listed and is done so on purpose. Please don't add more to this list unless the city is particularly notable. -->
Towns with fewer than 30,000 people in the Mojave include: [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], [[Boron, California|Boron]], 
[[California City, California|California City]], [[Helendale, California|Helendale]], [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]], [[Landers, California|Landers]], [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], [[Lucerne Valley]], [[Mojave, California|Mojave]], [[Needles, California|Needles]], [[Nipton, California|Nipton]], [[Pioneertown, California|Pioneertown]], [[Randsburg, California|Randsburg]], [[Ridgecrest, California|Ridgecrest]], [[Rosamond, California|Rosamond]], [[Yucca Valley, California|Yucca Valley]] and [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]] in California; [[Mesquite, Nevada|Mesquite]] and [[Moapa Valley, Nevada|Moapa Valley]] in Nevada; and [[Hurricane, Utah|Hurricane]] in Utah.

The California portion of the desert also contains [[Edwards Air Force Base]] and [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]], noted for experimental aviation and weapons projects, and the [[Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms|largest Marine Corps base]] in the world at Twentynine Palms. The US Army also maintains [[Fort Irwin National Training Center#Geography|Fort Irwin]] & the National Training Center (NTC) which is another major training area for the United States Military. Mojave airport is also home to a long term storage facility for large airplanes due to extremely dry non-corrosive weather conditions and a hard ground ideal for parking aircraft. The airport also houses the Air and Space Port and was one of the test centres for the Virgin Galactic Fleet.

The Mojave Desert contains a number of [[ghost town]]s, the most significant of these being the gold-mining town of [[Oatman, Arizona]], the silver-mining town of [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico, California]], and the old railroad depot of [[Kelso, California|Kelso]]. Some of the other ghost towns are of the more modern variety, created when [[U.S. Route 66]] (and the lesser-known [[U.S. Route 91]]) were abandoned in favor of the [[Interstate highway|Interstates]]. The Mojave Desert is crossed by major highways [[Interstate 15]], [[Interstate 40]], [[U.S. Route 95]], [[U.S. Route 395]] and [[California State Route 58]].

Other than the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] on the eastern half of the Mojave, few long streams cross the desert. The [[Mojave River]] is an important source of water for the southern parts of the desert. The [[Amargosa River]] flows from the Great Basin Desert south to near [[Beatty, Nevada]], then underground through [[Ash Meadows]] before returning to the surface near [[Shoshone, California]], disappearing underground again a short while later and has its final outlet into the southern end of Death Valley.  The riverbed passes under SR 127 near Dumont Dunes before turning north into Death Valley National Park.

The Mojave Desert is also home to the [[Devils Playground]]; about {{convert|40|mi|km}} of dunes and salt flats going in a northwest-southeasterly direction. The Devils Playground is a part of the Mojave National Preserve and is located between the town of [[Baker, California]] and [[Providence Mountains]]. The [[Cronese Mountains]] are found within the Devils Playground.

==Parks and tourism==

The Mojave Desert is one of the most popular tourism spots in North America, primarily because of the gambling destination of Las Vegas. The Mojave is also known for its scenic beauty, with three national parks – Death Valley National Park, [[Joshua Tree National Park]], and the Mojave National Preserve. Lakes [[Lake Mead|Mead]], [[Lake Mohave|Mohave]], and [[Lake Havasu|Havasu]] provide water sports recreation, and vast off-road areas entice off-road enthusiasts. The Mojave Desert also includes a [[California State Park]], the [[Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve]], located in [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]]. [[Hoover Dam]] is a popular tourist destination. Visitors get a chance to see the structure, the [[hydroelectric power]] plant, and hear the history of the dam's construction during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructioncompany.com/historic-construction-projects/hoover-dam/|title=Hoover Dam|author=|work=General Contractor Bob Moore Construction Company|publisher=|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

Besides the major national parks, there are other areas of identified significance and tourist interest in the desert such as the [[Big Morongo Canyon Preserve]], within the [[Colorado Desert]], and the [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area]], {{convert|17|mi}} west of Las Vegas, both of which are managed by the Bureau of Land Management.

Among the more popular and unique tourist attractions in the Mojave is the self described [[world's tallest thermometer]] at {{convert|134|ft}} high, which is located along [[Interstate 15 in California|Interstate 15]] in Baker, California. The newly renovated [[Kelso Depot, Restaurant and Employees Hotel|Kelso Depot]] is the Visitor Center for the Mojave National Preserve. Nearby the massive [[Kelso Dunes]] are a popular recreation spot. Nipton, California, located on the northern entrance to the Mojave National Preserve, is a restored ghost town founded in 1885.

Several attractions and natural features are located in the [[Calico Mountains (California)|Calico Mountains]]. [[Calico Ghost Town]], in Yermo, is administered by San Bernardino County. The ghost town has several shops and attractions, and inspired [[Walter Knott]] to build [[Knott's Berry Farm]]. The [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] also administers [[Rainbow Basin]] and Owl Canyon, two "off-the-beaten-path" scenic attractions together north of Barstow in the Calicos. The [[Calico Early Man Site]], in the Calico Hills east of [[Yermo, California|Yermo]], is believed by some archaeologists, including the late [[Louis Leakey]], to show the earliest evidence with [[Lithic analysis|lithic]] [[stone tools]] found here of human activity in North America. The [[Calico Peaks]] scenically rise above all the destinations.

A tour of the Mojave Desert inspired American songwriter [[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] to compose the [[parlor song]] "[[A Perfect Day (song)|A Perfect Day]]" in 1909.<ref>Reublein, Rick. [http://parlorsongs.com/bios/cjbond/cjbond.php "America's first great woman popular song composer"] site.</ref>

The '''flora of the Mojave Desert''' help define what is called the Mojave Desert in that the desert itself is generally considered to be outlined by the extent of growth of one of its plants, the Joshua tree (''[[Yucca brevifolia]]''). Mojave Desert flora is not a [[vegetation type]], although plants in the area have evolved in isolation because of physical barriers. This area includes southeastern California and smaller parts of central California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona in the United States. The flora are adapted to extremely hot and dry conditions, but generally not as extreme as the adaptations needed for survival in the [[flora of the Sonoran Desert]], which has an overlap in its major flora, such as the creosote bush (''[[Larrea tridentata]]'').

==West Mojave Plan litigation==
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management(BLM) manages public lands in the Mojave Desert as part of its "crown jewels of the [[Western United States|American West]]" [[National Landscape Conservation System]]. It has designated numerous large [[off-road vehicle]] open use areas on public lands in the western Mojave Desert, including El Mirage, [[Jawbone Canyon]], [[Rasor Off-Highway Vehicle Area|Rasor]], Spangler Hills, Stoddard Valley, Dove Spring Canyon, [[Dumont Dunes]], and the world's largest open off-road vehicle use area, [[Johnson Valley, California|Johnson Valley]]. Open areas designated for unrestricted vehicle travel in the western Mojave Desert total {{convert|363480|acre|km2}}. Several additional open areas dedicated to unrestricted vehicle travel on public lands have been designated in the northern and eastern Colorado (NECO) Desert. In 2002, BLM designated all washes in the southeastern third of the NECO planning area as also open to unrestricted vehicle travel. This was followed in 2003 by BLM expanding the off-road vehicle network in the western Mojave Desert to enhance off-road vehicle recreation opportunity. In 2004, relative to the case of ''[[Center for Biological Diversity]], et al., Plaintiffs, v. Bureau of Land Management, et al., Defendants''; the United States District court enjoined "all off-road vehicle use in the washes of the NECO Desert planning area pending issuance of a new biological opinion.".<ref>{{cite web|date=April 27, 2007|title=Desert Lawsuit Settlement|url=http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/cdd/lawsuit.html|work=California Desert District|publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]]|accessdate=2010-01-12}}<br/>
 a. {{cite web|date=December 20, 2004|title=Order Re: Defendants' motion to alter or amend the judgment and plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief|url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib//blm/ca/pdf/pdfs/caso_pdfs.Par.ba8f28ba.File.pdf/Ilston.ruling.12.30.04.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]]|accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref>{{Rp|a}} A new biological opinion was subsequently issued and BLM's open wash designation in the NECO planning area was reinstated. In 2006, several environmental groups protested an additional route network expansion designated under the West Mojave Desert (WEMO) plan.

In 2009, U.S. District Judge [[Susan Illston]] ruled against the BLM's proposed designation of additional off-road vehicle use allowance in the western Mojave Desert. According to the ruling, the BLM violated its own regulations<ref name=wil>[http://wilderness.org/content/road-routes-mojave-desert-found-illegal Mojave’s Off-Highway Roads Found Illegal]</ref> when it designated approximately {{convert|5000|mi|km}} of [[off-roading]] routes in 2006.<ref name=merc>[http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?SourceCode=20090930cg Judge rejects federal plan for SoCal desert routes]</ref> According to Judge Ilston, the BLM's designation was significantly "flawed because it does not contain a reasonable range of alternatives" to limit damage to sensitive habitat.<ref name=lat>[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mojave30-2009sep30,0,6696095.story Judge rejects U.S. management plan for California desert], ''Los Angeles Times'', 30 September 2009.</ref> Judge Illston found that the bureau had inadequately analyzed the routes' impacts on air quality, soils, plant communities, riparian habitats, and sensitive species such as the endangered [[Uma scoparia|Mojave fringe-toed lizard]], pointing out that the desert and its resources are "extremely fragile, easily scarred, and slowly healed."<ref name=lat/>

The court also found that the BLM failed to follow route designation procedures established in the agency’s own California Desert Conservation Area Plan, which allowed visitors to create hundreds of illegal OHV routes during the past three decades. The plan normally requires the BLM to consider the impacts to private property, non-motorized recreation opportunity, and natural resources before establishing off road areas.<ref name=wil/> The adopted West Mojave plan amendment was found to have violated the BLM's own manual of regulations, the [[Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976]] (FLPMA) and the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (NEPA).<ref name=merc/> The ruling was considered a success for a coalition of conservation groups, including the [[California Native Plant Society]], Friends of Juniper Flats, the Alliance for Responsible Recreation, Community Off-Road Vehicle Watch, The Center for Biological Diversity, [[Sierra Club]], and [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], who together initiated the legal challenge in late 2006.<ref name=lat/>

In 2011, Judge Illston ruled on a remedy request submitted by the ten involved environmental organizations. BLM in this ruling was directed to complete a revised WEMO route designation complying with all laws and regulations by March 2014. The agency is also required per this ruling to place signs on all off-road vehicle routes which are legal to use, create a monitoring plan to determine if illegal vehicle use is occurring, and provide additional enforcement to prevent illegal use.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/stories/PE_News_Local_D_offroad01.283e22a.html|title=Judge: Redo off-roading routes in Mojave Desert|newspaper=Press-Enterprise|first=David|last=Danelski|date=31 January 2011}}</ref>
