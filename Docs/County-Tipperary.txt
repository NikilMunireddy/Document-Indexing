'''County Tipperary''' ({{lang-ga|Contae Thiobraid Árann}}) is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. [[Tipperary County Council]] is the [[local government in the Republic of Ireland|local government]] authority for the county. Between 1838 and 2014 county Tipperary was divided into two counties, [[North Tipperary]] and [[South Tipperary]], which were unified under the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]], which came into effect following the [[Irish local elections, 2014|2014 local elections]] on 3 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tipperarycoco.ie/news/tipperary-county-council|title=Tipperary County Council|work=Tipperary County Council|date=29 May 2014|quote=Tipperary County Council will become an official unified authority on Tuesday, 3rd June 2014. The new authority combines the existing administration of North Tipperary County Council and South Tipperary County Council.}}</ref> It is located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]]. The county is named after the town of [[Tipperary]], and was established in the early thirteenth century, shortly after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. The population of the entire county was 158,754 at the 2011 census.<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/saveselections.asp CSO] Census 2011.</ref> The largest towns are [[Clonmel]], [[Nenagh]] and [[Thurles]].

==Geography and political subdivisions==
[[File:Galtee range aherlow.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Galtee Mountains]] seen from the [[Glen of Aherlow]].]]
Tipperary is the sixth largest of the 32 counties by area and the 11th largest by population.<ref>{{cite book| first=Eoghan| last=Corry| title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland| year=2005| id= | pages=186–191}}</ref> It is the third largest of Munster’s 6 counties by size and the third largest by population. The region is part of the central plain of Ireland, but the diversified terrain contains several mountain ranges: the [[Knockmealdown Mountains|Knockmealdown]], the [[Galtee Mountains|Galtee]], the [[Arra Hills]] and the [[Silvermine Mountains]]. The southern portion of the county is drained by the [[River Suir]]; the northern by tributaries of the Shannon which widens into [[Lough Derg (Shannon)|Lough Derg]]. No part of the county touches the coast. The centre is known as 'the [[Golden Vale]]', a rich pastoral stretch of land in the Suir basin which extends into counties [[County Limerick|Limerick]] and [[County Cork|Cork]].

===Baronies===
There are 12 historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in County Tipperary: [[Clanwilliam (County Tipperary)|Clanwilliam]], [[Eliogarty]], [[Iffa and Offa East]], [[Iffa and Offa West]], [[Ikerrin]], [[Kilnamanagh Lower]], [[Kilnamanagh Upper]],  [[Middle Third (County Tipperary barony)|Middle Third]], [[Ormond Lower]], [[Ormond Upper]], [[Owney and Arra]] and [[Slievardagh]].

===Civil parishes and townlands===
{{Main|Civil parishes in Ireland}}
Parishes were delineated after the [[Down Survey]] as an intermediate subdivision, with multiple [[townland]]s per parish and multiple parishes per barony. The civil parishes had some use in local taxation and were included on the nineteenth century maps of the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ims0.osiemaps.ie/website/publicviewer/main.aspx|title=Interactive map (civil parish boundaries viewable in Historic layer)|work=Mapviewer|publisher=Ordnance Survey of Ireland|accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref> For [[poor law]] purposes, [[District Electoral Divisions]] replaced the civil parishes in the mid-nineteenth century. There are 199 civil parishes in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Tipperary&streets=yes |title=Placenames Database of Ireland - Tipperary civil parishes |publisher=Logainm.ie |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}</ref> Townlands are the smallest officially defined geographical divisions in Ireland; there are 3,159 townlands in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Tipperary&streets=yes |title=Placenames Database of Ireland - Tipperary townlands |publisher=Logainm.ie |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Rock of Cashel, Tipperary.jpg|thumb|The [[Rock of Cashel]], seat of the [[Kings of Munster]]]]
Following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], the Kingdom of Munster was claimed as a lordship. By 1210, the [[sheriff]]dom of Munster shired into the shires of Tipperary and [[County Limerick|Limerick]].<ref name="Falkiner1904">{{cite book |authorlink=Caesar Litton Falkiner |last=Falkiner|first=Caesar Litton|title=Illustrations of Irish history and topography: mainly of the seventeenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vksNAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=14 August 2011|year=1904|publisher=Longmans, Green|pages=108–142|chapter=The Counties of Ireland}}</ref> In 1328, Tipperary was granted to the [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earls of Ormond]] as a [[county palatine]] or [[Liberty (division)|liberty]].<ref name="Falkiner1904"/> The grant excluded church lands such as the [[Archbishop of Cashel|archiepiscopal see]] of [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]], which formed the separate county of [[Cross Tipperary]].<ref name="Falkiner1904"/> Though the Earls gained jurisdiction over the church lands in 1662, "Tipperary and Cross Tipperary" were not definitively united until the [[County Palatine of Tipperary Act 1715]], when the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|2nd Duke of Ormond]] was [[attainder|attainted]] for supporting the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]].<ref name="C760a3">{{cite book |author=Deputy keeper of the public records in Ireland |title=Fifth Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVYRAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA3-PA33 |accessdate=2011-08-14 |series=[[Command paper]]s |volume=C.760 |date=1873-04-26 |publisher=HMSO |pages=32–37 |chapter=Appendix 3: Extract from Report of the Assistant Deputy Keeper on the Records of the Court of Record of the County Palatine of Tipperary}}</ref><ref name="Act2Geo1c8">{{cite book|last=Ireland|first=|title=Statutes Passed in the Parliaments Held in Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJVRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5|accessdate=14 August 2011|volume=III: 1715–1733|year=1794|publisher=Printed by George Grierson, printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty|pages=5–11|chapter=2 George I c.8}}</ref>

==Local government and politics==
Following the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]], [[Tipperary County Council]] is the local government authority for the county. The authority is a merger of two separate authorities [[North Tipperary County Council]] and [[South Tipperary County Council]] which operated up until June 2014. The [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] is responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] such as sanitation, planning and [[Real estate development|development]], libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and [[social housing]]. The county is part of the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for the purposes of European elections. For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the county is part of two constituencies: [[Tipperary North (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Tipperary North]] and [[Tipperary South (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Tipperary South]]. Together they return six deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil.

== Culture ==
Tipperary is referred to as the "Premier County", a description attributed{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to [[Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)|Thomas Davis]], [[Editing|Editor]] of ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'' [[newspaper]] in the 1840s as a tribute to the nationalistic feeling in Tipperary and said{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} that "where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows". 
Tipperary was the subject of the famous song "[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]" written by [[Jack Judge]], whose grandparents came from the county. It was popular with regiments of the [[British army]] during [[World War I]].
The song "Slievenamon", which is traditionally associated with the county, was written by [[Charles Kickham]] from [[Mullinahone]], and is commonly sung at sporting fixtures involving the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpage.com/songs/slevmoan.htm |title=Sliabh na mban - Slievenamon |publisher=Irishpage.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}</ref>

== Irish language ==
There are 979 Irish speakers in County Tipperary attending the five [[Gaelscoil]]eanna (Irish language primary schools) and two [[Gaelcholáiste|Gaelcholáistí]] (Irish language secondary schools).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Staitistic%C3%AD-2010-2011_Gaeilge.pdf|title=Oideachas Trí Mheán na Gaeilge in Éirinn sa Ghalltacht 2010-2011|year=2011|publisher=gaelscoileanna.ie|language=Irish|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref>

== Economy ==
The area around Clonmel is the economic hub of the county: to the west of the town the manufacturers [[Bulmers (C&C)|Bulmers]] (brewers) and [[Merck & Co.]] (pharmaceuticals). There is much fertile land, especially in the region known as the [[Golden Vale]], one of the richest agricultural areas in [[Ireland]]. Dairy farming and [[cattle]] raising are the principal occupations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Other industries are [[slate]] quarrying and the manufacture of [[meal]] and [[flour]].

Tipperary is famous for its [[horse breeding]] industry and is the home of [[Coolmore Stud]], the largest [[thoroughbred]] breeding operation in the world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Tourism plays a significant role in County Tipperary - [[Lough Derg (Shannon)|Lough Derg]], [[Thurles]], [[Rock of Cashel]], [[Ormonde Castle]], [[Ahenny High Crosses]], [[Cahir Castle]], Bru Boru Heritage Centre and [[Tipperary Crystal]] are some of the primary tourist destinations in the county.

== Transport ==
Road transport dominates in County Tipperary. The [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7 motorway]] crosses the north of the county through [[Roscrea]] and [[Nenagh]] and the [[M8 motorway (Ireland)|M8 motorway]] bisects the county from north of [[Two-Mile Borris]] to the [[County Limerick]] border. Both routes are amongst some of the busiest roads on the island. The Limerick to Waterford [[N24 road (Ireland)|N24]] crosses the southern half of Tipperary, travelling through [[Tipperary Town]], [[Bansha]], north of [[Cahir]] and around [[Clonmel]] and [[Carrick-on-Suir]].

===Railways===
Tipperary also has a number of railway stations situated on the [[Dublin-Cork railway line|Dublin-Cork line]], [[Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line|Dublin-to-Limerick]] and [[Limerick-Rosslare railway line|Limerick-Waterford line]]. The [[Rail transport in Ireland|railway lines]] connect places in Tipperary with [[Cork railway station|Cork]], [[Dublin Heuston]], [[Waterford railway station|Waterford]], [[Limerick railway station|Limerick]], [[Mallow railway station|Mallow]] and [[Galway railway station|Galway]].

== Sports ==
County Tipperary has a strong association with the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] which was founded in Thurles in 1884. The Gaelic Games of [[Hurling]], [[Gaelic football]], [[Camogie]] and [[Team handball|Handball]] are organised by the [[Tipperary GAA]] County Board of the GAA. The organisation competes in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]. Tipperary, with 26 wins, are the only county to have won an all-Ireland title in evey decade since the 1880s.

[[Horse racing]] takes place at [[Tipperary Racecourse]], [[Thurles Racecourse]] and [[Clonmel Racecourse]].
