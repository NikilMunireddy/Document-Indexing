The island was named ''La Española'' and claimed by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], which ruled until the early 17th century. Competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being [[Treaty of Ryswick|ceded to France]], which named it ''Saint-Domingue''. The development of [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s, worked by slaves brought from Africa, led to the colony being among the most lucrative in the world.<ref>[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=17130 ''France and the History of Haiti''] by Gearóid Ó Colmáin, ''Global Research'', 22 January 2010</ref>

{{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}
[[File:Copia de Cacicazgos de la Hispaniola.png|thumb|350px|The five [[cacique]]doms of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus]]

At the time of European encounter, the island of [[Hispaniola]], of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths,<ref name="Hispaniola Article"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cardiostart.org/dominican-republic-2015/ |title=Dominican Republic 2015 |accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> was one of many Caribbean islands inhabited by the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] Indians, speakers of an [[Arawakan]] language called Taino, which has been preserved in the Haitian Creole language. The Taíno name for the entire island was ''Haiti''. The people had migrated over centuries into the Caribbean islands from South America. Genetic studies show they were related to the [[Yanomami]] of the [[Amazon Basin]]. They also originated in Central and South America. After migrating to Caribbean islands, in the 15th century, the Taíno were pushed into the northeast Caribbean islands by the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]].<ref name="royal"/>

In the Taíno societies of the Caribbean islands, the largest unit of political organization was led by a ''[[cacique]],'' or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Haiti was divided among five Caciquats: the Magua in the north east, the Marien in the north west, the Xaragua in the south west, the Maguana in the center region of Cibao and the Higuey in the south east.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cassá, Roberto |title=Los Indios de Las Antillas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJ-wJ49cNwAC&pg=PA126|year=1992|publisher=Editorial Abya Yala|isbn=978-84-7100-375-1|pages=126–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Samuel M.|last=Wilson|year=1990|title=Hispaniola: Caribbean Chiefdoms in the Age of Columbus|publisher=University of Alabama Press|page=110|ISBN=0-8173-0462-2}}</ref> The caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms, with payment consisting of harvests.

Taíno cultural artifacts include [[cave paintings]] in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions. Modern-day [[Léogane]] started as a French colonial town in the southwest, is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of ''Xaragua.''<ref name="royal">{{cite journal|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/ROYAL-01.ANT|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216092556/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/ROYAL-01.ANT|archivedate= 16 February 2009|title=1492 and Multiculturalism|author=Royal, Robert |journal=The Intercollegiate Review|date=Spring 1992|volume=27|issue=2|pages=3–10}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

As a gateway to the [[Caribbean]], [[Hispaniola]] became a haven for [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]] during the early colonial period. The western part of the island was settled by French [[buccaneer]]s. Among them was Bertrand d'Ogeron, who succeeded in growing [[tobacco]]. He recruited many French colonial families from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. European nations were competing for control in the [[New World]], in the [[Caribbean]] as well as in [[North America]]. [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Imperial Spain|Spain]] settled their hostilities on the island, by way of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697, and divided Hispaniola between them.

===French rule (1625–1804)===
{{Further|Saint-Domingue}}

France received the western third and subsequently named it [[Saint-Domingue]], the French equivalent of ''[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]'', the Spanish colony of [[Hispaniola]] and the name of its patron saint, [[Saint Dominic]].<ref name=firstcolony>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm |title=Dominican Republic – The first colony |accessdate= 19 June 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

To develop it into sugarcane plantations, the French imported thousands of slaves from [[Africa]]. Sugar was a lucrative [[commodity crop]] throughout the 18th century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of [[New France|French Canada]], a vast territory, had numbered 65,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/encyclopedia/ImmigrationHistoryofCanada.htm |title=Immigration History of Canada |publisher=Faculty.marianopolis.edu |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> The whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of African slaves they had imported to work on their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Blacks outnumbered whites by about ten-to-one.

The French-enacted ''[[Code Noir]]'' ("Black Code"), prepared by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and ratified by [[Louis XIV]], had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms. Saint-Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years.<ref name="Farmer-LROB">{{cite web |author= Farmer, Paul | title=Who removed Aristide? |accessdate=19 February 2010 |date=15 April 2004 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608222428/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archivedate=6 June 2008}}</ref> Many slaves died from diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[typhoid fever]].<ref>{{Cite book |author = Kiple, Kenneth F. | title = The Caribbean Slave: A Biological History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=veMLoyrX0BEC&pg=&dq#v=onepage&q=&f | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | page = 145 | isbn = 0-521-52470-9 }}</ref> They had low [[birth rate]]s, and there is evidence that some women [[abortion|aborted]] foetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of slavery. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

As in its [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana colony]], the [[New France|French colonial]] government allowed some rights to [[free people of color]]: the [[mixed-race]] descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery. They established a separate [[social class]]. White French [[Creole peoples|Creole]] fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to [[France]] for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near [[Port-au-Prince]], and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property. Some became slave holders. The [[free people of color]] petitioned the [[New France|colonial]] government to expand their rights.

===Haitian Revolution (1791–1804)===
{{Main|Haitian Revolution}}
[[File:Frontispiece from the book Saint-Domingue, ou Histoire de Ses Révolutions. ca. 1815 (colorcopy).jpg|thumb|Burning of the town of [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap-Français]], {{circa|1815}}]]

Inspired by the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and principles of the [[rights of man]], [[free people of color]] and slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] and the [[French West Indies]] pressed for freedom and more [[civil rights]]. Most important was the revolution of the slaves in Saint-Domingue, starting in the northern plains in 1791, where Africans greatly outnumbered the whites.

In 1792, the [[French First Republic|French]] government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control. To build an alliance with the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' and slaves, the French commissioners [[Sonthonax]] and [[Polverel]] abolished slavery in the colony. Six months later, the [[National Convention]], led by [[Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], endorsed [[abolition of slavery timeline|abolition]] and extended it to all the French colonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/291/ |title=Decree of the National Convention of 4 February 1794, Abolishing Slavery in all the Colonies |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

Political leaders in the [[United States]], which was a new republic itself, reacted with ambivalence, at times providing aid to enable [[Planter (plantation owner)|planters]] to put down the revolt. Later in the revolution, the US provided support to black Haitian military forces, with the goal of reducing French influence in [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/HaitianRev |title=1784–1800 – The United States and the Haitian Revolution |publisher=History.state.gov |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

[[Toussaint Louverture]], a former slave and leader in the slave revolt, drove out the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] (from Santo Domingo) and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] invaders who threatened the colony. In the uncertain years of revolution, the United States played both sides off against each other, with its traders supplying both the French and the rebels.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/22/books/poles-in-haiti.html |title=Poles in Haiti |work = [[The New York Times]] |date=22 March 1987 |accessdate=24 July 2013 |author =Joseph, Raymond A.}}</ref> The struggle within Haiti between the [[free people of color]] led by [[André Rigaud]] and the black Haitians led by Louverture devolved into the [[War of the Knives]] in 1799 and 1800.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/history/revolution/revolution3.htm |title=The Haitian Revolution of 1791–1803 |first=Bob |last=Corbett |publisher=Webster University}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Smucker|first=Glenn R.|at=Toussaint Louverture|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/httoc.html|title=A Country Study: Haiti|editor=Richard A.

He was imprisoned at [[Fort de Joux]], where he died in 1803 of exposure and possibly [[tuberculosis]].<ref name = Farmer-LROB/>

The slaves, along with free ''gens de couleur'' and allies, continued their fight for independence. [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] defeated French troops at the [[Battle of Vertières]] on 18 November 1803, leading the first ever successful slave army revolution. In late 1803, France withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and Napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a [[North America]]n empire. With the war going badly, he sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the [[United States]], in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

In July 1825, [[Charles X|King Charles X]] of [[France]], during a period of "restoration" for the [[French monarchy|monarchy]], sent a [[French Navy|fleet]] to reconquer the island. Under pressure, [[Haiti indemnity controversy|President Boyer agreed to a treaty]] by which France formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million [[francs]] (reduced to 90 million in 1838). After losing the support of Haiti's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843. A long succession of [[coup]]s followed his departure to exile.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The enforced payment to France reduced Haiti's economy for years. Western nations did not give Haiti formal [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] recognition. Both of these problems kept the Haitian economy and society isolated.

Haiti is on the western part of [[Hispaniola]], the second largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]]. Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] (the latter shares a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} border with Haiti). Haiti at its closest point is about {{convert|45|nmi|km mi|0}} away from Cuba and comprises the ''horseshoe''-shape peninsula and because of this, it has a disproportionately long coastline and is ''second'' in length ({{convert|1771|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the Greater Antilles. Cuba has the longest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/today/placesinthenews/archive/2010arch/20100114_haiti.html |title=Geography: Haiti |accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/haiti/htland.htm |title=Geography: Haiti| accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref>

Haiti's terrain consists mainly of rugged mountains interspersed with small coastal plains and river valleys. The climate is tropical, with some variation depending on altitude. Haiti is the most mountainous nation in the Caribbean and its highest point is [[Pic la Selle]], at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0|}}.<ref name="NgCheong-Lum, Roseline 19"/>

The northern region consists of the ''[[Massif du Nord]]'' (Northern Massif) and the ''[[Plaine du Nord]]'' (Northern Plain). The ''Massif du Nord'' is an extension of the ''Cordillera Central'' in the Dominican Republic. It begins at Haiti's eastern border, north of the [[Guayamouc River]], and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula. The lowlands of the ''Plaine du Nord'' lie along the northern border with the Dominican Republic, between the ''Massif du Nord'' and the North Atlantic Ocean.

The central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges. The ''Plateau Central'' (Central Plateau) extends along both sides of the Guayamouc River, south of the ''Massif du Nord''. It runs from the southeast to the northwest. To the southwest of the ''Plateau Central'' are the ''Montagnes Noires'', whose most northwestern part merges with the ''Massif du Nord''. Its westernmost point is known as Cap Carcasse.

The southern region consists of the [[Plaine du Cul-de-Sac]] (the southeast) and the mountainous southern peninsula (also known as the [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|Tiburon Peninsula]]). The Plaine du Cul-de-Sac is a natural depression that harbors the country's saline lakes, such as [[Trou Caïman]] and Haiti's largest lake, [[Étang Saumatre]]. The [[Chaîne de la Selle]] mountain range – an extension of the southern mountain chain of the Dominican Republic (the Sierra de Baoruco) – extends from the Massif de la Selle in the east to the [[Massif de la Hotte]] in the west. This mountain range harbors [[Pic la Selle]], the highest point in Haiti at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elahmad.com/maps/qibla-english.htm?latitude=18.9712&longitude=-72.2845&t=h&zoom=9 |title=Map of Haiti |publisher=Elahmad.com |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2013}}

Haiti's most important valley in terms of crops is the Plaine de l'Artibonite, which is oriented south of the Montagnes Noires. This region supports the country's (also Hispaniola's) longest river, the [[Artibonite River|Riviere l'Artibonite]], which begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues most of its length through central Haiti and onward where it empties into the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]]. The eastern and central region of the island is a large elevated plateau.

Haiti also includes various offshore islands. The island of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] (Île de la Tortue) is located off the coast of northern Haiti. The [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissement]] of [[Gonâve Island|La Gonâve]] is located on the island of the same name, in the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]]. Gonâve Island is moderately populated by rural villagers. [[Île à Vache]] (Cow Island), a lush island with many beautiful sights, is located off the tip of southwestern Haiti. Also part of Haiti are the [[Cayemites]] and Île d' Anacaona.  [[Navassa Island|La Navasse]] located {{convert|40|nmi|mi km}} west of [[Jérémie]] on the south west [[peninsula]] of Haiti,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/haiti/rock.htm |title=Whose Rock Is It?

===Climate===
Haiti's climate is tropical with some variation depending on altitude. Port-au-Prince ranges in January from an average minimum of {{convert|23|°C|1}} to an average maximum of {{convert|31|°C|1}}; in July, from {{convert|25|–|35|°C|°F}}. The rainfall pattern is varied, with rain heavier in some of the lowlands and on the northern and eastern slopes of the mountains.

Port-au-Prince receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|1370|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. There are two rainy seasons, April–June and October–November. Haiti is subject to periodic droughts and floods, made more severe by deforestation. Hurricanes are also a menace.

===Environment===
{{Main|Environment of Haiti|Deforestation in Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti deforestation.jpg|thumb|300px|Haiti's border with the [[Dominican Republic]] in 2002 (right) shows the amount of deforestation on the Haitian side]]

The [[Erosion|soil erosion]] and [[deforestation]] have caused periodic and severe flooding in Haiti, as experienced, for example, on 17 September 2004. Earlier in May that year, floods had killed over 3,000 people on Haiti's southern border with the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/hurricane/2004-09-23-haiti-deforest_x.htm |title=Deforestation Exacerbates Haiti Floods |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=23 September 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

There has been little marine, coastal, and river basin management. Forest cover in the steep hills surrounds Haiti's river basin retains soil, which in turn retains water from rainfall, reducing river flood peaks and conserving flows in the dry season. Haiti's forests covered 60 percent of the country as recently as fifty years ago, but today less than one percent of Haiti remains forested.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reforestation|url=http://www.lambifund.org/programs_reforestation.shtml|website=The Lambi Fund of Haiti|publisher=The Lambi Fund of Haiti|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>

Deforestation has resulted in much of the soil being released from the upper catchments. Many of Haiti's rivers are now highly unstable, changing rapidly from destructive flooding to inadequate flows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitiregeneration.org/node/67|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303050815/http://www.haitiregeneration.org/node/67|archivedate=3 March 2011 |title=Environment and Natural Hazards &#124; The Haiti Regeneration Initiative |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= 3 March 2011 |accessdate= 11 January 2014}}</ref> Scientists at the [[The Earth Institute#Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)Earth Institute|Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)]]  and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] are working on the Haiti Regenerative Initiative an initiative aiming to reduce poverty and natural disaster vulnerability in Haiti through ecosystem restoration and sustainable resource management.

===Flora===
In 1925{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}, Haiti was lush, with 60% of its original forest covering the lands and mountainous regions. In 1988 only 2% percent of land had tree cover.  Haiti's residents have cut down forest cover for use as firewood, destroying soils and contributing to [[desertification]] and droughts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/53.htm |title=Forestry in Haiti |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Haiti}}
[[File:Haitians voting in the 2006 elections.jpeg|thumb|Voting in the 2006 elections in [[Port-au-Prince]] ]]

The government of Haiti is a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic, a multiparty system wherein the [[President of Haiti]] is head of state elected directly by popular [[elections in Haiti|elections]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1987 Constitution of the Republic of Haiti|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/constitutions/haiti/haiti1987.html|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=9 July 2011|location=ARTICLE 134|pages=ARTICLE 134}}</ref> The Prime Minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the President, chosen from the majority party in the National Assembly.

Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the [[National Assembly of Haiti]]. The government is organized [[unitary state|unitarily]], thus the central government ''delegates'' powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent. The current structure of Haiti's political system was set forth in the [[Constitution of Haiti]] on 29 March 1987.

Haitian politics have been contentious: since independence, Haiti has suffered 32 coups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1741707&ps=rs |title=Haiti Starts Over, Once Again |author=Michele Kelemen |publisher=Npr.org |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> Haiti is the only country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolution]], but a long history of oppression by dictators{{spaced ndash}}including [[François Duvalier]] and his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]{{spaced ndash}}has markedly affected the nation. France, the United States and other Western countries have repeatedly intervened in Haitian politics since the country's founding, sometimes at the request of one party or another. Along with international financial institutions, they have imposed large quantities of debt – so much that foreign debt payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending. They also enforced trade policies that have broken down the Haitian government's ability to protect the local economy, forcing greater dependence on imports and eroding economic self-sufficiency.<ref name="Bell">{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Beverly |date=2013 |title=Fault Lines: Views across Haiti's Divide |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=30–38 |isbn=978-0-8014-7769-0}}</ref>

According to a [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] report in 2006, there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty and Haiti ranked first of all countries surveyed for of levels of perceived domestic  corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transparency.ie/content/2006-corruption-perceptions-index-reinforces-link-between-poverty-and-corruption-and-shows-w |title=2006 Corruption Perceptions Index reinforces link between poverty and corruption |publisher=Transparency International |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=15 January 2009}}</ref>  The [[International Red Cross]] reports that seven out of ten Haitians live on less than US$2 a day, however, stated below "such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average Haitian and Haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily. The disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are; in the Haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question. For various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter. For some it is because "it's none of your business," for others, they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine2006_2/10-11.html |title=Hoping for change in Haiti's Cité-Soleil |publisher=International Red Cross |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>

Jean-Bertrand Aristide was initially denied access to Haiti by Haitian immigration authorities, despite issuing appeals for entrance to his supporters and international observers. The world's most prominent governments did not overtly oppose such appeals, nor did they support them; an unnamed analyst "close to the Haitian government" quoted in several media sources{{spaced ndash}} including ''[[The New York Times]]''{{spaced ndash}} is reported to have said: "Aristide could have 15 passports and he's still not going to come back to Haiti&nbsp;...

Conversely, according to the 2013 [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] ([[UNODC]]) report, murder rates in Haiti (10.2 per 100,000) are far ''below'' the regional average (26 per 100,000); less than ¼ that of Jamaica (39.3 per 100,000) and nearly ½ that of the Dominican Republic (22.1 per 100,000), making it among the safer countries in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2014/April/some-437000-people-murdered-worldwide-in-2012-according-to-new-unodc-study.html |title=Some 437,000 people murdered worldwide in 2012, according to new UNODC study |accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf |title=Global Study on Homicide |year=2013 |publisher=UNODC |accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref> In large part, this is due to the country's ability to fulfill a pledge by increasing its national police yearly by 50%, a four-year initiative that was started in 2012.

===Energy===
Haiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with [[Petrocaribe]] for much of its energy requirements. In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-foundation-haiti/programs/powering-haiti-clean-energy |title=Powering Haiti with Clean Energy}}</ref>

===Personal income===
[[File:CapHaitienMarche.jpg|thumb|300px|A market in [[Cap Haitien]] ]]

''[[The World Factbook]]'' reports a shortage of skilled labor, widespread unemployment and underemployment, saying "more than two-thirds of the labor force do not have formal jobs."   It is also often stated that three-quarters of the population lives on US$2 or less per day.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Such statistical estimations could be viewed with skepticism because the average Haitian and Haitian family spends more than that daily.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

''[[The World Factbook]]'' also states that "remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling one-fifth (20%) of GDP and representing more than five times the earnings from exports in 2012".<ref>{{cite web |title=The World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html |work=www.cia.gov |accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref> This implies that [[remittance]]s are the life-blood of the Haitian economy.

More than 200,000 people have climbed out of poverty. There is a growing gap between Port-au-Prince and the rest of the country. More than 80% of those living in extreme poverty do so in rural areas. Families in the north and southwest of the country work hard to grow food, but they fail to earn enough. Extreme climatic events, lack of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds, and limited market access are just some of the impediments they face.<ref name="Worldbank.org"/>

Haiti's economy was severely impacted by the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] which occurred on 12 January 2010, killing over 300,000 and displacing 1.5 million residents.<ref name = "CIA" >[http://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html CIA World Factbook], Haiti entry, accessed 1 June 2012.</ref>

The middle and upper classes live in Suburbs, or in the central part of the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like miniature fortresses, located behind walls embedded with metal spikes, barbed wire, broken glass, and sometimes all three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators, because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.<ref name=c151222/>

The [[Haitian gourde]] (HTG) is the national currency. The "[[Haitian gourde|Haitian dollar]]" equates to 5 gourdes (''goud''), which is a fixed exchange rate that exists in concept ''only,'' but are commonly used as informal prices.

The vast majority of the business sector and individuals in Haiti will also accept US dollars, though at the outdoor markets gourdes may be preferred. Locals may refer to the USD as "dollar américain" (''dola ameriken'') or "dollar US" (pronounced ''oos'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haitihub.com/download/Money-Matters-in-Haiti.pdf |title=All About Money: Gourdes, Dollars and Sense for Work and Life in Haiti|publisher=haitihub.com |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>

The park is part of a "master plan" for Haiti's North and North-East departments, including the expansion of the [[Cap-Haitien International Airport]] to accommodate large international flights, the construction of an international Seaport in [[Fort-Liberté]] and the opening of the $50 million Roi Henri Christophe Campus of a new university in Limonade (near Cap-Haitien) on 12 January 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/haiti-clinton-caracol-idUSL1E8LM3BF20121022 |title=Clintons preside at star-studded opening of Haitian industrial park |publisher=Reuters.com |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti rail map 1925.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rail map as of 1925]]

Haiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other. The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of [[Montrouis]] and [[Gonaïves]], before reaching its terminus at the northern port [[Cap-Haïtien]]. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with [[Les Cayes]] via [[Léogâne]] and [[Petit-Goâve]].

According to the Washington Post, "Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday [23 January 2010] that they assessed the damage from the [12 January] quake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and found that many of the roads aren't any worse than they were before because they've always been in poor condition."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012302113.html |title=Haiti's Bad Roads not Damaged by Quake, Army Engineers Say |author=Hedgpeth, Dana |publisher=Washington Post |date=23 January 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

The port at Port-au-Prince, [[Port international de Port-au-Prince]],  has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country. The port's facilities include [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, large [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s, and [[warehouse]]s, but these facilities are not in good condition. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees. The port of [[Saint-Marc]] is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and [[Traffic congestion|congested]] Port-au-Prince, as well as its central location relative to numerous Haitian cities.

During the 2010 earthquake, the Port-au-Prince port suffered widespread damage, impeding aid to the victims. The main pier caved in and fell into the water. One of the main cranes also collapsed in the water. Port access roads were severely damaged as well.

In the past, Haiti used rail transport, however the rail infrastructure was poorly maintained when in use and cost of rehabilitation is beyond the means of the Haitian economy.

===Airports===
{{Main|List of airports in Haiti}}

[[Toussaint Louverture International Airport]] is located {{convert|10|km}} North/North East of Port-au-Prince. It has Haiti's main [[jetway]], and along with [[Hugo Chavez International Airport]] located near Cap-Haïtien, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. To travel on from the international airport at Port-au-Prince to other Haitian cities requires boarding a smaller plane. Cities such as Jacmel, Jérémie, Les Cayes, and Port-de-Paix have airports that are accessible by smaller aircraft. Companies that fly to these airports include: [[Caribintair]], [[Sunrise Airways]] and [[Tortug' Air]].

In 2013, plans for the development of an international airport on Île-à-Vache were introduced by the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-9270-haiti-tourism-official-launch-of-project-tourist-destination-ile-a-vache.html|title=Haiti – Tourism : Official launch of project "Tourist destination Ile-à-Vache" – HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7|work=HaitiLibre.com}}</ref>

===Bus service===
[[File:Tap tap public transportation Haiti.jpg|thumb|300px|A "Tap tap" bus in [[Port-Salut]] ]]

[[Tap tap]] buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up trucks that serve as share taxis. The "tap tap" name comes from the sound of passengers tapping on the metal bus body to indicate they want off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jansochor.com/photo-blog.aspx?id=tap-tap-haiti |title=Tap-Tap |accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref> These vehicles for hire are often privately owned and extensively decorated. They follow fixed routes, do not leave until filled with passengers, and riders can usually disembark at any point. The decorations are a typically Haitian form of art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/news/doc/un-volunteer-takes-part.html |title=UN Volunteer takes part in art exhibition in Germany |accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>

In Haiti, communications include the radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Haiti ranked last among North American countries in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI){{snd}} an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Haiti ranked number 143 out of 148 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 141 in 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2014/GITR_OverallRanking_2014.pdf | title=NRI Overall Ranking 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Haiti}}

Haiti faces key challenges in the [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]
sector:
Notably, access to public services is very low, their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions. Foreign and Haitian [[NGO]]s play an important role in the sector, especially in rural and urban slum areas.

Haitian art is [[Haitian art|distinctive]], particularly through its paintings and sculptures, known for its various artistic expressions.<ref name="Yurnet-Thomas" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalfaithinaction.org/haiti-culture-and-sports/ |title=Haiti – Culture And Sports |author=Onofre, Alejandro Guevara |accessdate=2 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/haiti/ |title=In Haiti, Art Remains a Solid Cornerstone |author=Legro, Tom |date=11 January 2011}}</ref> Brilliant colors, [[Naïve art|naïve]] perspectives, and sly humor characterize [[Haitian art]]. Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, delectable foods, lush landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods. Artists frequently paint in fables. People are disguised as animals and animals are transformed into people.

As a result of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society. For example, a rooster often represents Aristide and the red and blue colors of the Haitian flag often represent his Lavalas party. Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Haitian music combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled on this Caribbean island.

===Literature===
{{Main|Haitian literature}}

Dating back to the days of its independence, Haiti has always been a literary nation that has produced a number of poetry and plays of international reputation. Despite attempts to write in [[Haitian Creole]] dating back to the eighteenth century due to its unofficial status, French has always been the exclusive literary language of Haiti. With the recognition of Creole as an official language, more and more novels, poems, and plays are being written in Creole. In 1975, the first novel written entirely in Haitian Creole was published entitled ''Dezafi'' written by [[Franketienne]] describing a poetic picture of Haitian life.<ref name="Haitians"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitisupportgroup.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=343:haitian-literature-an-introduction&catid=95:literature&Itemid=239 |title=

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Haitian cuisine}}
[[File:Ayiti&DR 2007 085.jpg|thumb|300px|A table set with Haitian cuisine]]

[[Haitian cuisine]] originates from several culinary styles from the various historical ethnic groups that populated the western portion of the island of Hispaniola. Haitian cuisine is similar to the rest of the [[Latin-America|Latin-Caribbean]] (the French and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Antilles), however it differs in several ways from its regional counterparts. While the cuisine is unpretentious and simple, the flavors are bold and spicy that demonstrate a primary influence of African culinary aesthetic, paired with a very French sophistication with notable derivatives coming from native [[Taíno people|Taíno]] and [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] techniques. Though similar to other cooking styles in the region, it carries a uniqueness native to the country, many visitors to the island have mixed reviews of Haitian cuisine. Haitians often use [[capsicum|peppers]] and other strong flavorings.<ref name=b1/>

Dishes tend to be seasoned liberally. Consequently Haitian cuisine is often moderately [[spicy]]. In the country, however, several foreign cuisines have been introduced. These include [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]] from [[Arab]] migration to Haiti. Rice and beans in several differing ways are eaten throughout the country regardless of location, becoming a sort of national dish. They form the [[staple diet]], which consists of a lot of [[starch]] and is high in [[carbohydrate]]s. Rural areas, with better access to agricultural products, have a larger variety of choices.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

One such dish is mais moulu (''mayi moulen''), which is comparable to [[grits]] that can be eaten with sauce pois (''sòs pwa''), a [[bean sauce]] made from one of many types of beans such as [[Kidney bean|kidney]], [[pinto bean|pinto]], [[chickpea]]s, or [[pigeon pea]]s (known in some countries as gandules). Mais moulin can be eaten with fish (often [[Lutjanus campechanus|red snapper]]), or alone depending on personal preference. Some of the many plants used in Haitian dishes include tomato, [[oregano]], [[cabbage]], [[avocado]], [[bell pepper]]s. A popular food is banane pesée (''ban-nan'n peze''), flattened [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] slices fried in [[cooking oil]] (known as [[tostones]] in the Spanish speaking [[Latin America]]n countries). It is eaten both as a [[snack]] and as part of a meal is, often eaten with ''tassot'' and ''griot'' ([[Deep frying|deep-fried]] goat and pork).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitian-recipes.com/recipes/103_griot-fried-pork.html|title=Haitian Recipes ::|work=haitian-recipes.com}}</ref>

Traditionally, the food that Haitians eat on the independence day (1 January) is [[soup joumou]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creolemadeeasy.com/cmejom/free/recipes/127-pumpkin-soup-soup-joumou.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521034622/http://www.creolemadeeasy.com/cmejom/free/recipes/127-pumpkin-soup-soup-joumou.html|archivedate=2014-05-21|title=Pumpkin Soup – Soup Joumou |publisher=Creolemadeeasy.com |accessdate= 22 May 2014}}</ref>
