'''Algeria''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|الجزائر}}}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Jazā'ir}}''; {{lang-ber|ⵍⵣⵣⴰⵢⴻⵔ}} ''Dzayer''), officially the '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria''', is a [[sovereign state]] in [[North Africa]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]]. Its capital and most populous city is [[Algiers]], located in the country's far north. With an area of {{convert|2381741|km2|sqmi|0}}, Algeria is the [[list of countries and dependencies by area|tenth-largest country in the world]], and the largest in Africa and the [[Arab world]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|title=Country Comparison: Area |publisher=CIA World Factbook |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> Algeria is bordered to the northeast by [[Tunisia]], to the east by [[Libya]], to the west by [[Morocco]], to the southwest by [[Western Sahara]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Mali]], to the southeast by [[Niger]], and to the north by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The country is a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]] consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes. [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] has been [[President of Algeria|President]] since 1999.

Ancient Algeria has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient [[Numidia]]ns, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Punic|Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Umayyad]]s, [[Abbasid]]s, [[Idrisid]], [[Aghlabid]], [[Rustamid]], [[Fatimid]]s, [[Zirid]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]], [[Almohads]], [[Ottomans]] and the [[French Algeria|French colonial empire]]. [[Berbers]] are generally considered to be the indigenous inhabitants of Algeria. Following the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Arab conquest of North Africa]], most indigenous inhabitants were [[Arabization|Arabised]]; thus, although most Algerians are Berber in origin, most identify with [[Arab]] identity . En masse, Algerians are a mix of Berbers with some additional elements such as  [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and Andalusians (people from southern Spain who migrated after the [[reconquista]]).

Algeria is a [[regional power|regional]] and [[middle power]]. The North African country supplies large amounts of [[natural gas]] to Europe, and energy exports are the backbone of the economy. According to [[OPEC]] Algeria has the [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|17th largest]] oil reserves in the world and the second largest in [[Africa]], while it has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|9th largest reserves]] of [[natural gas]]. [[Sonatrach]], the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa. Algeria has one of the largest militaries in Africa and the largest defence budget on the continent; most of Algeria's weapons are imported from [[Russia]], with whom they are a close ally.<ref name="AlgeriaSpending">{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/03/11/Algerias-military-goes-on-an-arms-spree/UPI-89581363031700/ |title=Algeria buying military equipment |publisher=UPI.com |accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb228/index.htm |title=The Nuclear Vault: The Algerian Nuclear Problem |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref> Algeria is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], [[OPEC]], the [[United Nations]] and is the founding member of the [[Arab Maghreb Union|Maghreb Union]].

==Etymology==
The country's name derives from the city of [[Algiers]]. The city's name in turn derives from the Arabic ''al-Jazā'ir'' (الجزائر, "The Islands"),<ref>{{OEtymD|algeria}}</ref> a truncated form of the older ''Jazā'ir Banī Mazghanna'' (جزائر بني مزغنة, "Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe"),<ref name=idrisi>al-Idrisi, Muhammad (12th century) ''Nuzhat al-Mushtaq''</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2013}}<ref name=khaldun>{{cite book|last=Abderahman|first=Abderrahman|title=History of Ibn Khaldun&nbsp;– Volume 6|year=1377}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2013}} employed by medieval geographers such as [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Algeria}}

===Ancient history===
{{main|Prehistoric North Africa|North Africa during Antiquity}}
In the region of Ain Hanech ([[Saïda Province]]), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.ulpgc.es/tarha/Ain_Hanech.pdf |title=The Site of Ain Hanech Revisited: New Investigations at this Lower Pleistocene Site in Northern Algeria |publisher=Journal of Archaeological Science |author1=Sahnouni, Mohamed  |author2=de Heinzelin, Jean |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/ain-hanech.html |title=Research at Ain Hanech, Algeria |publisher=Stoneageinstitute.org |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>

Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called [[Aterian]] (after the archeological site of [[Bir el Ater]], south of [[Tebessa]]).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002397 |title=Genomic Ancestry of North Africans Supports Back-to-Africa Migrations |publisher=PLOS Genetics |date=12 January 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref> or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.

The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called [[Berber people|Berbers]], who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berbers|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1997|chapter=Berbers in Antiquity|isbn=978-0-631-20767-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8Zcz91t29ukC|author1=Brett, Michael |author2=Fentress, Elizabeth }}</ref>

From their principal center of power at [[Carthage]], the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

[[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Numidia along with Egypt, Rome, and Carthage 200 BCE]]

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].

In 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Massinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was the bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day Algeria), located in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. The Germanic [[Vandals]] of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.<ref name="vandaf">{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Averil|last2=Ward-Perkins|first2=Bryan|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf8mrHjfZRoC&pg=RA1-PA124|volume=14|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32591-2|pages=124–126|chapter=Vandal Africa, 429–533}}</ref> They did not make any significant settlement on the land, as they were harassed by local tribes, in fact by the time the Byzantines arrived Lepcis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous [[Amazigh|Laguatan]] who had been busy facilitating an [[Amazigh]] political, military and cultural revival.<ref name="vandaf"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mattingly|first1=D.J.|title=The Laguatan: A Libyan Tribal Confederation in the late Roman Empire.|journal=Libyan Studies|date=1983|volume=14}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
{{main|Medieval Muslim Algeria}}
[[File:Mansourah-1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Mansourah mosque, Tlemcen]]
[[File:FatimidCaliphate969.png|thumbnail|Fatimid Caliphate at its greatest extent.]]
After negligible resistance from the locals, the Arabs conquered Algeria in the mid-7th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the new faith. After the fall of the [[Umayyad]] Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Aghlabids]], [[Almohads]], [[Abdalwadid]], [[Zirids]], [[Rustamids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]] and the [[Fatimids]].

During the Middle Ages, North Africa was home to many great Scholars, Saints, and Sovereigns including [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah Ibn Quraysh]] the first grammarian to suggest the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family, the great Sufi masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], as well as the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min|Abd Al Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yāghmūrasen]]. It was during this time period that the [[Fatimids]] or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb. These "Fatimids" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz, and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, primarily made of [[Arabs]] and [[levant]]ians extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the [[Arab]] [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|Tāghribāt]]. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Khālīfā Al-Zānatī]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes however remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location, and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]], and [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara – Les Almoravides (1056–1147) |publisher=Qantara-med.org |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people|Amazighs]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], Houaras, [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], Kutama, Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR2|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane| trans_title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |page=XV|author =Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}</ref>

Several [[Berber people|Amazigh]] dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. [[Ibn Khaldun]] provides a table summarizing the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region, the Zirid, [[Banu Ifran]], [[Maghrawa]], [[Almoravid]], [[Hammadid]], [[Almohad]], [[Merinid]], Abdalwadid, [[Wattasid]], [[Meknassa]] and [[Hafsid]] dynasties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR115|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane |trans_title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |pages=X |author =Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}</ref>

In the early 16th century, Spain constructed fortified outposts ([[presidio]]s) on or near the Algerian coast. Spain took control of few coastal towns like [[Mers el Kebir]] in 1505; [[Oran]] in 1509; and [[Tlemcen]], [[Mostaganem]], and [[Ténès]], in 1510. In the same year, few merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.<ref>{{cite web|title=European Offensive|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/14.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}</ref>

===Arabization===
{{Main|Banu Hilal}}There reigned in [[Ifriqiya]], current Tunisia, a [[Berbers|Berber]] family, [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]], somehow recognizing the suzerainty of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph of [[Cairo]]. Probably in 1048, the Zirid ruler or viceroy, el-Mu'izz, decided to end this suzerainty. The [[Fatimid]] state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition; The Viceroy, el-Mu'izz, also found another means of revenge.

Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulent influence, both [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier devised to relinquish control of the [[Maghreb]] and obtained the agreement of his sovereign. This not only prompted the Bedouins to leave, but the [[Fatimid]]treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance.

Whole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gabès Governorate|Gabe]]s region. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but each meeting, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and [[Arabs]] remained masters of the field.

The flood was still rising and in 1057, the [[Arabs]] spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they gradually choked [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]], as they had done Kairouan few decades ago. From there, they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains, some were forcibly taken by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century. We can say that in the 13th century there were in all of [[North Africa]], with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely [[Berbers|Berber]].

The region of Algeria was partially ruled by [[Ottomans]] for three centuries from 1516 to 1830. In 1516 the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spaniards]] but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the ''Bani Ziyad'' dynasty, to flee.<ref>[[Hayreddin Barbarossa#Rulers of Algiers]]</ref> When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).<ref name="csa16" />

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.<ref name="csa16" />

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42.<ref name="Davis" />

In 1671, the [[taifa]] rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of [[dey]]. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty nobles. It was at first dominated by the ''[[ojaq]]''; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role, although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="csa16" />

The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups, and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of Ottomon government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie]].<ref name="csa16">{{cite web|title=Algeria&nbsp;– Ottoman Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}</ref>

Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the [[First Barbary War|First]] (1801–1805) and [[Second Barbary War]]s (1815).

From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and ''département'' of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[immigrants]], who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.'' Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people immigrated to Algeria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Randell|first=Keith|title=France: Monarchy, Republic and Empire, 1814–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvyGHAAACAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|isbn=978-0-340-51805-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2013}} These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.<ref>{{cite book |author =Horne, Alistair |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6 |page=32}}</ref> Many Europeans settled in [[Oran]] and [[Algiers]], and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.<ref>Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002).

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harkis]] and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=French 'Reparation' for Algerians | date=6 December 2007}}</ref> The FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals.

===Independence===
{{main|History of Algeria (1962–99)}}
[[File:Houari Boumediene's Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Houari Boumediene]]]]
Algeria's first president was the  Front de Libération Nationale ([[FLN (Algeria)|FLN]]) leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was [[1965 Algerian coup d'état|overthrown in 1965]] by [[Houari Boumediene]], his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]; Boumédienne continued this trend. But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

In the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.<ref name="faco" />

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.<ref name="faco" />

===Civil War and aftermath===
{{main|Algerian Civil War}}

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War|civilian massacres]].<ref>"[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html 98 Die in One of Algerian Civil War's Worst Massacres ]". ''The New York Times''. 30 August 1997.</ref> At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding [[Air France Flight 8969]], a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.<ref name="faco" />

Algeria held [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups<ref>{{cite web| url = http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria#.Ut_5Aig4m2w |title = Freedom in the World 2013: Algeria|publisher = Freedom House| author = "Freedom House"}}</ref> which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a 'Civil Concord' initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armée, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.<ref name="faco" />

[[File:A Market in Algeria.jpg|thumb|Algeria is more stable than other North African countries]]
Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.<ref name="faco" />

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.<ref name="faco" />

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old [[state of emergency]].<ref>{{cite news| url = http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration?_s=PM:WORLD | title = Algeria Officially Lifts State of Emergency |publisher=CNN |date=24 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110301134330/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration?_s=PM:WORLD| archivedate= 1 March 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies.<ref name="aaeo" /> In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.<ref name="faco">{{cite web|title=Country Profile: Algeria |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/algeria/?profile=all |publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213054455/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/algeria/?profile=all |archivedate=13 December 2010 }}</ref> However, elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.

Algeria is the largest country in Africa, the [[Arab world]], and the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the [[Sahara]]. To the north, the [[Tell Atlas]] form with the [[Saharan Atlas]], further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of [[Aures]] and [[Tebessa|Nememcha]] occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is [[Mount Tahat]] ({{formatnum: 3003}} m).
[[File:Algeria relief.png|thumb|The [[Sahara]], the [[Ahaggar Mountains|Ahaggar]] and the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas mountains]] compose the Algerian relief]]
Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[37th parallel north|37°N]] (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape ending with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.<ref name=LOC>{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Helen Chapin|title=Algeria : a country study|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html|publisher=United States Library of Congress|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref>

The [[Ahaggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers, and just west of [[Tamanghasset]]. Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.<ref name=LOC />

In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

The highest official temperature was {{convert|50.6|°C|°F}} at In Salah.<ref>{{cite web|title=Extreme Weather&nbsp;– A Guide and Record Book|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|publisher=W.W.

Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.

===Fauna and flora===
{{Main|Wildlife of Algeria}}
[[File:Cèdre du Chélia 13 (Algeria).jpg|thumb|left|[[Cedrus]] of Chélia in the [[Aures]]]]
The varied vegetation of Algeria includes [[coastal]], [[mountainous]] and grassy [[desert]]-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization. The most commonly seen animals include the wild [[boar]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[gazelle]]s, although it is not uncommon to spot [[fennecs]] (foxes), and [[jerboas]]. Algeria also has a small [[African leopard]] and [[Saharan cheetah]] population, but these are seldom seen. A species of deer, the [[Barbary stag]], inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas.

A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. [[Barbary macaque]]s are the sole native monkey. Snakes, [[monitor lizard]]s, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of [[rodent]]s throughout the [[semi arid]] regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, including the [[Barbary lion]]s, [[Atlas bear]]s and [[West African crocodile|crocodile]]s.<ref>"[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014734 Crocodiles in the Sahara Desert: An Update of Distribution, Habitats and Population Status for Conservation Planning in Mauritania]". ''[[PLOS ONE]]''. 25 February 2011.</ref>

In the north, some of the native flora includes [[Macchia]] scrub, [[olive trees]], [[oak]]s, [[cedrus|cedars]] and other [[conifers]]. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ([[Aleppo pine]], [[juniper]], and [[evergreen oak]]) and some deciduous trees. [[Ficus|Fig]], [[eucalyptus]], [[agave]], and various [[palm trees]] grow in the warmer areas. The [[grape vine]] is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. [[Acacias]] with wild [[olives]] are the predominant flora in the remainder of the [[Sahara]].

[[Camel]]s are used extensively; the desert also abounds with venomous and nonvenomous snakes, [[scorpion]]s, and numerous insects.

Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military "décideurs", known as "le pouvoir" ("the power"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be [[Mohamed Mediène]], head of the military intelligence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Still waiting for real democracy|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21554565|publisher=The Economist|date=12 May 2012}}</ref> In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired. After the death of General [[Larbi Belkheir]], Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at [[Sonatrach]], and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.<ref>{{cite news|title=The president and the police|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15612455|publisher=The Economist|date=4 May 2010}}</ref>

The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm |title= Algeria Deputies Scrap Term Limit |publisher=BBC News |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081114015503/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm| archivedate= 14 November 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Algeria has universal [[suffrage]] at 18 years of age.<ref name="AlgeriaFactbook"/> The President is the head of the [[Algerian Army|army]], the [[Council of Ministers of Algeria|Council of Ministers]] and the [[High Security Council]].

Algeria is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.
Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daïra]]s'') and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital (political)|seat]], which is usually the largest city.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are<ref name="AlgeriaFactbook"/>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Algeria}}
[[File:Algeria Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|250px|Graphical depiction of the country's exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]
Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/CLASS.XLS |title=World Bank list of economies |date= January 2011 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=27 May 2011}}</ref> Algeria's currency is the [[Algerian dinar|dinar]] (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.<ref name="AlgeriaFactbook"/>

Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.<ref name="AlgeriaFactbook"/> The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.<ref name=aaeo/>

A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past 5 years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.<ref name=aaeo/>

[[File:Theatre d'oran.jpg|thumb|left|The port city of Oran]]
The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand. If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%. Growth of 3% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013. The rate of inflation was 4% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP. The current-account surplus is estimated at 9.3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$182 billion.<ref name=aaeo/> Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.<ref name="MFW4A">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/algeria/algeria-financial-sector-profile.html |title=Algeria: Financial Sector Profile |publisher=Making Finance Work for Africa |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref>

Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in [[foreign currency reserves]] and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's [[List of countries by external debt|external debt]] is extremely low at about 2% of GDP.<ref name="AlgeriaFactbook"/> The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.<ref name=imfart4/>

===Hydrocarbons===

[[File:Algeria pipelines map.jpg|thumb|left|Pipelines across Algeria]]
Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an [[OPEC]] member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe.<ref name=opb15>{{cite web|title=OPEC Bulletin 8-9/12|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/flipbook/OB08092012/OB08092012/assets/basic-html/page17.html|page=15}}</ref> Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|10th-largest reserves of natural gas]] in the world and is the [[List of countries by natural gas exports|sixth-largest gas exporter]]. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had {{convert|160|Tcuft}} of proven [[natural gas reserves|natural-gas reserves]].<ref name="ciawfb">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html|title=Country Comparison: Natural Gas – Proved Reserves|publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> It also ranks [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|16th in oil reserves]].<ref name="AlgeriaFactbook"/>

Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.<ref name=imfart4/>

Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards.<ref name=aaeo/> Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011, against 48% in 1962,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa-algerie.com/actualite/item/622-le-temps-des-crapules |title=Le temps des crapules&nbsp;– Tout sur l'Algérie |publisher=Tsa-algerie.com |date=27 May 2013 |author =Benchicou, Mohamed |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311022328/http://www.tsa-algerie.com/actualite/item/622-le-temps-des-crapules |archivedate=11 March 2014 }}</ref> and 70% of budgetary receipts, or USD 71.4 billion.<ref name=aaeo/>

The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.

There are several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in Algeria<ref>{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> including [[Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad]], the first capital of the [[Hammadid]] empire; [[Tipasa]], a Phoenician and later Roman town; and [[Djémila]] and [[Timgad]], both [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins; [[M'Zab Valley]], a limestone valley containing a large urbanized [[oasis]]; also the [[Casbah]] of Algiers is an important citadel. The only natural [[World Heritage Sites]] is the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], a mountain range.

[[File:Autoroute est ouest ghomri2.JPG|thumb|The main highway connecting the Moroccan to the Tunisian border, was a part of the [[Cairo–Dakar Highway]] project]]
The Algerian road network is the densest in Africa; its length is estimated at 180,000&nbsp;km of highways, with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85%. This network will be complemented by the [[Algeria East–West Highway|East-West Highway]], a major infrastructure project currently under construction. It is a 3-way, 1,216&nbsp;km long highway, linking [[Annaba]] in the extreme east to the [[Tlemcen]] in the far west. Algeria is also crossed by the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]], which is now completely paved. This road is supported by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed: Algeria, [[Mali]], Niger, [[Nigeria]], Chad and [[Tunisia]].

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Algeria}}
There is a substantial increase in the amount of drinking water supplied from reservoirs, long-distance water transfers and [[desalination]] at a low price to consumers, thanks to the country's substantial oil and gas revenues. In 2011 the capital Algiers transformed its intermittent [[water supply]] into a to continuous one, along with considerable improvements in [[wastewater treatment]]. However, there is still poor service quality in many cities outside Algiers with 78% of urban residents suffering from intermittent water supply. Another challenge is the pollution of water resources.

[[File:Bensari2.jpg|thumb|Algerian musicians in Tlemcen. Painting by [[Bachir Yellès]]]]

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic, [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Kateb Yacine]] and [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of [[Amnesty International]], and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tahar Djaout |publisher=French Publishers' Agency |url=http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&pid=517 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref>

The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

Contemporary [[Algerian cinema]] is various in terms of genre, exploring a wider range of themes and issues. There has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war of independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians.<ref>{{cite web |title=Short guide to contemporary Algerian cinema |publisher=Mapping Contemporary Cinema |url=http://www.mcc.sllf.qmul.ac.uk/?p=550}}</ref>

===Art===
[[File:Portrait-racim.jpg|thumb|Mohammed Racim was a Painter and founder of the Algerian school of miniature painting]]
Algerian painters, like [[:fr:Mohamed Racim|Mohamed Racim]] or Baya, attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonization, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, [[Mohamed Temam]], [[Abdelkhader Houamel]] have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of [[M'hamed Issiakhem]], [[Mohammed Khadda]] and [[Bachir Yelles]], appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations. [[Mohammed Khadda]]<ref name=art>{{cite web|url=http://www.khadda.com/ |title=Mohammed Khadda |publisher=Khadda.com |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> and [[M'hamed Issiakhem]] have been notable in recent years.<ref name=art/>

===Literature===
{{Main|Algerian literature|List of Algerian writers}}

The historic roots of Algerian literature goes back to the [[Numidia]]n era, when [[Apuleius]] wrote ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. This period had also known [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]], among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionized the Arab world literature, with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]], [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]], who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria, and many others.

[[Albert Camus]] was an Algerian-born French Pied-Noir author. In 1957 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]].

{{double image|right|Lucius Apuleius Platonicus, from 'Crabbes Historical Dictionary', published in 1825 (C19).jpg|120|Kateb Yacine Nedjma authograph.jpg|120|[[Apuleius]]|[[Kateb Yacine]]}}

Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.

As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the ''Algerian trilogy'' of [[Mohammed Dib]], or even ''Nedjma'' of [[Kateb Yacine]] novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Malek Bennabi]], [[Malek Haddad]], [[Moufdi Zakaria]], [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis]], Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa, [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Assia Djebar]].

In the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are [[Rachid Boudjedra]], [[Rachid Mimouni]], [[Leila Sebbar]], [[Tahar Djaout]] and [[Tahir Wattar]].

Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, ''the swallows of Kabul'' and ''the attack'' of [[Yasmina Khadra]], ''the oath of barbarians'' of [[Boualem Sansal]], ''memory of the flesh'' of [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] and the last novel by Assia Djebar ''nowhere in my father's House''.

==Health==
{{Main|Health in Algeria}}
In 2002, Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1.13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to "improved water sources" was limited to 92% of the population in urban areas and 80% of the population in rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to "improved sanitation". According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of "reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015". Given Algeria's young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies – Algeria |format=PDF }}</ref>
