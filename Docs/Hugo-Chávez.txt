'''Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías''' ({{IPA-es|ˈuɣo rafaˈel ˈtʃaβes ˈfɾi.as}}; 28 July 1954&nbsp;– 5 March 2013), commonly known as '''Hugo Chávez''', was a  [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] politician who served as the [[List of Presidents of Venezuela|64th President of Venezuela]] from 1999 to 2013. He was also leader of the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV), which he led until 2012.

Born into a working-class family in [[Sabaneta, Barinas]], Chávez became a career military officer, and after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the [[Punto Fijo Pact]],<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Unraveling of Representative Democracy in Venezuela|last = McCoy|first = Jennifer L|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 2006|isbn = 9780801884283|location = Baltimore, Maryland|page = 310|last2 = Myers|first2 = David J.|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rtJVhJZF6WgC }}</ref> he founded the clandestine [[Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200]] (MBR-200) in the early 1980s.

Following the adoption of a new [[1999 Venezuelan Constitution|constitution in 1999]], Chávez focused on enacting social reforms as part of the [[Bolivarian Revolution]], which is a type of socialist revolution. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government [[nationalized]] key industries, created participatory democratic [[Venezuelan Communal Councils|Communal Councils]], and implemented social programs known as the [[Bolivarian Missions]] to expand access to food, housing, healthcare, and education.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-vote-puts-chavismo-critical-test-172039207.html | title=Venezuela vote puts 'Chavismo' to critical test | publisher=Yahoo | date=4 October 2012 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | first=Ian |last=James | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SKRPZ5mB | deadurl=no | archivedate=4 Sep 2014}}</ref><ref name="UN"/><ref name="ECLAC">{{cite book|title=Social Panorama of Latin America 2014|publisher=[[ECLAC]]|date=March 2014|pages=91–92|url=http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/37627/S1420728_en.pdf?sequence=4|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=ENedu>{{cite news|last=Montilla K.|first=Andrea|title=Hoy se inicia consulta nacional para el currículo educativo|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/sociedad/Hoy-consulta-nacional-curriculo-educativo_0_395960640.html|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=El Nacional|date=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="p. 54">{{cite web|title=Estrategia de Cooperación de OPS/OMS con Venezuela 2006–2008|url=http://www.ops-oms.org.ve/site/pwr/docs/CCS_MS_OPS-OMS.pdf|format=PDF|pages=[http://www.ops–oms.org.ve/site/pwr/docs/CCS_MS_OPS–OMS.pdf#page=54 p. 54]|publisher=[[Pan American Health Organization]]|date=June 2006|accessdate=31 December 2006|language=es |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024054050/http://www.ops-oms.org.ve/site/pwr/docs/CCS_MS_OPS-OMS.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-24}}</ref><ref name="Márquez">{{cite web|last=Márquez|first=Humberto|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SKR8WGpN|archivedate=4 Sep 2014|deadurl=no|title=Venezuela se declara libre de analfabetismo|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|url=http://ipsnoticias.net/nota.asp?idnews=35621|date=28 October 2005|accessdate=29 December 2006|language=es}}</ref><ref name="ECONread">{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/10766504 | title=Propaganda, not policy | date=28 February 2008 | accessdate=3 May 2014 | newspaper=The Economist | archivedate=4 Sep 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SKSyXjwa}}</ref><ref name=RevistedHouseholds>{{cite web|title="Illiteracy" Revisited: What Ortega and Rodríguez Read in the Household Survey|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/literacy_2008_05.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2014|last1=Weisbrot|last2=Rosnick|first1=Mark|first2=David|date=May 2008}}</ref><ref name="http">{{cite web|publisher=''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]''|title=Banco de la Vivienda transfirió 66 millardos para subsidios|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/11/10/eco_art_64504A.shtml|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=29 December 2006|language=es}}</ref>{{citekill}} With Venezuela receiving high oil profits in the mid-2000s,<ref name=FPpoverty>{{cite news|last1=Cristóbal Nagel|first1=Juan|title=Poverty Shoots Up in Venezuela|url=http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/04/poverty-shoots-up-in-venezuela/|accessdate=26 October 2015|agency=''[[Foreign Policy]]''|date=4 June 2014}}</ref> improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality, and quality of life occurred primarily between 2003 and 2007.<ref name="UN"/><ref name=FPpoverty/><ref name=IACHRRequests/> At the end of Chávez's presidency in the early 2010s, economic actions performed by his government during the preceding decade such as overspending<ref name=NPRdec2014>{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Robert|title=For Venezuela, Drop In Global Oil Prices Could Be Catastrophic|url=http://www.npr.org/2014/12/25/373128433/for-venezuela-drop-in-global-oil-prices-could-be-catastrophic|accessdate=4 January 2015|agency=NPR|date=25 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=ELPAISfeb2015>{{cite news|last1=Scharfenberg|first1=Ewald|title=Volver a ser pobre en Venezuela|url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/01/30/actualidad/1422646346_475356.html|accessdate=3 February 2015|agency=El Pais|date=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=FPmarch2013>{{cite news|last1=Corrales|first1=Javier|title=The House That Chavez Built|url=http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/07/the-house-that-chavez-built/|accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=7 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=CSM25march>{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=J.

Internationally, Chávez aligned himself with the [[Marxist–Leninist]] governments of [[Fidel Castro|Fidel]] and then [[Raúl Castro]] in Cuba, and the socialist governments of [[Evo Morales]] (Bolivia), [[Rafael Correa]] (Ecuador), and [[Daniel Ortega]] (Nicaragua). His presidency was seen as a part of the socialist "[[pink tide]]" sweeping Latin America. Chávez described his policies as [[anti-imperialist]], being a prominent adversary of the United States's [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]] as well as a vocal critic of US-supported [[neoliberalism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]].<ref>[[#Ell02|Ellner 2002]]</ref> He described himself as a [[Marxist]].<ref name="en.ria.ru">{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20100116/157569985.html |title=Hugo Chavez admits to being Marxist, just like Christ &#124; World &#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.ria.ru |date=2010-01-16 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref><ref name=BBCmarx>{{cite web|first=Yolanda |last=Valery |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2010/01/100123_chavez_marx_amab.shtml |title=BBC Mundo – América Latina – El marxismo según Chávez |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref><ref name=N24marx>{{cite web|first=Zurimar |last=Campos |url=http://www.noticias24.com/actualidad/noticia/139693/yo-asumo-el-cristianismo-como-el-marxismo/ |title=Chávez afirma que es "marxista" pero reconoce que todavía no ha leído "El Capital" en |publisher=Noticias24.com |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref><ref name=ABCmarx>{{cite web|first=Ludmila |last=Vinogradoff |url=http://www.abc.es/20100116/internacional-iberoamerica/chavez-declara-marxista-201001162021.html |title=Chavez se declara marxista – Internacional_Iberoamerica – Internacional |publisher=ABC.es |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref><ref name=CLARINmarx>{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2010/01/16/elmundo/i-02120928.htm |title=Chávez se declara marxista en un mensaje ante el Congreso |publisher=Edant.clarin.com |date=2010-01-16 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref> He supported [[Latin American integration|Latin American and Caribbean cooperation]] and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]], the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], the [[Bank of the South]], and the regional television network [[TeleSUR]]. Chavez's ideas, programs, and style form the basis of "[[Chavismo]]", a political ideology closely associated with [[Bolivarianism]] and [[socialism of the 21st Century]].

==Early life==
He was born on 28 July 1954 in his paternal grandmother Rosa Inéz Chávez's home, a modest three-room house located in the rural village [[Sabaneta, Barinas|Sabaneta]], [[Barinas State]]. The Chávez family were of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], [[Afro Venezuelans|Afro-Venezuelan]], and [[Spanish Venezuelan|Spanish]] descent.<ref>[[#Bea06|Beaumont 2006]].</ref> His parents, [[Hugo de los Reyes Chávez]], described as a proud [[COPEI]] member,<ref name=Carroll193>{{cite book|last1=Rory|first1=Carroll,|title=Comandante : Hugo Chavez's Venezuela|date=2014|publisher=New York|location=Penguin Books|isbn=0143124889|pages=193–194|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref> and [[Elena Frías de Chávez]], were schoolteachers who lived in the small village of Los Rastrojos.<ref name="Carroll193"/>

Hugo was born the second of seven children.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 7–8, 247.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 21.</ref> Hugo described his childhood as "poor... [but] very happy",<ref>Chávez quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 23, 25–26.</ref> though his childhood of supposed poverty has been disputed as Chávez possibly changed the story of his background for political reasons.<ref name=Carroll193/> Attending the Julián Pino Elementary School, Chávez was particularly interested in the 19th-century [[Federalism#Latin America|federalist]] general [[Ezequiel Zamora]], in whose army his own great-great-grandfather had served.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 11.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 23–24, 26–27.</ref> With no high school in their area, Hugo's parents sent Hugo and his older brother [[Adán Chávez|Adán]] to live with their grandmother Rosa, who lived in a [[lower middle class]] subsidized home provided by the government, where they attended [[Daniel Florence O'Leary|Daniel O'Leary]] High School in the mid-1960s.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 07, 24–26.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rory|first1=Carroll,|title=Comandante : Hugo Chavez's Venezuela|date=2014|publisher=New York|location=Penguin Books|isbn=0143124889|pages=86–90|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 08–09.</ref> Hugo later described his grandmother as being "a pure human being... pure love, pure kindness."<ref>Chávez quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 22, 25.</ref> She was a devout [[Roman Catholic]], and Hugo was an altar boy at a local church.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 24.</ref> His father, despite having the salary of a teacher, helped pay college for Chávez and his siblings.<ref name=Carroll193/>

===Military Academy: 1971–1975===
Aged seventeen, Chávez studied at the [[Venezuelan Academy of Military Sciences]] in Caracas, following a curriculum known as the [[Andrés Bello]] Plan, instituted by a group of progressive, nationalistic military officers. This new curriculum encouraged students to learn not only military routines and tactics but also a wide variety of other topics, and to do so civilian professors were brought in from other universities to give lectures to the military cadets.<ref name="Cannon 2009. p. 55">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 55.</ref><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 30.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 38.</ref>
[[File:El pueblo venezolano acompaña los restos de su presidente Hugo Chávez Frías en la Academia Militar.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Supporters of Hugo Chávez at his funeral at the Military academy of Venezuela.]]

Living in Caracas, he saw more of the endemic poverty faced by working class Venezuelans, and said that this experience only made him further committed to achieving social justice.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 49–50.</ref><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 31.</ref> He also began to get involved in activities outside of the military school, playing baseball and softball with the ''Criollitos de Venezuela'' team, progressing with them to the Venezuelan National Baseball Championships.

In Peru, Chávez heard the leftist president, General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] (1910–1977), speak, and inspired by Velasco's ideas that the military should act in the interests of the working classes when the ruling classes were perceived as corrupt,<ref name="Marcano and Tyszka. p. 36">[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 36.</ref> he "drank up the books [Velasco had written], even memorising some speeches almost completely."<ref>Chávez quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 40-47.</ref>

Befriending the son of Maximum Leader [[Omar Torrijos]], the leftist dictator of Panama, Chávez visited Panama, where he met with Torrijos, and was impressed with his land reform program that was designed to benefit the peasants.

{{Further2|[[Military career of Hugo Chávez]]}}
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=I think that from the time I left the academy I was oriented toward a revolutionary movement... The Hugo Chávez who entered there was a kid from the hills, a ''{{lang|es|Ilanero}}''{{sic}} with aspirations of playing professional baseball. Four years later, a second-lieutenant came out who had taken the revolutionary path.

Following his graduation, Chávez was stationed as a communications officer at a [[counterinsurgency]] unit in Barinas,<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 38.</ref> although the [[Marxist–Leninist]] insurgency which the army was sent to combat had already been eradicated from that state.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 57–59.</ref> At one point he found a stash of Marxist literature that apparently had belonged to insurgents many years before. He went on to read these books, which included titles by [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Mao Zedong]], but his favourite was a work entitled ''The Times of Ezequiel Zamora'', written about [[Ezequiel Zamora|the 19th-century federalist general]] whom Chávez had admired as a child.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 59.</ref> These books further convinced Chávez of the need for a leftist government in Venezuela: "By the time I was 21 or 22, I made myself a man of the left".<ref name="Chávez p. 59">Chávez, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 59.</ref>

In 1977, Chávez's unit was transferred to [[Anzoátegui]], where they were involved in battling the [[Red Flag Party]], a Marxist–[[Hoxhaist]] insurgency group.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 39.</ref> After intervening to prevent the beating of an alleged insurgent by other soldiers,<ref name="Marcano and Tyszka p.41">[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 41.</ref> Chávez began to have his doubts about the army and their methods in using torture.<ref name="Chávez p. 59"/> At the same time, he was becoming increasingly critical of the corruption in the army and in the civilian government, coming to believe Venezuela's poor were not benefiting from the oil wealth, and began to sympathize with the Red Flag Party and their cause and their violent methods.<ref>Chávez, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 60–64.</ref>

In 1977, he founded a revolutionary movement together with Luis R. Gonzalez an William Jimenez,  within the armed forces, in the hope that he could one day introduce a leftist government to Venezuela: the Venezuelan People's Liberation Army (''{{lang|es|Ejército de Liberación del Pueblo de Venezuela}}'', or ELPV), consisted of him and a handful of his fellow soldiers who had no immediate plans for direct action, though they knew they wanted a middle way between the right wing policies of the government and the far left position of the Red Flag.<ref name="Marcano and Tyszka p.41"/><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 63–65.</ref><ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 15.</ref> Nevertheless, hoping to gain an alliance with civilian leftist groups in Venezuela, Chávez set up clandestine meetings with various prominent Marxists, including Alfredo Maneiro (the founder of the [[Radical Cause]]) and [[Douglas Bravo]].<ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 54.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 65–77.</ref> At this time, Chávez married a working-class woman named Nancy Colmenares, with whom he had three children: Rosa Virginia (born September 1978), Maria Gabriela (born March 1980) and Hugo Rafael (born October 1983).<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 634.</ref>

==Later military career and the Bolivarian Revolutionary Army-200: 1982–1991==
[[File:MBR-200 logo.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Logo of MBR-200.]]
Five years after his creation of the ELPV, Chávez went on to form a new secretive cell within the military, the [[Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200|Bolivarian Revolutionary Army-200]] (EBR-200), later redesignated the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200).<ref name="Cannon 2009. p. 55"/><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 48–49, 56.</ref><ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 16.</ref> He was inspired by [[Ezequiel Zamora]] (1817–1860), [[Simón Bolívar]] (1783–1830) and [[Simón Rodríguez]] (1769–1854), who became known as the "three roots of the tree" of the MBR-200.<ref>[[#Got05|Gott 2005]]. pp. 23–24.</ref><ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 56.</ref> Later, Chávez said that "the Bolivarian movement that was being born did not propose political objectives... Its goals were imminently internal. Its efforts were directed in the first place to studying the military history of Venezuela as a source of a military doctrine of our own, which up to then didn't exist".<ref>Chávez, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 80.</ref> However, he always hoped for the Bolivarian Movement to become a politically dominant party that would "accept all kinds of ideas, from the right, from the left, from the ideological ruins of those old capitalist and communist systems."<ref>Chávez, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 81.</ref> Indeed, Irish political analyst Barry Cannon noted that the MBR's early ideology "was a doctrine in construction, a heterogeneous amalgam of thoughts and ideologies, from universal thought, capitalism, Marxism, but rejecting the neoliberal models currently being imposed in Latin America and the discredited models of the old Soviet Bloc."<ref name="Cannon2009 58">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 58.</ref>

In 1981, Chávez, by now a captain, was assigned to teach at the military academy where he had formerly trained. Here he introduced new students to his so-called "Bolivarian" ideals and recruited some of them. By the time they had graduated, at least thirty out of 133 cadets had joined his cause.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 83–85.</ref> In 1984 he met [[Herma Marksman]], a recently divorced history teacher with whom he had an affair that lasted several years.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 51–53.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 86–90.</ref> During this time [[Francisco Arias Cárdenas]] , a soldier interested in [[liberation theology]], also joined MBR-200.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 92–93.</ref> Cárdenas rose to a significant position within the group, although he came into ideological conflict with Chávez, with Chávez believing that they should begin direct military action in order to overthrow the government, something Cárdenas thought was reckless.<ref>Cárdenas, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 92–93.</ref>

After some time, some senior military officers became suspicious of Chávez and reassigned him so that he would not be able to gain any more fresh new recruits from the academy. He was sent to take command of the remote barracks at [[Elorza]] in [[Apure State]],<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 50.</ref> where he organized social events for the community and contacted the local indigenous tribal peoples, the [[Cuiva]] and [[Yaruro people|Yaruro]]. Distrustful as they were because of the mistreatment at the hands of the Venezuelan army in previous decades, Chávez gained their trust by joining the expeditions of an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] to meet with them. Chávez said his experiences with them later led him to introduce laws protecting the rights of indigenous tribal peoples.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 98-102.</ref> In 1988, after being promoted to the rank of major, the high-ranking General Rodríguez Ochoa took a liking to Chávez and employed him to be his assistant at his office in Caracas.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 105, 108.</ref>

{{Further2|[[History of Venezuela (1999–present)]]}}

===First presidential term: 2 February 1999 – 10 January 2001===
Chávez's presidential inauguration took place on 2 February 1999, and during the usual presidential oath he deviated from the prescribed words to proclaim that "I swear before God and my people that upon this moribund constitution I will drive forth the necessary democratic transformations so that the new republic will have a [[Magna Carta]] befitting these new times."<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 127.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 226.</ref> He appointed new figures to a number of government posts, including promoting various leftist allies to key positions; he for instance gave one of the founders of MBR, Jesús Urdaneta, the position in charge of the [[Bolivarian Intelligence Service|Bolivarian Intelligence Agency]]; and made one of the 1992 coup leaders, Hernán Grüber Ódreman, governor of the Federal District of [[Caracas]].<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 229.</ref>
Chávez also appointed some conservative, centrist and centre-right figures to government positions as well, reappointing Caldera's economy minister Maritza Izaquirre to that same position and also appointing the businessman Roberto Mandini to be president of the state-run oil company [[Petroleos de Venezuela]].<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 230.</ref> His critics referred to this group of government officials as the "[[Boliburguesía]]" or "Bolivarian bourgeoisie",<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. xx.</ref><ref>[[#Rom10|Romero 2010]].</ref> and highlighted the fact that it "included few people with experience in public administration."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The involvement of a number of his immediate family members in Venezuelan politics led to accusations of [[nepotism]].<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 250–255.</ref> In June 2000 he separated from his wife Marisabel, and their divorce was finalised in January 2004.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 243.</ref>

Chávez set into motion a social welfare program called [[Plan Bolívar 2000]], which he organised to begin on 27 February 1999, the tenth anniversary of the ''Caracazo'' massacre.  Chávez said he would set aside $20.8 million for the plan, though some state that the program costed $113 million. Plan Bolívar 2000 involved 70,000 soldiers, sailors and members of the air force going out into the streets of Venezuela where they would repair roads and hospitals, remove stagnant water that offered breeding areas for disease-carrying mosquitoes, offer free medical care and vaccinations, and sell food at low prices.<ref name=USb2000>{{cite web|title=Venezuelan Soldiers Leave Their Barracks . . .

In May 2000 he launched his own Sunday morning radio show, ''[[Aló Presidente]]'' (''Hello, President''), on the state radio network, as well as a Thursday night television show, ''De Frente con el Presidente'' (''Face to Face with the President''). He followed this with his own newspaper, ''El Correo del Presidente'' (''The President's Post''), founded in July, for which he acted as editor-in-chief, but which was later shut amidst accusations of corruption in its management.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 193–195.</ref> In his television and radio shows, he answered calls from citizens, discussed his latest policies, sang songs and told jokes, making it unique not only in Latin America but the entire world.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 237.</ref>

====Constitutional reform====

Chávez then called for a public referendum which he hoped would support his plans to form a [[1999 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela|constitutional assembly]], composed of representatives from across Venezuela, as well as from indigenous tribal groups, which would be able to rewrite the nation's constitution.<ref name="ReferenceB">[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 130.</ref><ref name="Jones 2007. p. 238">[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 238.</ref> Using the momentum of support he had received in the previous elections,<ref name=CONS>{{cite book|last1=Rory|first1=Carroll,|title=Comandante : Hugo Chavez's Venezuela|date=2014|publisher=New York|location=Penguin Books|isbn=0143124889|page=41|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref> the referendum went ahead on 25 April 1999, and was a success for Chávez, with 88% of voters supporting the proposal.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Jones 2007. p. 238"/>

[[File:HugoChavez1823.jpeg|thumb|Chávez holds a miniature copy of the 1999 [[Constitution of Venezuela|Venezuelan Constitution]] at the 2003 [[World Social Forum]] held in Brazil.]]
Then Chávez called for an election to take place on 25 July, in which the members of the constitutional assembly would be voted into power.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 239.</ref> Of the 1,171 candidates standing for election to the assembly, over 900 of them were opponents of Chávez. Despite the large number of opposition candidates, Chavez's supporters won another overwhelming electoral victory creating "a very pro-Chávez Constitutional Assembly", with his supporters taking 125 seats (95% of the total), including all of those belonging to indigenous tribal groups, whereas the opposition were voted into only 6 seats.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Jones 2007. p. 240">[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 240.</ref><ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup05">[[#Int07|International Crisis Group 2007]]. p. 05.</ref>

On 12 August 1999, the new constitutional assembly voted to give themselves the power to abolish government institutions and to dismiss officials who were perceived as being corrupt or operating only in their own interests. Opponents of the Chávez regime argued that it was therefore dictatorial.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 241.</ref><ref>[[#Bel99|Belos 1999]].</ref> Most jurists believed that the new constitutional assembly became the country's "supreme authority" and that all other institutions were subordinate to it.<ref name="Gott">{{cite book|last=Gott|first=Richard|title=Hugo Chávez and the Bolivarian revolution|year=2005|publisher=Verso|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-1844675333|page=147|edition=New}}</ref> The assembly also declared a "judicial emergency", granting itself the power to overhaul the judicial system.

The constituent assembly, filled with Chávez's supporters,<ref name=CONS/> put together [[1999 Venezuelan Constitution|a new constitution]], and a referendum on the issue of whether to adopt it was held in December 1999; the referendum saw an abstention vote of over 50%, although among those voting, 72% approved the new constitution's adoption.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup05" /><ref>[[#Koz06|Kozloff 2006]]. p. 94.</ref><ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. pp. 61–62.</ref> The constitution included progressive language of environment and indigenous protection, socioeconomic guarantees with state benefits, but it also gave greater powers to Chávez.<ref name=CONS/><ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup06">[[#Int07|International Crisis Group 2007]]. p. 06.</ref> The assembly granted the presidency more power by extending their term and getting rid of the two houses of the Congress, while also granting the power to legislate on citizen rights, to promote military officers and to oversee economic and financial matters.<ref name=CONS/><ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup06"/> It also gave the military a role in the government by providing it with the mandated role of ensuring public order and aiding national development, something it had been expressely forbidden from doing under the former constitution.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup06" /> As a part of the new constitution, the country, which was then officially known as the Republic of Venezuela, was renamed the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (República Bolivariana de Venezuela) at Chávez's request.<ref name="Jones 2007. p. 240" /><ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup05" />

With the creation of the 1999 Venezuelan constitution by the pro-Chávez constituent assembly,<ref name=CONS/> [[checks and balances]] were eliminated and Chávez's government controlled every branch of Venezuelan government for over 15 years until the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2015|Venezuelan parliamentary election in 2015]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ma|first1=Alexandra|title=Will A Venezuelan Opposition Party's Election Victory Bring Real Change?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/venezuela-elections-david-smilde_56745723e4b0b958f6567bd8?ir=Latino+Voices&section=latino-voices&utm_hp_ref=latino-voices|accessdate=19 December 2015|agency=''[[Huffington Post]]''|date=19 December 2015}}</ref>

===Second presidential term: 10 January 2001 – 10 January 2007===
[[File:HugoChavez1820.jpeg|thumb|right|Chávez visiting [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil in 2003]]
Under the new constitution, it was legally required that new elections be held in order to re-legitimize the government and president. This [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2000|presidential election in July 2000]] would be a part of a greater "megaelection", the first time in the country's history that the president, governors, national and regional congressmen, mayors and councilmen would be voted for on the same day.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 140.</ref><ref>[[#Koz06|Kozloff 2006]]. p. 88.</ref><ref name="Cannon2009 63">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 63.</ref> Going into the elections, Chávez had control of all three branches of government.<ref name=Nelson1/> For the position of president, Chávez's closest challenger proved to be his former friend and co-conspirator in the 1992 coup, [[Francisco Arias Cárdenas]], who since becoming governor of Zulia state had turned towards the political centre and begun to denounce Chávez as autocratic.<ref name="Cannon2009 42">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 42.</ref> Although some of his supporters feared that he had alienated those in the middle class and the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy who had formerly supported him, Chávez was re-elected with 59.76% of the vote (the equivalent of 3,757,000 people), a larger majority than his 1998 electoral victory,<ref name="ReferenceC">[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 141.</ref><ref name="Ramírez 2005. p. 79">[[#Ram05|Ramírez 2005]]. p. 79.</ref> again primarily receiving his support from the poorer sectors of Venezuelan society.<ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. pp. 42–44.</ref>

That year, Chávez helped to further cement his geopolitical and ideological ties with the Cuban government of Fidel Castro by signing an agreement under which Venezuela would supply Cuba with 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates, in return receiving 20,000 trained Cuban medics and educators. In the ensuing decade, this would be increased to 90,000 barrels a day (in exchange for 40,000 Cuban medics and teachers), dramatically aiding the Caribbean island's economy and standard of living after its "[[Special Period]]" of the 1990s.<ref>[[#Koz08|Kozloff 2008]]. pp. 23–24.</ref> However, Venezuela's growing alliance with Cuba came at the same time as a deteriorating relationship with the United States: in late 2001, just after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|American-led invasion of Afghanistan]] in retaliation for [[11 September attacks]] against the U.S. by Islamist militants, Chávez showed pictures of Afghan children killed in a bomb attack on his television show. He commented that "They are not to blame for the terrorism of [[Osama Bin Laden]] or anyone else", and called on the American government to end "the massacre of the innocents. Terrorism cannot be fought with terrorism." The U.S. government responded negatively to the comments, which were picked up by the media worldwide.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 208–209.</ref>

[[File:Mision robinson wayuu by Franklin Reyes.png|thumb|left|Chávez's second term in office saw the implementation of social missions, such as this one to eliminate illiteracy in Venezuela.]]

Meanwhile, the 2000 elections had led to Chávez's supporters gaining 101 out of 165 seats in the Venezuelan National Assembly, and so in November 2001 they voted to allow him to pass 49 social and economic decrees.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup07"/><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 143.</ref> This move antagonized the opposition movement particularly strongly.<ref name="Cannon2009 63"/>

At the start of the 21st century, Venezuela was the world's fifth largest exporter of [[crude oil]], with oil accounting for 85.3% of the country's exports, therefore dominating the country's economy.<ref name="Kozloff08 18-23">[[#Koz08|Kozloff 2008]]. pp. 18–23.</ref><ref name="Cannon2009 32">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 32.</ref> Previous administrations had sought to privatise this industry, with U.S. corporations having a significant level of control, but the Chávez administration wished to curb this foreign control over the country's natural resources by nationalising much of it under the state-run oil company, [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.]] (PdVSA). In 2001, the government introduced a new Hydrocarbons Law through which they sought to gain greater state control over the oil industry: they did this by raising royalty taxes on the oil companies and also by introducing the formation of "mixed companies", whereby the PdVSA could have joint control with private companies over industry. By 2006, all of the 32 operating agreements signed with private corporations during the 1990s had been converted from being primarily or solely corporate-run to being at least 51% controlled by PdVSA.<ref name="Kozloff08 18-23"/>

====Opposition and the CD====
During Chávez's first term in office, the opposition movement had been "strong but reasonably contained, [with] complaints centering mainly on procedural aspects of the implementation of the constitution".<ref name="Cannon2009 63"/>

The first organized protest against the Bolivarian government occurred in January 2001, when the Chávez administration tried to implement educational reforms through the proposed Resolution 259 and Decree 1.011, which would have seen the publication of textbooks with a heavy Bolivarian bias. The protest movement, which was primarily by middle class parents whose children went to privately run schools, marched to central Caracas shouting out the slogan "Don't mess with my children." Although the protesters were denounced by Chávez, who called them "selfish and individualistic," the protest was successful enough for the government to retract the proposed education reforms and instead enter into a consensus-based educational program with the opposition.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 143–145.</ref>

Later into 2001, an organization known as the ''{{lang|es|Coordinadora Democrática de Acción Cívica}}'' (CD) was founded, under which the Venezuelan opposition political parties, corporate powers, most of the country's media, the [[Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce]], the {{lang|es|Frente Institucional Militar}} and the [[Central Workers Union]] all united to oppose Chávez's regime.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup07">[[#Int07|International Crisis Group 2007]]. p. 07.</ref><ref>[[#Ram05|Ramírez 2005]]. p. 80.</ref> The prominent businessman [[Pedro Carmona]] (1941–) was chosen as the CD's leader.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup07"/> They received support from various foreign sources.[[File:Hugo Chávez on USS Yorktown.jpg|thumb|right|Chávez visiting the [[USS Yorktown (CG-48)|USS ''Yorktown'']], a US Navy ship docked at [[Curaçao]] in the [[Netherlands Antilles]], in 2002]] The CD and other opponents of Chávez's Bolivarian government accused it of trying to turn Venezuela from a democracy into a dictatorship by centralising power amongst its supporters in the Constituent Assembly and granting Chávez increasingly autocratic powers. Many of them pointed to Chávez's personal friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro and the [[Politics in Cuba|one-party socialist government in Cuba]] as a sign of where the Bolivarian government was taking Venezuela.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup07"/> Others did not hold such a strong view but still argued that Chávez was a "free-spending, authoritarian [[populism|populist]]" whose policies were detrimental to the country.<ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 01.</ref>

====Coup, strikes and the recall referendum====

[[File:Anti-chavez march.jpg|thumb|A 2004 rally against Chávez in [[Caracas]], demanding [[Recall election|his removal from the presidency]].]]

On 11 April 2002, during mass protests in Caracas against the Bolivarian government,<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 171–172.</ref> twenty people were killed, and over 110 were wounded.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 168.</ref> A group of high-ranking anti-Chávez military officers had been planning to launch a coup against Chávez and used the civil unrest as an opportunity.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 170–171.</ref> After the plotters gained significant power, Chávez agreed to be detained and was transferred by army escort to [[La Orchila]]; business leader [[Pedro Carmona]] declared himself president of an interim government.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 175–184.</ref> Carmona abolished the 1999 constitution and appointed a small governing committee to run the country.<ref name="Cannon2009 63"/> Protests in support of Chávez along with insufficient support for Carmona's regime, which some felt was implementing [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] measures, quickly led to Carmona's resignation, and Chávez was returned to power on 14 April.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 181–185.</ref>

Chávez's response was to moderate his approach, implementing a new economic team that appeared to be more centrist and reinstated the old board of directors and managers of the state oil company [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.]] (PDVSA), whose replacement had been one of the reasons for the coup.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 185.</ref><ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 24.</ref> At the same time, the Bolivarian government began increased the country's military capacity, purchasing 100,000 [[AK-47]] assault rifles and several helicopters from Russia, as well as a number of [[Super Tucano]] light attack and training planes from Brazil. Troop numbers were also increased.<ref>[[#Koz08|Kozloff 2008]]. p. 71.</ref>

In 2002, after appointing political allies to head the PDVSA and replacing the company's board of directors with loyalists who had "little or no experience in the oil industry",<ref name=CNNoil>{{cite news|last=Kahn|first=Jeremy|title=Pumping Trouble: A strike in Venezuela has raised temperatures in Caracas and oil prices around the world.|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/02/03/336466/|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=3 February 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232750/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/02/03/336466/ |archivedate=2014-04-22}}</ref> Chávez faced a [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003|two-month management strike]] at the PDVSA.<ref name=BBCoil>{{cite news|last=Ceaser|first=Mike|title=Venezuelans hit by oil crisis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1913893.stm|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=5 April 2002}}</ref> The Chávez government's response was to fire about 19,000 striking employees for illegally abandoning their posts and then employing retired workers, foreign contractors, and the military to do their jobs instead.<ref name="Wilpert 2007. p. 25">[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 25.</ref> According to one observer, this move further damaged the strength of Chávez's opposition by removing the many managers in the oil industry who had been supportive of their cause to overthrow Chávez.<ref name="Wilpert 2007. p. 25"/>

The 1999 constitution had introduced the concept of a recall referendum into Venezuelan politics, so the opposition called for such a referendum to take place. A [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004|2004 referendum to recall Chávez]] was defeated. 70% of the eligible Venezuelan population turned out to vote, with 59% of voters deciding to keep the president in power.<ref name="Ramírez 2005. p. 79"/><ref name="Cannon2009 64">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 64.</ref> Unlike his original 1998 election victory, this time Chávez's electoral support came almost entirely from the poorer working classes rather than the middle classes, who "had practically abandoned Chávez" after he "had consistently moved towards the left in those five and a half years".<ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 19.</ref>

===="Socialism of the 21st century"====
The various attempts at overthrowing the Bolivarian government from power had only served to further radicalize Chávez.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In January 2005, he began openly proclaiming the ideology of "[[socialism of the 21st Century]]", something that was distinct from his earlier forms of [[Bolivarianism]], which had been [[Social democracy|social democratic]] in nature, merging elements of capitalism and socialism. He used this new term to contrast the [[democratic socialism]], which he wanted to promote in Latin America from the Marxist–Leninist socialism that had been spread by socialist states like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China during the 20th century, arguing that the latter had not been truly democratic, suffering from a lack of participatory democracy and an excessively authoritarian governmental structure.<ref name="Cannon2009 58"/>

In May 2006, Chávez visited Europe in a private capacity, where he announced plans to supply cheap Venezuelan oil to poor working class communities in the continent. The Mayor of London [[Ken Livingstone]] welcomed him, describing him as "the best news out of Latin America in many years".<ref>[[#Obs06|''The Observer'' 2006]].</ref>

On 15 December 2006, Chávez publicly announced that those leftist political parties who had continually supported him in the Patriotic Pole would unite into one single, much larger party, the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (''Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela'', PSUV).<ref name="Cannon2009 59"/> In the speech which he gave announcing the PSUV's creation, Chávez declared that the old parties must "forget their own structures, party colours and slogans, because they are not the most important thing for the fatherland."<ref name="Cannon2009 59"/> According to political analyst Barry Cannon, the purpose of creating the PSUV was to "forge unity amongst the disparate elements [of the Bolivarian movement], providing grassroots input into policy and leadership formation, [and] uniting the grassroots and leadership into one single body."<ref name="Cannon2009 60">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 60.</ref> It was hoped that by doing so, it would decrease the problems of clientelism and corruption and also leave the movement less dependent on its leadership:<ref name="Cannon2009 60"/> as Chávez himself declared, "In this new party, the bases will elect the leaders.

In 2007, the Bolivarian government set up a constitutional commission in order to review the 1999 constitution and suggest potential amendments to be made to it.

The inauguration of Chávez's new term was scheduled for 10 January 2013, but as he was undergoing medical treatment at the time in Cuba, he was not able to return to Venezuela for that date. The National Assembly president [[Diosdado Cabello]] proposed to postpone the inauguration and the Supreme Court decided that, being just another term of the sitting president and not the inauguration of a new one, the formality could be bypassed. The [[Roman Catholicism in Venezuela|Venezuelan Bishops Conference]] opposed the verdict, stating that the constitution must be respected and the Venezuelan government had not been transparent regarding details about Chávez's health.<ref>{{cite news |title=Church warns Venezuela govt on constitution |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130107-church-warns-venezuela-govt-constitution |newspaper=France 24 |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111082713/http://www.france24.com/en/20130107-church-warns-venezuela-govt-constitution |archivedate=2013-01-11}}</ref>

==Political ideology==
[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|upright|19th century general and politician [[Simón Bolívar]] provided a basis for Chávez's political ideas.]]
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=Democracy is impossible in a capitalist system. Capitalism is the realm of injustice and a tyranny of the richest against the poorest. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] said, 'Between the powerful and the weak all freedom is oppressed. Only the rule of law sets you free.' That's why the only way to save the world is through socialism, a democratic socialism... [Democracy is not just turning up to vote every five or four years], it's much more than that, it's a way of life, it's giving power to the people... it is not the government of the rich over the people, which is what's happening in almost all the so-called democratic Western capitalist countries.|source=Hugo Chávez, June 2010<ref name="Hard Talk"/> }}
Chávez propagated what he called "socialism for the 21st century", but according to the pro-Chavez academic [[Gregory Wilpert]], "Chávez has not clearly defined twenty-first century socialism, other than to say that it is about establishing [[liberty]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[social justice]], and [[solidarity]]. He has also indicated that it is distinctly different from [[state socialism]]", as implemented by the governments of the [[Soviet Union]] and the People's Republic of China.<ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]] p. 07.</ref> As a part of his socialist ideas, he emphasised the role of so-called "[[participatory democracy]]", which he claimed increased democratic participation, and was implemented through the foundation of the [[Venezuelan Communal Councils]] and [[Bolivarian Circles]] which he cited as examples of grassroots and participatory democracy.<ref>Sojo, Cleto A.

===Bolivarianism===
{{Main|Bolivarianism|Bolivarian Circles}}
Hugo Chávez defined his political position as [[Bolivarianism]], an ideology he developed from that of [[Simón Bolívar]] (1783–1830) and others. Bolívar was a 19th-century general who led the fight against the [[colonialism|colonialist]] Spanish authorities and who is widely revered across Latin America today. Along with Bolívar, the other two primary influences upon Bolivarianism are [[Simón Rodríguez]] (1769–1854), a philosopher who was Bolívar's tutor and mentor, and [[Ezequiel Zamora]], (1817–1860), the Venezuelan Federalist general.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Maxwell|year=2001|title=Venezuela's Hugo Chávez: Savior or Threat to Democracy?|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=36|issue=3|page=263}}. Online at [http://www.injerencia.org/documentos/Venezuela/Articulos_Ingles/Chavez_Savior%20or%20Threat.pdf]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> Political analyst and Chávez supporter Gregory Wilpert, in his study of Chávez's politics, noted that "The key ingredients for Chávez's revolutionary Bolivarianism can be summarized as: an emphasis on the importance of education, the creation of civilian-military unity, Latin American integration, social justice, and national sovereignty. In many ways this is not a particularly different set of principles and ideas to those of any other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] or national liberation thinker."<ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]] p. 16.</ref> Chávez's ideology originating from Bolívar has also received some criticism because Chávez had occasionally described himself as being influenced by [[Karl Marx]], a critic of Bolívar.<ref name="marx">{{cite web

===Marxism===
Chávez's connection to [[Marxism]] was a complex one, though he had described himself as a Marxist on some occasions.<ref name="en.ria.ru"/><ref name=BBCmarx/><ref name=N24marx/><ref name=ABCmarx/><ref name=CLARINmarx/> In May 1996, he gave an interview with Agustín Blanco Muñoz in which he remarked that "I am not a Marxist, but I am not anti-Marxist. I am not communist, but I am not anti-communist."<ref>Quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 236.</ref> In a 2009 speech to the national assembly, he said: "I am a Marxist to the same degree as the followers of the ideas of Jesus Christ and the liberator of America, Simon Bolivar."<ref name="en.ria.ru"/><ref>{{YouTube|BSwUO-4oXjY}}</ref> He was well versed in many Marxist texts, having read the works of many Marxist theoreticians, and often publicly quoted them. Various international Marxists supported his government, believing it to be a sign of proletariat revolution as predicted in [[Marxist theory]].<ref>See for instance [[#Woo06|Woods 2006]] and [[#Ali06|Ali 2006]].</ref> In 2010, Hugo Chávez proclaimed support for the [[Trotskyism|ideas]] of Marxist [[Leon Trotsky]], saying "When I called him (former Minister of Labour, [[José Ramón Rivero]])" Chávez explained, "he said to me: 'President I want to tell you something before someone else tells you ... I am a Trotskyist', and I said, 'well, what is the problem? I am also a Trotskyist! I follow Trotsky's line, that of permanent revolution," and then cited [[Marx]] and [[Lenin]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6246219.stm | title=Chávez accelerates on path to socialism | date=10 January 2007 |work=BBC News | first=Nathalie | last=Malinarich}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jorge |last=Martin |date=12 January 2007 |title="What is the problem?

Chávez's early heroes were nationalist military dictators that included former Peruvian president [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]<ref name="Jones 2007. p. 40-47"/> and former Panamanian "Maximum Leader" [[Omar Torrijos]].<ref name="Jones 2007. p. 52-53"/><ref name=ECONmarch2013>{{cite news|title=Venezuela after Chávez Now for the reckoning|url=http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21573095-after-14-years-oil-fuelled-autocracy-hugo-chávezs-successors-will-struggle-keep|accessdate=23 December 2014|agency=The Economist|date=9 March 2013}}</ref> One dictator Chávez admired was [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], a former president of Venezuela that he praised for the public works he performed.<ref name=Carroll193/> Chávez praised Pérez Jiménez in order to vilify preceding democratic governments, stating that "General Pérez Jiménez was the best president Venezuela had in a long time ...

In the first few years of Chavez's office, his newly created social programs required large payments in order to make the desired changes. On February 5, 2003, the government created [[CADIVI]], a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control [[capital flight]] by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency.<ref>CADIVI, [http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html CADIVI, una medidia necesaria]</ref> This limit to foreign currency led to a creation of a currency [[black market]] economy since Venezuelan merchants rely on foreign goods that require payments with reliable foreign currencies. As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the bolívar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants since the government held the majority of the more reliable currencies.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hanke |first=Steve |title=The World's Troubled Currencies |url=http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article41552.html |publisher=The Market Oracle |accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>

====Prisons====
During Chávez's presidency, there were reports of prisoners having easy access to firearms, drugs, and alcohol. Carlos Nieto—head of Window to Freedom—alleges that heads of gangs acquire military weapons from the state, saying: "They have the types of weapons that can only be obtained by the country's armed forces. ... No one else has these." Use of internet and mobile phones are also a commonplace where criminals can take part in street crime while in prison. One prisoner explained how, "If the guards mess with us, we shoot them" and that he had "seen a man have his head cut off and people play [[Soccer|football]] with it."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gupta|first=Girish|title=In Venezuela’s prisons, inmates are the wardens|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/venezuela/120511/inside-violent-venezuelan-prison-la-planta|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=Global Post|date=14 May 2012}}</ref>

Edgardo Lander, a sociologist and professor at the Central University of Venezuela with a PhD in sociology from Harvard University explained that Venezuelan prisons were "practically a school for criminals" since young inmates come out "more sort of trained and hardened than when they went in". He also explained that prisons are controlled by gangs and that "very little has been done" to control them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jay|first=Paul|title=The Modern History of Venezuela, Why Still So Much Crime? – Edgardo Lander on Reality Asserts Itself (7/9)|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=11760|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=The Real News|date=19 April 2014}}</ref>

=== Democracy under Chávez ===
The electoral processes surrounding Venezuela's democracy under Chávez were often observed controversially. Given the protests and strikes, some of which were quite big, like in 10 December 2001, the largest in the history of Venezuela,<ref name=p4041NELSON>{{cite book | last1=Nelson | first1=Brian A. | title=The silence and the scorpion: the coup against Chávez and the making of modern Venezuela | date=2009 | publisher=Nation Books | location=New York | isbn=1568584180 | pages=40–41 | online edition=}}</ref> some confidential cables published on [[Wikileaks]] tried to explain the discrepancy between Chávez's relatively low popularity and his overwhelming electoral victory.<ref name=whywon>[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS2671_a.html VENEZUELA: WHY CHAVEZ "WON"]</ref>

According to the cables, Hugo Chávez used "practically unlimited state resources" for propaganda activities, and high oil prices facilitated his success. The opposition, on the contrary, was divided into different parties, which ran for the same office, and the limited financial resources were badly invested. Chávez lavished huge amounts of money in exchange for votes.<ref name=whywon /> He reportedly mobilized the lower class Venezuelan voters who had historically abstained from elections for years,<ref name=whywon/> providing both undocumented Venezuelans and foreigners with identity cards; 200,000 foreigners were naturalized before August 2004 and around 3,000-4,000 foreigners per year might have been naturalized thereafter. Most of them purportedly voted for him.<ref name=whywon/>

According to the same cable, Chávez had control over the CNE (National Electoral Council) "and, by extension, the international observer missions."<ref name=whywon/> Moreover, "The CNE's decision to use fingerprinting machines "cazahuellas" to verify a voter's identity led to the widespread belief that a person's vote would not be secret".<ref name=whywon />

Finally, Chávez allegedly used the judiciary in order to detain or intimidate opposition politicians or NGOs accused of receiving money from the [[United States]] (through the National Endowment for Democracy - NED) purportedly in order to overthrow the government.<ref name=sumatedirec>[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06CARACAS339_a.html Sumate DIRECTORS harassed, FACING POSSIBLE DETENTION]</ref><ref name=genpetroleo>[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS2033_a.html THE NEXT ROUND OF ARRESTS?]</ref> According to the same source, the received money amounts to $30,000.<ref name=sumatedirec /> He reportedly also put pressure in the attorney general's office in order to replace three key employees and have any case that might damage the government or Chávez himself undisclosed.<ref>[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS620_a.html Bringing THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HEEL T]</ref><ref>[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS2702_a.html VENEZUELAN MAYOR CARPRILES (STILL) HELD FOR TRIAL]</ref>

In December 1998, Hugo Chávez declared three goals for the new government; "convening a constituent assembly to write a new constitution, eliminating government corruption, and fighting against social exclusion and poverty". However, during Hugo Chávez's time in power, corruption has become widespread throughout the government due to impunity towards members of the government, bribes and the lack of transparency.<ref name=CATOhc>{{cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=Corruption, Mismanagement, and Abuse of Power in Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/development-policy-analysis/corruption-mismanagement-abuse-power-hugo-chavezs-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute}}</ref> In 2004, Hugo Chávez and his allies took over the Supreme Court, filling it with supporters of Chávez and made new measures so the government could dismiss justices from the court.<ref name=HRW2012>{{cite web|title=World Report 2012: Venezuela|url=http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-venezuela|work=Report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> According to the [[libertarian]] ''[[Cato Institute]]'', the [[National Electoral Council of Venezuela]] was under control of Chávez where he tried to "push a constitutional reform that would have allowed him unlimited opportunities for reelection".<ref name=CATOcorruption>{{cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=The Corruption of Democracy in Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/corruption-democracy-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> The [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], produced annually by the Berlin-based NGO [[Transparency International]] (TNI), reported that in the later years of Chávez's tenure, corruption worsened; it was 158th out of 180 countries in 2008, and 165th out of 176 (tied with [[Burundi]], [[Chad]], and [[Haiti]]).<ref name=2012Index>{{cite news|title=Factbox: Transparency International's global corruption index|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/05/us-corruption-transparency-global-idUSBRE8B406G20121205|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=5 December 2012|first=David|last=Cutler}}</ref> Most Venezuelans believed the government's effort against corruption was ineffective; that corruption had increased; and that government institutions such as the judicial system, parliament, legislature, and police were the most corrupt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2010/11|url=http://www.transparency.org/country#VEN_PublicOpinion|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>

In [[Gallup Poll]]'s 2006 Corruption Index, Venezuela ranked 31st out of 101 countries according to how widespread the population perceive corruption as being in the government and in business. The index listed Venezuela as the second least corrupt nation in Latin America, behind Chile.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Crabtree |first2=Nicole |last2=Naurath |url=http://www.hra.am/file/gallup_corruption.htm |title=Gallup Launches Worldwide Corruption Index |publisher=Gallup Poll News Service |accessdate=21 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124180011/http://www.hra.am/file/gallup_corruption.htm |archivedate=2007-11-24}}</ref> Some criticism came from Chávez's supporters, as well. Chávez's own political party, [[Fifth Republic Movement]] (MVR), had been criticized as being riddled with the same cronyism, political patronage, and corruption that Chávez alleged were characteristic of the old "Fourth Republic" political parties. Venezuela's trade unionists and indigenous communities participated in peaceful demonstrations intended to impel the government to facilitate labor and land reforms. These communities, while largely expressing their sympathy and support for Chávez, criticized what they saw as Chávez's slow progress in protecting their interests against managers and mining concerns, respectively.<ref>Fuentes, F.

====Aiding FARC====
[[File:Raulreyesfarc.png|thumb|Raúl Reyes]]
According to the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS), "Chavez's government funded [[FARC]]'s office in Caracas and gave it access to Venezuela's intelligence services" and said that during the 2002 coup attempt that "FARC also responded to requests from [Venezuela's intelligence service] to provide training in urban terrorism involving targeted killings and the use of explosives". The IISS continued saying that "the archive offers tantalizing but ultimately unproven suggestions that FARC may have undertaken assassinations of Chavez's political opponents on behalf of the Venezuelan state". Venezuelan diplomats denounced the IISS' findings saying that they had "basic inaccuracies".<ref>{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=Study: Colombian rebels were willing to kill for Venezuela's Chavez|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/05/10/venezuela.farc.documents/index.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=10 May 2011}}</ref>

In 2007, authorities in [[Colombia]] claimed that through laptops they had seized on a raid against [[Raúl Reyes]], they found in documents that Hugo Chávez offered payments of as much as $300 million to the FARC "among other financial and political ties that date back years" along with other documents showing "high-level meetings have been held between rebels and Ecuadorean officials" and some documents claiming that FARC had "bought and sold [[uranium]]".<ref name="Padgett">{{cite news|last=Padgett|first=Tim|title=Chávez and the Cash-Filled Suitcase|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1838145,00.html|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=3 September 2008}}</ref><ref name=USATODAYfarc>{{cite news|title=Colombia: Chavez funding FARC rebels|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-02-venezuelacolombia_N.htm?csp=34|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=4 March 2008}}</ref>

In 2015, Chávez's former bodyguard [[Leamsy Salazar]] stated in ''Bumerán Chávez'' that Chávez met with the high command of FARC in 2007 somewhere in rural Venezuela. Chávez created a system in which the FARC would provide the Venezuelan government with drugs that would be transported in live cattle and the FARC would receive money and weaponry from the Venezuelan government. According to Salazar, this was done in order to weaken Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe]], an enemy of Chávez.<ref name=ROTTENstate>{{cite news|last1=Cristóbal Nagel|first1=Juan|title=Something Is Rotten in the State of Venezuela|url=http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/28/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-venezuela-chavez-maduro-cabello-salazar-farc/|accessdate=17 May 2015|agency=''[[Foreign Policy]]''|date=28 April 2015}}</ref>

====1999 Venezuelan Constitution====
In the 1999 [[Constitution of Venezuela|Venezuelan constitution]], 116 of the 350 articles were concerned with human rights; these included increased protections for indigenous peoples and women, and established the rights of the public to education, housing, healthcare, and food. It called for dramatic democratic reforms such as ability to recall politicians from office by popular referendum, increased requirements for government transparency, and numerous other requirements to increase localized, participatory democracy, in favor of centralized administration. It gave citizens the right to timely and impartial information, community access to media, and a right to participate in acts of civil disobedience.<ref name="new-const">[[#Wil03|Wilpert 2003]].</ref><ref name="Embassy of Venezuela in the US">{{cite web|year = 2000| title=Bolivarian Constitution of Venezuela|url= http://www.embavenez-us.org/constitution/intro.htm|accessdate =30 December 2006|publisher=Embassy of Venezuela in the US}}</ref>

Chávez gave a public appearance on 28 July 2011, his 57th birthday, in which he stated that his health troubles had led him to radically reorient his life towards a "more diverse, more reflective and multi-faceted" outlook, and he went on to call on the middle classes and the [[private sector]] to get more involved in his Bolivarian Revolution, something he saw as "vital" to its success.<ref>[[#BBC11b|BBC News 2011b]].</ref> Soon after this speech, in August Chávez announced that his government would nationalize Venezuela's gold industry, taking it over from Russian-controlled company [[Rusoro]], while at the same time also moving the country's gold stocks, which were largely stored in western banks, to banks in Venezuela's political allies like Russia, China and Brazil.<ref>[[#Gua11|''The Guardian'' 2011]].</ref>
