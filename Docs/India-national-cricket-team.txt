The '''Indian cricket team''', also known as '''Team India''' and '''Men in Blue''', is the national [[cricket]] team of [[India]]. Governed by the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI), it is a [[List of International Cricket Council members#Full Members|full member]] of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) with Test and [[One Day International]] (ODI) status.

Although cricket was introduced to Sub-continent by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club in India was established in [[Calcutta]] in 1792, India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]], becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen [[Sunil Gavaskar]] and [[Gundappa Viswanath]], all-rounder [[Kapil Dev]] and the [[Indian spin quartet]].

Traditionally much stronger at home than abroad, it was also said that'Indian team ghar pe sher (lion) ha lekin bahir zero ha' but the Indian team has improved its overseas form since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England national cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. It has won the [[India at the Cricket World Cup|Cricket World Cup]] twice – in [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and in [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]] under Mahendra Singh Dhoni's captaincy. After winning the 2011 World Cup, India became only the third team after [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] and Australia to have won the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] more than once,<ref name="BBC-Power">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm|title=India power past Sri Lanka to Cricket World Cup triumph|publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2011|first=Sam|last=Sheringham}}</ref> and the first cricket team to win the World Cup at home. It has won the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]], under the captaincy of Dhoni. It was also the joint champions of [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]], along with [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]].

As of 29 February 2016, India is ranked second in Tests, fourth in ODIs and second in [[Twenty20 International]]s (T20Is) by the ICC.<ref name="ICC rankings - ICC Test, ODI and Twenty20 rankings" /> [[Virat Kohli]] is the current captain of the team in Tests while Dhoni is the ODI and T20I captain. The Indian cricket team has rivalries with other Test-playing nations, most notably [[India–Pakistan cricket rivalry|with Pakistan]], the political arch-rival of India. However, in recent times, rivalries with nations like Australia, England and South Africa have also gained prominence.

Some of these, such as [[Ranjitsinhji]] and [[KS Duleepsinhji]] were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the [[Ranji Trophy]] and [[Duleep Trophy]] – two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian team went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/0/India_in_British_Isles_1911.html|title = India in British Isles, 1911 |work=Cricket Archive| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref>

India was invited into The [[Imperial Cricket Council]] in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in [[Indian cricket team in England in 1932|England in 1932]], led by [[CK Nayudu]], who was considered as the best Indian batsman at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/1909-1963.html|title = History of the Imperial Cricket Conference|work=ICC| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref> The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at [[Lord's cricket ground|Lord's]] in [[London]].

In the early 1940s, India didn't play any Test cricket due to the [[Second World War]]. The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against [[Sir Donald Bradman]]'s [[The Invincibles (cricket)|Invincibles]] (a name given to the [[Australia national cricket team]] of that time). It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England. Australia won the five-match series 4–0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer.<ref>{{cite web

The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961–62, and also won a home series against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]]. They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia, and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967–68.

The key to India's [[bowling]] in the 1970s were the [[Indian spin quartet]] – [[Bishen Bedi]], [[E.A.S. Prasanna]], [[BS Chandrasekhar]] and [[Srinivas Venkataraghavan]]. This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and [[Gundappa Viswanath]]. Indian [[cricket pitch|pitches]] have had tendency to support [[spin bowling|spin]] and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of [[Ajit Wadekar]]. Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while [[Dilip Sardesai]]'s 112 played a big part in their one Test win.

[[File:Indian Cricket Team Test Results.svg|thumb|A graph showing India's Test match results against all Test match teams from 1932 to September 2006]]
The advent of [[One Day International cricket]] in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considerably strong in [[One Day International|ODIs]] at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defence-based approaches to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup. Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.

In contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and were particularly strong at home where their combination of stylish batsman and beguiling spinners were seen at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976 when they chased 403 to win thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain [[Clive Lloyd]] dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without an individual scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by [[Mohinder Amarnath]]. The innings was the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.

During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy [[Mohammed Azharuddin]], [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] and all-rounder [[Ravi Shastri]]. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and two-time defending champions West Indies in the final, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the [[Asia Cup]] and in 1985, won the [[World Championship of Cricket]] in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the [[Indian subcontinent]]. India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.

[[File:Kumble edited.jpg|thumb|With 619 wickets, [[Anil Kumble]] is the world's third highest wicket taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket taker .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |title=Cricinfo- Anil Kumble |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>]]
The addition of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, [[Javagal Srinath]], India's fastest bowler since [[Amar Singh (cricketer)|Amar Singh]] made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the [[South Asia|subcontinent]] while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as [[Sourav Ganguly]] and [[Rahul Dravid]], later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]]. Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best ranked team in the world. After failing to reach the semifinals at the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3–0 on a tour of Australia and then 2–0 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman [[Ajay Jadeja]] were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as "the Indian cricket's worst hour". However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | work=BBC News | title=India cricket: Middle-order retirements are end of era | date=23 August 2012}}</ref>

Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]] as India's first ever foreign [[List of India national cricket coaches|coach]]. India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. [[Australian national cricket captains|Australian captain]] [[Steve Waugh]] labelled India as the "Final Frontier" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|title = Steve Waugh Column|work=Steve Waugh| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref> Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at [[Lord's cricket ground|Lord's]] which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and then went to the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] in South Africa where they reached the final only to be beaten by [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. The 2003–04 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1–1 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.

[[File:Wankhede-1.JPG|thumb|The Indian cricket team in action in the Wankhede Stadium]]
At the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1–1. [[Greg Chappell]] took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, [[Suresh Raina]], and the coming of age of players like [[Irfan Pathan]] and [[Yuvraj Singh]]. A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and [[Virender Sehwag]] were selected to play for the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the 2005 "[[ICC Super Series|SuperTest]]" against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = TWI gets production rights for India-Pakistan series|work=The Hindu – Sport| accessdate =14 October 2006}}</ref> Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4–1 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1–0 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2–1. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = India can find right balance before World Cup|work=Jamie Alter| accessdate =14 October 2006}}</ref>

In December 2006, India played and won its first ever [[Twenty20]] international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like [[Robin Uthappa]] saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round. After [[Indian cricket team in England in 2007|winning the Test series against England]] in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever [[Twenty20 World Cup]] held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007–08, they toured Australia where India lost the controversial Test series 2–1, but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia.<ref>[http://stats.cricinfo.com/twenty20wc/content/records/283307.html The result percentage] Cricinfo</ref>

In April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2–0 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2–0 in the home Test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1–1.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html The series] cricinfo</ref>

On 2 April 2011, India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup by defeating Sri Lanka in the final, thus becoming the second team after West Indies and Australia to win the World Cup twice, the previous win being in 1983. [[Gautam Gambhir]] and the skipper Dhoni led the way with 97 and 91* respectively.<ref>

India were whitewashed 4–0 in away Test series by England in August 2011 due to which England replaced India as the No. 1 Test team in the rankings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-india-2011/content/story/527348.html |title=England dethrone India to become No.1 |work=Cricinfo |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}</ref> This series was followed by another 4–0 whitewash of India in January 2012 in Australia. The disastrous whitewashes saw the retirement of Dravid and [[VVS Laxman]] from Test cricket in 2012. Tendulkar retired in November 2013 after his 200th Test match. With Ganguly having retired in 2008, this period signalled the end of the fabled middle-order batting line-up Indian had for a decade.

==Governing body==
{{Main|Board of Control for Cricket in India}}
The [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI) is the governing body for the Indian cricket team and first-class cricket in India. The Board has been operating since 1929 and represents India at the [[International Cricket Council]]. It is amongst the richest sporting organisations in the world. It sold media rights for India's matches from 2006–2010 for US$612,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2006/02/18/stories/2006021803840100.htm| accessdate =11 January 2007|title=Nimbus Bags Cricket Rights for $612 m|work=The Hindu |location=India}}</ref> It manages the Indian team's sponsorships, its future tours and team selection.

The [[International Cricket Council]] determines India's upcoming matches through its future tours program. However, the BCCI, with its influential financial position in the cricketing world, has often challenged the ICC's program and called for more tours between India, [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], Pakistan and England which are more likely to earn more revenue as opposed to tours with [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] or [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/231378.html| accessdate =11 January 2007|title=ICC faces threat from India|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> In the past, the BCCI has also come into conflict with the ICC regarding [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425822/161040| accessdate =11 January 2007|title=India challenge ICC|publisher=[[TVNZ]]}}</ref> and the legitimacy of the [[ICC Champions Trophy]].

===Selection committee===
{{Main|Indian national cricket selectors}}

Selection for the Indian cricket team occurs through the BCCI's zonal selection policy, where each of the five zones is represented with one selector and one of the members nominated by BCCI as the Chairman of the selection committee. This has sometimes led to controversy as to whether these selectors are biased towards their zones.<ref name="selection">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060730/main4.htm| accessdate =11 January 2007|title=Selection Policy not Zonal: Pawar|work=The Tribune |location=India}}</ref>

The current chairman of selection committee is [[Sandeep Patil]]. [[Roger Binny]], [[Vikram Rathore]], [[Saba Karim]] and [[Rajinder Hans]] are the other members of the selection committee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianteam.com/2008/09/27/bcci-gets-new-selection-committee/ |title=BCCI gets new selection committee |publisher=Indian Team |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> whose terms started in September 2012 with BCCI holding the rights for a one-year extension.

==Team colours==
Since colours have made their way into international cricket, the Indian cricket team has chosen blue as their primary colour and have worn one or the other shade of blue. The blue colour of their uniform has also earned them the nickname of "Men in Blue". With the advent of the [[World Series Cup]] in the 1970s, each team was to don a primary and secondary colour on their uniforms. The Indian team elected to wear light-blue as their primary colour and yellow as their secondary colour. Even during the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], the secondary colour on the Indian cricket team's clothing was yellow. However, this has since been replaced with the tricolour. In the past, the Indian ODI outfits were changed to different shades of blue, mostly darker than the current,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and the team donned purple during 1992, and then the sky blue colour for the next decade. Indian team has got a new kit from 2009 which is feroza blue with India written on it in orange.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Team India's new jersey unveiled | date=18 February 2009}}</ref> Currently, from October 2010, the team is once again using a light blue shade though not as light as the previous sky blue one, with India written in orange, and shades of the tricolour at the sides. The kit sponsor for the Indian cricket team is [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], which in 2005 bought the kit rights in a $27.2&nbsp;million contract with [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digi-help.com/pub/nike-indian-cricket-sponsorship.asp |title=Nike wins Indian cricket team endorsement rights, 199 crore brand sponsorship deal with India cricket team and BCCI |publisher=Digi-help.com |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>

Due to their love for blue color Nike with [[Board for Control of Cricket in India]] launched the mega campaign called "Bleed Blue" for the support of Indian team in [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]] which turned out to be a huge success and people over the internet and places adopted this to cheer for India.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nike.com/nikeos/p/nikecricket/en_IN/bleed_blue_index | work=Nike Cricket | title=Bleed Blue}}</ref>

A new ultramarine blue coloured jersey of the [[one-day cricket]] team was released on 20 October 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil | work=The Times of India | title=Team India dazzles in 'ultramarine' blue new jersey | date=20 October 2010}}</ref> for the upcoming tours and [[ICC Cricket World Cup]], the jersey has been designed by team's apparel and kit sponsor Nike. Previously, the Indian cricket team has worn a darker shade of blue and before that the team has worn sky blue. The vertical tricolour band has been made on both sides in comparison to just one side in previous shirt. The [[STAR India]], the official team sponsor logo is on the central part of the jersey (above orange coloured INDIA logo and on the right arm Nike logo is visible. The name and jersey number of the player is printed in orange at the back while on the chest the logo of [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] is on the left side and the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2011]] logo in white can be seen on the right side. The one-day cap was also sky blue with the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] logo on the front.

When playing [[first-class cricket]], in addition to their cricket whites, Indian fielders sometimes wear a sunhat, which is dark blue and has a wide brim, with the BCCI logo in the middle of the front of the hat. Helmets are coloured similarly. Some players sport the Indian flag on their helmet. The current kit sponsor for the Indian team is Nike, Inc. and current team sponsor is [[STAR India]].

There are numerous world-renowned cricket stadiums located in India. Most grounds are under the administration of various state cricket boards as opposed to being under the control of the BCCI. The Bombay Gymkhana was the first ground in India to host a full-scale cricket match featuring an Indian cricket team. This was between the Parsis and the Europeans in 1877. The first stadium to host a Test match in India was also the Gymkhana Ground in [[Bombay]] in 1933, the only Test it ever hosted. The second and third Tests in the 1933 series were hosted at [[Eden Gardens]] and [[Chepauk]]. The [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in Delhi was the first stadium to host a Test match after independence, a draw against the West Indies in 1948, the first of a 5-Test series. 21 stadiums in India have hosted at least one [[List of Test cricket grounds|official Test match]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of world-class cricket stadiums in India, with multiple Test venues in [[Lucknow]], Chandigarh ([[Punjab Cricket Association Stadium|PCA]] & [[Sector 16 Stadium|Sector 16]]), Chennai, [[Mumbai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Nagpur]].

Eden Gardens in Kolkata has hosted the most Tests, and also has the largest [[seating capacity]] of any cricket stadium in the world, being capable of holding more than 90,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sachinc/CricketArticle.pdf|title = Cricket: India's Passion|work=Sachin Chitta| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref> Founded in 1864, it is one of the most historical stadiums in India, having hosted numerous historical and controversial matches.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html Cricinfo – Grounds|title = Cricinfo – Grounds: Eden Gardens|work=Cricinfo| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref> Other major stadiums in India include the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]], which was established in 1883 and hosted memorable matches including Anil Kumble's ten wickets in an innings haul against Pakistan. For the last two years, the ground has been undergoing renovation.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58040.html|title = Cricinfo – Grounds: Feroz Shah Kotla|work=Cricinfo| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref>

The Bombay Gymkhana hosted the first ever Test match in India which is the only Test it has hosted to date. [[Wankhede Stadium]], established in 1974, has a capacity to hold 33,000 spectators and is currently the most popular venue in the city. It has hosted 21 Test matches. It was the unofficial successor of the Brabourne Stadium, which is also located in Mumbai. Mumbai is often considered the cricketing capital of India because of its fans and the talent it produces (see [[Mumbai cricket team]]) and thus the stadium regularly hosts major Test matches.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html|title = Cricinfo – Grounds: Wankhede Stadium|work=Cricinfo| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref> The [[M.

==Captains==
{{Main|List of India national cricket captains}}
Twenty-eight men have captained the Indian cricket team in at least one Test match, although only six have led the team in more than 25 matches, and five have captained the team in ODIs but not Tests. India's first captain was [[CK Nayudu]], who led the team in four matches against England: one in England in 1932 and a series of three matches at home in 1933-34. [[Lala Amarnath]], India's fourth captain, led the team in its first Test match after [[Indian independence]]. He also captained the side to its first Test victory and first series win, both in a three-match series at home against Pakistan in 1952-53. From 1952 until 1961-62, India had a number of captains such as [[Vijay Hazare]], [[Polly Umrigar]] and [[Nari Contractor]].

The Nawab of Pataudi, [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi]], was the team's captain for 36 Test matches from 1961-62 to 1969-70, returning for another four matches against West Indies in 1974-75. In the early years of his captaincy tenure, the team was whitewashed in the West Indies, England and Australia. However, in 1967-68, Pataudi led India on its maiden New Zealand tour, which ended in India winning the Test series 3-1. In 1970-71, [[Ajit Wadekar]] took over the captaincy from Pataudi. Under Wadekar's captaincy, India registered its first Test series wins in the West Indies and England. India played its first ODI in 1974, also under his captaincy. India won its first ODI under the captaincy of [[Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan]] in the [[1975 Cricket World Cup]], against [[East African cricket team|East Africa]]. Between 1975-76 and 1978-79, [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] captained the team in 22 Tests and 4 ODIs, winning 6 Tests and one ODI.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1983 Cricket WC.jpg|thumb|Kapil Dev led the Indian team to victory at the 1983 World Cup.]] -->
Sunil Gavaskar took over as Test and ODI captain in 1978-79, leading India in 47 Test matches and 38 ODIs, winning 9 Tests and 14 ODIs. He was succeeded by Kapil Dev in the 1980s, who continued for 34 Test matches, including 4 victories. Kapil Dev led India to victory in 40 of his 74 ODIs in charge, including the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]]. Kapil Dev also captained India's 2-0 Test series victory in England in 1986. Between 1987-88 and 1989-90, India had three captains in [[Dilip Vengsarkar]], Ravi Shastri and [[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]]. Vengsarkar took over the captaincy from Kapil Dev after the 1987 Cricket World Cup. Although he started with two centuries in his first series as captain, his captaincy period was turbulent{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and he lost the job following a disastrous tour of the West Indies in early-1989 and a stand-off with the Indian cricket board (BCCI).

India has had six regular Test captains since [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] took charge in 1989. Azharuddin led the team in 47 Test matches from 1989-90 to 1998-99, winning 14, and in 173 ODIs, winning 89. He was followed by Sachin Tendulkar, who captained the team in 25 Test matches and 73 ODIs in the late 1990s; Tendulkar was relatively unsuccessful<ref>{{cite news|title=Tendulkar on his captains: Ganguly was aggressive, Rahul methodical, Dhoni instinctive|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|accessdate=1 July 2015|publisher=[[Firstpost]]|date=7 November 2014}}</ref><ref>http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html</ref> as a captain, winning only 4 Test matches and 23 ODIs. He was replaced as ODI captain by [[Ajay Jadeja]] and then by [[Sourav Ganguly]].

[[File:Dhoni at Reebok event.jpg|thumb|right|Mahendra Singh Dhoni holds the record for most Tests wins (27) by an Indian captain.]]
Ganguly became the regular captain of the team in both Tests and ODIs in 2000. He remained captain until 2005-06 and became the then most successful Indian captain, winning 21 of his 49 Test matches in charge and 73 of his 141 ODIs. Under his captaincy, India became the joint-winners of the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and the runners-up of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. India lost only three Tests at home under Ganguly and managed to draw Test series in England and Australia. Rahul Dravid took over as Test captain in 2005. In 2006, he led India to its first Test series victory in the West Indies in more than 30 years. In September 2007, Mahendra Singh Dhoni was named as the new captain of the ODI and [[T20I]] teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team to the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural World Twenty20]] title. Anil Kumble was appointed Test captain in November 2007, but retired from international cricket in November 2008 after captaining in 14 Tests. Dhoni succeeded him as the Test captain, making him the captain in all formats. Under the captaincy of Dhoni, the Indian team held the number one position in the [[ICC Test Championship|Test rankings]] for 21 months (from November 2009 to August 2011), and set a national record for most back-to-back ODI wins (nine straight wins).<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA Sri Lanka denies India 5–0 rout by winning final cricket match] {{wayback|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA |date=20090213041951 |df=y }}</ref> Dhoni also led the team to victory in 2011 Cricket World Cup and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]]. However, the team performed poorly in away Tests from 2011 to 2014. Dhoni retired from Test cricket in December 2014, and Virat Kohli was named his successor.

==Individual records==
[[File:Tendulkar closup.jpg|thumb|Sachin Tendulkar celebrates his 38th [[Century (cricket)|Test century]] during a match against Australia in 2008. Tendulkar holds [[Achievements of Sachin Tendulkar|multiple world records]] including the world's leading run-scorer and century maker in both Tests and ODIs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/india/content/player/35320.html |title=Cricinfo profile: Sachin Tendulkar |publisher=Content-www.cricinfo.com |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>]]
{{Main|Indian cricket team records}}
{{See also|List of Indian Test cricketers|List of Indian ODI cricketers}}

Sachin Tendulkar, who began playing for India as a 16-year-old in 1989 and has since become the most prolific run-scorer in the history of both Test and ODI cricket, is easily the batsman with the most national achievements. He holds the record of most appearances in both Tests and ODIs, most runs in both Tests and ODIs and most centuries in Tests and ODIs. The highest score by an Indian is the 319 scored by Virender Sehwag in Chennai. It is the second [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century in Test cricket]] by an Indian, the first being a 309 also made by Sehwag although against Pakistan. The team's highest ever score was a 726/9 against Sri Lanka at Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai in 2009, while its lowest was 42 against England in 1974. In ODIs, the team's highest is 418/5 against West Indies at Indore in 2011–12. India score 413–5 in a match against [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] which is the highest score ever in Cricket World Cup history. In the same match, India set a world record of the highest winning margin of 257 runs in an ODI match.

India also has had some very strong bowling figures, with spin bowler Anil Kumble being a member of the elite group of 3 bowlers who have taken 600 Test wickets. In 1999, Anil Kumble emulated [[Jim Laker]] to become the second bowler to take all ten wickets in a [[test cricket|Test match]] innings when he took 10 wickets for 74 runs against Pakistan at the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in [[Delhi]].

Many of the Indian cricket team's records are also [[Test cricket records|world records]], for example Sachin Tendulkar's century tally (in Tests and ODIs) and run tally (also in both Tests and ODIs). Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 183 not out against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the world record score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. The Indian cricket team also holds the record sequence of 17 successful run-chases in ODIs,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-www1.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/248029.html|title = Dravid rues faulty execution|work=Cricinfo Staff| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref> which ended in a dramatic match against the West Indies in May 2006, which India lost by just 1 run when Yuvraj Singh was bowled by Dwayne Bravo's full toss.

Sachin Tendulkar was the first batsman to score 200 runs (He was unbeaten at 200* which he achieved from 147 deliveries) (25x4 | 3x6), in a single innings, in an ODI on 24 February 2010 against South Africa in [[Gwalior]].
On 8 December 2011, this achievement was eclipsed by compatriot Virender Sehwag, who scored 219 runs from 149 deliveries (25x4 | 7x6) versus [[West Indies]] in [[Indore]], making the ODI double century club exclusively Indian. On 13 November 2014 the record was broken by another Indian opening batsmen [[Rohit Sharma]] when he scored 264 runs from 173 deliveries (33x4 | 9x6) against [[Sri Lanka]] in Kolkata.

[[File:A Cricket fan at the Chepauk stadium, Chennai.jpg|thumb|[[Sudhir Kumar Chaudhary]] a fan of the Indian Cricket team, travels to all Indian home games with his body painted as the [[Indian Flag]].]]
Due to the large [[Indian diaspora]] in nations like Australia, England and South Africa, a large Indian fan turnout is expected whenever India plays in each of these nations.

There have been a number of official fan groups that have been formed over the years, including the Swami Army or Bharat Army,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bharat Army History|url=http://www.bharat-army.com/history/|publisher=www.bharat-army.com|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref> the Indian equivalent of the [[Barmy Army]], that were very active in their support when India toured Australia in 2003/2004. They are known to attribute a number of popular Indian songs to the cricket team.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/27/1072308727357.html?from=storyrhs|title = Swami Army Roars to Full Battle Cry|work=The Age Newspaper| accessdate =21 September 2006|location=Melbourne|date=28 December 2003}}</ref>

Fan rivalry and cross-border tension has created a [[India–Pakistan cricket rivalry|strong rivalry between the Indian and the Pakistani cricket teams]]. In tours between these two nations, cricket visas are often employed to accommodate for the tens of thousands of fans wishing to cross the border to watch cricket. This intense fan dedication is one of the major causes of the BCCI's financial success.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|title = 10,000 Visas for Pak Cricket Fans|work=The Tribune, Chandigarh| accessdate =21 September 2006}}</ref>

However, there are downsides to having such a cricket-loving population. Many Indians hold [[Cricket in India|cricket]] very close to their hearts and losses are not received well by the Indian population. In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after a long string of weak performances, there have been reports of player [[effigy|effigies]] being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|title = Ganguly's Debt of Gratitude|work=BBC News | accessdate =21 September 2006 | date=21 March 2003}}</ref> In many cases, players have come under intense attention from the media for negative reasons, this has been considered as one of the reasons for Sourav Ganguly being left out of the Indian team. At times, when a match is surrounded by controversy, it has resulted in a debacle. For example, when India slid to defeat against Australia at [[Brabourne Stadium]] in 1969, fans began throwing stones and bottles onto the field as well as setting fire to the stands, before laying siege to the Australian dressing rooms. During the same tour, a stampede occurred at Eden Gardens when tickets were oversold and India fell to another loss; the Australian team bus was later stoned with bricks.<ref name="Riots">{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|title = I predict a riot|work=Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson| accessdate =22 September 2006}}</ref> A similar event occurred during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], where India were losing the semi-final to [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] at Eden Gardens. In this case, the fan behaviour was directed at the Indian team in disappointment at their lacklustre performance. An armed guard had to be placed at the home of captain [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] to ensure his safety.<ref name="Riots"/> Indian fans have also been passionate in their following of [[Sachin Tendulkar]], who has been commonly thought of as one of the best batsmen in the world. Glorified for the bulk of his career, a riot occurred in early 1999 in a Test against Pakistan at [[Eden Gardens]] after a collision with Pakistani paceman [[Shoaib Akhtar]] saw him run out, forcing police to eject spectators and the game to be played in an empty stadium. Although in 2006, a string of low scores resulted in Tendulkar being booed by the [[Mumbai]] crowd when he got out against England<ref name="Sachinboo">{{cite web|url = http://www.indiadaily.org/entry/sachin-tendulkar-booed-by-wankhede-crowd/|title = Sachin Tendulkar booed by Wankhede Crowd|work=India Daily|publisher=India Daily| accessdate =15 January 2006}}</ref>

Often, fans engage in protests regarding players if they believe that regionalism has affected selection, or because of regional partisan support for local players. In 2005, when Sourav Ganguly was dropped due to lack of form, Ganguly's home state of [[West Bengal]] erupted in protests.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/dec/15protest.htm|title = Protests rock Kolkata over Ganguly's exclusion|work=Rediff| accessdate =14 October 2006}}</ref> India later played a match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] in [[Kolkata]], West Bengal. The Indian team was booed by the Bengali crowd who supported South Africa instead of India in response to Ganguly's dropping. Similar regional divisions in India regarding selection have also caused protests against the team, with political activists from the regional Kalinga Kamgar Sena party in [[Odisha]] disrupting the arrival of the team in [[Cuttack]] for an ODI over the lack of a [[Odisha cricket team|local player]] in the team, with one activist manhandling coach [[Greg Chappell]].<ref>{{cite news|title =Security concerns over Barabati Stadium's future|url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/indvwi/content/current/story/277430.html| date =24 January 2007|accessdate =25 January 2007|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> Similar treatment was handed to India's Marathi captain [[Sunil Gavaskar]] in the 1980s by Bengali crowds, with consecutive Tests in [[Calcutta]] requiring police intervention due to crowd rioting.<ref name="Sachinboo"/>

However, it should be noted that a successful string of results, victories against arch-rivals Pakistan or victory in major tournaments such as the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] are greeted with particular ecstasy from the Indian fans.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040402/sports.htm#5|title = The Entire Nation Erupts with Joy|work=The Tribune, Chandigarh| accessdate =20 September 2006}}</ref>

The Indian women's cricket team has a much lower profile than the men's team. For all national women's cricket teams, the female players are paid much less their male counterparts, and the women's teams do not receive as much popular support or recognition as the men's team. The women's teams also have a less packed schedule compared to men's teams and play fewer matches. The Indian women's cricket team played its first [[Women's Test cricket|Test match]] in 1976/7, when they drew with the [[West Indian women's cricket team|West Indies]] in a six-match series.

The [[Women's Cricket World Cup]] was held in India in 1978 and featured 4 teams. India lost both the matches they have played. Their next appearance in the Test and ODI circuit was against Australia in 1984, in which the Test series was tied but the [[Women's one-day international cricket|ODI series]] was lost in a whitewash.

The Indian women's cricket team has since picked up their form, reaching the finals in the last World Cup, but then losing to [[Australia national women's cricket team|Australia]]. The Women's Asia Cup of 2005–06 was won by India, who beat Sri Lanka in the final. They also beat the West Indies in the 2004–05 season, winning the 5 ODI series 5–0.
