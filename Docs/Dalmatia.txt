'''Dalmatia''' ({{lang-hr|Dalmacija}}, {{IPA-sh|dǎlmaːt͡sija|}}; see [[#Name|names in other languages]]) is one of the four [[historical region|historical]] [[Regions of Croatia|regions]] of [[Croatia]],<ref name="Frucht 2004">{{cite book|last=Frucht|first=Richard C.|title=Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&pg=PA413&lpg=PA413&dq=Croatia+proper&source=bl&ots=EF85_zNPK6&sig=XZ6wxVJn0JotU39o595JU4ftmzQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tIQrUNPCHM2B4ASR0IH4Bw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Croatia%20proper&f=false|accessdate=15 August 2012|edition=illustrated|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=1576078000|page=413}}</ref> alongside [[Croatia proper]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Istria]].

Dalmatia is a narrow coastal region, stretching from island of [[Rab]] in the north to the [[Bay of Kotor]] in the south. The [[hinterland]] ([[Dalmatian Zagora]]) ranges in width from fifty kilometres in the north, to just a few kilometres in the south; it is mostly covered by the rugged [[Dinaric Mountains]]. [[Islands of Croatia|79 islands]] (and about 500 islets) run parallel to the coast, the largest (in Dalmatia) being [[Brač]], [[Pag (island)|Pag]] and [[Hvar]]. The largest city is [[Split, Croatia|Split]], followed by [[Zadar]], [[Dubrovnik]], and [[Šibenik]].

Name of the region stems from an [[Illyrians|Illyrian tribe]] called the [[Dalmatae]], who lived in the area in [[classical antiquity]]. Later it became a [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Roman province]], and as result a [[Romance languages|Romance]] culture emerged, along with the now-extinct [[Dalmatian language]], later largely replaced with related [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. With the arrival of Croats to the area in the 8th century, who occupied most of the hinterland, Croatian and Romance elements began to intermix in language and the culture. During the Middle Ages, its cities were often conquered by, or switched allegiance to, the kingdoms of the region. The longest-lasting rule was the one of the [[Republic of Venice]], which controlled [[Venetian Dalmatia|most of Dalmatia]] between 1420 and 1797, with the exception of the small but stable [[Republic of Ragusa]] (1358–1808) in the south. Between 1815 and 1918, it was as a province of [[Austrian Empire]] known as the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. After the Austro-Hungarian defeat in [[World War I]], Dalmatia was split between the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] which controlled most of it, and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] which held several smaller parts, and after [[World War II]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]] took control over the complete area.

==Name==
The name Dalmatia derives from the name of the [[Dalmatae]] tribe, which is connected with the [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] word ''delme'' meaning "sheep" ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''delme'').<ref name="Wilkes 1995 244">{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John|title=The Illyrians|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1995|series=The Peoples of Europe|page=244|isbn=0-631-19807-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C}}</ref> Its 
[[Latin]] form ''Dalmatia'' gave rise to its current English name. In [[Venetian language]], once dominant in the area, it is spelled ''Dalmàssia'', and in modern [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Dalmazia''. The modern Croatian ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]) [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|spelling]] is ''Dalmacija'', {{IPA-hr|dǎlmaːt͡sija|pron}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Dalmatia is referenced in the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleverse|2 Timothy|4:10}} so its name has been translated in many of the world's languages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Definition==

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]] the [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Roman province of Dalmatia]] was much larger than the present-day [[Split-Dalmatia County]], stretching from [[Istria]] in the north to historical [[Albania]] in the south.<ref name="Stallaerts2009">{{cite book|author=Robert Stallaerts|title=Historical Dictionary of Croatia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSjRbIz4iDkC&pg=PA89|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7363-6|pages=89–}}</ref> Dalmatia signified not only a geographical unit, but was an entity based on common culture and settlement types, a common narrow eastern Adriatic coastal belt, [[Mediterranean climate]], [[sclerophyllous]] vegetation of the Illyrian province, Adriatic [[carbonate platform]], and [[karst]] [[geomorphology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Modern area===
Dalmatia is today an [[historical region]] only, not formally instituted in Croatian law. Its exact extent is therefore uncertain and subject to public perception. According to Lena Mirošević and Josip Faričić of the [[University of Zadar]]:<ref name=Mirosevic>{{cite book|last1=Mirošević|first1=Lena|last2=Faričić|first2=Josip|year=2011|title=Perception of Dalmatia in Selected Foreign Lexicographic Publications|publisher=Geoadria|volume=XVI|page=124}}; Department of Geography, [[University of Zadar]].</ref>
[[File:Dalmatia (Kingdom).svg|thumb|right|200px|The extent of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (blue), on a map of modern-day Croatia.]]

<blockquote>...the modern perception of Dalmatia is mainly based on the territorial extent of the Austrian [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], with the exception of Rab island, which is geographically related to the [[Kvarner]] area and functionally to the [[Croatian Littoral|Littoral]]–[[Gorski Kotar]] area, and with the exception of the [[Bay of Kotor]], which was annexed to another state ([[Montenegro]]) after World War I. Simultaneously, the southern part of [[Lika]] and upper Pounje, which were not a part of Austrian Dalmatia, became a part of [[Zadar County]]. From the present-day administrative and territorial point of view, Dalmatia comprises the four Croatian littoral counties with seats in Zadar, Šibenik, Split, and Dubrovnik.</blockquote>

"Dalmatia" is therefore generally perceived to extend approximately to the borders of the Austrian [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. However, due to territorial and administrative changes over the past century, the perception can be seen to have altered somewhat with regard to certain areas, and sources conflict as to their being part of the region in modern times:
*The Bay of Kotor area in [[Montenegro]]. With the [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|subdivision]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] into [[Oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|oblasts]] in 1922, the whole of the Bay of Kotor from [[Sutorina]] to [[Sutomore]] was granted to the Zeta Oblast, so that the border of Dalmatia was formed at that point by the southern border of the former [[Republic of Ragusa]].<ref>[[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], ''Anali Zavoda za Povijesne Znanosti Hrvatske Akademije Znanosti i Umjetnosti u Dubrovniku'', p.405, Volume 38</ref> The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' defines Dalmatia as extending "to the narrows of Kotor" (i.e. the southernmost tip of continental Croatia, the [[Prevlaka]] peninsula).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/150229/Dalmatia ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'': Dalmatia]</ref> Other sources, however, such as the ''[[Treccani]]'' encyclopedia and the "''[[Rough Guides|Rough Guide]] to Croatia''" still include the Bay as being part of the region.<ref name="Dalmatia on the Rough Guide to Croatia">{{Cite book|author=Bousfield, Jonathan|year=2010|title=The Rough Guide to Croatia|publisher=Penguin|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gXhvbLaZUawC&pg=PA263 263]|isbn=978-1-84836-936-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dalmatia on Enciclopedia Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dalmazia/}}</ref>
*The island of [[Rab]], along with the small islands of [[Sveti Grgur]] and [[Goli Otok|Goli]], were a part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and are historically and culturally related to the region, but are today associated more with the [[Croatian Littoral]], due to geographical vicinity and administrative expediency.
*[[Gračac Municipality]] and northern [[Pag (island)|Pag]]. A number of sources express the view that "from the modern-day administrative point of view", the extent of Dalmatia equates to the four southernmost counties of Croatia: [[Zadar County|Zadar]], [[Šibenik-Knin County|Šibenik-Knin]], [[Split-Dalmatia County|Split-Dalmatia]], and [[Dubrovnik-Neretva County|Dubrovnik-Neretva]].<ref name=Mirosevic /><ref name=Frommers>{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Ryan|last2=Mastrini|first2=Hana|last3=Baker|first3=Mark|last4=Torme Olson|first4=Karen|last5=Charlton|first5=Angela|last6=Bain|first6=Keith|last7=de Bruyn|first7=Pippa|year=2009|title=Frommer's Eastern Europe|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0470473347|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-npAm56mDFgC&pg=PA120&dq=dalmatia+borders+counties&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ntyEU-vpH-vY4QTq0YGgAw&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=dalmatia%20borders%20counties&f=false|page=120}}</ref><ref name=Turnock>{{cite book|last=Turnock|first=David|year=2003|title=The Human Geography of East Central Europe|publisher=Routledge|page=318|isbn=1134828004}}</ref><ref name=Heenan>{{cite book|last1=Heenan|first1=Patrick|last2=Lamontagne|first2=Monique|year=1999|title=The Central and Eastern Europe Handbook|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=168|isbn=1579580890}}</ref><ref name=nacional>{{cite news|date=2008|title=Gorilo u nekoliko dalmatinskih županija|trans_title=Fire in several Dalmatian counties|url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/49268/gorilo-u-nekoliko-dalmatinskih-zupanija|language=Croatian|newspaper=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]]|location=Zagreb|accessdate=2014-05-30}}</ref><ref name=regionministry>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrrfeu.hr/default.aspx?id=1484|title=Za 29 dalmatinskih malih kapitalnih projekata 14.389.000 kuna|trans_title=14,389,000 kuna for 29 Dalmatian capital projects|language=Croatian|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=|website=Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds|publisher=Republic of Croatia: Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds|accessdate=2014-05-30}}</ref> This definition does not include the Bay of Kotor, nor the islands of Rab, Sveti Grgur, and Goli. It also excludes the northern part of the island of Pag, which is part of the [[Lika-Senj County]]. However, it includes the Gračac Municipality in Zadar County, which was not a part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and is not traditionally associated with the region (but instead the region of [[Lika]]).

==Culture and ethnicity==
The inhabitants of Dalmatia are culturally subdivided into two or three groups. The urban families of the coastal cities, sometimes known as ''Fetivi,''<ref name="Bousfield">{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Bousfield|title=The Rough Guide to Croatia|publisher=Rough Guides|year=2003|page=293|isbn=1843530848}}</ref> are culturally akin to the inhabitants of the [[Dalmatian islands]] (known derogatorily as ''Boduli''). The two are together distinct, in the [[Mediterranean culture|Mediterranean aspects]] of their culture, from the more numerous inhabitants of the [[Zagora (Croatia)|Zagora]], the hinterland, referred to (sometimes derogatorily) as the ''[[Vlaji]]''.<ref name="Bousfield" /> The latter are historically more influenced by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|culture]], merging almost seamlessly at the border with the [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Herzegovinian Croats]] and southern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in general.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The former two groups (inhabitants of the islands and the cities) historically included many [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] speakers, many of whom identified as [[Italians of Dalmatia|Italians]] (esp. after the [[Unification of Italy]]). Their presence, relative to those identifying as [[Croats]], decreased dramatically over the course of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. The Italian speakers constituted (according to the Italian linguist [[Matteo Bartoli|Bartoli]]) nearly one third of Dalmatians in the second half of the 18th century.<ref>Seton-Watson, "Italy from Liberalism to Fascism, 1870-1925". p. 107</ref> According to the Austrian census it had decreased to 12.5% in 1865 and 3.1% in 1890.<ref>Perselli, Guerrino. ''I censimenti della popolazione dell'Istria, con Fiume e Trieste, e di alcune città della Dalmazia tra il 1850 ed il 1936''</ref> There remains, however, a strong cultural, and, in part, ancestral heritage among the natives of the cities and islands, who today almost exclusively identify as [[Croats]], but retain a sense of regional identity.{{cn|date=December 2015}} 

==Geography and climate==

Most of the area is covered by Dinaric Alps mountain ranges running from north-west to south-east. On the coasts the climate is Mediterranean, while further inland it is moderate Mediterranean. In the mountains, winters are frosty and snowy, while summers are hot and dry. To the south winters are milder. Over the centuries many forests have been cut down and replaced with bush and brush. There is evergreen vegetation on the coast. The soils are generally poor, except on the plains where areas with natural grass, fertile soils and warm summers provide an opportunity for tillage. Elsewhere, land cultivation is mostly unsuccessful because of the mountains, hot summers and poor soils, although olives and grapes flourish. Energy resources are scarce. Electricity is mainly produced by hydropower stations. There is a considerable amount of [[bauxite]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[File:Dubrovnik crop.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The historic core of the city of [[Dubrovnik]], in southern Dalmatia.]]
The largest Dalmatian mountains are [[Dinara]], [[Mosor]], [[Svilaja]], [[Biokovo]], [[Moseć]], [[Veliki Kozjak]] and [[Mali Kozjak]]. The regional geographical unit of historical Dalmatia{{clarify|reason=what period (century at least) does "historical Dalmatia" refer to?|date=August 2012}} - the coastal region between Istria and the Gulf of Kotor - includes the [[Orjen]] mountain with the highest peak in Montenegro, 1894 m. In present-day Dalmatia, the highest peak is Dinara (1913 m), which is not a coastal mountain, while the highest coastal Dinaric mountains are on Biokovo (Sv. Jure, 1762 m) and Velebit (Vaganski vrh, 1757 m),<ref name="yearbook">{{Croatia Yearbook 2015|page=48|chapter=Geographical and Meteorological Data|author=}}</ref> although the Vaganski vrh itself is located in [[Lika-Senj County]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Mountaineering Association|url=http://www.plsavez.hr/info/hrvatski-vrhovi/vaganski-vrh/|title=Vaganski vrh|language=Croatian|trans_title=Vaganski peak|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>

The largest Dalmatian islands are [[Brač]], [[Korčula]], [[Dugi Otok]], [[Mljet]], [[Vis (island)|Vis]], [[Hvar]], [[Pag (island)|Pag]] and [[Pašman]]. The major rivers are [[Zrmanja]], [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]], [[Cetina]] and [[Neretva]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Dalmatia}}

===Antiquity===
{{Main|Dalmatia (Roman province)}}
[[File:REmpire Dalmatia.svg|thumb|190px|Province of Dalmatia during the Roman Empire.]]
[[File:Marcellinus Dalmatia.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Independent Dalmatia - Extent of Marcellinus' Control (454-468) and Julius Nepos' Control (468-480).]]
Dalmatia's name is derived from the name of an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe called the [[Dalmatae]] who lived in the area of the eastern [[Adriatic]] coast in the 1st millennium BC. It was part of the [[Illyria]]n Kingdom between the 4th century BC and the [[Illyrian Wars]] (220, 168 BC) when the [[Roman Republic]] established its protectorate south of the river [[Neretva]]. The name "Dalmatia" was in use probably from the second half of the 2nd century BC and certainly from the first half of the 1st century BC, defining a coastal area of the eastern [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] between the [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] and [[Neretva]] rivers.<ref>S.Čače, ''Ime Dalmacije u 2. i 1. st. prije Krista'', Radovi Filozofskog fakulteta u Zadru, godište 40 za 2001. Zadar, 2003, pp. 29, 45.</ref> It was slowly incorporated into Roman possessions until the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was formally established around 32-27 BC. In 9 AD the Dalmatians raised the last in [[Great Illyrian Revolt|a series of revolts]]<ref>Charles George Herbermann, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference'' (1913)</ref> together with the Pannonians, but it was finally crushed, and in 10 AD, Illyricum was split into two provinces, [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] which spread into larger area inland to cover all of the [[Dinaric Alps]] and most of the eastern Adriatic coast.<ref>M.Zaninović, ''Ilirsko pleme Delmati'', pp. 58, 83-84.</ref>

The historian [[Theodore Mommsen]] wrote in his book, ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire'', that all Dalmatia was fully romanized by the 4th century AD. However, analysis of archaeological material from that period has shown that the process of [[romanization]] was rather selective. While urban centers, both coastal and inland, were almost completely romanized, the situation in the countryside was completely different. Despite the Illyrians being subject to a strong process of acculturation, they continued to speak their native language, worship their own gods and traditions, and follow their own social-political tribal organization which was adapted to Roman administration and political structure only in some necessities.<ref>A. Stipčević'', Iliri'', Školska knjiga Zagreb, 1974, p. 70</ref>

The collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], with the beginning of the [[Migration Period]], left the region subject to [[Goths|Gothic]] rulers, [[Odoacer]] and [[Theodoric the Great]]. They ruled Dalmatia from 480 to 535 AD, when it was restored to the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern (Byzantine) Empire]] by [[Justinian I]].{{cn|date=November 2015}}

===Middle Ages===
{{moresources|section|date=November 2015}}
{{See also|Dalmatia (theme)|Principality of Dalmatian Croatia|Kingdom of Croatia (Medieval)|Medieval Dalmatian principalities}}
The Middle Ages in Dalmatia were a period of intense rivalry among neighboring powers:  the waning [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] (later in a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Hungary]]), the [[Bosnian Kingdom]], and the [[Venetian Republic]]. Dalmatia at the time consisted of the coastal cities functioning much like city-states, with extensive autonomy, but in mutual conflict and without control of the rural hinterland (the [[Zagora (Croatia)|Zagora]]). Ethnically, Dalmatia started out as a Roman region, with a romance culture that began to develop independently, forming the now-extinct [[Dalmatian language]].

In the [[Early Middle ages|Early Medieval period]], Byzantine Dalmatia was ravaged by an [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] invasion that destroyed its capital, [[Salona]], in 639 AD, an event that allowed for the settlement of the nearby [[Diocletian's Palace]] in [[Spalatum]] (Split) by Salonitans, greatly increasing the importance of the city. The Avars were followed by the great [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] migrations.<ref>Curta Florin. ''Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, 2006; ISBN 978-0-521-81539-0 ([https://books.google.com/?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&pg=RA2-PA100&lpg=RA2-PA100&dq=qytet+fort+city#v=onepage&q=qytet%20fort%20city&f=false])</ref>

The Slavs, loosely allied with the Avars, permanently settled the region in the first half of the 7th century AD and remained its predominant ethnic group ever since. The Croats soon formed their own realm: the [[Principality of Dalmatian Croatia]] ruled by native Princes of [[Guduscani|Guduscan]] origin. The meaning of the geographical term "Dalmatia", now shrunk to the cities and their immediate hinterland. These cities and towns remained influential as they were well fortified and maintained their connection with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The two communities were somewhat hostile at first, but as the Croats became [[Christianized]] this tension increasingly subsided. A degree of cultural mingling soon took place, in some enclaves stronger, in others weaker, as Slavic influence and culture was more accentuated in Ragusa, Spalatum, and Tragurium. In about 925 AD, [[Duke Tomislav]] was crowned, establishing the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]], and extending his influence further southwards to [[Zahumlje|Zachlumia]]. Being an ally of the Byzantine Empire, the King was given the status of Protector of Dalmatia, and became its ''de facto'' ruler.

[[File:SPLIT-Adam S front view.jpg|thumb|left|190|An engraving of the seaward walls of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] by [[Robert Adam]], 1764. The walls were originally built for the Roman [[Diocletian's Palace]].]]
In the [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval period]], the Byzantine Empire was no longer able to maintain its power consistently in Dalmatia, and was finally rendered impotent so far west by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. The Venetian Republic, on the other hand, was in the ascendant, while the Kingdom of Croatia became increasingly influenced by Hungary to the north, being absorbed into it via personal union in 1102. Thus, these two factions became involved in a struggle in this area, intermittently controlling it as the balance shifted. During the reign of King [[Emeric, King of Hungary#Wars in the Balkans|Emeric]], the Dalmatian cities separated from Hungary by a treaty.<ref>cit: ''Hunc iste, postquam Dalmatae pacto hoc a Hungaria separati se non tulissent, revocatum contra Emericum armis vindicavit, ac [[Livno#History|Chelmensi Ducatu]], ad mare sito, parteque [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedoniae]] auxit.'' AD 1199. Luc. lib. IV. cap. III. Diplomata [[Béla IV of Hungary|Belae IV.]] AD 1269.</ref> A consistent period of Hungarian rule in Dalmatia was ended with the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]] of Hungary in 1241. The [[Mongols]] severely impaired the feudal state, so much so that that same year, King [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla IV]] had to take refuge in Dalmatia, as far south as the [[Klis]] fortress. The Mongols attacked the Dalmatian cities for the next few years but eventually withdrew without major success.

In 1389 [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], the founder of the [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (958–1463)|Bosnian Kingdom]], was able to control the Adriatic littoral between [[Kotor]] and [[Šibenik]], and even claimed control over the northern coast up to [[Rijeka]], and his own independent ally, Dubrovnik (Ragusa). This was only temporary, as Hungary and the Venetians continued their struggle over Dalmatia after Tvrtko's death in 1391. By this time, the whole Hungarian and Croatian Kingdom was facing increasing internal difficulties, as a 20-year civil war ensued between the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] from the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]]. During the war, the losing contender, [[Ladislaus of Naples]], sold his "rights" on Dalmatia to the Venetian Republic for a mere 100,000 [[ducats]]. The much more centralized Republic came to control all of Dalmatia by the year 1420, it was to remain under Venetian rule for 377 years (1420–1797).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&id=T_1bA7hj3lcC&dq=kotor+Southern+Dalmatia+google+books&q=dalmatia|title=Yugoslavia - Carol Greene - Google Livres|publisher=Books.google.fr|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref>

From 1420 to 1797 the Republic of Venice controlled most of Dalmatia, calling it ''Esclavonia'' in the 15th century<ref>"Esclavonia, formerly called Dalmatia", according to the Spanish traveler [[Pedro Tafur]], who sailed down the coast in 1436 (Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andanças e viajes]'').</ref> with the southern [[enclave]], the [[Bay of Kotor]], being called ''[[Albania Veneta]]''. [[Venetian language|Venetian]] was the commercial ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the Mediterranean at that time, and it heavily influenced Dalmatian and to a lesser degree coastal Croatian and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].

The southern city of Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]) became de facto independent in 1358 through the [[Treaty of Zadar]] when Venice relinquished its suzerainty over it to [[Louis I of Hungary]]. In 1481, Ragusa switched allegiance to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This gave its tradesmen advantages such as access to the Black Sea, and the [[Republic of Ragusa]] was the fiercest competitor to Venice's merchants in the 15th and 16th century.

The Republic of Venice was also one of the powers most hostile to [[Ottoman Empire#Growth (1453–1683)|the Ottoman Empire's expansion]], and participated in [[Ottoman wars in Europe|many wars against it]]. As the Turks took control of the hinterland, many Christians took refuge in the coastal cities of Dalmatia. The border between the Dalmatian hinterland and the [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina]] greatly fluctuated until the [[Morean War]], when the Venetian capture of Knin and Sinj set much of the borderline at its current position.<ref name="Nazor-2002">{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=45078|language=Croatian|title=Inhabitants of Poljica in the War of Morea (1684-1699)|first=Ante|last=Nazor|volume=21|number=21|date=February 2002|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|issn=0351-9767|accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref>

After the [[Great Turkish War]] and the [[Peace of Passarowitz]], more peaceful times made Dalmatia experience a period of certain economic and cultural growth in the 18th century, with the re-establishment of trade and exchange with the hinterland. This period was abruptly interrupted with the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. [[Napoleon]]'s troops stormed the region and ended the independence of the Republic of Ragusa as well, but saving it from occupation by the [[Russian Empire]] and Montenegro.

In 1805, Napoleon created his [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] around the Adriatic Sea, annexing to it the former Venetian Dalmatia from Istria to Kotor. In 1808 he annexed to this Italian Kingdom the just conquered [[Republic of Ragusa]]. A year later in 1809 he removed the Venetian Dalmatia from his Kingdom of Italy and created the [[Illyrian Provinces]], which were annexed to France, and created his marshal [[Nicolas Soult]] ''Duke of Dalmatia''.

Napoleon's rule in Dalmatia was marked with war and high taxation, which caused several rebellions. On the other hand, French rule greatly contributed to [[Illyrian movement|Croatian national awakening]] (the first newspaper in Croatian was published then in Zadar, the ''[[Il Regio Dalmata – Kraglski Dalmatin]]''), the legal system and infrastructure were finally modernized to a degree in Dalmatia, and the educational system flourished. French rule brought a lot of improvements in infrastructure; many roads were built or reconstructed. Napoleon himself blamed Marshal [[Auguste Marmont]], the governor of Dalmatia, that too much money was spent. However, in 1813, the Habsburgs once again declared war on France and, by the following year, had restored control over Dalmatia.

At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Dalmatia was granted as a province to the Emperor of Austria. It was officially known as the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].

In 1848, the Croatian Assembly (Sabor) published the People's Requests, in which they requested among other things the abolition of serfdom and the unification of Dalmatia and Croatia. The Dubrovnik Municipality was the most outspoken of all the Dalmatian communes in its support for unification with Croatia. A letter was sent from Dubrovnik to Zagreb with pledges to work for this idea. In 1849, Dubrovnik continued to lead the Dalmatian cities in the struggle for unification. A large-scale campaign was launched in the Dubrovnik paper ''L'Avvenire'' (''The Future'') based on a clearly formulated programme: the federal system for the Habsburg territories, the inclusion of Dalmatia into Croatia and the Slavic brotherhood. The president of the council of Kingdom of Dalmatia was the politician Baron Vlaho Getaldić.

In the same year, the first issue of the Dubrovnik almanac appeared, ''Flower of the National Literature'' (''Dubrovnik, cvijet narodnog književstva''), in which [[Petar Preradović]] published his noted poem "To Dubrovnik". This and other literary and journalistic texts, which continued to be published, contributed to the awakening of the national consciousness reflected in efforts to introduce the Croatian language into schools and offices, and to promote Croatian books. The Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] brought the so-called Imposed Constitution which prohibited the unification of Dalmatia and Croatia and also any further political activity with this end in view. The political struggle of Dubrovnik to be united with Croatia, which was intense throughout 1848-49, did not succeed at that time.

In 1861 was the meeting of the first Dalmatian Assembly, with representatives from Dubrovnik. Representatives of Kotor came to Dubrovnik to join the struggle for unification with Croatia. The citizens of Dubrovnik gave them a festive welcome, flying Croatian flags from the ramparts and exhibiting the slogan: Ragusa with Kotor. The Kotorans elected a delegation to go to Vienna; Dubrovnik nominated Niko Pucić, who went to Vienna to demand not only the unification of Dalmatia with Croatia, but also the unification of all Croatian territories under one common Assembly.

At the end of the First World War, the Austrian Empire disintegrated, and Dalmatia was again split between the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) which controlled most of it, and the Kingdom of [[Italy]] which held small portions of northern Dalmatia around Zadar and the islands of [[Cres]], [[Lošinj]] and Lastovo.

===Twentieth century===

In 1905 a dispute arose in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Austrian Reichsrat]] over whether Austria should pay for Dalmatia. It has been argued that in the conclusion of the so-called "''[[April Laws]]''" is written "''given by Banus Count [[House of Keglević|Keglevich of Buzin]]''", which explained the historical affiliation of Dalmatia to Hungary.<ref>Stenographische Protokolle über die Sitzungen des Hauses der Abgeordneten des österreichischen Reichsrates, Ausgaben 318-329, [http://books.google.at/books?ei=R2vYT6XNK8vP4QTwtdilAw&hl=de&id=AlAyAQAAMAAJ&dq=Keglevich Seite 29187], Austria, Reichsrat, Abgeordnetenhaus, published 1905.</ref> Two years later Dalmatia elected representatives to the Austrian Reichsrat.

Dalmatia was a strategic region during [[World War I]] that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy joined the [[Triple Entente]] [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1915 upon agreeing to the [[London Pact]] that guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy's participation on the Allied side. From  5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], [[Lastovo|Lagosta]], [[Šibenik|Sebenico]], and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.<ref>Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo. ''History of Dalmatia''. Giardini, 1993. Pp. 281.</ref> By the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact and by 17 November had seized [[Rijeka]] as well.<ref name="Paul O 2005.

In 1922, the territory of the former Kingdom of Dalmatia was divided into two provinces, the District of Split (''Splitska oblast''), with its capital in Split, and the District of Dubrovnik (''Dubrovačka oblast''), with its capital in [[Dubrovnik]]. In 1929, the [[Littoral Banovina]] (''Primorska Banovina''), a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, was formed. Its capital was Split, and it included most of Dalmatia and parts of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The southern parts of Dalmatia were in [[Zeta Banovina]], from the Gulf of Kotor to [[Pelješac]] peninsula including Dubrovnik. In 1939, Littoral Banovina was joined with [[Sava Banovina]] (and with smaller parts of other banovinas) to form a new province named the [[Banovina of Croatia]]. The same year, the ethnic Croatian areas of the Zeta Banovina from the Gulf of Kotor to Pelješac, including Dubrovnik, were merged with a new Banovina of Croatia.

During World War II, in 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], [[Hungary]] and [[Bulgaria]] occupied Yugoslavia, redrawing their borders to include former parts of the Yugoslavian state. A new Nazi puppet state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), was created, and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] was given some parts of the Dalmatian coast, notably around Zadar and Split, as well as many of the area's islands. The remaining parts of Dalmatia became part of the NDH. Many Croats moved from the Italian-occupied area and took refuge in the satellite state of Croatia, which became the battleground for a guerrilla war between the [[Axis forces|Axis]] and the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Following the surrender of Italy in 1943, most of Italian-controlled Dalmatia was reverted to Croatian control. [[Zadar]] was razed by the Allies during World War II, starting the [[Istrian exodus|exodus]] of its Italian population. After WWII, Dalmatia became part of the People's Republic of Croatia, part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] (then called the Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia).

The territory of former Kingdom of Dalmatia was divided between two [[Federal republic|federal]] Republics of Yugoslavia and most of the territory went to Croatia, leaving only the Bay of Kotor to [[Montenegro]]. When Yugoslavia dissolved in 1991, those borders were retained and remain in force. During the [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatian war of Independence]], most of Dalmatia was a battleground between the Croatian government and [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|local Serb rebels]], with much of the region being placed under the control of Serbs. Croatia did regain southern parts of these territories in 1992 but did not regain all of the territory [[Operation Storm|until 1995]].
