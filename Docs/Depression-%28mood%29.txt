'''Depression''' is a state of low [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and aversion to activity that can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, feelings and [[subjective well-being|sense of well-being]].<ref name="Salmans1995">{{cite book |last=Salmans |first=Sandra |title=Depression: Questions You Have&nbsp;– Answers You Need |year=1997 |publisher=People's Medical Society |isbn=978-1-882606-14-6}}</ref><ref name="DSM-5(2013)">{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) |year=2013 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}</ref>

People with a depressed mood can feel sad, [[Anxiety|anxious]], empty, hopeless, helpless, [[Low self-esteem|worthless]], guilty, irritable, angry, ashamed or [[Psychomotor agitation|restless]]. They may lose interest in activities that were once pleasurable, experience loss of appetite or overeating, have problems concentrating, remembering details or making decisions, experience relationship difficulties and may contemplate, attempt or commit [[suicide]]. [[Insomnia]], [[hypersomnia|excessive sleeping]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], aches, pains, digestive problems or reduced energy may also be present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/complete-index.shtml |title=NIMH · Depression |work=[[National Institute of Mental Health|nimh.nih.gov]] |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

Depressed mood is a feature of some [[Psychiatry|psychiatric syndromes]] such as [[major depressive disorder]],<ref name="DSM-5(2013)"/> but it may also be a normal reaction, as long as it does not persist long term, to life events such as bereavement, a symptom of some bodily ailments or a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments.

== Causes ==

=== Life events ===
Adversity in childhood, such as bereavement, [[neglect]], mental abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse and unequal parental treatment of siblings can contribute to depression in adulthood.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Christine Heim|author2=D.

Life events and changes that may precipitate depressed mood include [[childbirth]], [[menopause]], financial difficulties, job problems, a medical diagnosis (cancer, HIV, etc.), [[bullying]], loss of a loved one, [[natural disaster]]s, social isolation, relationship troubles, jealousy, separation, and [[catastrophic injury]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=Peter |year=2005 |pmid=16414327|title=Mood, Depression, and Reproductive Hormones in the Menopausal Transition |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=118 Suppl 12B |pages=54–8 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.09.033 |issue=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rashid |first1=T. |last2=Heider |first2=I. |title=Life Events and Depression |year=2008 |journal=Annals of Punjab Medical College |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=http://www.pmc.edu.pk/Downloads/apmc/apmc_v2n1/Life%20Events%20And%20Depression.pdf |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | author = [[Douglas A.

===Medical treatments===

Certain medications are known to cause depressed mood in a significant number of patients. These include medications for [[hepatitis C]] (such as [[interferon]]), [[Anxiolytics|anxiety]] and [[Hypnotics|sleep]] (such as [[Mood disorder#Substance-induced|benzodiazepines]] like [[alprazolam]], [[clonazepam]], [[lorazepam]] and [[diazepam]]), [[Antihypertensives|high blood pressure]] (such as [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[methyldopa]], [[reserpine]]), and hormonal treatments (such as [[corticosteroid]]s, [[contraceptives]]).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition.|last = American Psychiatric Association|first = |publisher = American Psychiatric Association|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Arlington, VA|pages = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ehret M, Sobieraj DM |title=Prevention of interferon-alpha-associated depression with antidepressant medications in patients with hepatitis C virus: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Int.

=== Substance-induced ===
Several [[Substance abuse|drugs of abuse]] can cause or exacerbate depression, whether in intoxication, withdrawal, and from chronic use. These include [[alcohol]], [[sedative]]s (including prescription [[Mood disorder#Substance-induced|benzodiazepines]]),  [[opioid]]s (including [[Analgesic|prescription pain killers]] and illicit drugs like [[heroin]]), [[stimulant]]s (such as [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]]), [[hallucinogen]]s, and [[inhalants]].<ref name=":0" /> While many often report self-medicating depression with these substances, improvements in depression from drugs are usually short-lived (with worsening of depression in the long-term, sometimes as soon as the drug effects wear off) and tend to be exaggerated (e.g., "many people report [[euphoria]] after the fact with alcohol intoxication, even though at the time of intoxication they were tearful and agitated").<ref name=":1" />

=== Psychiatric syndromes ===
{{Main|Mood disorder#Depressive disorders|l1=Depressive mood disorders}}

A number of psychiatric syndromes feature depressed mood as a main symptom. The [[mood disorder]]s are a group of disorders considered to be primary disturbances of mood. These include [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD; commonly called major depression or clinical depression) where a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities; and [[dysthymia]], a state of chronic depressed mood, the symptoms of which do not meet the severity of a [[major depressive episode]]. Another mood disorder, [[bipolar disorder]], features one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood, [[cognition]] and energy levels, but may also involve one or more episodes of depression.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabbard |first=Glen O. |title=Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders |edition=3rd |volume=2 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=[[Washington, DC]] |page=1296}}</ref> When the course of depressive episodes follows a seasonal pattern, the disorder (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.) may be described as a [[seasonal affective disorder]].
Outside the mood disorders: [[borderline personality disorder]] often features an extremely intense depressive mood; [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode;<ref name="psychiatric355">{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision: DSM-IV-TR |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=[[Washington, DC]] |year=2000a |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |ref= CITEREFAmerican_Psychiatric_Association2000a}}</ref>{{rp|355}} and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], an [[anxiety disorder]] that sometimes follows trauma, is commonly accompanied by depressed mood.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vieweg |first1=W.

=== Historical legacy ===
{{main|Dispossession, oppression and depression}}
Researchers have begun to conceptualize ways in which the historical legacies of racism and colonialism may create depressive conditions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cvetkovich|first1=Ann|title=Depression: A Public Feeling|date=2012|publisher=Duke University Press Books|location=Durham, NC|isbn=0822352389}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=William T.L.|last2=Abramson|first2=Lyn Y.|last3=Devine|first3=Patricia G.|last4=Hollon|first4=Steven D.|title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=5|pages=427|date=2012|doi=10.1177/1745691612455204|pmid=26168502}}</ref>

==Assessment==
Questionnaires and checklists such as the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] or the [[Children's Depression Inventory]] can be used by a [[mental health provider]] to help detect, and assess the severity of depression.<ref>Kovacs, M. (1992).  ''Children's Depression Inventory.'' North Tonawanda, NY: Multi-Health Systems, Inc.</ref>

==Treatment==
{{main|Management of depression}}
Depressed mood may not require professional treatment, and may be a normal reaction to life events, a symptom of some medical condition, or a [[side effect]] of some drugs or medical treatments.  A prolonged depressed mood, especially in combination with other symptoms, may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment.<ref>Cheog J et al. (Last reviewed 26 August 2010). [http://psychcentral.com/library/depression_faq.htm Frequently Asked Questions About Depression]. PsychCentral.com. Retrieved 11 May 2013</ref>  Different sub-divisions of depression have different treatment approaches.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20101010200401/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12329/45890/45890.pdf Depression]. UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) October 2009.</ref>
In the United States, it has been estimated that two thirds of people with depression do not actively seek treatment.<ref>[http://www.psychiatry.wustl.edu/depression/depression_facts.htm Depression Facts]. Psychiatry.wustl.edu. Retrieved on 2015-11-24.</ref> The World Health Organisation (WHO) has predicted that by 2030, depression will account for the highest level of disability accorded any physical or mental disorder in the world (WHO, 2008).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychology.org.au/publications/inpsych/2012/february/manicavasagar/|title=Australian Psychological Society : A review of depression diagnosis and management|website=www.psychology.org.au|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref>

The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.<ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/chapter/key-priorities-for-implementation NICE guidelines, published October 2009]. Nice.org.uk. Retrieved on 2015-11-24.</ref> The treatment of depression is best managed by lifestyle choices, which includes, diet, sleep and exercise.

== Sex differences ==
{{main|Sex differences in depression}}
Women have a higher rate of major depression than men. While women have a greater proportion of somatic symptoms, such as appetite, sleep disturbances and fatigue accompanied by pain and anxiety, than men, the gender difference is much smaller in other aspects of depression.<ref name=Psychiatryonline>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.6.1051|pmid=12042198|title=Gender Differences in the Prevalence of Somatic Versus Pure Depression: A Replication|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=159|issue=6|pages=1051–2|year=2002|last1=Silverstein|first1=Brett}}</ref>  Instances of suicide in men is much greater than in women. In a report by Lund University in Sweden and Stanford University, it was shown that men commit suicide at a rate almost three times that of women in Sweden, and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and [[National Center for Injury Prevention and Control]] report that the rate in the US is almost four times as many males as females.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nauert|first1=Rick|title=Men's Suicide Rate is 3 times that of Women|url= http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/06/11/mens-suicide-rate-is-3-times-that-of-women/55897.html|website=Psychcentral.com}}</ref> However, women have higher rates of suicide ideation and attempts.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} The difference is attributed to men choosing more effective methods resulting in the higher rate of success.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling|first1=Jennifer|title=A Gendered Analysis of Sex Differences in Suicide-Related Behaviors:|publisher=University of South Alabama}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=AFSP|title=Facts and Figures|url= https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures|website=AFSP|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> This research would suggest that woman are more likely to discuss their depression, whereas men are more likely to try and hide it.  The culture of women being more free to express then men, could be a contributing factor to this phenomenon.
