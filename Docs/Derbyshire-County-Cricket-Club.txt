'''Derbyshire County Cricket Club''' is one of eighteen [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket|county clubs]] within the domestic [[cricket]] structure of [[England]] and [[Wales]]. It represents the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Derbyshire]]. Its limited overs team is called the '''Derbyshire Falcons''' in reference to the famous [[peregrine falcon]] which nests on the [[Derby Cathedral]] (it was previously called the Derbyshire Scorpions until 2005 and the Phantoms until 2010).<ref>{{cite web |title=Derbyshire to take on Falcons title |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/domestic/counties/derbyshire/derbyshire-take-on-falcons-title,307245,EN.html |work=ECB website |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> Founded in 1870, the club had major status from its first match in 1871: i.e., classified as an ''unofficial'' [[first-class cricket|first-class]] team by substantial sources from 1871 to 1887. Because of poor performances and lack of fixtures in some seasons, Derbyshire then lost its status for seven seasons until it was invited into the [[County Championship]] in 1895.<ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |first= |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 – 1863|year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |first= |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}</ref> Derbyshire is classified as an ''official'' first-class team from 1895 by [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and the County Championship clubs;<ref>Birley, p. 145.</ref> classified as a [[List A]] team since the beginning of [[limited overs cricket]] in 1963;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/78/List_A_Events.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=List A events played by Derbyshire |accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref> and classified as a major [[Twenty20]] team since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/78/Twenty20_Events.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Twenty20 events played by Derbyshire |accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>

The club is based at the [[County Cricket Ground, Derby|County Cricket Ground]], previously known as the Racecourse Ground, in the city of [[Derby]]. In 2006, for the first time in eight years, County Cricket returned to [[Queen's Park, Chesterfield]] with a [[County Championship]] game against [[Worcester]] and a [[National League (cricket)|One Day League]] game against [[Surrey]]. Other [[first-class cricket]] grounds used in the past have included [[Buxton]], [[Recreation Ground (Chesterfield)|Saltergate in Chesterfield]], [[Heanor]], [[Ilkeston]], [[Blackwell, Bolsover|Blackwell]], [[Abbeydale Park]] in [[Sheffield]], [[Wirksworth]] and [[Burton upon Trent]] (3 grounds), which is actually in Staffordshire. One-day contests have been played at [[Darley Dale]], [[Repton School]], [[Trent College]], [[Leek, Staffordshire]] and [http://knypersley.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp Knypersley] (also in Staffordshire).

==History==

===Earliest cricket in Derbyshire===
Cricket may not have reached Derbyshire until the 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket in the county is a match in September 1757 between Wirksworth and [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] at Brampton Moor, near [[Chesterfield]].

===Origin of club===
The formation of Derbyshire County Cricket Club took place on 4 November 1870 at a meeting in the Guildhall, Derby. The [[George Stanhope, 7th Earl of Chesterfield|Earl of Chesterfield]] who had played for and against all England was the first President, G. H. Strutt was Vice-President and [[Walter Boden]], who had campaigned for the club's foundation for three years, was secretary. When Chesterfield died the following year, [[William Jervis]] became president.<ref>Ric Sissons ''The Players'' 1988</ref>

[[Derbyshire county cricket opening season|Derbyshire's opening season]] was 1871 when the club played its initial major match ''versus'' [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford Cricket Ground]] on 26 and 27 May 1871 and joined the (then unofficial) County Championship.

===Club history===
{{for|Derbyshire County Cricket Club season by season|Derbyshire County Cricket Club seasons}}

Although the club had some good results in its early seasons, it struggled for the most part and before the 1888 season, following a run of disastrous results, Derbyshire was demoted from first-class status, which was then based on the number of matches against other teams of similar standing. Derbyshire recovered first-class status in 1894 and rejoined the County Championship in 1895.

Although the county then had a quite strong team due to the bowling of [[George Davidson (cricketer)|George Davidson]], [[John Hulme (cricketer, born 1862)|Joseph Hulme]] and [[George Porter (cricketer)|George Porter]] and the batting and wicketkeeping of [[William Storer]], [[William Chatterton]] and Bagshaw, within three years they had hit rock-bottom, going through 1897 without a win due to their best bowlers losing their powers.

From this point up to 1925, Derbyshire were perennially among the weakest counties, losing every single match in 1920 despite the efforts of [[Samuel Cadman|Sam Cadman]] and [[Arthur Morton (cricketer, born 1883)|Arthur Morton]], persevering professionals. From 1926, the nucleus of a good team emerged around some doughty batting from [[Denis Smith (cricketer)|Denis Smith]], [[Stan Worthington]] and [[George Pope (cricketer)|George Pope]]. Pope's bowling and that of his brother [[Alf Pope|Alf]], leg spinner [[Thomas Mitchell (cricketer)|Tom Mitchell]] and seam bowler [[Bill Copson]] took the team to their one and so far only Championship victory in 1936. They won 13 of their 28 matches outright and five on first innings. Worthington, [[Les Townsend]], Smith and Alderman all passed 1,000 runs and Copson and Mitchell took over 100 wickets, with Alf Pope taking 94. [[Charlie Elliott]], who later became a test umpire and selector, was another member of this team which was captained by [[Arthur Walker Richardson|AW Richardson]].

There have been more downs than ups in post-war years. Though runs came regularly from [[Arnold Hamer]] and less consistently from the West Indian [[Laurie Johnson (cricketer)|Laurie Johnson]] and captain [[Donald Carr]], the batting remained the weak point right up to the beginning of covered pitches in the 1980s. However, a series of seam bowlers served England as well as Derbyshire. The list began with Copson and continued with [[Cliff Gladwin]], [[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]], [[Harold Rhodes (cricketer)|Harold Rhodes]], [[Alan Ward]], [[Mike Hendrick]] and, most recently [[Devon Malcolm]] and [[Dominic Cork]]. Spin was in short supply apart from the steady work of Edwin Smith and the under-rated allrounder [[Geoff Miller]], the current National selector of the England team and noted [[public speaking|after-dinner speaker]].<br />The signing of Eddie Barlow, the famous South African, in 1976 and the lengthy period under the captaincy of [[Kim Barnett]], starting in 1983, meant the side were rarely uncompetitive.

Derbyshire were crowned LV= County Championship Division Two champions in 2012 after securing a 6-wicket victory over Hampshire on the final day of the season at the County Ground, as Karl Krikken's side won promotion after securing more wins over the course of the season than Yorkshire who also finished the campaign on 194 points.

After the conclusion of the 2013 season, Derbyshire announced a new Elite Cricket Performance model in the next phase of the Club’s quest for sustainable on-field success across all three domestic competitions, combined with the desire to produce England cricketers. Former Derbyshire bowler [[Graeme Welch]] <ref>{{cite web | title = Start of a new era as Derbyshire attract Welch | publisher = Derbyshire County Cricket Club | date = 2014-01-07 | url = http://www.derbyshireccc.com/dccc/news-and-features/news-headlines/1210-the-start-of-a-new-era-as-derbyshire-attract-welch | accessdate = 2014-01-07}}</ref> was appointed the new Elite Cricket Performance Director in January 2014.
