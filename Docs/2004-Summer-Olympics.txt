The '''2004 Summer Olympic Games''' ({{lang-ell|Θερινοί Ολυμπιακοί Αγώνες 2004|link=no}}, {{transl|el|''Therinoí Olympiakoí Agó̱nes 2004''}}<ref>Standard [[Greek language|Greek]] pronunciation is {{IPA-el|θeriˈni olibi.aci aɣoˈnes ðio çiʎaˈðes tetraˈkosi.a|}}</ref>), officially known as the '''Games of the XXVIII Olympiad''' and commonly known as '''Athens 2004''', was a premier international [[multi-sport event]] held in [[Athens]], Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004 with the motto ''Welcome Home.'' 10,625 athletes competed,<ref name=olympics>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/athens-2004-summer-olympics|title=Athens 2004 |accessdate=19 January 2008 |work=International Olympic Committee |publisher=olympic.org}}</ref> some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries.<ref name=olympics/> There were 301 medal events in 28 different [[Olympic sports|sports]].<ref name=olympics/> Athens 2004 marked the first time since the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] that all countries with a [[National Olympic Committee]] were in attendance. 2004 marked the return of the games to the city where they began.

A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by [[Giuseppe Cassioli]] that had been used since the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Games]].  This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the [[Rome|Roman]] Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.<ref name="OM">[http://olympic-museum.de/w_medals/wmed1956.htm Winner Medals], Olympic Games Museum.

The final tally was led by the [[United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics|United States]], followed by [[China at the 2004 Summer Olympics|China]] and [[Russia at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Russia]] with host [[Greece at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Greece]] at 15th place. Several World and Olympics records were broken during the games. With little or no controversies, the games were deemed generally successful with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world.

==Host city selection==

{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics bids}}
[[Athens]] was chosen as the host city during the 106th IOC Session held in [[Lausanne]] on 5 September 1997.  Athens had lost its bid to organize the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] to [[Atlanta]] nearly seven years before on 18 September 1990, during the 96th IOC Session in Tokyo. 1996 coincided with the 100th Anniversary of the [[first modern Olympics]], which were also held in Athens. Under the direction of [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], Athens pursued another bid, this time for the right to host the Summer Olympics in 2004. The success of Athens in securing the 2004 Games was based largely on Athens' appeal to Olympic history and the emphasis that it placed on the pivotal role that [[Greece]] and [[Athens]] could play in promoting Olympism and the Olympic Movement. Furthermore; unlike their bid for the 1996 Games which was largely criticized for its overall disorganization and arrogance – wherein the bid lacked specifics and relied largely upon sentiment and the notion that it was Athens' right to organize the Centennial Games;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/19/sports/atlanta-selected-over-athens-for-1996-olympics.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2&pagewanted=print|title=Atlanta Selected Over Athens for 1996 Olympics|last=Weisman|first=Steven R.|date=19 September 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 September 2008}}</ref> the bid for the 2004 Games was lauded for its humility and earnestness, its focused message, and its detailed bid concept.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/athens-wins-2004-olympics-1237761.html|title=Athens wins 2004 Olympics|date=6 September 1997|first=Mike|last=Rowbottom|work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate=25 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The 2004 bid addressed concerns and criticisms raised in its unsuccessful 1996 bid – primarily Athens' infrastructural readiness, its air pollution, its budget, and politicization of Games preparations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/06/sports/athens-wins-a-vote-for-tradition-and-the-2004-olympics.html?pagewanted=print|title=Athens Wins a Vote for Tradition, and the 2004 Olympics|date=6 September 1997|first=Jere|last=Longman|newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=25 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Athens' successful organization of the [[1997 World Championships in Athletics]] the month before the host city election was also crucial in allaying lingering fears and concerns among the sporting community and some IOC members about its ability to host international sporting events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/sports/athens-pins-olympic-bid-to-world-meet.html?pagewanted=print|title=Athens Pins Olympic Bid to World Meet|last=Longman|first=Jere|date=3 August 1997|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 September 2008}}</ref> Another factor which also contributed to Athens' selection was a growing sentiment among some IOC members to restore the values of the Olympics to the Games, a component which they felt was lost during the heavily criticized over-commercialization of [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta 1996 Games]].<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/07/sports/athens-can-thank-atlanta-for-2004-games.html|title=Athens Can Thank Atlanta for 2004 Games|date=7 September 1997|first=Dave|last=Anderson|newspaper=New York Times| accessdate=25 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Subsequently, the selection of Athens was also motivated by a lingering sense of disappointment among IOC members regarding the numerous organizational and logistical setbacks experienced during the 1996 Games.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

After leading all voting rounds, Athens easily defeated Rome in the 5th and final vote. [[Cape Town]], Stockholm, and [[Buenos Aires]], the three other cities that made the IOC shortlist, were eliminated in prior rounds of voting. Six other cities submitted applications, but their bids were dropped by the IOC in 1996. These cities were [[Istanbul]], [[Lille]], Rio de Janeiro, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Seville]], and [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/athens/election_uk.asp |title=International Olympic Committee – Athens 2004 – Election |publisher=Olympic.org |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>

==Development and preparation==

=== Costs ===
The 2004 Summer Olympic Games cost the [[Government of Greece]] €8.954 billion to stage.<ref name=greekembassy>{{cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&folder=200&article=14269|title=Cost of Athens 2004 Olympics|accessdate=13 November 2004|work=Embassy of Greek |publisher=greekembassy.org}}</ref> According to the cost-benefit evaluation of the impact of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games presented to the Greek Parliament in January 2013 by the Minister of Finance Mr. Giannis Stournaras, the overall net economic benefit of the games for Greece was positive.<ref>https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.in.gr%2Feconomy%2Farticle%2F%3Faid%3D1231231141&edit-text=&act=url 'Net benefit for the economy' At 8.5 bn. Euros the total gross cost of the 2004 Olympic Games, www.in.gr, 18 January 2013, 11:04 GMT 13:04 GR</ref>

The Athens 2004 Organizing Committee (ATHOC), responsible for the preparation and organisation of the games, concluded its operations as a company in 2005 with a surplus of [[Euro|€]]130.6 million. ATHOC contributed €123.6 million of the surplus to the Greek State to cover other related expenditures of the Greek State in organizing of the games. As a result, ATHOC reported in its official published accounts a net profit of €7 million.<ref>https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.in.gr%2Fgreece%2Farticle%2F%3Faid%3D623342&edit-text=&act=url Surplus 7 million presents the financial report of "Athens 2004", www.in.gr, www.in.gr, 12 May. 2005, 20:27 GMT 22:27 GR</ref><ref>http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wHrZvzjsKBkq3dtvSoClrL8zT3FrY18BEMliYHTRwL0-OJInJ48_97uR_L9VDRJSMaAjkxp0HIviVTzBGm8pBsqXJHxrbqI-HQgiZ7qUS3x82Pu5V6JN8utNd0ZuKdojFmlcA2aw2QHX0_An54CB64IAJHlHThPXRF9RfwUyurZNrpJE1iF3HVv Published Accounts of the ATHENS 2004 Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, Greek Official Gazette, FEK5395/2005</ref> The State’s contribution to the total ATHOC budget was 8% of its expenditure against an originally anticipated 14%.

The overall revenue of ATHOC, including income from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc., totalled €2,098.4 million. The largest percentage of that income (38%) came from broadcasting rights. The overall expenditure of ATHOC was €1,967.8 million.

Often analysts refer to the "Cost of the Olympic Games" by taking into account not only the Organizing Committee’s budget (i.e. the organizational cost) directly related to the Olympic Games, but also the cost incurred by the hosting country during preparation, i.e. the large projects required for the upgrade of the country’s infrastructure, including sports infrastructure, roads, airports, hospitals, power grid etc. This cost, however, is not directly attributable to the actual organisation of the Games. Such infrastructure projects are considered by all fiscal standards as fixed asset investments that stay with the hosting country for decades after the Games. Also, in many cases these infrastructure upgrades would have taken place regardless of hosting the Olympic Games, although the latter may have acted as a "catalyst".

It was in this sense that the Greek Ministry of Finance reported in 2013 that the expenses of the Greek state for the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, including both infrastructure and organizational costs, reached the amount of €8.5 billion. The same report further explains that €2 billion of this amount was covered by the revenue of the ATHOC (from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc.) and that another €2 billion was directly invested in upgrading hospitals and archaeological sites.
Therefore, the net infrastructure costs related to the preparation of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games was €4.5 billion, substantially lower than the reported estimates,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3770981.stm Olympics 'may cost Greece dear' bbc.co.uk, Wednesday, 2 June 2004, 16:57 GMT 17:57 UK]</ref> and mainly included long-standing fixed asset investments in numerous municipal and transport infrastructures.

On the revenue side, the same report estimates that incremental tax revenues of approximately €3.5 billion arose from the increased activities caused by the Athens 2004 Olympic Games during the period 2000 to 2004. These tax revenues were paid directly to the Greek state specifically in the form of incremental social security contributions, income taxes and VAT tax paid by all the companies, professionals, and service providers that were directly involved with the Olympic Games.  Moreover, it is reported that the Athens 2004 Olympic Games have had a great economic growth impact on the tourism sector, one of the pillars of the Greek economy, as well as in many other sectors.

The final verdict on the cost of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, in the words of the Greek Minister of Finance, is that "as a result from the cost-benefit analysis, we reach the conclusion that there has been a net economic benefit from the Olympic Games"

By late March 2004, some Olympic projects were still behind schedule, and Greek authorities announced that a roof it had initially proposed as an optional, non-vital addition to the Aquatics Center would no longer be built. The main Olympic Stadium, the designated facility for the opening and closing ceremonies, was completed only two months before the games opened.  This stadium was completed with a retractable glass roof designed by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]]. The same architect also designed the [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex#Athens Olympic Velodrome|Velodrome]] and other facilities.
[[File:Athens Olympic Outdoor Aquatic Center.jpg|thumb|left|The Olympic Outdoor Aquatic Center]]
Infrastructure, such as the [[tram|tram line]] linking venues in southern Athens with the city proper, and numerous venues were considerably behind schedule just two months before the games. The subsequent pace of preparation, however, made the rush to finish the Athens venues one of the tightest in Olympics history. The Greeks, unperturbed, maintained that they would make it all along. By July/August 2004, all venues were delivered: in August, the Olympic Stadium was officially completed and opened, joined or preceded by the official completion and openings of other venues within the [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex]] (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko.

[[File:Athens Velodrome.JPG|thumb|The Athens Olympic Velodrome during the Olympic games of 2004]]

Late July and early August witnessed the [[Athens Tram]] become operational, and this system provided additional connections to those already existing between Athens and its waterfront communities along the [[Saronic Gulf]].  These communities included the port city of [[Piraeus]], Agios Kosmas (site of the sailing venue), Helliniko (the site of the old international airport which now contained the fencing venue, the canoe/kayak slalom course, the 15,000-seat [[Helliniko Olympic Arena|Helliniko Olympic Basketball Arena]], and the softball and baseball stadia), and the [[Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex]] (site of the taekwondo, handball, indoor volleyball, and beach volleyball venues, as well as the newly reconstructed [[Karaiskaki Stadium]] for football). The upgrades to the Athens Ring Road were also delivered just in time, as were the expressway upgrades connecting Athens proper with peripheral areas such as Markopoulo (site of the shooting and equestrian venues), the newly constructed [[Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]], Schinias (site of the rowing venue), Maroussi (site of the OAKA), Parnitha (site of the Olympic Village), Galatsi (site of the rhythmic gymnastics and table tennis venue), and Vouliagmeni (site of the triathlon venue). The upgrades to the [[Athens Metro]] were also completed, and the new lines became operational by mid-summer.

[[EMI]] released ''Unity'', the official pop album of the Athens Olympics, in the leadup to the Olympics.<ref name=unity/> It features contributions from [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Moby]], [[Destiny's Child]], and [[Avril Lavigne]].<ref name=unity/> EMI has pledged to donate [[US dollar|US$]]180,000 from the album to [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]'s HIV/AIDS program in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref name=unity>{{cite news|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/music/sleeve/notes.asp?file=archives/sleeve/2004/5/26/26UnityOlymp&date=5/26/2004/2 |title=Unity Olympics Album |work=The Star Online eCentral |year=2004 |accessdate=16 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033643/http://www.star-ecentral.com:80/music/sleeve/notes.asp?file=archives/sleeve/2004/5/26/26UnityOlymp&date=5/26/2004/2 |archivedate=22 April 2008 }} </ref>

At least 14 people died during the work on the facilities. Most of these people were not from Greece.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3920919.stm |title=Workers in peril at Athens sites |work=BBC News |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=16 August 2008}}</ref>

Before the games, Greek hotel staff staged a series of one-day strikes over wage disputes. They had been asking for a significant raise for the period covering the event being staged. [[Paramedic]]s and ambulance drivers also protested.  They claimed to have the right to the same Olympic bonuses promised to their security force counterparts.

The lighting ceremony of the [[Olympic flame]] took place on 25 March in [[Olympia, Greece|Ancient Olympia]]. For the first time ever, the flame travelled around the world in a [[2004 Olympic Torch Relay|relay]] to [[Sydney|former]], [[Beijing|next]], [[London|and]] [[Rio de Janeiro|later]] Olympic cities and other large cities, before returning to Greece.

==Mascots==

[[File:Athens athena model.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mascots were based on this clay model at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]
[[File:Athens athena toy.jpg|thumb|upright|A plush mascot]]

[[Olympic mascot|Mascots]] have been a tradition at the Olympic Games since the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]], France.  The Athens games had two official mascots: ''[[Athiná]]'' and ''[[Phévos]]'' (pronounced in Greek, Athina and Fivos).  The sister and brother were named after Athena, [[Athena|the goddess of wisdom, strategy and war]], and Phoebus, [[Phoebus|the god of light and music]], respectively. They were inspired by the ancient [[daidala]], which were dolls that had religious connotations as well as being toys.

==Online coverage==
For the first time, major broadcasters were allowed to serve video coverage of the Olympics over the Internet, provided that they restricted this service geographically, to protect broadcasting contracts in other areas. For instance, the [[BBC]] made their complete live coverage available to UK high-speed Internet customers for free; customers in the U.S. were only able to receive delayed excerpts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pfanner |first=Eric |title=Athens Games beating Sydney in TV race |work=International Herald Tribune |date=30 August 2004 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/08/30/tv30_ed3_.php |accessdate=18 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070912020526/http://www.iht.com:80/articles/2004/08/30/tv30_ed3_.php |archivedate=12 September 2007 }}</ref> The International Olympic Committee forbade Olympic athletes, as well as coaches, support personnel and other officials, from setting up specialized [[weblog]]s and/or other websites for covering their personal perspective of the games. They were not allowed to post audio, video, or photos that they had taken. An exception was made if an athlete already has a personal website that was not set up specifically for the Games.<ref>{{cite news |title=You're Athletes, Not Journalists |publisher=Wired News |date=20 August 2004 |url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64650,00.html |accessdate=18 August 2006| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5Ppo9LSLA | archivedate = 24 June 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref> [[NBC]] launched its own Olympic website, NBCOlympics.com. Focusing on the television coverage of the games, it did provide video clips, medal standings, live results. Its main purpose, however, was to provide a schedule of what sports were on the many stations of NBC Universal. The games were on TV 24 hours a day on one network or another.

==Technology==
[[File:TOC-01.jpg|thumb|View of the ATHOC Technology Operations Center during the Games.]]
[[File:Boeing 737-484, Olympic AN0399495.jpg|thumb|left|[[Olympic Airlines]] Boeing 737-484 decorated with the colours of the 2004 Olympics]]
As with any enterprise, the Organizing Committee and everyone involved with it relied heavily on technology in order to deliver a successful event. ATHOC maintained two separate data networks, one for the preparation of the Games (known as the Administrative network) and one for the Games themselves (Games Network). The technical infrastructure involved more than 11,000 computers, over 600 [[server (computing)|servers]], 2,000 [[Computer printer|printers]], 23,000 fixed-line telephone devices, 9,000 mobile phones, 12,000 [[TETRA]] devices, 16,000 TV and video devices and 17 Video Walls interconnected by more than 6,000&nbsp;kilometers of cabling (both [[optical fiber]] and [[twisted pair]]).

This infrastructure was created and maintained to serve directly more than 150,000 ATHOC Staff, Volunteers, Olympic family members ([[IOC]], [[National Olympic Committee|NOCs]], Federations), Partners & Sponsors and Media. It also kept the information flowing for all spectators, TV viewers, Website visitors and news readers around the world, prior and during the Games. The Media Center was located inside the [[Zappeion]] which is a Greek national exhibition center.

Between June and August 2004, the technology staff worked in the Technology Operations Center (TOC) from where it could centrally monitor and manage all the devices and flow of information, as well as handle any problems that occurred during the Games. The TOC was organized in teams (e.g. Systems, Telecommunications, Information Security, Data Network, Staffing, etc.) under a TOC Director and corresponding team leaders (Shift Managers). The TOC operated on a 24x7 basis with personnel organized into 12-hour shifts.

==The Games==

===Opening Ceremony===
[[File:Olympic flame at opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic Flame]] at the Opening Ceremony]]
{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony}}
The widely praised Opening Ceremony Directed by avant garde choreographer [[Dimitris Papaioannou]] and Produced by Jack Morton Worldwide led by Project Director David Zolkwer was held on 13 August 2004. It began with a twenty eight (the number of the Olympiads up to then) second countdown paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/sports/olympics/29closing.html?ex=1148788800&en=1c65a34c3766781c&ei=5070&pagewanted=print|title=Master of Olympic Pageantry Prepares One Final Blowout|date=29 August 2004|newspaper=New York Times|agency=Associated Press| accessdate=25 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> As the countdown was completed, fireworks rumbled and illuminated the skies overhead. After a drum corps and bouzouki players joined in an opening march, the video screen showed images of flight, crossing southwest from Athens over the Greek countryside to ancient Olympia. Then, a single drummer in the ancient stadium joined in a drum duet with a single drummer in the main stadium in Athens, joining the original ancient Olympic games with the modern ones in symbolism. At the end of the drum duet, a single flaming arrow was launched from the video screen (symbolically from ancient Olympia) and into the reflecting pool, which resulted in fire erupting in the middle of the stadium creating a burning image of the Olympic rings rising from the pool. The Opening Ceremony was a pageant of traditional Greek culture and history hearkening back to its mythological beginnings. The program began as a young Greek boy sailed into the stadium on a 'paper-ship' waving the host nation's flag to [[:wikt:aethereal|aethereal]] music by [[Hadjidakis]] and then a [[centaur]] appeared, followed by a gigantic head of a [[cycladic]] figurine which eventually broke into many pieces symbolising the Greek islands. Underneath the cycladic head was a Hellenistic representation of the human body, reflecting the concept and belief in perfection reflected in Greek art. A man was seen balancing on a hovering cube symbolising man's eternal 'split' between passion and reason followed by a couple of young lovers playfully chasing each other while the god [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] was hovering above them. There followed a very colourful float parade chronicling Greek history from the ancient [[Minoan civilization]] to modern times.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Greek 2004 Olympics Footage (Squence).jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|This Ceremony Showing The Kotinos Appearing On Screen]] -->
Although [[NBC]] in the United States presented the entire opening ceremony from start to finish, a topless Minoan priestess was shown only briefly, the breasts having been [[pixelation|pixelated]] digitally in order to avoid controversy (as the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|"Nipplegate"]] incident was still fresh in viewer's minds at the time) and potential fines by the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. Also, lower frontal nudity of men dressed as ancient Greek statues was shown in such a way that the area below the waist was cut off by the bottom of the screen. In most other countries presenting the broadcast, there was no censorship of the ceremony.

Following the artistic performances, a parade of nations entered the stadium with over 10,500 athletes walking under the banners of 201 nations. The nations were arranged according to [[Greek alphabet]] making [[Finland]], Fiji, [[Chile]], and Hong Kong the last four to enter the stadium before the Greek delegation. On this occasion, in observance of the tradition that the delegation of Greece opens the parade and the host nation closes it, the Greek flag bearer opened the parade and all the Greek delegation closed it. Based on audience reaction, the emotional high point of the parade was the entrance of the delegation from [[Afghanistan]] which had been absent from the Olympics and had female competitors for the first time. The [[Iraq]]i delegation also stirred emotions. Also recognized was the symbolic unified march of athletes from [[North Korea]] and South Korea under the [[Korea]]n [[Unification Flag]]. The country of [[Kiribati]] made a debut at these games and [[East Timor]] made a debut under its own flag. After the Parade of Nations, during which the Dutch [[Tiësto|DJ Tiësto]] provided the music, the [[Iceland]]ic singer [[Björk]] performed the song [[Oceania (song)|Oceania]], written specially for the event by her and the poet [[Sjón]].

The Opening Ceremony culminated in the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron by 1996 Gold Medalist Windsurfer [[Nikolaos Kaklamanakis]]. Many key moments in the ceremony, including the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron, featured music composed and arranged by [[John Psathas]]<ref>{{cite web|title=SOUNZ  – NZ composer – John Psathas |url=http://sounz.org.nz/contributor/composer/1017|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ix23KRGb|archivedate=11 August 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 August 2009}}</ref> from New Zealand. The gigantic cauldron, which was styled after the Athens 2004 Olympic Torch, pivoted down to be lit by the 35-year-old, before slowly swinging up and lifting the flame high above the stadium. Following this, the stadium found itself at the centre of a rousing fireworks spectacular.

===Participating National Olympic Committees===
All [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) participated in the Athens Games, as was the case in 1996. Two new NOCs had been created since 1996 and made their debut at these Games ([[Kiribati at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Kiribati]] and [[Timor-Leste at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Timor-Leste]]).  Therefore, with the re-appearance of [[Afghanistan]] (missing the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]) the number of participating nations increased from 199 to 202. Also since 2000, Yugoslavia had changed its name to [[Serbia and Montenegro]] and its code from YUG to SCG. The number in parentheses indicates the number of participants each NOC contributed.

===Sports===
<!--

Editors, see User:Jared/2004 events for a list of events at these games, with links to all of the pages.

-->The sports featured at the 2004 Summer Olympics are listed below. Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of [[Aquatic sports|aquatics]], and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women's wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the [[Fencing (sport)#Sabre|sabre]]. American [[Kristin Heaston]], who led off the qualifying round of women's shotput became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia but Cuban [[Yumileidi Cumba]] became the first woman to win a gold medal there.

The demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/[[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]] event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.

===Closing Ceremony===
[[File:Athens 2004 Olympics Closing ceremony.jpg|thumb|Balloons falling at the Athens 2004 Olympics Closing ceremony]]
{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics closing ceremony}}
The Games were concluded on 29 August 2004. The closing ceremony was held at the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]], where the Games had been opened 16 days earlier. Around 70,000 people gathered in the stadium to watch the ceremony.

The initial part of the ceremony interspersed the performances of various Greek singers, and featured traditional Greek dance performances from various regions of Greece (Crete, Pontos, Thessaly, etc.). The event was meant to highlight the pride of the Greeks in their culture and country for the world to see.

A significant part of the closing ceremony was the exchange of the Olympic flag of the Antwerp games between the mayor of Athens and the mayor of Beijing, host city of the next Olympic games. After the flag exchange a presentation from the Beijing delegation presented a glimpse into Chinese culture for the world to see. [[Beijing University]] students (who were at first incorrectly cited as the [[Twelve Girls Band]]) sang [[Mo Li Hua]] (Jasmine Flower) and the medal ceremony for the last event of the Olympics, the [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|men's marathon]], was conducted, with [[Stefano Baldini]] from Italy as the winner. The bronze medal winner, [[Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima]] of Brazil, was simultaneously announced as a recipient of the [[Pierre de Coubertin medal]] for his bravery in finishing the race despite being attacked by a rogue spectator while leading with 7&nbsp;km to go.

A flag-bearer from each nation's delegation then entered along the stage, followed by the competitors ''en masse'' on the floor.

Short speeches were presented by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], President of the Organising Committee, and by President Dr. [[Jacques Rogge]] of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], in which he described the Athens Olympics as "unforgettable, dream Games".<ref name="ESPN"/>

Dr. Rogge had previously declared he would be breaking with tradition in his closing speech as President of the IOC and that he would never use the words of his predecessor [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], who used to always say 'these were the best ever games'.<ref name="ESPN"/> Dr. Rogge had described [[2002 Winter Olympics|Salt Lake City 2002]] as "superb games" and in turn would continue after Athens 2004 and describe [[2006 Winter Olympics|Turin 2006]] as "truly magnificent games."

The national anthems [[Hymn to Liberty|of Greece]] and [[March of the Volunteers|China]] were played in a handover ceremony as both nations' flags were raised. The [[Mayor of Athens]], [[Dora Bakoyianni]], passed the Olympic Flag to the [[Mayor of Beijing]], [[Wang Qishan]]. After a short cultural performance by Chinese actors, dancers, and musicians directed by eminent Chinese director [[Zhang Yimou]], Rogge declared the 2004 Olympic Games closed. The Olympic flag was next raised again on 10 February 2006 during the [[2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony of next Winter Olympic games]] in [[Turin|Torino]].

A young Greek girl, Fotini Papaleonidopoulou, lit a symbolic lantern with the [[Olympic Flame]] and passed it on to other children before "extinguishing" the flame in the cauldron by blowing a puff of air. The ceremony ended with a variety of musical performances by Greek singers, including [[Dionysis Savvopoulos]], [[George Dalaras]], [[Haris Alexiou]], [[Anna Vissi]], [[Sakis Rouvas]], [[Eleftheria Arvanitaki]], Alkistis Protopsalti, [[Antonis Remos]], [[Michalis Hatzigiannis]], [[Marinella]] and Dimitra Galani, as thousands of athletes carried out symbolic displays on the stadium floor.

To commemorate the games, a series of [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Greek high value euro collectors' coins]] were minted by the Mint of Greece, in both silver and gold.  The pieces depict landmarks in Greece as well as ancient and modern sports on the obverse of the coin.  On the reverse, a common motif with the logo of the games, circled by an olive branch representing the spirit of the games.

Preparations to stage the Olympics led to a number of positive developments for the city's infrastructure.  These improvements included the establishment of [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]], a modern new international airport serving as Greece's main aviation gateway;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aia.gr/pages.asp?pageid=5&langid=2 |title=The Company |publisher=Aia.gr |date=28 March 2001 |accessdate=15 March 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218151043/http://www.aia.gr/pages.asp?pageid=5&langid=2| archivedate= 18 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> expansions to the [[Athens Metro]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ametro.gr/page/default.asp?la=1&id=376 |title=AttikoMetro Inside |publisher=Ametro.gr |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211142041/http://www.ametro.gr/page/default.asp?la=1&id=376| archivedate= 11 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> system; the "[[Athens Tram|Tram]]", a new metropolitan tram (light rail) system<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tramsa.gr/ |title=Tram Sa |publisher=Tramsa.gr |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323163748/http://www.tramsa.gr/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> system; the "[[Proastiakos]]", a new suburban railway system linking the airport and suburban towns to the city of Athens; the "[[Attiki Odos]]", a new toll motorway encircling the city,<ref>http://www.aodos.gr/article.asp?catid=12069&tag=7275  {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.aodos.gr/article.asp?catid=12069&tag=7275|date =20090111094933}}</ref> and the conversion of streets into pedestrianized walkways in the historic center of Athens which link several of the city's main tourist sites, including the [[Parthenon]] and the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] (the site of the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games in 1896]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minenv.gr/4/44/4401/440102/44010202/e4401020202.html |title=Unification of Archaeological Sites in the Centre of Athens |publisher=Minenv.gr |date=4 November 1995 |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=csm>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0721/p04s01-wogn.html |title=As Olympic Glow Fades, Athens Questions $15 Billion Cost |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>  All of the above infrastructure is still in use to this day, and there have been continued expansions and proposals to expand Athens' metro, tram, suburban rail and motorway network, the airport, as well as further plans to pedestrianize more thoroughfares in the historic center of Athens.

As of 2012 many conversion schemes have stalled owing to the [[Greek government-debt crisis]].

==Post-competition developments==
On 6 December 2012, the [[IOC]] stripped medals from four athletes caught doping at the 2004 Athens Olympics including one gold medalist and postponed a decision to revoke [[Lance Armstrong]]'s bronze from the [[2000 Sydney Games]]. The IOC also disqualified four athletes whose Athens doping samples were retested earlier in the year and came back positive, including shot put gold medalist [[Yuriy Bilonog]] of [[Ukraine]]. The others are [[hammer throw]] silver medalist [[Ivan Tskikhan]] of [[Belarus]] and two bronze medalists, women's [[shot put]]ter [[Svetlana Krivelyova]] of [[Russia]] and [[discus]] thrower [[Irina Yatchenko]] of Belarus.
The case of a fifth bronze medalist, [[weightlifter]] [[Oleg Perepechenov]] of [[Russia]], remains pending.<ref>{{cite web|title=Four Athens athletes have medals stripped|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/8043149/Four-Athens-athletes-have-medals-stripped|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref>
