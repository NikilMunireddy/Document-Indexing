'''Arlington National Cemetery''' is a [[United States national cemetery|United States military cemetery]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], across the [[Potomac River]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], in whose {{convert|624|acre}} the dead of the nation's conflicts have been buried, beginning with the [[American Civil War]], as well as reinterred dead from earlier wars.

The cemetery was established during the Civil War on the grounds of [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], which had been the estate of the family of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Robert E. Lee]]'s wife [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna (Custis) Lee]] (a great-granddaughter of [[Martha Washington]]).  The cemetery, along with Arlington House, [[Memorial Drive (Arlington National Cemetery)|Memorial Drive]], the [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial|Hemicycle]], and the [[Arlington Memorial Bridge]], form the '''Arlington National Cemetery Historic District''', listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20140418.htm|title=Weekly list of actions take: 04//07/14 to 04/11/14|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Smith|first2=Megan|last2=Tooker|first3=Susan, US Army Corps of Engineers, ERDC-CERL, Champaign, Illinois|last3=Enscore|date=2013-01-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904235704/http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/14000146.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-04|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/14000146.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form: Arlington National Cemetery Historic District|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-03-29}}</ref>  Like nearly all federal installations in Arlington County, it has a Washington, D.C. mailing address.

==History==
[[File:East front of Arlington Mansion (General Lee's home), with Union soldiers on the lawn, 06-28-1864 - NARA - 533118.jpg|thumb|right||Custis Lee Mansion with Union soldiers on lawn]]
[[George Washington Parke Custis]], grandson of [[Martha Washington]], acquired the land that now is Arlington National Cemetery in 1802, and began construction of [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]]. The estate passed to Custis' daughter, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna]], who had married [[United States Army]] officer [[Robert E. Lee]]. Custis' will gave a "life inheritance" to Mary Lee, allowing her to live at and run Arlington Estate for the rest of her life but not enabling her to sell any portion of it.<ref name="Landscape62">[http://web.archive.org/web/20140413180731/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 62.]</ref> Upon her death, the Arlington estate passed to her eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee.<ref name="Landscape62" />

When Virginia seceded from the Union at the start of the [[American Civil War]], Robert E. Lee resigned his commission on April 20, 1861, and took command of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Virginia, later becoming commander of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]].<ref name="Warner">{{cite book| author=Ezra J.

At the outbreak of the Civil War, most military personnel who died in battle near Washington, D.C., were buried at the [[United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery|United States Soldiers' Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C., or [[Alexandria National Cemetery (Alexandria, Virginia)|Alexandria Cemetery]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], but by late 1863 both were nearly full.<ref name="Landscape84" /> On July 16, 1862, Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead, and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program.<ref name="Landscape84">[http://web.archive.org/web/20140413180731/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 84.]</ref> In May 1864, Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]]. [[Quartermaster General of the United States Army|Quartermaster General]] [[Montgomery C. Meigs (1816–1892)|Montgomery C. Meigs]] ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area.<ref name="Landscape84" /> The property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves), it had a view of the District of Columbia, and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the Confederate States of America, and denying Robert E. Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration.<ref name="Landscape88">[http://web.archive.org/web/20140413180731/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 88.]</ref> The first military burial at Arlington, for [[William Henry Christman]], was made on May 13, 1864,<ref name="Landscape86">[http://web.archive.org/web/20140413180731/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 86.]</ref> close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27.<ref name="Dennee4">[http://www.freedmenscemetery.org/resources/documents/arlington-section27.pdf Dennee, p. 4.] Accessed 2012-07-09.</ref> However, Meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until June 15, 1864.<ref name="Landscape85">[http://web.archive.org/web/20140413180731/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 85.]</ref> The first African-American to be buried there was William H.

The government acquired Arlington at a tax sale in 1864 for $26,800, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|26800|1864|r=-4}}}} today.<ref name="hughes">{{cite book |title=Bivouac of the Dead |author=Hughes, Mark |year=1995 |publisher=Heritage Books |page=265| isbn=978-0-7884-0260-9}}</ref> Mrs. Lee had not appeared in person but rather had sent an agent, attempting to pay the $92.07 in property taxes (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|92.07|1864|r=-2}}}} today) assessed on the estate in a timely manner.<ref name="arlingtoncemetery.org">{{cite web| title=Historical Information| publisher=Arlington National Cemetery| date=| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/historical_information/arlington_house.html | accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref> The government turned away her agent, refusing to accept the tendered payment. In 1874, [[Custis Lee]], heir under his grandfather's will passing the estate in trust to his mother, sued the United States claiming ownership of Arlington. In December, 1882, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Lee's favor in ''[[United States v. Lee]]'', deciding that Arlington had been confiscated without due process.<ref name="arlingtoncemetery.org"/> After that decision, Congress returned the estate to him, and on March 3, 1883,<ref>(1) http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/History/Facts/ArlingtonHouse.aspx<br>(2){{cite wikisource|title=United States v.

The southern portion of the land now occupied by the cemetery was used during and after the Civil War as a settlement for freed slaves. More than 1,100 freed slaves were given land at Freedman's Village by the government, where they farmed and lived during and after the Civil War. They were evicted in 1888 when the estate was repurchased by the government and dedicated as a military installation.

President [[Herbert Hoover]] conducted the first national Memorial Day ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery, on May 30, 1929.<ref name="presidency">{{cite web| author=John T.

Beginning in 1992, Morrill Worcester donated thousands of wreaths around the end-of-year holiday season to be placed on graves at Arlington. He has since expanded his effort, now known as Wreaths Across America, and supplies wreaths to over 230 state and national cemeteries and veterans monuments across the country.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/1007/ Leipold, J.D.

===Recent expansion===
With limited space but large numbers of World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and other veterans dying and wanting to be buried at Arlington, the need for additional burial space at the cemetery became a pressing issue.  In 1990, cemetery superintendent [[John C. Metzler, Jr.]], implemented a $1.4 million plan to clear a former {{convert|13|acre}} parking lot to create space for new graves.<ref name="KaplowExpanded">{{cite news|last=Kaplow|first=Bobby|title=Arlington National Cemetery Being Expanded|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1991-10-24}}</ref>

The project also included converting {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of unused space and {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of maintenance property on the cemetery grounds into burial space in 2006 and 2007 to allow an additional 26,000 graves and 5,000 [[Cremation#Methods of keeping or disposing of the cremated remains|inurnments]].

In January 2013, [[Arlington County, Virginia]], signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Arlington Cemetery officials to expand the cemetery even further. Under the tentative plan, Arlington County will give up the [[easement]] for Southgate Road (which lies between the Navy Annex property and the cemetery's 2012 boundary), and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the Navy Annex site for a new Southgate Road. In exchange, the Department of Defense will give the Navy Annex parking lot to the county. Army land west of South Joyce Street to Columbia Pike would be transferred to the county as well. Additionally, roughly the northern half of the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] land bounded by South Joyce Street, Columbia Pike, and South Washington Boulevard would be conveyed by the state to the cemetery.  The [[cloverleaf interchange]] between Columbia Pike and S. Washington Blvd. would be eliminated, and the [[hairpin turn]] in Columbia Pike straightened, to provide a safer, more natural exit from S. Washington Blvd. onto Columbia Pike.

===150th anniversary===
In May 2014, Arlington National Cemetery celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding with a series of events, tours, and lectures.

During these celebrations, cemetery officials formally re-designated the Old Amphitheater as the [[James Tanner Amphitheater]]. [[James R. Tanner]] was a Union Army officer who lost both legs during the war. He later became a War Department stenographer, and recorded much of the early evidence in the investigation into the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]]. He later was active in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], a Union Army veterans group. Tanner is buried a few yards from the amphitheater.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/arlington-cemetery-to-rename-old-ampitheater-for-civil-war-double-amputee-james-tanner/2014/05/16/7c85add4-dd3b-11e3-bda1-9b46b2066796_story.html|last=Ruane|first=Michael E.|title=Arlington Cemetery to Rename Old Ampitheater for Civil War Double Amputee James Tanner|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref>

===Arlington Woods expansion controversy===
[[File:Looking NW at Arlington Woods - Section 29 - Arlington National Cemetery - 2013-01-18.jpg|thumb|A portion of Arlington Woods on Humphreys Drive]]
On February 22, 1995, officials of the [[United States Department of the Interior]] and the [[United States Department of the Army]] signed an agreement to transfer from Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, to the Army a part of Arlington Woods, which was located in Section 29 of the NPS at Arlington National Cemetery between Arlington House and [[Fort Myer]].<ref>(1) {{cite web|url=http://public.mapper.army.mil/ANC/ANCWeb/PublicWMV/ancWeb.html|title=Interactive map of Arlington National Cemetery showing Section 29 and Future Expansion Site|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery|accessdate=2012-12-26}}<br> (2) Coordinates of Section 29: {{coord|38.8820646|-77.0770195|format=dms|type:landmark|name=Section 29}}</ref> The property transfer, which involved {{convert|12|acre}} of NPS land, was intended to enable the Cemetery to increase its space for burials.<ref name=Wee/><ref name=Williams/><ref name=Hanna>{{cite journal|last=Hanna|first=Jennifer|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6D9veWmNm|archivedate=2012-12-24|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf|title=Arlington House: The Robert E.

Environmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the {{convert|24|acre}} remnant of an historically important stand of native trees.<ref name=Gearan/>  A historical marker near the woodland notes that, while visiting Arlington House in 1825, [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]] had warned [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis]], the wife of George Washington Parke Custis:  "Cherish these forest trees around your mansion.  Recollect how much easier it is to cut a tree than to make one grow."  The marker further notes that the Virginia Native Plant Society had recognized the woodland as being one of the best examples of old growth terraced gravel forest remaining in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6NGjR9WUw|archivedate=2014-02-09|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=11750|title="The Arlington Woodlands: Arlington House, The Robert E.

On September 23, 1996, Public Law 104-201 authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to transfer to the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] all of the land in Section 29 that was within an "Arlington National Cemetery Interment Zone" and some of the land in the Section that was within a "Robert E. Lee Memorial Preservation Zone".<ref name=law/><ref name=vogel /><ref name=Williams/>

On March 5, 1998, the NPS, which is a component of the Department of the Interior, informed the [[National Capital Planning Commission]] that it wanted to transfer only {{convert|4|acre}} to the Cemetery, rather than the {{convert|12|acre}} that the 1995 agreement had described.  In response, Metzler stated:  "I was surprised. But we will continue to work with the Department of Interior and see what happens."<ref name=Wee/>

On July 12, 1999, the NPS issued a [[Federal Register]] notice that announced the availability of an [[environmental impact assessment#United States|environmental assessment]] (EA) for the transfer.<ref name=Hanna/><ref name=assessment1>{{cite journal|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6D9yhumVz|archivedate=2012-12-24|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-07-12/pdf/99-17523.pdf|format=pdf|title=Notice: Environmental Assessment of Proposed Land Transfer, Arlington House — The Robert E.

This forest was the same type that once covered the Arlington estate, and had regenerated from trees that were present historically.  A forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old.  The Interment Zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources, in addition to those in the Preservation Zone.<ref name=assessment1/>  The EA described four alternative courses of action.<ref name=assessment1/>

In contrast to the NPS's March 1998 statement to the National Capital Planning Commission, the 1999 EA stated that the preferred alternative (Alternative 1) would transfer to the Cemetery approximately {{convert|9.6| acre}}, comprising most of the Interment Zone and the northern tip of the Preservation Zone.<ref name=assessment1/> Another alternative (Alternative 3) would transfer to the Cemetery the {{convert|12|acre|ha}} Interment Zone, while keeping the {{convert|12.5|acre|ha}} Preservation Zone under NPS jurisdiction.<ref name=assessment1/> The EA concluded: "Public Law 104-201 directed the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army jurisdiction over the Interment Zone, which is the plan in Alternative 3.  Adoption of any of the other alternatives would require legislative action to amend the existing law."<ref name=assessment1/>

[[File:Millennium Project - Arlington National Cemetery.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Map showing the Millennium Project's expansion of Arlington National Cemetery.]]
On December 28, 2001, Public Law 107-107 repealed the "obsolete" part of Public Law 104-201 that had authorized the transfer of portions of Section 29 to the Secretary of the Army.<ref name=law2/> The new legislation required the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army within 30 days the approximately {{convert|12|acre|ha}} Interment Zone.<ref name=law2/>  The transfer therefore involved the entire {{convert|12|acre}} of NPS land that the 1995 agreement and Alternative 3 in the 1999 EA had described.

The 2001 legislation required the Secretary of the Army to use the Interment Zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium.<ref name=law2/> In addition, the legislation required the Secretary of the Interior to manage the remainder of Section 29 "in perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee Memorial."<ref name=law2/>

===Management turnover===
After the cemetery's management controversy began to end, the Army appointed Patrick K. Hallinan the acting superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery in June 2010. He was promoted permanently to the position in October 2010. Hallinan had previously worked for the Office of Field Programs in the National Cemetery Administration, an agency of the [[United States Department of Veterans' Affairs]]. In that capacity, Hallinan had oversight of 131 national cemeteries, national cemetery policy, procedures, and operations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.army.mil/article/46846/|title=Army names new superintendent for Arlington National Cemetery|work=Army News Service|date=October 20, 2010|accessdate=August 21, 2015}}</ref> Hallinan was promoted to Executive Director of the Army National Cemeteries program upon the retirement of Kathryn Condon in spring 2014.<ref name=lechnerappointed />

In May 2014, Hallinan stepped down and was replaced by Jack E. Lechner, Jr. as superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery. Lechner had been a [[funeral director]] for 10 years in the private sector before joining the U.S. Army. He rose to the rank of colonel (retiring in November 2011), having spent 2008 to 2010 as chief of the Supply Division of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], overseeing the equipping of Iraqi and Afghanistan national security forces. Since June 2010, he had served as executive officer and deputy superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery under Hallinan.<ref name=lechnerappointed>{{cite news|url=http://nfda.org/government-relations-/current-funeral-service-issues/3974-lechner-named-superintendent-of-arlington-national-cemetery.html|title=Lechner Named Superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery|work=Memorial Business Journal|date=May 29, 2014|accessdate=August 21, 2015}}</ref>

The Army removed Lechner as superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery in early August 2015 after a performance review "called into question his ability to serve successfully as a senior leader". The Army declined to elaborate further, and Hallinan was temporarily appointed ANC superintendent until a successor could be found.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-man-is-arrested-at-bwi-with-gun-arlington-cemetery-chief-is-removed/2015/08/21/889678c8-481b-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html|last=Davenport|first=Christian|title=Army Removes Chief of Arlington Cemetery|work=The Washington Post|date=August 21, 2015|accessdate=August 21, 2015}}</ref>

===Wreaths Across America===

In 1992, Morrill Worcester's wreath company in Harrington, Maine, had a surplus at the end of the holiday season. Worcester fondly remembered a boyhood trip to Arlington National Cemetery, and so he laid the extra 5,000 wreaths to honor and remember the fallen who protected the country.

Hearing about Worcester’s plans, the owner of the local trucking company provided transportation for the wreaths from Maine to Virginia. Other volunteers decorated the wreaths with red bows and coordinated a ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

For thirteen years, the community quietly honored the veterans until a photo of the snowy gravestones covered with wreaths went viral on the Internet. Thousands of people called Worcester, wanting to replicate the wreath-laying service at their own veteran cemeteries.

The next year, over 150 different locations had simultaneous ceremonies with Arlington’s. Additionally, the project had its first “Veterans Honor Parade” with the Patriot Guard Riders to escort the wreaths from Maine to Arlington. Today, the parade is a weeklong event, stopping at schools, community events, and veterans’ homes.

The amazing support prompted Worcester—with the help of veterans and truckers—to transformed his idea into a nonprofit 501(c)3 in 2007 called Wreaths for America. US Congress even declared December 13, 2008, “Wreaths Across America Day”.

In 2014, WAA volunteers lay over 700,000 memorial wreaths at 1,000 locations in the US and overseas, including Pearl Harbor Memorial, Bunker Hill, Valley Forge, and the World Trade Center Memorial. This was also a monumental year as WAA was able to place wreaths at all sections at Arlington National Cemetery for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Arlington Story|url=http://www.wreathsacrossamerica.org/about/history/|publisher=Wreaths Across America|accessdate=9 December 2015}}</ref>

Arlington National Cemetery is divided into 70 sections, with some sections in the southeast and western part of the cemetery reserved for future expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.mapper.army.mil/ANC/ANCWeb/PublicWMV/ancWeb.html|title=Interactive map of Arlington National Cemetery|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery|accessdate=2013-01-20}}</ref> Section 60, in the southeast part of the cemetery, is the burial ground for military personnel killed in the [[Global War on Terror]] since 2001.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/05/23/section.60.cemetery/index.html |title=Mementos adorn 'saddest acre' |date=2009-05-23 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> Section 21, also known as the Nurses Section, is the area of Arlington National Cemetery where many nurses are buried and is the site of the [[Spanish-American War Nurses Memorial]] and the [[Nurses Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery)|Nurses Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/text/nurses_memorial_text.html |title=Nurses Memorial |publisher=Arlington National Cemetery |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> Another section—[[Chaplains Hill]]—includes monuments to Jewish, Protestant, and Roman Catholic [[military chaplain]]s. In 1901, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers buried at the Soldiers' Home and various locations within Arlington were reinterred in a Confederate section that was authorized by Congress in 1900. On June 4, 1914, the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] dedicated the [[Confederate Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery)|Confederate Memorial]] designed by [[Moses Ezekiel]]. Upon his death in 1917, Ezekiel was buried at the base of the monument as he was a veteran of the Confederate army.<ref>{{cite web |title=Confederate Memorial | publisher=Arlington National Cemetery |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/visitor_information/Confederate_Memorial.html |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> All Confederate headstones in this section are peaked rather than rounded.<ref name="markers">{{cite web| title=History of Government Furnished Headstones and Markers| url=http://www.cem.va.gov/hist/hmhist.asp| date=1 February 2010| publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs| accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref> More than 3,800 former slaves, called "Contrabands" during the Civil War, are buried in Section 27.

Prior to 2007, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) did not allow the use of the [[pentacle]] as an "emblem of belief" on tombstones in military cemeteries. This policy was changed following an out-of-court settlement on 23 April following a series of lawsuits by the family of [[Patrick Stewart (soldier)|Patrick Stewart]] against the VA.<ref name="SymbolsAllowed">{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/23/america/NA-GEN-US-Wiccan-Soldier.php |title=Wiccans symbols allowed on grave markers in government cemeteries |work=International Herald Tribune |author=Associated Press |date=2007-04-23 |accessdate=2007-07-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070627115226/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/23/america/NA-GEN-US-Wiccan-Soldier.php| archivedate= 27 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="VAMustAccommodate">{{cite press release |url=http://www.au.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr003=bg8nm5s6e1.app13a&abbr=pr&page=NewsArticle&id=8269&security=1002&news_iv_ctrl=1241 |title=Veterans Affairs Department Must Accommodate Wiccan Symbol On Memorial Markers At Government Cemeteries, Says Americans United |publisher=Americans United (AU.org) |date=2006-06-08 |accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref><ref name="ListofVASymbols">{{cite web |url=http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/hm/hmemb.asp |title=Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers |work=VA.gov |accessdate=2007-07-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711063328/http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/hm/hmemb.asp| archivedate= 11 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Between 1947 and 2001, privately purchased markers were permitted in the cemetery. The sections in which the cemetery permitted such markers are nearly filled and the cemetery generally does not allow new burials in these sections.<ref name="burial">{{cite web| title=Private Headstone Markers| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/FuneralInformation/OrderHeadstone.aspx#Private| publisher=Arlington National Cemetery| date=| accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> Nevertheless, the older sections of the cemetery have a wide variety of private markers placed prior to 2001, including an artillery piece.

==Arlington Memorial Amphitheater==
{{Main|Arlington Memorial Amphitheater}}
[[File:Arlington National Cemetery Amphitheater (1).jpg|left|200px|thumb|The interior of Memorial Amphitheater]]
The Tomb of the Unknowns is part of the [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater]]. The Memorial Amphitheater has hosted state funerals and [[Memorial Day]] and [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]] ceremonies. Ceremonies are also held for [[Easter]]. About 5,000 people attend these holiday ceremonies each year. The structure is mostly built of Imperial Danby marble from [[Vermont]]. The Memorial Display room, between the amphitheater and the Tomb of the Unknowns, uses [[Botticino]] stone, imported from [[Italy]]. The amphitheater was the result of a campaign by [[Ivory Kimball]] to construct a place to honor America's servicemen/women. Congress authorized the structure on March 4, 1913. [[Woodrow Wilson]] laid the cornerstone for the building on October 15, 1915. The cornerstone contained 15 items including a Bible and a copy of the Constitution.<ref name="amphitheatre">{{cite web| title=The Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/visitor_information/amphitheater.html | work=Arlingtoncemetery.org| publisher=Arlington National Cemetery| date=| accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref>

Before the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater was completed in 1921, important ceremonies were held at what is now known as the "Old Amphitheater." This structure sits where Robert E. Lee once had his gardens. The amphitheater was built in 1868 under the direction of Civil War General [[John A. Logan]]. Gen. [[James A. Garfield]] was the featured speaker at the [[Memorial Day|Decoration Day]] dedication ceremony, May 30, 1868, later being elected as President of the United States 1881. The amphitheater has an encircling colonnade with a latticed roof that once supported a web of vines. The amphitheater has a marble [[dais]], known as "the [[wiktionary:rostrum|rostrum]]", which is inscribed with the U.S. national motto found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]], ''[[E pluribus unum]]'' ("Out of many, one"). The rostrum was designed by General [[Montgomery C. Meigs (1816–1892)|Montgomery C. Meigs]], then Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army.<ref>Poole, Robert M. On Hallowed Ground: The Story of Arlington National Cemetery.

==Memorials==
{{main|List of memorials and monuments at Arlington National Cemetery}}

===Tomb of the Unknowns===
{{Main|Tomb of the Unknowns}}
[[File:Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers.jpg|right|thumb|The Tomb of the Unknowns with guards]]

The [[Tomb of the Unknowns|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] stands on top of a hill overlooking Washington, D.C. One of the more well-attended sites at the Cemetery, the tomb is made from Yule marble quarried in Colorado. It consists of seven pieces, with a total weight of 79 [[short ton]]s (72 [[metric ton]]s). The tomb was completed and opened to the public April 9, 1932, at a cost of $48,000.

It was initially named the "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier." Other unknown servicemen were later entombed there, and it became known as the "Tomb of the Unknowns", though it has never been officially named. The soldiers entombed there are:
* Unknown Soldier of [[World War I]], interred November 11, 1921. President [[Warren G. Harding]] presided.
* Unknown Soldier of [[World War II]], interred May 30, 1958. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] presided.
* Unknown Soldier of the [[Korean War]], also interred May 30, 1958. President Dwight Eisenhower presided again, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] acted as next of kin.
* Unknown Soldier of the [[Vietnam War]], interred May 28, 1984. President [[Ronald Reagan]] presided. The remains of the Vietnam Unknown were disinterred, under the authority of President [[Bill Clinton]], on May 14, 1998, and were identified as those of Air Force 1st Lt. [[Michael Blassie|Michael J. Blassie]], whose family had them reinterred near their home in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. It has been determined that the crypt at the Tomb of the Unknowns that contained the remains of the Vietnam Unknown will remain empty.{{clear}}

The Tomb of the Unknowns has been perpetually guarded since July 2, 1937, by the U.S. Army. The [[3rd United States Infantry Regiment (TOG)|3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] ("The Old Guard") began guarding the Tomb on April 6, 1948. There is a meticulous routine which the guard follows when watching over the graves.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Dqy6Z5HJ|archivedate=2013-01-21|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/VisitorInformation/ChangingofTheGuard.aspx|title=The Changing of the Guard|location=Arlington, Virginia|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery|accessdate=2012-01-21}}</ref>  The Tomb Guard:

# Marches 21 steps down the black mat behind the Tomb.
# Turns, faces east for 21 seconds.
# Turns and faces north for 21 seconds.
# Takes 21 steps down the mat.
# Repeats the routine until the soldier is relieved of duty at the [[Guard Mounting|Changing of the Guard]].

After each turn, the Guard executes a sharp "shoulder-arms" movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the Guard stands between the Tomb and any possible threat.

Twenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowed—the 21-gun salute.

Each turn the guard makes precise movements and followed by a loud click of the heels as he snaps them together. The guard is changed every half-hour during daylight in the summer, and every hour during daylight in the winter and every two hours at night (when the cemetery is closed to the public), regardless of weather conditions.

A commemorative stamp was issued on November 11, 1922, the first anniversary of the first entombment picturing the Amphitheater. It encompasses the original Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The remains of an unidentified WW I American soldier was entombed on Armistice Day, November 11, 1921, later covered in 1931 by a more elaborate marble sarcophagus.<ref>Juell, Rod. “50-cent Arlington Amphitheater”, Arago: people, postage & the post, National Postal Museum online, viewed March 12, 2014.</ref>

===Other memorials===
[[File:USS Maine Mast.jpg|thumb|200px|The ''Maine'' Mast Memorial]]
There are several memorials on the grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. But due to the lack of space for burials and the large amount of space that memorials take up, the U.S. Army now requires a joint or concurrent resolution from Congress before it will place new memorials at Arlington.

Near the Tomb of the Unknowns stands the [[USS Maine Mast Memorial|''USS Maine'' Mast Memorial]], which commemorates the 266 men who lost their lives aboard the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']]. The memorial is built around a [[mast (sailing)|mast]] salvaged from the ''Maine''’s wreckage. The USS ''Maine'' Memorial served as the temporary resting place for foreign heads of state or government, [[Manuel L. Quezon]] of the [[Philippines]] and [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] of [[Poland]], who died in exile in the United States during [[World War II]].

The [[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' Memorial was dedicated on May 20, 1986, in memory of the crew of flight [[STS-51-L]], who [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|died during launch]] on January 28, 1986. Transcribed on the back of the stone is the text of the [[John Gillespie Magee, Jr.]] poem ''High Flight'', which was quoted by then President [[Ronald Reagan]] when he addressed the disaster. Although many remains were identified and returned to the families for private burial, some were not, and were laid to rest under the marker. Two crew members, [[Dick Scobee|Scobee]] and [[Michael J. Smith (astronaut)|Smith]], are buried in Arlington. On February 1, 2004, [[NASA]] Administrator [[Sean O'Keefe]] dedicated a similar memorial to those who died when the Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|broke apart during reentry]] on February 1, 2003.<ref name="NASA">{{cite web| title=Columbia Memorial Dedicated at Arlington| url=http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/home/F_04_Memorials.html| publisher=NASA| accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref> Astronauts [[Laurel Clark]], [[David M. Brown|David Brown]] and [[Michael P. Anderson|Michael Anderson]], who were killed in the Columbia disaster, are also buried in Arlington.

The Lockerbie Cairn is a memorial to the 270 killed in the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] over [[Lockerbie]], [[Scotland]]. The memorial is constructed of 270 stones, one for each person killed in the disaster. In section 64, a memorial to the 184 victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the Pentagon was dedicated September 11, 2002. The memorial takes the shape of a pentagon, and lists the names of all the victims that were killed. Unidentified remains from the victims are buried beneath it.<ref name="Pentagon">{{cite news| title=Remains of Pentagon Attack Victims Buried at Arlington| url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=43465| work=American Forces Press Service| publisher=Department of Defense| author=Jim Garamone| date=12 September 2002| accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref>

On June 25, 1925, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] approved a request to erect a Commonwealth [[Cross of Sacrifice]] with the names of all the citizens of the USA who lost their lives fighting in the Canadian forces during [[World War I]]. The monument was dedicated November 11, 1927 and after the [[Korean War]] and [[World War II]] the names of US citizens who died in those conflicts were added.

The [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial]] is adjacent to the Ceremonial Entrance to Arlington National Cemetery.

The [[Laos Memorial]], or Lao Veterans of America memorial, dedicated to Lao and Hmong veterans who served with [[US Special Forces]] and [[CIA]] advisors during the [[Vietnam War]], to defend the Royal [[Kingdom of Laos]] from the [[North Vietnamese invasion of Laos]] is located on Grant Avenue near the eternal flame memorial to U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>Smith, Philip, Lao Veterans of America, Inc. Washington, D.C. (15 May 1997), http://www.laoveteransofamerica.org</ref>

In 2012, legislation began moving through Congress to approve a "Place of Remembrance" at Arlington National Cemetery. The memorial will be an [[ossuary]] designed to contain fragments of remains which are unidentifiable through DNA analysis. The remains will be cremated before placement in the memorial.<ref>"Fast Track: 'Place of Remembrance' Planned for Arlington." ''Navy Times.'' June 25, 2012.</ref>

==Burial procedures==
[[File:Arlington House Half-mast 28 May 2011.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Arlington House flag flying at [[half-staff]]. The flag is lowered during interments.]]
The flags in Arlington National Cemetery are flown at [[half-staff]] from a half-hour before the first [[funeral]] until a half hour after the last funeral each day. Funerals are normally conducted five days a week, excluding weekends.<ref>Location of Arlington House flagpole: {{Coord|38.881187|-77.072128|region:US_type:landmark_scale:2000_source:wikimapia|display=inline|name=Arlington House flagpole}}</ref><ref>[http://wikimapia.org/#y=38881187&x=-77072128&z=17&l=0&m=h&v=2 Hybrid satellite image/street map from WikiMapia]</ref>

Funerals, including interments and inurnments, average between 27-30 per day. The cemetery conducts approximately 6,900 burials each year.<ref name="facts">{{cite web| title=Arlington National Cemetery Facts| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/visitor_information/anc_facts.html| date=| publisher=Arlington National Cemetery| accessdate=2011-07-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725013705/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/visitor_information/anc_facts.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

With more than 400,000 interments,<ref name="DavenportMissingFunds" /> Arlington National Cemetery has the second-largest number of burials of any national cemetery in the United States. The largest of the 130 national cemeteries is the [[Calverton National Cemetery]], on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], near [[Riverhead, New York]], which conducts more than 7,000 burials each year.

In addition to in-ground burial, Arlington National Cemetery also has one of the larger [[columbarium|columbaria]] for cremated remains in the country. Four courts are currently in use, each with 5,000 niches. When construction is complete, there will be nine courts with a total of 50,000 niches; capacity for 100,000 remains. Any honorably discharged veteran is eligible for inurnment in the columbarium, if s/he served on active duty at some point in her/his career (other than for training).<ref name="CFR">{{cite web| title=32 CFR 553.15a—Persons eligible for inurnment of cremated remains in Columbarium in Arlington National Cemetery| url= http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;rgn=div8;view=text;node=32%3A3.1.1.4.18.0.11.16;idno=32;cc=ecfr;sid=1b5d76eb98eb266e4144e384e69e930a| date=27 July 2011| accessdate=2011-07-29| publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}</ref>

===Burial criteria===
[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=ebe6204b5183f9156bf1036a1135dc30;rgn=div5;view=text;node=32%3A3.1.1.4.18;idno=32;cc=ecfr Part 553 of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations] establishes regulations for Arlington National Cemetery, including eligibility for interment (ground burial) and inurnment. Due to limited space, the criteria for ground burial eligibility are more restrictive than at other national cemeteries, as well as more restrictive than for inurnment in the columbarium.

The persons specified below are eligible for ground burial in Arlington National Cemetery, unless otherwise prohibited.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/funeral_information/guide.interment.html| title=Establishing Eligibility—Eligibility for Interment (Ground Burial)| publisher=Arlington National Cemetery| date=| accessdate=2011-07-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014703/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/funeral_information/guide.interment.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The last period of active duty of former members of the armed forces must have ended honorably. Interment may be of casketed or cremated remains.
* Any active-duty member of the [[Military of the United States|armed forces]] (except those members serving on active duty for training only).
* Any veteran who is retired and eligible for retirement pay from service in the armed forces (including service members retired from a reserve component who served a period of active duty (other than for training)).
* Any former member of the armed forces separated honorably prior to October 1, 1949, for medical reasons and who was rated at 30% or greater disabled effective on the day of discharge.
* Any former member of the armed forces who has been awarded one of the following decorations:
** [[Medal of Honor]]
** [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], [[Navy Cross]], or [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]]
** [[Silver Star]]
** [[Purple Heart]]
* Any former member of the armed forces who served on active duty (other than for training) and who held any of the following positions:
** An elective office of the U.S. Government (such as a term in Congress).
** Office of the Chief Justice of the United States or of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
** An office listed, at the time the person held the position, in 5 USC 5312 or 5313 (Levels I and II of the Executive Schedule).
** The chief of a mission who was at any time during his/her tenure classified in Class I under the provisions of Section 411, Act of 13 August 1946, 60 Stat. 1002, as amended (22 USC 866) or as listed in State Department memorandum dated March 21, 1988.
* Any former prisoner of war who, while a prisoner of war, served honorably in the active military, naval, or air service, whose last period of military, naval or air service terminated honorably and who died on or after November 30, 1993.
* The spouse, widow or widower, minor child, or permanently dependent child, and certain unmarried adult children of any of the above eligible veterans.
[[File:Silence and Respect.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Respectful silence is requested at Arlington.]]
* The widow or widower of:
** a member of the armed forces who was lost or buried at sea or fell out of a plane or officially determined to be permanently absent with a status of either missing or missing in action.
** a member of the armed forces who is interred in a US military cemetery overseas that is maintained by the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]].
* The spouse, minor child, or permanently dependent child of any person already buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
* The parents of a minor child, or permanently dependent child whose remains, based on the eligibility of a parent, are already buried at Arlington. A spouse divorced from the primary eligible, or widowed and remarried, is not eligible for interment.
* Provided certain conditions are met, a former member of the armed forces may be buried in the same grave with a close relative who is already buried and is the primary eligible.

===Inurnment criteria for columbarium===
Due at least partly to the lack of space at the cemetery for ground burial, standards for inurnment (burial of cremated remains) in the columbarium are currently much less restrictive than for ground burial at the Cemetery. In general, any former member of the armed forces who served on active duty (other than for training) and whose last service terminated honorably is eligible for inurnment. Eligibility for inurnment is described fully in [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=ebe6204b5183f9156bf1036a1135dc30;rgn=div5;view=text;node=32%3A3.1.1.4.18;idno=32;cc=ecfr#32:3.1.1.4.18.0.11.16 32 C.F.R. § 553.15a].

===Prohibitions against interment or memorialization===
Congress has from time to time created prohibited categories of persons that, even if otherwise eligible for burial, lose that eligibility. One such prohibition is against certain persons who are convicted of committing certain state or federal capital crimes, as defined in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode38/usc_sec_38_00002411----000-.html 38 U.S. Code § 2411]. Capital crime is a specifically defined term in the statute, and for state offenses can include offenses that are eligible for a life sentence (with or without parole). The reasoning for this provision originally was to prevent [[Timothy McVeigh]] from being eligible at Arlington National Cemetery, but it has since been amended to prevent others.<ref name="fox">{{cite news| title=Arlington National Cemetery Burial Law Eyed| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,165335,00.html| author=Associated Press| publisher=Fox News| date=10 August 2005| accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref>

==2010 mismanagement controversy==
{{main|Arlington National Cemetery mismanagement controversy}}
On June 9, 2010, [[United States Secretary of the Army]] [[John M. McHugh]] reprimanded Arlington National Cemetery's superintendent, [[John C. Metzler, Jr.]], and his deputy, Thurman Higgenbotham, after a [[United States Department of Defense]] inspector general's report revealed that cemetery officials had placed the wrong headstones on tombs, buried coffins in shallow graves, and buried bodies on top of one another.<ref name="Barnes2010">{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/11/nation/la-na-arlington-cemetery-20100611| author=Julian E.

In March 2011, as a result of the problems discovered, Kathryn Condon, the recently appointed director of the Army Cemeteries Program, announced that the cemetery's staff had been increased from 102 to 159. She added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because, "They didn't have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do."<ref name="Davenport">{{cite news| author=Christian Davenport| title=For first time in decades, Arlington National Cemetery must bury multiple 'unknowns'| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/06/AR2011030603633.html| work=Washington Post| publisher=Washingtonpost.com| date=7 March 2011| page=1| accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref>

The mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals, which also proved controversial. Until 2005, the cemetery's administration gave free access, with the family's permission, to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2008, the cemetery gradually imposed increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning about 2005.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite news| author=Dana Milbank| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/09/AR2008070902169.html| title=Putting Her Foot Down And Getting The Boot| work=Washington Post| publisher=WashingtonPost.com| date=10 July 2008| page=3| accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref>
