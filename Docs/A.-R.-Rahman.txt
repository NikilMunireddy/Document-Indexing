In December 2012 Rahman and [[Shekhar Kapoor]] launched Qyuki, a networking site which is a platform for story writers to exchange their thoughts. Cisco invested ₹270&nbsp;million in the startup, giving it a 17-percent share. Qyuki uses Cisco's cloud infrastructure for the site.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.siliconindia.com/news/startups/The-Entrepreneurial-Side-Of-Bollywood-Stars-nid-162101-cid-100.html|title = The Entrepreneurial Side Of Bollywood Stars |author = SiliconIndia|publisher = SiliconIndia|date =27 February 2014  |accessdate = 1 Mar 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.linkedin.com/company/qyuki-digital-media|title = Qyuki Digital Media |author = LinkedIn|publisher = LinkedIn|accessdate = 1 Mar 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/myQyuki/info|title = Qyuki About Page |author = Facebook|publisher = Facebook|accessdate = 1 Mar 2014}}</ref> On 20 December he released the single "Infinite Love" in English and Hindi, commemorating the last day of the Mayan calendar to spread hope, peace and love. Rahman's 2013 tour, Rahmanishq, was announced on 29 July 2013 in [[Mumbai]]. Beginning in Sydney on 24 August, the tour moved to a number of cities in India.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/a-r-rahman-live/1148472/ A R Rahman Tour 2013]</ref>

In January 2016, after a long break A. R. Rahman performed live in [[Chennai]] and for the first time in [[Coimbatore]] & [[Madurai]], with a complete Tamil playlist. As the name suggests, ''Nenje Yezhu'' (which means rise up) began 2016 with a positive note and with music from the heart. The proceeds of this concert will be used for flood relief in Tamil Nadu and also for creating awareness against cancer, supporting VS Medical Trust outside Chennai.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ramanujam|first1=Srinivasa|title=Rahman’s musical balm for Chennai|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/review-of-the-nenje-ezhu-concert-by-ar-rahman/article8116522.ece|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=The Hindu|date=17 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Coimbatore’s soul lifts up to ‘Nenje Ezhu’ of Rahman|url=http://www.covaipost.com/local/coimbatores-soul-lifts-up-to-nenje-ezhu-of-rahman/#.VsCLsbR95lY|website=The Covai Post|accessdate=14 February 2016|date=25 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tanvi|first1=P S|title=Saturday Night Live|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/tanvi-ps-joined-thousands-of-rahmaniacs-to-enjoy-three-hours-of-musical-madness-in-coimbatore/article8151378.ece|accessdate=14 February 2016|work=The Hindu|date=3 February 2016}}</ref>

==Musical style and impact==
Skilled in Carnatic music, [[Classical music|Western]] and [[Hindustani classical music]] and the [[Qawwali]] style of [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], Rahman is noted for film songs  amalgamating elements of these and other genres, layering instruments from different musical idioms in an improvisational style.<ref name="Rahmanrs"/><ref>{{Cite journal | last =Viswanathan | first =T.|last2=Harper Allen|first2=Matthew|title= Music in South India|page= 139 | postscript =<!--None-->}}</ref> Symphonic orchestral themes accompany his scores, occasionally using a [[leitmotif]]. During the 1980s Rahman recorded [[monaural]] arrangements in common with his musical predecessors, [[K. V. Mahadevan]] and [[M. S. Viswanathan|Vishwanathan]]–[[T. K. Ramamoorthy|Ramamoorthy]]. In later years his methodology changed, as he experimented with the fusion of traditional instruments with new electronic sounds and technology.<ref name="Rahmanrs"/><ref>{{Cite book | last = Slobin | first = Mark |author2=Gregory Booth|author3=Joseph Getter|author4=B.

Rahman's musical interests and outlook originate in his love of experimentation. His compositions have an [[Auteur theory|auteuristic]] use of [[counterpoint]], orchestration and the [[human voice]], melding Indian pop music with a unique [[timbre]], form and instrumentation. With this syncretic style and wide-ranging lyrics, the appeal of Rahman's music crosses classes and cultures in Indian society.<ref name=wom>Through innovations such as these, commentators herald Rahman's work as having "passed the relatively static makeup of Western ensembles such as jazz bands and symphony orchestras and the rigid formula of American pop songs." {{Cite book | last =Todd Titon | first =Jeff |author2=Linda Fujie |author3=David Locke |author4=[[David P.

Director [[Baz Luhrmann]] said: {{quote| I had come to the music of A. R. Rahman through the emotional and haunting score of ''Bombay'' and the wit and celebration of ''Lagaan''. But the more of AR's music I encountered the more I was to be amazed at the sheer diversity of styles: from swinging brass bands to triumphant anthems; from joyous pop to West-End musicals.

<!--The famous composer Hans Zimmer says about A. R. Rahman "Like any good artist, A.R. is not a traditionalist, he's a revolutionary. He uses all the revolutionary things that come from all over the world in his stuff&nbsp;... hip-hop beats, electronics .. and there's an incredible inquisitiveness and playfulness in his music, Plus he writes a bloody good tune ,,, and at the end of the day it comes down to can the guy write a tune or not and obviously he can".-->
