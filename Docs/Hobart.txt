==History==
{{Main|History of Hobart}}

The first settlement began in 1803 as a penal colony at [[Risdon Cove]] on the eastern shores of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]], amid British concerns over the presence of French [[Exploration|explorers]]. In 1804 it was moved to a better location at the present site of Hobart at [[Sullivans Cove]]. The city, initially known as ''Hobart Town'' or ''Hobarton'', was named after [[Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire|Lord Hobart]], the Colonial Secretary.

The area's [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|indigenous inhabitants]] were members of the semi-nomadic ''Mouheneener'' tribe.<ref>[http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/So&Sessionals.htm Parliament of Tasmania – House of Assembly Standing Orders] "We acknowledge the traditional people of the land upon which we meet today, the [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Mouheneener people]]." {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/So&Sessionals.htm |date=20080930220233 }}</ref> Violent conflict with the European settlers, and the effects of diseases brought by them, dramatically reduced the aboriginal population, which was rapidly replaced by free settlers and the [[convict]] population. [[Charles Darwin]] visited Hobart Town in February 1836 as part of the [[The Voyage of the Beagle|Beagle expedition]]. He writes of Hobart and the Derwent estuary in his ''Voyage of the Beagle'':
<blockquote>...The lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are cleared; and the bright yellow fields of corn, and dark green ones of potatoes, appear very luxuriant... I was chiefly struck with the comparative fewness of the large houses, either built or building. Hobart Town, from the census of 1835, contained 13,826 inhabitants, and the whole of Tasmania 36,505.</blockquote>

The Derwent River was one of Australia's finest deepwater ports and was the centre of the [[Southern Ocean]] whaling and the [[seal hunting|sealing]] trade. The settlement rapidly grew into a major port, with allied industries such as shipbuilding.

Hobart Town became a city on 21 August 1842, and was renamed Hobart from the beginning of 1881.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8991859 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=1 January 1881 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Topography===
[[File:LGA Tas SE Hobart.png|thumb|left|upright|The City of Hobart (green) and Greater Hobart (teal)]]

Hobart is located on the estuary of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] in the state's south-east. Geologically Hobart is built predominantly on Jurassic [[Diabase|dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic siltstone and Permian mudstone.
Hobart extends along both sides of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]]; on the western shore from the Derwent valley in the north through the flatter areas of [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] which rests on older Triassic sediment and into the hilly areas of New Town, Lenah Valley. Both of these areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, in the Derwent estuary. South of the Derwent estuary lies Storm Bay and the [[Tasman Peninsula]].

The Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent valley area in a southerly direction hugging the Meehan Range in the east before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as Bellerive. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger deposits from the Quaternary. From there the city extends in an easterly direction through the [[Meehan Range]] into the hilly areas of Rokeby and Oakdowns, before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]].

Hobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself; Sandy Bay, Cornelian Bay, Nutgrove, Kingston, Bellerive, and Howrah Beaches as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as; Seven Mile, Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton, and Goats Beaches.

[[File:Greater Hobart Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Hobart area from Bellerive]]

===Climate===
Hobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|Köppen ''Cfb'']]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|°C}} on 4 January 2013 and the lowest was {{convert|−2.8|°C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name="BoM"/> Annually, Hobart receives 40.8 clear days. Compared to other major Australian cities, Hobart has the second fewest daily average hours of sunshine, with 5.9 hours per day, [[Melbourne]] having the fewest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/|title=Australia's official weather forecasts & weather radar - Bureau of Meteorology|publisher=}}</ref> However, during the summer it has the most hours of daylight of any Australian city, with 15.2 hours on the summer solstice.

Although Hobart itself rarely receives snow during the winter (the city's geographic position keeps temperatures from plummeting far below zero), the adjacent [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]] is often seen with a snowcap. Mountain snow covering has also been known to occur during the other seasons. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 15 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to cold air masses arriving from Antarctica coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales.

Hobart is a busy seaport. Its economy is heavily reliant on the sea and it serves as the home port for the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] activities of Australia and France. The port loads around 2,000 tonnes of Antarctic cargo a year for the Australian research vessel ''[[Aurora Australis (icebreaker)|Aurora Australis]].''<ref>{{cite news |last=Collyer |first=Sam |title=Potential Antarctic boost for Hobart port |work=[[Lloyd's List]] Daily Commercial News |publisher=Informa Australia |date=5 August 2008 |url=http://www.lloydslistdcn.com.au/informaoz/LLDCN/news/daily-news/1217861971938/Potential-Antarctic-boost-for-Hobart-port.html |access-date=15 August 2008 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/20080806031050/http://www.lloydslistdcn.com.au/informaoz/LLDCN/news/daily-news/1217861971938/Potential-Antarctic-boost-for-Hobart-port.html |archive-date=6 August 2008 }}</ref> The city is also a hub for [[cruise ship]]s during the summer months, with up to 40 such ships docking during the course of the season.

The city also supports many other industries. Major local employers include [[catamaran]] builder [[Incat]], [[zinc]] refinery [[Nyrstar]], [[Cascade Brewery]] and [[Cadbury's Chocolate Factory, Tasmania|Cadbury's Chocolate Factory]], [[Norske Skog]] and [[Wrest Point Casino]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Why do Business In Hobart?

Hobart also supports a huge tourist industry. Visitors come to the city to explore its historic inner suburbs and nationally acclaimed restaurants and cafes, as well as its vibrant music and nightlife culture. Tourists also come to visit the massive weekly market in [[Salamanca Place]], as well as to use the city as a base from which to explore the rest of Tasmania.

The last 15–20 years has also seen Hobart's wine industry thrive as many vineyards have developed in countryside areas outside of the city in the Coal River Wine Region and [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]], including [[Moorilla Estate]] at [[Berriedale, Tasmania|Berriedale]] one of the most awarded vineyards in Australia.
[[File:Macquarie Street Hobart CBD.jpg|thumb|left|Macquarie Street in Hobart's CBD, the focal point of the city's economy.]]

===Antarctic bases===
Hobart is an Antarctic gateway city, with geographical proximity to East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Infrastructure is provided by the port of Hobart for scientific research and cruise ships, and [[Hobart International Airport]] supports an Antarctic Airlink to Wilkins Runway at [[Casey Station]].

Hobart is the home port for the Australian and French Antarctic programs, and provides port services for other visiting Antarctic nations and Antarctic cruise ships. Antarctic and Southern Ocean expeditions are supported by a specialist cluster offering cold climate products, services and scientific expertise. The majority of these businesses and organisations are members of the [[Tasmanian polar network]], supported in part by the Tasmanian State Government.

==Distinctive features==
[[File:Strickland Avenue, Hobart Tas.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Wellington, Tasmania|Mount Wellington]] seen from Strickland Avenue]]

The [[Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens]] is a popular recreation area a short distance from the City centre. It is the second-oldest Botanic Gardens in Australia and holds extensive significant plant collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bgci.org/garden.php?id=107|title=Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens|publisher=Botanic Gardens Conservation International}}</ref>

Hadley's Orient Hotel, on Hobart's Murray Street, is the oldest continuously operating hotel in Australia.

[[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]], accessible by passing through [[Fern Tree, Tasmania|Fern Tree]], is the dominant feature of Hobart's skyline. Indeed, many descriptions of Hobart have used the phrase "nestled amidst the foothills", so undulating is the landscape. At 1,271 metres, the mountain has its own ecosystems, is rich in biodiversity and plays a large part in determining the local weather.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The [[Tasman Bridge]] is also a uniquely important feature of the city, connecting the two shores of Hobart and visible from many locations. The [[Hobart Synagogue]] is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest synagogue in Australia]] and a rare surviving example of an [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogue.

===Architecture===
[[File:Hobart waterfront architecture.jpg|thumb|left|The Tasmania Museum and Art Gallery]]

Hobart is known for its well-preserved historic architecture, much of it dating back to the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] eras, giving the city a distinctly "[[Old World]]" feel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Content-Area Vocabulary Strategies for Language Arts|year=2002|publisher=Walch Publishing|page=39|isbn=0-82514337-3}}</ref> For locals, this became a source of discomfiture about the city's convict past, but is now a draw card for tourists.<ref>Clark, J. "This Southern Outpost, Hobart 1846–1914" pp. 1</ref> Regions within the city centre, such as [[Salamanca Place]], contain many of the city's heritage-listed buildings. Historic homes and mansions also exist in the suburbs.

[[Kelly's Steps]] were built in 1839 by shipwright and adventurer [[James Kelly (Australian explorer)|James Kelly]] to provide a short-cut from Kelly Street and Arthur Circus in Battery Point to the warehouse and dockyards district of Salamanca Place.<ref name="unknown 4">{{Cite journal| author = unknown | title = A self-guided tour of the Salamanca Arts Centre | journal = Salamanca Arts Centre | volume = | issue = | page = 4 | url = http://www.salarts.org.au/Files/00299-On-Site-Insight.pdf | accessdate = 30 May 2008 }}</ref> In 1835, [[John Lee Archer]] designed and oversaw the construction of the sandstone [[Parliament House, Hobart|Customs House]], facing Sullivans Cove. Completed in 1840, it was used as Tasmania's parliament house, and is now commemorated by a pub bearing the same name (built in 1844) which is frequented by yachtsmen after they have completed the [[Sydney to Hobart yacht race]].

Hobart is also home to many historic churches. The Scots Church (formerly known as St Andrew's) was built in Bathurst Street from 1834–36, and a small sandstone building within the churchyard was used as the city's first Presbyterian Church. The Salamanca Place warehouses and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] were also constructed in this period. The Greek revival [[St. George's Anglican Church, Battery Point|St George's Anglican Church]] in Battery Point was completed in 1838, and a classical tower, designed by James Blackburn, was added in 1847. St Joseph's was built in 1840. [[St David's Cathedral, Hobart|St David's Cathedral]], Hobart's first cathedral, was consecrated in 1874.

Hobart has very few [[high rise]] buildings in comparison to other Australian cities. This is partly a result of height limits imposed due to Hobart's proximity to [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] and [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]].<ref>http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/f041c176-60f4-43ec-a5a7-a2dc00a2259f/final_draft_24_feb_2014.pdf</ref>

Hobart is home to the [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]], which is resident at the [[Federation Concert Hall]] on the city's waterfront. It offers a year-round program of concerts and is thought to be one of the finest small orchestras in the world. Hobart also plays host to the University of Tasmania's acclaimed Australian International Symphony Orchestra Institute (AISOI) which brings pre-professional advanced young musicians to town from all over Australia and internationally. The AISOI plays host to a public concert season during the first two weeks of December every year focusing on large symphonic music.

Designed by the prolific architect Sir [[Roy Grounds]], the 17-storey [[Wrest Point Hotel Casino]] in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]], opened as Australia's first legal [[casino]] in 1973.

The city's nightlife primarily revolves around [[Salamanca Place]], the waterfront area, Elizabeth St in North Hobart and Sandy Bay, but popular [[pub]]s, bars and [[nightclub]]s exist around the city as well. Major national and international music events are usually held at the [[Derwent Entertainment Centre]], or the [[Wrest Point Hotel Casino|Casino]].

===Events===
[[File:Hobart Wharfchancellor.jpg|thumb|Hobart's Constitution Dock is the arrival point for Yachts after they have completed the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]], and usually witnesses scenes of celebration by many yachtsmen during the new year festivities.]]

Hobart is internationally famous among the yachting community as the finish of the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] which starts in Sydney on [[Boxing Day]] (the day after Christmas Day). The arrival of the yachts is celebrated as part of the [[Hobart Summer Festival]], a food and wine festival beginning just after Christmas and ending in mid-January. The [[Taste of Tasmania]] is a major part of the festival, where locals and visitors can taste fine local and international food and wine.

The city is the finishing point of the [[Targa Tasmania]] rally car event, which has been held annually in April since 1991.

The annual [[Tulip]] Festival at the [[Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens]] is a popular Spring celebration in the City.

The [[Australian Wooden Boat Festival]] is a biennial event held in Hobart celebrating wooden boats. It is held concurrently with the [[Royal Hobart Regatta]], which began in 1830 and is therefore Tasmania's oldest surviving sporting event.

[[File:CG-BelleriveOval-pano.jpg|thumb|[[Bellerive Oval]]]]

Most of Hobart's sporting teams in national competitions are statewide teams rather than exclusively city teams.

[[Cricket]] is the most popular game of the city. The [[Tasmanian Tigers]] cricket team plays its home games at the [[Bellerive Oval]] on the Eastern Shore. A new team, [[Hobart Hurricanes]] represent the city in the [[Big Bash League]]. [[Bellerive Oval]] has been the breeding ground of some world class cricket players including the former Australia captain [[Ricky Ponting]].

Despite [[Australian rules football]]'s huge popularity in the state of Tasmania, the state does not have a team in the [[Australian Football League]]. However, a [[Tasmanian AFL bid|bid for an Tasmanian AFL team]] is a popular topic among football fans. The State government is one of the potential sponsors of such a team. Local domestic club football is still played. [[Tasmanian Football League|Tasmanian State League]] football features five clubs from Hobart, and other leagues such as [[Southern Football League (Tasmania)|Southern Football League]] and the Old Scholars Football Association are also played each Winter.

The city has two local [[rugby league football]] teams (Hobart Tigers and South Hobart Storm) who compete in the [[Tasmanian Rugby League]].

Tasmania is not represented by teams in the [[NRL]], [[Super Rugby]], [[netball]], soccer, or basketball leagues. However, the "Oasis Hobart Chargers" team does represent Hobart in the [[South East Australian Basketball League]]. Besides the bid for an [[Australian Football League|AFL]] club which was passed over in favour of a second Queensland team, despite several major local businesses and the Premier pioneering for a club, there is also a [[Tasmania United FC|Hobart bid]] for entry into the [[A-League]].

Hockey Tasmania has a men's team (the Tasmanian Tigers) and a women's team (the Van Demons) competing in the [[Australian Hockey League]].

Hobart's major newspaper is ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]'', which was founded by [[John Davies (publisher)|John Davies]] in 1854 and has been continually published ever since. The paper is currently owned and operated by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Limited]].

==Government==
[[File:Lascar Parliament House (Hobart) (4551936219).jpg|thumb|The Parliament House of Tasmania]]

The Greater Hobart metropolitan area consists of five local government areas of which three, [[City of Hobart]], [[City of Glenorchy]] and [[City of Clarence]] are designated as cities. Hobart also includes the urbanised local governments of the [[Municipality of Kingborough]] and [[Municipality of Brighton]]. Each local government services all the suburbs that are within its geographical boundaries and are responsible for their own urban area, up to a certain scale, and residential planning as well as waste management and mains water storage.

Most city wide events such as the Taste of Tasmania and Hobart Summer Festival are funded by the Tasmanian State Government as a joint venture with the Hobart City Council. Urban planning of the Hobart CBD in particular the Heritage listed areas such as Sullivans Cove are also intensely scrutinised by State Government, which is operated out of Parliament House on the waterfront.

==Education==

[[File:UTAS Centenary Building.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Tasmania|The University of Tasmania's]] Centenary Building, Sandy Bay campus]]

Hobart is home to the main campus of the [[University of Tasmania]], located in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]]. On-site accommodation colleges include [[Christ College (University of Tasmania)|Christ College]], [[Jane Franklin Hall]] and [[St. John Fisher College (University of Tasmania)|St John Fisher College]]. Other campuses are in Launceston and Burnie.

The G.H.A (Greater Hobart Area) contains 122 Primary, Secondary and Pretertiary (College) schools distributed throughout Clarence, Glenorchy and Hobart City Councils and Kingborough and Brighton Municipalities. These schools are made up of a mix of public, catholic, private and independent run, with the heaviest distribution lying in the more densely populated West around the Hobart city core. The city also maintains a large Polytechnics College campus (formerly [[TAFE Tasmania]]) for post-secondary studies in Trades and other non-university qualifications.

==Infrastructure==
{{Main|Transport in Hobart}}
[[File:Metro Tasmania bus.jpg|thumb|A Metro Tasmania bus]]

The only [[public transportation]] within the city of Hobart is via a network of [[Metro Tasmania]] buses funded by
the Tasmanian Government and a small number of private bus services. Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated passenger tram services, a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. However, the tramway closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart.

Suburban passenger trains, run by the Tasmanian Government Railways, were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the Tasman Limited, ceased running in 1978. Recently though there has been a push from the city, and increasingly from government, to establish a [[Riverline (Hobart)|light rail network]], intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks in a [[South Line, Tasmania|North South corridor]]; to help relieve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD.

The main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]. Leaving the city, motorists can travel the [[Lyell Highway]] to the [[West Coast, Tasmania|west coast]], [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland Highway]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] and the north, [[Tasman Highway]] to the east coast, or the [[Huon Highway]] to the far south.

[[File:HobartAirportTerminal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hobart International Airport]]]]

Ferry services from Hobart's Eastern Shore into the city were once a common form of public transportation, but with lack of government funding, as well as a lack of interest from the private sector, there has been the demise of a regular commuter ferry service – leaving Hobart's commuters relying solely on travel by automobiles and buses. There is however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]].

Hobart is served by [[Hobart International Airport]] with flights to/from Melbourne ([[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]]); Sydney (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin); Brisbane (Virgin); Gold Coast (Jetstar); and Canberra (Virgin). The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.

[[File:Cobble Creek, Hobart.jpg|thumb|right|Former Hobart Gas Company]]

In 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and [[New Zealand]], and possible new domestic flights to Darwin, Cairns and Perth have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In addition, [[Tony Abbott]] the former Prime minister of Australia promised in the lead up to the 2013 federal election that his government would provide the funding needed for an extension of the one and only runway at Hobart international. This would allow larger planes to land which could boost the economy.
