The '''Council of Europe''' ('''CoE'''; {{lang-fr|Conseil de l'Europe}}) is an [[international organization]] focused on promoting  [[democracy]], [[rule of law]], [[human rights]], [[Council of Europe Development Bank|economic development]] and integration of [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines|certain regulatory functions]] in [[Europe]]. Founded in 1949, it has 47 member states, covers approximately 820 million people and operates with an annual budget of approximately half a billion [[euro]]s.<ref>Council of Europe, [http://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/budget Budget], Retrieved: 21 April 2016</ref> The organization is distinct from the 28-nation [[European Union]] (EU), although it is sometimes confused with it, partly because the EU has adopted the original [[Flag of Europe|Council of Europe flag]]<ref>Council of Europe [http://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/the-european-flag The European flag], Retrieved: 18 April 2016</ref> and also [[Anthem of Europe|shares its anthem]].<ref>Council of Europe [http://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/the-european-anthem The European anthem], Retrieved: 18 April 2016</ref> No country has ever joined the EU without first belonging to the Council of Europe.<ref>Council of Europe [http://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/do-not-get-confused How to Distinguish Us], Retrieved: 18 April 2016</ref>

Unlike the EU, the Council of Europe cannot make binding laws, but it does have the power to enforce select international agreements reached by European states on various topics. The best known enforcement body of the Council of Europe is the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which enforces the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Other major CoE elements include the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]]. Through such initiatives, the Council aims to promote common standards, charters and conventions streamlining cooperation among European countries.

The Council's two statutory bodies are the [[Committee of Ministers]], comprising the foreign ministers of each member state, and the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]], composed of members of the national parliaments of each member state. The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] is an independent institution within the Council of Europe, mandated to promote awareness of and respect for human rights in the member states. The [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe|Secretary General]] heads the secretariat of the organisation.

The headquarters of the Council of Europe are in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are its two [[official language]]s. The Committee of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly and the [[Congress of the Council of Europe|Congress]] also use [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for some of their work.

== History ==
[[File:Palais Universitaire de Strasbourg-10 août 1949.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Plaque commemorating the first session of the Council of Europe Assembly at [[Palais Universitaire, Strasbourg|Strasbourg University]]]]
In a speech at the [[University of Zurich]] on 19 September 1946, Sir [[Winston Churchill]] called for a "kind of [[United States of Europe]]" and for the creation of a Council of Europe.<ref name=COE_Churchill>{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Archives/Selection/Churchill/Default_en.asp |title=Winston Churchill and the Council of Europe |work=Council of Europe: Archiving and Documentary Resources |publisher=Council of Europe |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}, including audio extracts</ref><ref name="ENA_Churchill">{{cite web|title=European Navigator (ENA)|url=http://www.ena.lu/the_zurich_speech-020100043.html|accessdate=4 April 2011}} Including full transcript</ref> He had spoken of a Council of Europe as early as 1943 in a radio broadcast.<ref name=CE_Churchill>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Fonds/Themes/Churchill/Default_en.asp |title=Winston Churchill and the Council of Europe|work=Council of Europe: Archiving and Documentary Resources |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=4 April 2011}} Including audio extracts</ref>

[[Willy Brandt]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German minister for Foreign Affairs]], is speaking.]]

The future structure of the Council of Europe was discussed at a specific congress of several hundred leading politicians, government representatives and civil society in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], in 1948. There were two schools of thought competing: some favoured a classical international organization with representatives of governments, while others preferred a political forum with parliamentarians. Both approaches were finally combined through the creation of the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly under the Statute of the Council of Europe. This dual intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary structure was later copied for the [[European Communities]], [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].

The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by the [[Treaty of London (1949)|Treaty of London]]. The Treaty of London or the Statute of the Council of Europe was signed in London on that day by ten states: [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Many other states followed, especially after the democratic transitions in central and eastern Europe during the early 1990s, and the Council of Europe now includes all European states except [[Belarus]],<ref name="applicant">See [[#applicant|Applicants section]].</ref> [[Kazakhstan]],<ref name="applicant"/> [[Vatican City]]<ref>The Holy See is [[#Observers|currently observer]] to the [[Committee of Ministers|CoE Committee of Ministers]].</ref> and the European [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] such as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]], [[Abkhazia]], [[South Ossetia]], [[Northern Cyprus]], [[Transnistria]], and [[Kosovo]].

== Aims and achievements ==
Article 1(a) of the Statute states that "The aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress." <ref>{{cite web|title=Statute of the Council of Europe|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm|website=http://conventions.coe.int/|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> Membership is open to all European states who seek harmony, cooperation, good governance and human rights, accepting the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms.

While the member states of the European Union transfer part of their national legislative and executive powers to the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Parliament]], Council of Europe member states maintain their sovereignty but commit themselves through conventions/treaties ([[international law]]) and co-operate on the basis of common values and common political decisions. Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states working together at the Council of Europe. Both organizations function as concentric circles around the common foundations for European co-operation and harmony, with the Council of Europe being the geographically wider circle. The European Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of integration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level. "The Council of Europe and the European Union: different roles, shared values." <ref>http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/european-union</ref> Council of Europe conventions/treaties are also open for signature to non-member states, thus facilitating equal co-operation with countries outside Europe.

The Council of Europe's most famous achievement is the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was adopted in 1950 following a report by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, and followed on from the United Nations '[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]' (UDHR). <ref>http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/</ref> The Convention created the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court. It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their fundamental rights and freedoms.

The various activities and achievements of the Council of Europe can be found in detail on its official website. The Council of Europe works in the following areas:

== Criticism ==
In recent years, the Council of Europe has been criticized for doing too little to stand up to the transgressions of some of its members. [[Human Rights Watch]], for example, argued in September 2014 that [[Azerbaijan]]'s "systematic crackdown on human rights defenders and other perceived government critics shows sheer contempt for its commitments to the Council of Europe".<ref name=HRW_Criticism>{{cite news|last1=Human Rights Watch|title=Azerbaijan: Government Repression Tarnishes Chairmanship Council of Europe’s Leadership Should Take Action|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/09/29/azerbaijan-government-repression-tarnishes-chairmanship|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=29 September 2014}}</ref> Similarly, the [[European Stability Initiative]] has documented how the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in January 2013 voted down a resolution on [[political prisoner]]s in Azerbaijan, providing a result largely favorable to the authoritarian government of [[Ilham Aliyev]].<ref name=ESI_debate>{{cite web|last1=European Stability Initiative|title=Azerbaijan debacle: The PACE debate on 23 January 2013|url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&id=156&document_ID=136|website=ESIweb|accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref> In 2013 ''[[The Economist]]'' agreed, saying that the "Council of Europe's credibility is on the line".<ref>{{cite news|last1=The Economist|title=Azerbaijan and the Council of Europe|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/03/azerbaijan|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=23 March 2013}}</ref>

Both the Human Rights Watch and the European Stability Initiative have called on the Council of Europe to undertake concrete actions to show that it is willing and able to return to its "original mission to protect and ensure human rights".<ref name=ESI_HavelPrize>{{cite news|last1=European Stability Initiative|title=What the 2014 Havel Prize says about the Council of Europe – and what should happen now|url=http://www.esiweb.org/rumeliobserver/2014/09/29/what-the-2014-havel-prize-says-about-the-council-of-europe-and-what-should-happen-now/|accessdate=29 September 2014|agency=ESI web|issue=29 September 2014}}</ref>

== Institutions ==
The institutions of the Council of Europe are:
* The [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe|Secretary General]], who is elected for a term of five years by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] and heads the Secretariat of the Council of Europe. Mr Thorbjørn Jagland, the former Prime Minister of Norway was elected Secretary General of the Council of Europe in September 2009.  In June 2014, he was re-elected, and his second term in office commenced on 1 October 2014.
* The [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]], comprising the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of all 47 member states who are represented by their [[Ministers Deputies|Permanent Representatives and Ambassadors]] accredited to the Council of Europe. Committee of Ministers' presidencies are held in alphabetical order for six months following the English alphabet: [[Turkey]] 11/2010-05/2011, [[Ukraine]] 05/2011-11/2011, the United Kingdom 11/2011-05/2012, [[Albania]] 05/2012-11/2012, [[Andorra]] 11/2012-05/2013, [[Armenia]] 05/2013-11/2013, [[Austria]] 11/2013-05/2014, and so on.
[[File:Plenary chamber of the Council of Europe's Palace of Europe 2014 01.JPG|thumb|300px|Council's [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] [[hemicycle]]]]
* The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] (PACE), which comprises national parliamentarians from all member states and elects its President for a year with the possibility of being re-elected for another year. In January 2016, Pedro Agramunt from [[Spain]] was elected President of the Parliamentary Assembly. National parliamentary delegations to the Assembly must reflect the political spectrum of their national parliament, i.e., comprise government and opposition parties. The Assembly appoints members as rapporteurs with the mandate to prepare parliamentary reports on specific subjects. The British MP [[Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] was rapporteur for the drafting of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. [[Dick Marty]]'s reports on secret [[CIA]] detentions and rendition flights in Europe became quite famous in 2007. Other Assembly rapporteurs were instrumental in, for example, the abolition of the death penalty in Europe, the political and human rights situation in [[Chechnya]], disappeared persons in [[Belarus]], freedom of expression in the media and many other subjects.
* The [[Congress of the Council of Europe]] (Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe), which was created in 1994 and comprises political representatives from local and regional authorities in all member states. The most influential instruments of the Council of Europe in this field are the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]] of 1985 and the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities of 1980.
* The [[European Court of Human Rights]], created under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] of 1950, is composed of a judge from each member state elected for a renewable term of six years by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] and is headed by the elected President of the Court. The current President of the Court is Guido Raymondi from Italy. Under the new Protocol No. 14 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the terms of office of judges shall be nine years but non-renewable. Ratification of Protocol No. 14 was delayed by Russia for a number of years, but won support to be passed in January 2010.
* The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], who is elected by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] for a non-renewable term of six years since the creation of this position in 1999. Since April 2012, this position has been held by [[Nils Muižnieks]] from Latvia.
* The [http://www.coe.int/T/NGO/default_en.asp Conference of INGOs.] NGOs can participate in the [[INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe]]. Since the [Resolution (2003)8] adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 19 November 2003, they are given a "participatory status".
* Information Offices of the Council of Europe in many member states.

[[File:EU-FR-AL-67@Strasbourg-Pharmacopée européenne 01.jpg|thumb|[[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]].]]

The CoE system also includes a number of semi-autonomous structures known as "[[Partial Agreement]]s", some of which are also open to non-member states:
* The [[Council of Europe Development Bank]] in [[Paris]]
* The [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] with its [[European Pharmacopoeia]]
* The [[European Audiovisual Observatory]]
* The European Support Fund ''[[Eurimages]]'' for the co-production and distribution of films
* The [[Pompidou Group]] – Cooperation Group to Combat Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Drugs
* The European Commission for Democracy through Law, better known as the [[Venice Commission]]
* The [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (GRECO)
* The European and Mediterranean [[EUR-OPA Major Hazards Agreement|Major Hazards Agreement (EUR-OPA)]] which is a platform for co-operation between European and Southern Mediterranean countries in the field of major natural and technological disasters.
* The Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport, which is open to accession by states and sport associations.<ref>{{cite web|title = Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport |publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://www.coe.int/t/DG4/EPAS/default_en.asp}}</ref>
* The [[North-South Centre]] of the Council of Europe in [[Lisbon]] (Portugal)
* The Centre for Modern Languages is in [[Graz]] (Austria)

=== Headquarters and buildings ===
{{See also|European Institutions in Strasbourg}}
[[File:Council of Europe Palais de l'Europe aerial view.JPG|thumb|Aerial shot of the [[Palace of Europe|Palais de l'Europe]] in Strasbourg]]
[[File:Council of Europe Agora building in Strasbourg.JPG|thumb|Council of Europe's Agora building]]
The seat of the Council of Europe is in [[Strasbourg]], France. First meetings were held in Strasbourg's [[University of Strasbourg|University]] Palace in 1949, but the Council of Europe soon moved into its own buildings. The Council of Europe's eight main buildings are situated in the ''Quartier européen'', an area in the northeast of Strasbourg spread over the three districts of Le Wacken, La Robertsau and Quartier de l'Orangerie, where are also located the four buildings of the [[seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg]], the [[Arte]] headquarters and the seat of the [[International Institute of Human Rights]].

Building in the area started in 1949 with the predecessor of the Palais de l'Europe, the House of Europe (demolished in 1977), and came to a provisional end in 2007 with the opening of the New General Office Building, later named "Agora", in 2008.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.coe.int/t/DC/Press/Source/PressFile_%20AGORA_fr.pdf | date = 30 January 2008 | language = French |title=Inauguration of the Agora Building | publisher = Council of Europe}}</ref> The Palais de l'Europe ([[Palace of Europe]]) and the [[Art Nouveau]] Villa Schutzenberger (seat of the [[European Audiovisual Observatory]]) are in the Orangerie district, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] and the Agora Building are in the Robertsau district. The Agora building has been voted "best international business center real estate project of 2007" on 13 March 2008, at the [[MIPIM]] 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mipim.com/App/homepage.cfm?appname=100517&moduleid=288&campaignid=11888&iUserCampaignID=43827991 |title=2008 List of MIPIM winners}}</ref> The European Youth Centre is located in the Wacken district.

Besides its headquarters in Strasbourg, the Council of Europe is also present in other cities and countries. The Council of Europe Development Bank has its seat in Paris, the [[North-South Centre]] of the Council of Europe is established in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], and the Centre for Modern Languages is in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]. There are [[European Youth Centres]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and in Strasbourg. The European Wergeland Centre, a new Resource Centre on education for intercultural dialogue, human rights and democratic citizenship, operated in cooperation with the Norwegian Government, opened in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title =European Wergeland Centre |url=http://www.theewc.org/about-the-ewc.html}}</ref>

The Council of Europe has offices in [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Ukraine]]; information offices in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, [[Bulgaria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], Georgia, [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], Moldova, [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russian Federation]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and Ukraine; and a projects office in [[Turkey]]. All these offices are establishments of the Council of Europe and they share its juridical personality with privileges and immunities.

Due to persistent budgetary shortages, the Council of Europe is expected to cut down significantly the number of its activities, and thus the number of its employees, from 2011 on. This will notably affect the economy of the city of Strasbourg, where a total of 2,321 people (on 1 January 2010) are doing salaried work for the CoE. Most offices in foreign countries are expected to be closed as well.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lalsace.fr/fr/france-monde/article/3340157,218/Reduction-drastique-des-activites-a-Strasbourg.html |title=Conseil de l'Europe – Réduction drastique des activités à Strasbourg | location = Mulhouse |date=19 June 2010 |work=L'Alsace |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

== Symbol and Anthem ==
{{Main|Symbols of Europe|Flag of Europe}}
[[File:Flag of Europe.svg|thumb|[[Flag of Europe]]]]

The Council of Europe created, and has since 1955 used as its official symbol, the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] with 12 golden stars arranged in a circle on a blue background.

Its  musical anthem since 1972, the "[[European Anthem]]", is based on the "[[Ode to Joy]]" theme from [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth symphony]].

On 5 May 1964, the 15th anniversary of its founding, the Council of Europe established 5 May as [[Europe Day]].<ref name="symbols">{{cite web|title =Flag, anthem and logo: the Council of Europe's symbols|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp|accessdate = 5 August 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080731041722/http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 31 July 2008}}</ref>

The wide private and public use of the European Flag is encouraged to symbolise a European dimension. To avoid confusion with the [[European Union]] which subsequently adopted the same flag in the 1980s, as well as other European institutions, the Council of Europe often uses a modified version with a lower-case "e" surrounding the stars which is referred to as the "Council of Europe Logo".<ref name="symbols"/><ref>{{cite web| title =Logo of the Council of Europe| publisher=Council of Europe| url=http://www.coe.int/02/Logo/Pictures/LogoCoE/LogoCoe.jpg| accessdate = 5 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110102024938/http://www.coe.int/02/Logo/Pictures/LogoCoE/LogoCoe.jpg| archivedate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

== Membership, observers, partners ==
{{Main|Member states of the Council of Europe}}
The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] joined three months later, and [[Iceland]] and Germany the next year. It now has 47 member states, with [[Montenegro]] being the latest to join.

Article 4 of the Council of Europe Statute specifies that membership is open to any "European" State. This has been interpreted liberally from the beginning (when Turkey was admitted) to include any [[Geography of Europe#Countries bordering or spanning another continent|transcontinental states]], such as Russia.

Nearly all [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European states]] have acceded to the Council of Europe, with the exception of [[authoritarian]] [[Belarus]]; [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[Vatican City]]; predominantly [[Central Asia]]n [[Kazakhstan]], as well as some of the [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]].

Besides the status as a full member, the Council of Europe has established [[Member_states_of_the_Council_of_Europe#Observers|other instruments for cooperation and participation]] of non-member states: observer, applicant, special guest, and partner for democracy.

== Co-operation ==

=== Non-member states ===
The Council of Europe works mainly through conventions. By drafting conventions or international treaties, common legal standards are set for its member states. However, several conventions have also been opened for signature to non-member states. Important examples are the [[Convention on Cybercrime]] (signed for example, by Canada, Japan, South Africa and the United States), the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] on the recognition of study periods and degrees (signed for example, by Australia, Belarus, Canada, the [[Holy See]], Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand and the United States), the Anti-[[Doping (sport)|doping]] Convention (signed, for example, by Australia, Belarus, Canada and Tunisia) and the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats]] (signed for example, by Burkina Faso, Morocco, Tunisia and Senegal as well as the [[European Community]]). Non-member states also participate in several partial agreements, such as the [[Venice Commission]], the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (GRECO), the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] Commission and the [[North-South Centre]].

Invitations to sign and ratify relevant conventions of the Council of Europe on a case-by-case basis are sent to three groups of non-member entities:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheNonMembres.asp?CM=14&CL=ENG |title=CoE Conventions |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date=31 December 1998 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}</ref>

=== European Union ===
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=400px|align=right}}
The Council of Europe is not to be confused with the [[Council of the European Union]] (the "Council of Ministers") or the [[European Council]]. These belong to the [[European Union]], which is separate from the Council of Europe, although they have shared the same European flag and anthem since the 1980s because they both work for [[European integration]]. The Council of Europe is not to confused with the European Union itself.

The Council of Europe is an entirely separate body<ref name="COE_not_EU">{{cite web| url = http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu/index_en.htm| title = Council of the European Union| publisher =[[European Union]]| accessdate = 2012-05-19}}</ref> from the European Union. It is not controlled by it.

Cooperation between the [[European Union]] and the Council of Europe has recently been reinforced, notably on culture and education as well as on the international enforcement of justice and Human Rights.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Council of Europe and the European Union sign an agreement to foster mutual cooperation|date=23 May 2007|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR331(2007)&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE&ShowBanner=no&Target=_self|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}</ref>

The European Union is expected to accede to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (the Convention). There are also concerns about consistency in case law – the [[European Court of Justice]] (the EU's court in [[Luxembourg]]) is treating the Convention as part of the legal system of all [[Member states of the European Union|EU member states]] in order to prevent conflict between its judgements and those of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (the court in [[Strasbourg]] interpreting the Convention). Protocol No. 14 of the Convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the EU [[Treaty of Lisbon]] contains a protocol binding the EU to join. The EU would thus be subject to its human rights law and external monitoring as its member states currently are.<ref name="Juncker Council">{{cite web|last=Juncker|first=Jean-Claude|authorlink=Jean-Claude Juncker|title =Council of Europe – European Union: "A sole ambition for the European continent"|year=2006|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Sessions/2006/speeches/20060411_report_JCJuncker_EN.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}</ref><ref name="Reform Draft">{{cite web|title =Draft treaty modifying the treaty on the European Union and the treaty establishing the European community|date=24 July 2007|publisher=[[Open Europe]]|url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}</ref>

=== United Nations ===
The Council of Europe holds [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer status]] with the [[United Nations]] and is regularly represented in the [[UN General Assembly]]. It has organized the regional UN conferences against racism and on women and co-operates with the United Nations at many levels, in particular in the areas of human rights, minorities, migration and counter-terrorism.

=== Non-governmental organizations ===
Non-governmental organizations ([[NGOs]]) can participate in the [[INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe]] and become observers to inter-governmental committees of experts. The Council of Europe drafted the [[European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organizations]] in 1986, which sets the legal basis for the existence and work of NGOs in Europe. Article 11 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] protects the right to freedom of association, which is also a fundamental norm for NGOs. The rules for [[Consultative Status]] for INGOs appended to the resolution (93)38 "On relation between the Council of Europe and [[international nongovernmental organizations|non-governmental organizations]]", adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 18 October 1993 at the 500th meeting of the Ministers' Deputies.
On 19 November 2003 the Committee of Ministers changed the consultative status into a participatory status,“considering that it is indispensable that the rules governing the relations between the Council of Europe and NGOs evolve to reflect the active participation of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) in the Organization's policy and work programme”.<ref>[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=Res%282003%298&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&Site=CM&BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&BackColorIntranet=EDB021&BackColorLogged=F5D383] (Resolution Res (2003)8)</ref>
