'''Herbert George Wells''' (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946)—known as '''H. G. Wells'''<ref name=SFE>

Wells is now best remembered for his [[science fiction]] novels, and is called the father of science fiction, along with [[Jules Verne]] and [[Hugo Gernsback]].<ref>Adam Charles Roberts (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRw_MIPjnXwC&pg=PA48 "The History of Science Fiction", page 48].

He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] four times.<ref name="Nobel nominations"/>

Wells's earliest specialized training was in [[biology]], and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] context.<ref>Robert M. Philmus and David Y. Hughes, ed., ''H. G. Wells: Early Writings in Science and Science Fiction'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1975), p. 179.</ref> He was also from an early date an outspoken [[socialism|socialist]], often (but not always, as at the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]]) sympathising with [[pacifism|pacifist]] views. His later works became increasingly political and [[didacticism|didactic]], and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist.<ref>Vincent Brome, ''H. G. Wells: A Biography'' (London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green, 1951).</ref> Novels like ''[[Kipps]]'' and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'', which describe lower-middle-class life, led to the suggestion, when they were published, that he was a worthy successor to [[Charles Dickens]],<ref>Vincent Brome, ''H. G. Wells: A Biography'' (London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green, 1951), p. 99.</ref> but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in ''[[Tono-Bungay]]'' (1909), a diagnosis of [[English society]] as a whole. A diabetic, in 1934 Wells co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (known today as [[Diabetes UK]]).

==Life==

===Early life===
Herbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 46 High Street, [[Bromley]], in [[Kent]],<ref name="Francis">{{cite book |last=Wells |first=H. G. |authorlink=H. G. Wells |editor1-last=Claeys |editor1-first=Gregory |editor2-last=Parrinder |editor2-first=Patrick |others=Gregory Claeys, Francis Wheen, Andy Sawyer |title=A Modern Utopia |origyear=1905 |date=2005 |publisher=Penguin Classics |isbn=978-0-14-144112-2}}</ref> on 21 September 1866.<ref name=Parrinder>{{cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Patrick |title=''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Called "Bertie" in the family, he was the fourth and last child of [[Joseph Wells (cricketer)|Joseph Wells]] (a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional [[cricket]]er) and his wife, Sarah Neal (a former [[domestic worker|domestic servant]]). An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing [[Amateur and professional cricketers|professional cricket]] for the [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent county team]].<ref name="Smith">Smith, David C. (1986) ''H. G. Wells: Desperately mortal. A biography.'' Yale University Press, New Haven and London ISBN 0-300-03672-8</ref> Payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards, or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played.

A defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg.<ref name=Parrinder/> To pass the time he started reading books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a [[private school]] founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing [[Copperplate script|copperplate handwriting]] and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.

No longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as [[apprenticeship|apprentice]]s in various occupations. From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a [[draper]] at the [[Southsea]] Drapery Emporium, Hyde's.<ref name="GHW1925" /> His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices,<ref name="Francis"/> later inspired his novels ''[[The Wheels of Chance]]'' and ''[[Kipps]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Batchelor |first=John |title=H. G. Wells |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |year=1985 |page=2|isbn=0-521-27804-X}}</ref> which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.

Wells's parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother being a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and his father a [[Freethought|freethinker]]. When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at [[Uppark]], a [[English country house|country house]] in [[Sussex]]), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. Fortunately for Herbert, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', and [[Thomas More|More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''. This would be the beginning of Herbert George Wells's venture into literature.

===Teacher===
[[File:H.G. Wells , c1890.jpg|thumb|H. G. Wells studying in London, taken circa 1890]]

In October 1879 Wells's mother arranged through a distant relative, Arthur Williams, for him to join the [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] at [[Wookey]] in Somerset as a pupil–teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children.<ref name="GHW1925">{{cite book|last=Wells|first=Geoffrey H.|title=The Works of H. G. Wells|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1925|page=xvi|oclc=458934085|isbn=0-86012-096-1}}</ref> In December that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby [[Midhurst]], and an even shorter stay as a boarder at [[Midhurst Grammar School]], he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's. In 1883 Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil–teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his previous, short stay had been remembered.<ref name=Smith/><ref name="GHW1925" />

The years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point, but his good fortune at securing a position at Midhurst Grammar School meant that Wells could continue his self-education in earnest.<ref name=Smith/> The following year, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the [[Royal College of Science]] in [[South Kensington]], now part of [[Imperial College London]]) in London, studying [[biology]] under [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. As an alumnus, he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he became the first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887 with a weekly allowance of 21 [[shilling]]s (a [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]) thanks to his scholarship. This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many [[working class]] families had "round about a pound a week" as their entire household income)<ref>Reeves, M.S. ''Round About a Pound a Week''. New York: Garland Pub., 1980. ISBN 0-8240-0119-2 Some of the text is available online.</ref> yet in his ''Experiment in Autobiography'', Wells speaks of constantly being hungry, and indeed, photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished.
[[File:H G Wells - Sandgate - Project Gutenberg eText 13715.png|thumbnail|left|upright|H. G. Wells in 1907 at the door of his house at [[Sandgate, Kent|Sandgate]]]]
He soon entered the Debating Society of the school. These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society. At first approaching the subject through Plato's ''Republic'', he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed [[Fabian Society]] and free lectures delivered at [[Kelmscott House]], the home of [[William Morris]]. He was also among the founders of ''The Science School Journal'', a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as trying his hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'' was published in the journal under the title ''[[The Chronic Argonauts]]''. The school year 1886–87 was the last year of his studies.

During 1888 Wells stayed in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], living in [[Basford, Staffordshire|Basford]], and also at the Leopard Hotel in [[Burslem]]. The unique environment of [[The Potteries]] was certainly an inspiration. He wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that "the district made an immense impression on me." The inspiration for some of his descriptions in ''The War of the Worlds'' is thought to have come from his short time spent here, seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city, shooting huge red light into the skies. His stay in The Potteries also resulted in the macabre short story "[[The Cone]]" (1895, contemporaneous with his famous ''The Time Machine''), set in the north of the city.

After teaching for some time, Wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the College of Preceptors ([[College of Teachers]]). He later received his Licentiate and Fellowship [[College of Teachers|FCP]] diplomas from the College. It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in [[zoology]] from the [[University of London External System|University of London External Programme]]. In 1889–90 he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School, where he taught [[A. A. Milne]].<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22657 | year = 1989 | title = Hampstead: Education | journal = A History of the County of Middlesex | volume = 9 | pages = 159–169 | accessdate =9 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/aamilne.htm |title=A.

Upon leaving the Normal School of Science, Wells was left without a source of income. His aunt Mary—his father's sister-in-law—invited him to stay with her for a while, which solved his immediate problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's residence, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel. He would later go on to court her.

In 1891, Wells [[cousin marriage|married his cousin]] Isabel Mary Wells. The couple agreed to separate in 1894 when he fell in love with one of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins (later known as Jane), whom he married in 1895.<ref>Batchelor (1985: 165)</ref> Poor health took him to Sandgate, near [[Folkestone]], where in 1901 he constructed a large family home: [[Spade House]]. He had two sons with Jane: [[G. P. Wells|George Philip]] (known as "Gip") in 1901 (died 1985) and Frank Richard in 1903 (died 1982).

With his wife Jane's consent, Wells had [[affair]]s with a number of women, including the American [[birth control]] activist [[Margaret Sanger]], adventurer and writer [[Odette Keun]], Ukrainian spy [[Moura Budberg]] and novelist [[Elizabeth von Arnim]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Lynn|first=Andrea|title=Shadow Lovers: The Last Affairs of H.

One of the ways that Wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches. One common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries, and they covered a wide variety of topics, from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests. During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, he drew a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments on their marriage. During this period, he called these pictures "picshuas".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/06/0531wells.html |title=H. G.

===Writer===
[[File:Woking tripod.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Statue of a ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripod]], erected as a tribute to H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Wells in the centre of the town of [[Woking]], England]]

Some of his early novels, called "[[scientific romance]]s", invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as ''[[The Time Machine]]'', ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[The Sleeper Awakes|When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', and ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''. He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including ''[[Kipps]]'' and a critique of English culture during the Edwardian period, ''[[Tono-Bungay]]''. Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, the best known of which is "[[The Country of the Blind]]" (1904).

According to [[James E. Gunn (writer)|James Gunn]], one of Wells' major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his "new system of ideas".<ref>[http://www.sfcenter.ku.edu/tomorrow.htm The Man Who Invented Tomorrow] In 1902, when Arnold Bennett was writing a long article for Cosmopolitan about Wells as a serious writer, Wells expressed his hope that Bennett would stress his "new system of ideas." Wells developed a theory to justify the way he wrote (he was fond of theories), and these theories helped others write in similar ways.</ref> In his opinion the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as "the plausible impossible" and "[[suspension of disbelief]]". While neither invisibility or time travel were new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. In "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he therefore used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the "law" appears in his introduction to ''The Scientific Romances of H.G. Wells'' (1933),

<blockquote>"As soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real. Touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis. Any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention."<ref>{{cite book|last1=D. Behlkar|first1=Ratnakar|title=Science Fiction: Fantasy and Reality|date=2009|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Dist|page=19}}</ref></blockquote>

Though ''Tono-Bungay'' is not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it. Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914). This book contains what is surely his biggest prophetic "hit". Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of [[radium]] releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years. The ''rate'' of release is too slow to have practical utility, but the ''total amount'' released is huge. Wells's novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosives—but which "continue to explode" for days on end. "Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century", he wrote, "than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible&nbsp;... [but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands". In 1932, the physicist and conceiver of [[nuclear chain reaction]] [[Leó Szilárd]] read ''The World Set Free'', a book which he said made a great impression on him.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Richard Rhodes]] | year = 1986 | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York | page = 24 | isbn = 0-684-81378-5}}</ref>

Wells also wrote nonfiction. Wells's first nonfiction [[bestseller]] was ''[[Anticipations|Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought]]'' (1901). When originally serialized in a magazine it was subtitled, "An Experiment in Prophecy", and is considered his most explicitly [[future|futuristic]] work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German [[militarism]], and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful [[aircraft]] before 1950, and averred that "my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanityplus.org/learn/about-us/wells |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520001844/http://humanityplus.org/learn/about-us/wells |archivedate=20 May 2009 |title=Annual HG Wells Award for Outstanding Contributions to Transhumanism |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Frank Miller|title=Contesting Cultural Authority: Essays in Victorian Intellectual Life|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-37257-7|pages=219–20|chapter=Public Science in Britain 1880–1919}}</ref>

His bestselling two-volume work, ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1920), began a new era of popularised world history. It received a mixed critical response from professional historians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~tdoyle/hgwells/outline_hist.shtml |title=The Outline of History—H. G. Wells |publisher=Cs.clemson.edu |date=20 April 2003 |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> However, it was very popular amongst the general population and made Wells a rich man. Many other authors followed with "Outlines" of their own in other subjects. Wells reprised his ''Outline'' in 1922 with a much shorter popular work, ''A Short History of the World'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/86/ |title=Wells, H. G. 1922. A Short History of the World |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> and two long efforts, ''[[The Science of Life]]'' (1930) and ''The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind'' (1931). The "Outlines" became sufficiently common for [[James Thurber]] to parody the trend in his humorous essay, "An Outline of Scientists"—indeed, Wells's ''Outline of History'' remains in print with a new 2005 edition, while ''A Short History of the World'' has been  re-edited (2006).

From quite early in his career, he sought a better way to organize society, and wrote a number of [[Utopia]]n novels. The first of these was ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with "no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all";<ref>''A Modern Utopia''</ref> two travellers from our world fall into its [[alternate history]]. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realize a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a [[comet]] causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (''[[In the Days of the Comet]]'' (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 [[Alexander Korda]] film, ''[[Things to Come]]''). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending [[World War II|World War]], with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of [[fascism|fascist]] dictators in ''The Autocracy of Mr Parham'' (1930) and ''The Holy Terror'' (1939). ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the critic [[Malcolm Cowley]] stated "by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer".<ref>Cowley, Malcolm. "Outline of Wells's History." ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (pp. 22–23).</ref>

[[File:H. G. Wells Daily Mirror.jpg|right|thumb|upright|H. G. Wells circa 1918]]
Wells contemplates the ideas of [[nature and nurture]] and questions humanity in books such as ''The Island of Doctor Moreau''. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a [[dystopia]]n novel, ''When the Sleeper Wakes'' (1899, rewritten as ''The Sleeper Awakes'', 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers. ''The Island of Doctor Moreau'' is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like [[Gulliver's Travels|Gulliver]] on his return from the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.

Wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of [[W. N. P. Barbellion]]'s diaries, ''The Journal of a Disappointed Man'', published in 1919. Since "Barbellion" was the real author's [[pen name]], many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the ''Journal''; Wells always denied this, despite being full of praise for the diaries, but the rumours persisted until Barbellion's death later that year.

In 1927 a Canadian citizen, [[Florence Deeks]] (1864–1959), unsuccessfully sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust, claiming that much of ''The Outline of History'' had been plagiarized from her unpublished manuscript,<ref>At the time of the alleged infringement in 1919-20, unpublished works were protected in Canada under common law.{{cite journal |last=Magnusson |first=Denis N. |date=Spring 2004 |title=Hell Hath No Fury: Copyright Lawyers' Lessons from ''Deeks v. Wells'' |journal=Queen's Law Journal |volume=29 |page=692, note 39}}</ref> ''The Web of the World's Romance'', which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Magnusson |first=Denis N. |date=Spring 2004 |title=Hell Hath No Fury: Copyright Lawyers' Lessons from ''Deeks v. Wells'' |journal=Queen's Law Journal |volume=29 |page=682}}</ref>

In 2000, [[A. B. McKillop]], a professor of history at Carleton University and a leading Canadian historian, produced a book on the Deeks versus Wells case, called ''The Spinster & The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past''.<ref>McKillop, A. B. (2000) Macfarlane Walter & Ross, Toronto.</ref> McKillop had been researching another Canadian historical figure when he came across information relating to this, and intrigued, followed through with this book. According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author; McKillop paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case, and suggests that in a more modern court, she would have been successful.

Deeks's manuscript was apparently sent to MacMillan and Company, UK, to check that references to other works did not violate copyright. It appeared to go through the hands of one of the editors in the UK who passed it onto Wells, as he knew Wells was thinking of a similar project. The net result was that Deeks's eventually rejected work came back and when it was eventually opened, it was found "soiled, thumbed, worn and torn, with over a dozen pages turned down at the corners, and many others creased as if having been bent back in use".<ref>Deeks, Florence A. (1930s) "Plagiarism?" unpublished typescript, copy in Deeks Fonds, Baldwin Room, Toronto Reference Library, Toronto, Ontario.</ref> When she compared her work to ''The Outline of History'' in the winter of 1920–21 she found remarkable similarities, exact text similarities, and the same errors and omissions that marred her work, also in Wells's.

In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, had published in ''Queen's Law Journal'' an article on ''Deeks v. Wells''. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book (described as "a novel" in the editorial introduction). While having some sympathy for Deeks, he "challenges the outpouring of public support" for her. He argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with [[sexism]] from her lawyers, she did receive a fair trial. He goes on to say that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Magnusson |first=Denis N. |date=Spring 2004 |title=Hell Hath No Fury: Copyright Lawyers' Lessons from Deeks v.

In 1933 Wells predicted in ''The Shape of Things to Come'' that the world war he feared would begin in January 1940,<ref>{{cite book|title=The shape of things to come: the ultimate revolution|edition=Penguin 2005|year=1933|isbn=0-14-144104-6|page=208|chapter=9.

In 1936, before the [[Royal Institution]], Wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World [[Encyclopaedia]], to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being. In 1938, he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education, ''[[World Brain]]'', including the essay, "The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia".

Prior to 1933, Wells's books were widely read in Germany and Austria, and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication.<ref name="Partington"/> By 1933 he had attracted the attention of German officials because of his criticism of the political situation in Germany, and on 10 May 1933, Wells's books were [[List of book-burning incidents#Jewish, anti-Nazi and "degenerate" books (by the Nazis)|burned by the Nazi youth]] in Berlin's [[Bebelplatz|Opernplatz]], and his works were banned from libraries and bookstores.<ref name="Partington">Patrick Parrinder and John S. Partington (2005). ''The Reception of H. G. Wells in Europe''. pp. 106-108. Bloomsbury Publishing.</ref> Wells, as president of [[PEN International]] (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), angered the [[Nazism|Nazis]] by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN's refusal to admit non-[[Aryan]] writers to its membership. At a PEN conference in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Wells refused to yield to Nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author [[Ernst Toller]] be prevented from speaking.<ref name="Partington"/> Near the end of the World War II, [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] discovered that the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned [[Operation Sea Lion]], with Wells included in the alphabetical list of "[[The Black Book]]".<ref>Wells, Frank. ''H. G. Wells—A Pictorial Biography''. London: Jupiter Books, 1977, p. 91.</ref>

Seeking a more structured way to play war games, Wells also wrote ''[[Floor Games]]'' (1911) followed by ''[[Little Wars]]'' (1913). ''Little Wars'' is recognised today as the first [[Miniature wargaming|recreational war game]] and Wells is regarded by gamers and hobbyists as "the Father of Miniature War Gaming".<ref>[http://theminiaturespage.com/ref/minigide.html The Miniatures Page].

===Final years===
[[File:Herbert George Wells in 1943.jpg|right|thumb|upright|H. G. Wells in 1943]]
Wells's literary reputation declined as he spent his later years promoting causes that were rejected by most of his contemporaries as well as by younger authors whom he had previously influenced. In this connection [[George Orwell]] described Wells as "too sane to understand the modern world".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Orwell|first=George|title=Wells, Hitler and the World State|journal=Horizon|date=August 1941|url=http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/wells/english/e_whws}}</ref> [[G. K. Chesterton]] quipped: "Mr Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message".<ref>Chesterton's reference is to the biblical "[[mess of pottage]]", implying that Wells had sold out his artistic birthright in mid-career: {{cite book|last1=Rolfe|first1=Christopher|last2=Parrinder|first2=Patrick|authorlink2=|title=H.

Wells had [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Who_we_are/History/HG-Wells/ |title=HG Wells—Diabetes UK |publisher=Diabetes.org.uk |date=14 April 2008 |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110106003137/http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Who_we_are/History/HG-Wells/ |archivedate=6 January 2011 }}</ref> and was a co-founder in 1934 of The Diabetic Association (what is now [[Diabetes UK]], the leading charity for people with diabetes in the UK).<ref>[http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Who_we_are/History/ "Diabetes UK: Our History"]. diabetes.org.uk. Retrieved 10 December 2015</ref>

On 28 October 1940, on the radio station [[KTSA]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Wells took part in a radio interview with [[Orson Welles]], who two years previously had performed a famous [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|radio adaptation of ''The War of the Worlds'']]. During the interview, by Charles C Shaw, a KTSA radio host, Wells admitted his surprise at the widespread panic that resulted from the broadcast, but acknowledged his debt to Welles for increasing sales of one of his "more obscure" titles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flynn|first=John L. |authorlink=|title=War of the Worlds: from Wells to Spielberg by |publisher=Galactic|isbn=978-0-9769400-0-5|location=Owens Mills, MD|page=45|chapter=The legacy of Orson Welles and the Radio Broadcast}}</ref>

Wells died of unspecified causes on 13 August 1946, aged 79, at his home at 13 Hanover Terrace, [[Regent's Park]], London.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=H. G.

==Political views==
{{Main|Political views of H.G. Wells}}

===The Fabian Society===
Wells called his political views socialist. He was for a time a member of the socialist [[Fabian Society]], but broke with them as his creative political imagination, matching the originality shown in his fiction, outran theirs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Cole|editor=Morris, A. J. Anthony|title=Edwardian radicalism, 1900–1914: some aspects of British radicalism|year=1974|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-7100-7866-8|pages=97–114|chapter=H. G. Wells and the Fabian Society}}</ref> He later grew staunchly critical of them as having a poor understanding of economics and educational reform. He ran as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[London University (UK Parliament constituency)|London University]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general elections]] after the death of his friend [[W. H. R. Rivers]], but at that point his faith in the party was weak or uncertain.

===Class===
Social class was a theme in Wells's ''[[The Time Machine]]'' in which the Time Traveller speaks of the future world, with its two races, as having evolved from:<blockquote>"the gradual widening of the present (19th century) merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer.&nbsp;... Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth? Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people&nbsp;... is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35/35.txt |title=''The Time Machine'' |date= |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> "</blockquote>
Wells has this very same Time Traveller, reflecting his own socialist leanings, refer in a tongue-in-cheek manner to an imagined world of stark class division as "perfect" and with no social problem unsolved. His Time Traveller thus highlights how strict class division leads to the eventual downfall of the human race: <blockquote>"Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> "</blockquote>

In his book ''[[The Way the World is Going]]'', Wells called for a non-Marxist form of [[socialism]] that would avoid both [[Class conflict|class war]] and conflict between nations.<ref>H. G. Wells, ''The Way the World is Going''. London, Ernest Benn, 1928, (p. 49).</ref>

===World government===
Wells's most consistent political ideal was the [[World government|World State]]. He stated in his autobiography that from 1900 onward he considered a World State inevitable. He envisioned the state to be a planned society that would advance science, end nationalism, and allow people to progress by merit rather than birth.

In ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1900) Wells envisaged that "the great urban region between Chicago and the Atlantic” will unify the English-speaking states, and this larger English-speaking unit, “a New Republic dominating the world,” will by the year 2000 become the means “by which the final peace of the world may be assured forever." It will be “a new social Hercules that will strangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle.” Such a synthesis "of the peoples now using the English tongue, I regard not only as possible, but as a probable, thing.”<ref>''[[Anticipations]]'', pp 100-101.</ref> The New Republic “will already be consciously and pretty freely controlling the general affairs of humanity before this century closes…” Its principles and opinions “must necessarily shape and determine that still ampler future of which the coming hundred years is but the opening phase.” The New Republic must ultimately become a "World-State."<ref>''[[Anticipations]]'', p 107.</ref>

Wells's 1928 book ''[[The Open Conspiracy]]'' argued that groups of campaigners should advocate a "world commonwealth", governed by a scientific elite, that would work to eliminate problems such as poverty and warfare.<ref>Wells, H. G. ''The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Doran, 1928), pp. 28, 44, 196.</ref> In 1932, Wells told Young Liberals at the [[University of Oxford]] that [[Progressivism|progressive]] leaders must become [[:wikt:small-l liberal|liberal]] [[fascists]] who would "compete in their enthusiasm and self-sacrifice" against the advocates of dictatorship.<ref>[[Mark Mazower|Mazower, Mark]], ''Dark Continent:Europe's Twentieth Century''. New York : A. A. Knopf, 1998. ISBN 0679438092 pp. 21–22.</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last =Coupland| first =Philip| title =H. G. Wells's "Liberal Fascism"| journal =Journal of Contemporary History| volume =35| issue =4| page =549| date =October 2000}}</ref> In 1940, Wells published a book called ''[[The New World Order (Wells)|The New World Order]]'' that outlined his plan as to how a World Government would be set up. In ''The New World Order'', Wells admitted that the establishment of such a government could take a long time, and be created in a piecemeal fashion.<ref>Partington, John S. ''Building Cosmopolis: The Political Thought of H. G. Wells''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003. ISBN 0754633837, (p. 16).</ref>

===Eugenics===
Some of Wells's early science fiction works reflect his thoughts about the degeneration of humanity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/deviance/biographies/wells.htm |title=H. G. Wells and the uses of Degeneration in Literature |publisher=Bbk.ac.uk |date=1946-08-17 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}</ref> Wells doubted whether human knowledge had advanced sufficiently for eugenics to be successful. In 1904 he discussed a survey paper by [[Francis Galton]], co-founder of [[eugenics]], saying, "I believe that now and always the conscious selection of the best for reproduction will be impossible; that to propose it is to display a fundamental misunderstanding of what individuality implies&nbsp;... It is in the [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]] of failure, and not in the selection of successes for breeding, that the possibility of an improvement of the human stock lies". In his 1940 book ''The Rights of Man: Or What Are We Fighting For?'' Wells included among the [[human rights]] he believed should be available to all people, "''a prohibition on mutilation, sterilization, torture, and any bodily punishment''".<ref>Andrew Clapham, ''Human Rights:A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford : [[Oxford University Press]], 2007. ISBN 9780199205523 (pp. 29-31).</ref>

===Race===
Wells's 1906 book ''[[The Future in America: A Search After Realities|The Future in America]]'', contains a chapter, "The Tragedy of Colour", which discusses the problems facing black Americans.<ref name="H. G. Wells, 1906 p. 201">H. G. Wells, ''The Future in America'' (New York and London: Harper and Brothers, 1906), p. 201 (Chs. 11 & 12,).</ref> While writing the book, Wells met with [[Booker T. Washington]], who provided him with much of his information for the book.<ref>Virginia L. Denton, ''Booker T. Washington and the Adult Education Movement''. University Press of Florida, 1993. ISBN 0813011825. pp. 150, 231.</ref> Wells praised the "heroic" resolve of black Americans, stating he doubted if the US could:
<blockquote>"show any thing finer than the quality of the resolve, the steadfast effort hundreds of black and coloured men are making to-day to live blamelessly, honourably, and patiently, getting for themselves what scraps of refinement, learning, and beauty they may, keeping their hold on a civilization they are grudged and denied."<ref name="H. G. Wells, 1906 p. 201" /></blockquote>
In his 1916 book ''What Is Coming?'' Wells states, "I hate and despise a shrewish suspicion of foreigners and foreign ways; a man who can look me in the face, laugh with me, speak truth and deal fairly, is my brother, though his skin is as black as ink or as yellow as an evening primrose".<ref>''What is Coming? A Forecast of Things after the War'', London, Cassell, 1916, p. 256.</ref>

In ''The Outline of History'', Wells argued against the idea of "racial purity", stating: "Mankind from the point of view of a biologist is an animal species in a state of arrested differentiation and possible admixture.&nbsp;... [A]ll races are more or less mixed".<ref>H. G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 110 (Ch. XII, §§1–2).</ref>

In 1931 Wells was one of several signatories to a letter in Britain (along with 33 British [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]) protesting against the death sentence passed upon the African-American [[Scottsboro Boys]].<ref>Susan D. Pennybacker, ''From Scottsboro to Munich: Race and Political Culture in 1930s Britain'' Princeton University Press, 2009. ISBN 0691088284, (p. 29).</ref>

In 1943 Wells wrote an article for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', "What a Zulu Thinks of the English", prompted by receiving a letter from a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] soldier, Lance Corporal Aaron Hlope.<ref name="zulu">"What a Zulu Thinks of the English" was reprinted as "The Rights of Man in South Africa" in
'''42 to '44: A Contemporary Memoir'' (London, Secker and Warburg, 1944) p. 68–74.</ref> Wells's article was a strong attack on anti-black discrimination in South Africa. Wells claimed he had "the utmost contempt and indignation for the unfairness of the handicaps put upon men of colour". Wells also denounced the South African government as a "petty white tyranny".<ref name="zulu" />

===Zionism===
Wells had given some moderate, unenthusiastic support for [[Territory|Territorialism]] before the First World War, but later became a bitter opponent of the Zionist movement in general. He saw [[Zionism]] as an exclusive and separatist movement which challenged the collective solidarity he advocated in his vision of a world state. No supporter of Jewish identity in general, Wells had in his utopian writings predicted the ultimate assimilation of the [[Jewish people]].<ref>Cheyette, Bryan. ''Constructions of "the Jew" in English Literature and Society''. Cambridge University Press, 1995, pp. 143–48.</ref> In notes to accompany his [[biographical novel]] ''A Man of Parts'' [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] describes how Wells came to regret his attitudes to the Jews as he became more aware of the extent of the Nazi atrocities.<ref name="Lodge"/> This included a letter of apology written to [[Chaim Weizmann]] for earlier statements he had made.<ref name="Lodge">{{cite book|last=Lodge|first=David|authorlink=David Lodge (author)|title=A Man of Parts|year=2011|publisher=Secker|location=London |isbn=9781846554964|page=521}}</ref>

===First World War===
He supported Britain in the [[First World War]] in his 1914 article, "Why Britain Went To War",<ref>H. G. Wells: [https://archive.org/stream/warillustratedal01hammuoft?ui=embed#page/10/mode/1up Why Britain Went To War] (10 August 1914). ''[[The War Illustrated]]'' album de luxe.

The Amalgamated Press, London 1915.</ref> despite his many criticisms of British policy, and opposed, in 1916, moves for an early peace.<ref>''Daily Herald'', 27 May 1916.</ref> In an essay published that year he acknowledged that he could not understand those British pacifists who were reconciled to "handing over great blocks of the black and coloured races to the [German Empire] to exploit and experiment upon" and that the extent of his own pacifism depended in the first instance upon an armed peace, with "England keep[ing] to England and Germany to Germany". State boundaries would be established according to natural ethnic affinities, rather than by planners in distant imperial capitals, and overseen by his envisaged world alliance of states.<ref name=WIC>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H.

===Soviet Union===
The leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]] led to a change in his view of the Soviet Union even though his initial impression of Stalin himself was mixed. He disliked what he saw as a narrow orthodoxy and intransigence in Stalin. He did give him some praise saying in an article in the left-leaning ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 1934, "I have never met a man more fair, candid, and honest" and making it clear that he felt the "sinister" image of Stalin was unfair or false.<ref>Adam Bruno Ulam (2007). "Stalin: The Man and His Era". p. 359. Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2007</ref> Nevertheless, he judged Stalin's rule to be far too rigid, restrictive of independent thought, and blinkered to lead toward the Cosmopolis he hoped for.<ref>''Experiment in Autobiography'', pp. 215, 687–689.</ref> In the course of his visit to the Soviet Union in 1934, he debated the merits of [[Reformism|reformist]] socialism over [[Marxism-Leninism]] with Stalin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rationalrevolution.net/special/library/cc835_44.htm |title=Joseph Stalin and H. G. Wells, Marxism vs. Liberalism: An Interview |publisher=Rationalrevolution.net |date= |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>

In 1939 Wells denounced the ideological takeover of science by fascism and communism:

<blockquote>"In Communist circles you may hear the most terrible balderdash about proletarian chemistry or proletarian mathematics. In Germany also it is alleged that some remarkable iniquity attaches to Jewish physics and Einstein is denounced and banned."<ref>Patrick Parrinder, John S. Partington (2005). "The Reception of H.G. Wells in Europe". p. 102. Bloomsbury Publishing.</ref></blockquote>

===Other endeavours===
Wells brought his interest in art and design, and politics together when he and other notables signed a memorandum to the Permanent Secretaries of the Board of Trade, among others. The November 1914 memorandum expressed the signatories concerns about British industrial design in the face of foreign competition. The suggestions were accepted, leading to the foundation of the [[Design and Industries Association]].<ref>Raymond Plummer, ''[http://www.dia.org.uk/page/AboutUs/Nothing_Need_be_Ugly Nothing Need be Ugly]'' Design & Industries Assn., June 1985.</ref> In the 1920s he was an enthusiastic supporter of rejuvenation attempts by [[Eugen Steinach]] and others. He was a patient of Dr [[Norman Haire]] (perhaps a rejuvenated one) and in response to Haire's 1924 book ''Rejuvenation: the Work of Steinach, Voronoff, and Others'',<ref>{{Citation | author1=Haire, Norman | title=Rejuvenation : the work of Steinach, Voronoff, and others | publication-date=1924 | publisher=G. Allen & Unwin | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/3654837 | accessdate=15 April 2013 }}</ref> Wells prophesied a more mature, graver society with "active and hopeful children" and adults "full of years" where none will be "aged".<ref>Diana Wyndham. {{cite web|url= http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/sup/9781743320068|title=''Norman Haire and the Study of Sex''}} Foreword by the Hon. [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] AC CMG. Sydney: {{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/sup/|title=Sydney University Press}}, 2012, p. 117.</ref>

In his later political writing, Wells incorporated into his discussions of the World State a notion of universal human rights that would protect and guarantee the freedom of the individual. His 1940 publication ''The Rights of Man'' laid the groundwork for the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref>[http://www.academia.edu/400254/Human_Rights_and_Public_Accountability_in_H._G._Wells_Functional_World_State 'Human Rights and Public Accountability in H. G. Wells' Functional World State' | John Partington]. Academia.edu. Retrieved on 9 August 2013.</ref>

===Summary===
In the end Wells's contemporary political impact was limited, excluding his fiction's positivist stance on the leaps that could be made by [[physics]] towards world peace. His efforts regarding the [[League of Nations]] became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature. In his last book ''[[Mind at the End of Its Tether]]'' (1945) he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea. He also came to refer to the Second World War era as "The Age of Frustration".

==Religious views==
Wells wrote in his book ''God the Invisible King'' (1917) that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world: <blockquote>"This book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer. [Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God.&nbsp;... Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is opposed to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer would suggest that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus."<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H. G. |title=God the Invisible King|publisher=Cassell|location=London|year=1917|chapter=Preface|oclc=261326125|isbn=0-585-00604-0}} [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1046/1046-h/1046-h.htm Link to the online book.].</ref></blockquote> Later in the work he aligns himself with a "renascent or modern religion&nbsp;... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian&nbsp;... [that] he has found growing up in himself".<ref>Wells (1917: "The cosmology of modern religion").</ref>

Of [[Christianity]] he has this to say: "it is not now true for me.&nbsp;... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother&nbsp;... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie". Of other world religions he writes: "All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.&nbsp;... They do not work for me".<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H.

[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1951win n4.jpg|thumb|upright|Wells's works were reprinted in American science fiction magazines as late as the 1950s]]
The science fiction historian [[John Clute]] describes Wells as "the most important writer the genre has yet seen", and notes his work has been central to both British and American science fiction.<ref name="jc">John Clute, ''Science Fiction :The Illustrated Encyclopedia''. Dorling Kindersley London, ISBN 0751302023 (p. 114–15).</ref> He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1921, 1932, 1935, and 1946.<ref name="Nobel nominations">[http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=10075 "Nomination Database: Herbert G Wells"]. Nobel Prize.org. Retrieved 19 March 2015.</ref>

In Britain, Wells's work was a key model for the British "[[Scientific Romance]]", and other writers in that mode, such as [[Olaf Stapledon]],<ref>Andy Sawyer, "[William] Olaf Stapledon (1886–1950)", in ''Fifty Key Figures in Science Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 2010. ISBN 0203874706 (pp. 205–210).</ref> [[J. D. Beresford]],<ref name="rb">[[Richard Bleiler]], "John Davis Beresford (1873–1947)" in Darren Harris-Fain, ed.

Robert Reginald, Douglas Menville, Mary A. Burgess. Detroit—Gale Research Company. ISBN 0810310511 p. 1002.</ref> all drew on Wells's example. Wells was also an important influence on British science fiction of the period after the Second World War, with [[Arthur C. Clarke]]<ref>Michael D. Sharp, ''Popular Contemporary Writers'', Marshall Cavendish, 2005 ISBN 0761476016 p. 422.</ref> and [[Brian Aldiss]]<ref>Michael R. Collings, ''Brian Aldiss''. Mercer Island, WA : Starmont House, 1986. ISBN 0916732746 p. 60.</ref> expressing strong admiration for Wells's work.

In the United States, [[Hugo Gernsback]] reprinted most of Wells's work in the pulp magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', regarding Wells's work as "texts of central importance to the self-conscious new genre".<ref name="jc" /> Later American writers such as [[Ray Bradbury]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.strandmag.com/the-magazine/interviews/ray-bradbury/|title=Ray Bradbury|work=Strand Mag}}</ref> [[Isaac Asimov]],<ref>''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov 1920–1954.'' Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday, 1979. p. 167.</ref> [[Frank Herbert]]<ref>{{Wayback |date=20121021031705 |url=http://members.multimania.co.uk/Fenrir/ctdinterviews.htm |title=Vertex Magazine Interview }} with Frank Herbert, by Paul Turner, October 1973, Volume 1, Issue 4.</ref> and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]<ref name="jh2">John Huntington, "Utopian and Anti-Utopian Logic: H. G. Wells and his Successors". ''Science Fiction Studies'', July 1982.</ref> all recalled being influenced by Wells's work.

Wells also inspired writers of European speculative fiction such as [[Karel Čapek]]<ref name="jh2" /> and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].<ref name="jh2" />

*In [[M. P. Shiel]]'s short story "The Primate of the Rose" (1928), there is an unpleasant womanizer named E. P.

*In [[C. S. Lewis]]' novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945), the character Jules is a caricature of Wells,<ref>Rolfe; Parrinder (1990: 226)</ref> and much of Lewis's science fiction was written both under the influence of Wells and as an antithesis to his work (or, as he put it, an "exorcism"<ref>Lewis, C.

===Dramatic===
*[[Malcolm MacDowell]] portrays Wells in the 1979 [[science fiction film]] ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'', in which Wells uses a time machine to pursue [[Jack the Ripper]] to the present day.  In the film, Wells meets "Amy" in the future who then returns to 1895 to become his second wife Amy Catherine Robbins.
*Wells is portrayed in the 1985 story ''[[Timelash]]'' from the [[Doctor Who (season 22)|22nd season]] of the [[BBC]] science-fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. In this story, Herbert, an enthusiastic temporary companion to the Doctor, is revealed to be a young H. G. Wells. The plot is loosely based upon the themes and characters of ''[[The Time Machine]]'' with references to ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]''. The story jokingly suggests that Wells's inspiration for his later novels came from his adventure with the [[Sixth Doctor]]. 
*In the [[BBC2]] anthology series ''Encounters'', about imagined meetings between historical figures, ''Beautiful Lies'' (15 August 1992) centred on an acrimonious dinner party attended by Wells ([[Richard Todd]]), [[George Orwell]] ([[Jon Finch]]), and [[William Empson]] ([[Patrick Ryecart]]).
*The character of Wells also appeared in several episodes of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' (1993–1997), usually pitted against the time-traveling villain known as Tempus ([[Lane Davies]]). Wells's younger self was played by [[Terry Kiser]], and the older Wells was played by [[Hamilton Camp]].
*In the 2006 television docudrama ''[[HG Wells: War with the World]]'', Wells is played by [[Michael Sheen]].
*On the science fiction television series ''[[Warehouse 13]]'' (2009–2014), there is a female version Helena G. Wells. When she appeared she explained that her brother was her front for her writing because a female science fiction author would not be accepted.
*Comedian [[Paul F. Tompkins]] portrays a fictional Wells as the host of ''The Dead Authors Podcast'', wherein Wells uses his time machine to bring dead authors (played by other comedians) to the present and interview them.
*H.G. Wells as a young boy appears in the ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' episode "The Magnificent Eight". In this story, the boy Wells is dying of [[tuberculosis|consumption]], but is cured by a time-travelling [[Firestorm (comics)|Martin Stein]].
