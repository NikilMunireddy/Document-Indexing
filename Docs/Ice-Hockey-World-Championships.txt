The '''Ice Hockey World Championships''' are an annual men's [[ice hockey]] tournament organized by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF). First officially held at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], it is the sport's highest profile annual international tournament.

The IIHF was created in 1908 while the [[Ice Hockey European Championships|European Championships]], the precursor to the World Championships, were first held in 1910. The [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|tournament]] held at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] is recognized as the first Ice Hockey World Championship. Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also considered the World Championship for that year. The first World Championship that was held as an individual event was in [[1930 World Ice Hockey Championships|1930]] in which twelve nations participated. In [[1931 World Ice Hockey Championships|1931]], ten teams played a series of [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin format]] qualifying rounds to determine which nations participated in the medal round. Medals were awarded based on the final standings of the teams in the medal round. This basic format would be used until 1992 (although small variations were made). In 1951, thirteen nations took part and were split into two groups. The top seven teams (Pool A) played for the World Championship. The other six ([[IIHF World Championship Division I|Pool B]]) played for ranking purposes. During a congress in 1990, the IIHF introduced a playoff system. As the IIHF grew, more teams began to participate at the World Championships, so more pools (later renamed divisions) were introduced.

The modern format for the World Championship features 16 teams in the championship group, 12 teams in [[IIHF World Championship Division I|Division I]] and 12 teams in [[IIHF World Championship Division II|Division II]]. If there are more than 40 teams, the rest compete in [[IIHF World Championship Division III|Division III]]. The teams in the championship play a preliminary round, then the top eight teams play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion. Over the years, the tournament has gone through several [[Ice hockey rules|rule]] changes. In 1969 [[Checking (ice hockey)|body-checking]] in all three zones in a [[Ice hockey rink|rink]] was allowed, [[Hockey helmet|helmet]]s and [[goaltender mask]]s became mandatory in the early 1970s and in 1992 the IIHF began using the [[Penalty shootout|shootout]]. The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the [[National Hockey League rules|rules used in the NHL]]. The World Championships have been open to all players, both professional and amateur, since 1977. The IIHF requires that players are citizens of the country they represent and allow players to switch national teams provided that they play in their new nation for a certain period of time.

[[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]] was the tournament's first dominant team, [[List of IIHF World Championship medalists|winning the tournament]] 12 times between 1930 and 1952. The [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]], [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]], [[Great Britain men's national ice hockey team|Great Britain]] and [[Switzerland men's national ice hockey team|Switzerland]] were also competitive during this period. The [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] first participated in 1954 and soon became rivals with Canada. From 1963 until the nation's breakup in 1991, the Soviet Union was the dominant team, winning 20 championships. During that period, only three other nations won medals: Canada, Czechoslovakia and Sweden. [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]] first participated in 1992 and the [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovakia]] began competing in 1993. In the 2000s, the competition became more open as the "[[Big Six (hockey)|Big Six]]" teams<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-announces-world-cup-of-hockey-for-2016-1.2930670/|title=NHL announces World Cup of Hockey for 2016|publisher=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=2015-01-24|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref> – Canada, the Czech Republic, [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], Russia, Sweden, and the United States – as well as Slovakia became more evenly matched.

As this tournament takes place during the same time period as the [[NHL]]'s [[Stanley Cup]] [[Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], many of the best players do not participate, and it is considered secondary in importance among [[North American]] fans and players to the Stanley Cup. Thus, NHL players generally only participate once their respective team is eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. 

The [[2015 IIHF World Championship|79th World Championship]] was held in [[Prague]] and [[Ostrava]], [[Czech Republic]], and was the most successful to date in terms of [[List of IIHF World Championships by attendance|overall attendance]]. In the final, Canada defeated Russia to win their twenty-fifth title.

At the 1963 World Championships in Stockholm, the Soviet Union won the gold medal, beginning a streak of nine consecutive World Championship golds. The [[1964 Winter Olympics]] in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] marked the first time that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey. The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal, but Canada finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting them in a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Prior to 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovaks. The procedure had been changed to count all games and that meant the Canadians finished fourth.<ref>{{cite web|title=1964 – Winter Olympics IX (Innsbruck, Austria)|url=http://www.tsn.ca/olympics/feature/?fid=10273|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref> However, the Olympics also counted as the World Championships, and under IIHF rules, Canada should have won a bronze.<ref>{{cite web|title='64 Team Canada gets bronze medals|url=http://www.tsn.ca/canadian_hockey/story/?id=123399&lid=sublink05&lpos=topStory_canadian_hockey|publisher=The Sports Network|date=2005-04-30|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref> In April 2005, the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the 1964 Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal.<ref>{{cite news|title=1964 Canadian Olympic hockey team to be honoured|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/04/29/olympichockey050429.html|publisher=CBC Sports|date=2005-04-29|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref> However, two months later, the IIHF over-turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/canadian_hockey/story/?id=127513|title=IIHF denies Canada 1964 bronze|date=2005-06-05|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050921/TRUTH21/TPSports/Hockey|title=IIHF backs off on giving Canadians 1964 bronze medal|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|author=Houston, William|date=2005-09-21|accessdate=2009-03-10}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The Soviets dominated the remainder of the decade. Following 1963, the team went undefeated in Olympic and World Championship competition for four years.

With European teams constantly improving, the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive and pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF voted to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional players<ref name="Num17">{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html|title=Story #17–Protesting amateur rules, Canada leaves international hockey|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref> at the 1970 World Championships.

IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together and said that ice hockey's status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made. In response, Canada withdrew from International ice hockey competition.<ref name="Num17" /><ref>{{cite news| title = Summit Series '72 Summary| publisher = Hockey Hall of Fame| url = http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml| accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref> Canada's ice hockey team did not participate in the [[1972 Winter Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]].<ref name="Num17"/> Canada also waived their rights to host the 1970 World Championship, so it was held in Stockholm, Sweden instead.<ref name="Num40"/>

Led by goaltender [[Vladislav Tretiak]] and forwards [[Valeri Kharlamov]], [[Alexander Yakushev]], [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Petrov|Vladimir Petrov]] and [[Boris Mikhailov (ice hockey)|Boris Mikhailov]], the Soviet Union won gold at the 1970 and 1971 World Championships and the [[1972 Winter Olympics]].<ref name="Num67">{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-67.html|title=Story #67–The perfect game against the best team: Czechoslovaks-Soviets 7–2|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref> 1972 marked the first time that both the Olympics and World Championships were held in the same year as separate events.

It was one of the biggest margins the Soviet team had ever lost by in an official game.<ref name="Num67"/> The [[1976 World Ice Hockey Championships|1976 World Championships]] were held in [[Katowice]], [[Poland]]. On the opening day of the tournament, [[Poland men's national ice hockey team|Poland]] defeated the Soviet Union 6–4 thanks to a [[hat-trick]] from forward [[Wieslaw Jobczyk]] and the goaltending of [[Andrzej Tkacz]]. It was one of the biggest upsets in international hockey history; two months earlier at the [[1976 Winter Olympics]], Poland had lost 16–1 to the Soviets. The Soviets lost two more games and won the silver, and Czechoslovakia won gold. Poland finished seventh and was relegated to Pool B, the division in which teams play for ranking purposes and not the championship (now known as Division I).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-39.html|title=Story #39–Poland scores biggest shocker in World Championship history|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref>

===1976–1987: First years of open competition===
[[Günther Sabetzki]] became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. The IIHF agreed to allow "open competition" between all players in the World Championships, and moved the competition to later in the season so players not involved in the [[NHL playoffs]] could participate. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics, because of both the unwillingness of the NHL to take a break mid-season and the IOC's strict amateur-only policy. The IIHF also agreed to endorse the [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]], a competition meant to bring together the best players from the top hockey-playing countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-6.html|title=Story #6–First Canada Cup opens up the hockey world|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref>

The [[1976 World Ice Hockey Championships]] in [[Katowice]] were the first to feature professionals although in the end only the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]] made use of the new rule, recalling eight pros from the [[Minnesota North Stars]] and [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]]. The first fully open World Championship was held in [[1977 World Ice Hockey Championships|1977]] in [[Vienna]], Austria, and saw the first participation of active Canadian NHL players, including two-time [[Hart Memorial Trophy|NHL MVP]] [[Phil Esposito]]. Sweden and Finland also augmented their rosters with a few NHL and WHA players. Many of the players on the Canadian team were not prepared for the tournament and were unfamiliar with the international game. The team finished fourth, losing both games to the Soviet Union by a combined score of 19–2. Czechoslovakia won gold, becoming the third team (after Canada and the Soviet Union) to win consecutive championships.<ref name="Num13"/>

With NHL players participating in the tournament, IIHF officials began to fear that true amateurs and young players were losing their places. As a result, full world championship status was given to the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|IIHF World Under-20 Championship]], which had been held annually since 1974 as an unofficial invitational tournament. Colloquially known as the World Junior Hockey Championship, the event was structured after the World Championships, but limited to players under the age of 20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-91.html|title=Story #91–The World U20 Championship takes its place on the IIHF calendar|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref> The [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World Under-18 Championship]] was established in 1999 and typically held in April.

Starting in [[1978 World Ice Hockey Championships|1978]], the Soviet team won five consecutive World Championships, and had an unbeaten streak that
lasted from [[1981 World Ice Hockey Championships|1981]] through the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] and until [[1985 World Ice Hockey Championships|1985]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-62.html|title=Story #62–Soviets’ revenge for Lake Placid&nbsp;– 13–1 over Sweden|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref> During that period, Canada remained competitive, winning three bronze medals. World Championship tournaments were
not held in 1980, 1984 or 1988–the Olympic years.<ref name="AllMed"/>

The [[1987 World Ice Hockey Championships|1987 World Championships]] in Vienna were over-shadowed by several controversies. At the beginning of the tournament, the roster of the [[West Germany national ice hockey team|West German]] team included Miroslav Sikora, a Polish-German forward who had previously played for Poland at the [[1977 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1977 World Under-20 Championship]]. Sikora became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of West Germany and played in the first three games, scoring a goal in a 3–1 win over Finland. Following the game, Finland launched a protest, demanding that the result be over-turned because the Germans had used an
ineligible player. At the time, players were not allowed to switch nationalities under any circumstances and the IIHF agreed to overturn the result and award the two points to Finland. This angered German officials, who filed a protest in an Austrian court. The court agreed with the Germans, overturning the IIHF decision and allowing them to keep their points. The result affected the final standings because had the IIHF's decision stood, Finland would have advanced to the medal round instead of Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-29.html|title=Story #29–"Sikora case" – Vienna court decides the 1987 Worlds medal race|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref> However, the Finns finished out of the medal round, and Sweden won their first gold medal since 1962. The tournament format also became controversial because the Soviet Union finished undefeated but the Swedish team, which had lost three games in the preliminary round, won on goal differential because of a 9–0 win over Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-44.html|title=Story #44–Amid turmoil, Sweden wins first gold in a quarter of a century|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref>

The Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991. Nine former soviet states became part of the IIHF and began competing in international competitions, including [[Belarus men's national ice hockey team|Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan men's national ice hockey team|Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia men's national ice hockey team|Latvia]] and [[Ukraine national ice hockey team|Ukraine]].

The [[2011 IIHF World Championship|2011 tournament]] was held in independent Slovakia for the first time. Finland won its second world championship with a 6-1 victory over Sweden.

The [[2014 IIHF World Championship|2014]] was held for the first time in the independent Belarus in spite of concerns of the human rights abuses perpetuated by the authoritarian government.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hockey championship in Belarus: Lukashenko puts activists on ice|url=https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/05/hockey-belarus-lukashenko-puts-activists-ice/}}</ref> The tournament saw more upsets by the less prominent ice-hockey nations. France has beaten Canada for the second time in the modern history and made it to the quarterfinal. Eventual finalists Finland lost to Latvia and made it to the quarterfinals only due to a shootout win over Switzerland. The tournament was won by Russia, Finland won silver and Sweden won bronze defeating the Czech republic.

The [[2015 IIHF World Championship]] was held in Prague. It was to be the last appearance of [[Jaromír Jágr]] on the Czech national hockey team, and the home crowd had great expectations for its national team, who had failed to win a gold medal since 2010, matching its longest run without a win since the break-up of Czechoslovakia. However the tournament was dominated by an excellent Canadian team, which went undefeated and beat Russia 6-1 in the gold medal match. Its captain, [[Sidney Crosby]] joined the [[Triple Gold]] club, and became the first player to captain each team to a gold medal. The bronze was won by United States, condemning the Czechs to the second consecutive fourth place.

===History===
[[Image:Dmitry Medvedev 20 May 2008-2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Members of the 2008 World Champion Russian team with President [[Dmitry Medvedev]].]]
The first World Championship to be held as an individual event was in [[1930 World Ice Hockey Championships|1930]]. Twelve different nations participated. Canada's team was given a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] to the gold medal game, and the rest of the nations played an [[Single-elimination tournament|elimination tournament]] to determine which nation would also play for the gold.<ref name="HCanRelease">{{cite press release | title =World Championship statistics | publisher = [[Hockey Canada]] | format = PDF | url = http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/57519/la_id/1.htm | accessdate = 2009-03-11 | quote = Must be downloaded from link }}</ref>

In [[1931 World Ice Hockey Championships|1931]], the World Championships switched to a similar format to what was used at the Olympics. Ten teams played series of [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin format]] qualifying rounds were played to determine which nations participated in the medal round. Medals were awarded based on the final standings of the teams in the medal round.<ref name="HCanRelease"/> The format was changed several times in the 1930s, in some years there was a gold medal game, while in others the gold medal was awarded based on points.<ref name="HCanRelease"/>

In [[1937 World Ice Hockey Championships|1937]], the tournament format was again switched to being similar to the version used at the Olympics. A preliminary round involving 11 teams was played, then the top four advanced to the medal round and medals were awarded based on points; no gold medal game was played. A gold medal game was played in [[1938 World Ice Hockey Championships|1938]]; it was the last gold medal game played in the World Championships until 1992.<ref name="HCanRelease"/>

In 1951, thirteen nations took part and were split into two groups. The top seven teams (Pool A) played for the World Championship.<ref name="HCanRelease"/> The other six ([[IIHF World Championship Division I|Pool B]]) played for ranking purposes. Generally eight teams played in the top-level Championship, although the number varied over the years, going as low as three (in [[1953 World Ice Hockey Championships|1953]]) and as high as twelve (in [[1959 World Ice Hockey Championships|1959]]). The same format was used until 1992.<ref name="HCanRelease"/> The format was criticized because often the gold medal winner was decided before the final game was played, such as at the [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics]].

During a congress in 1990, the IIHF introduced a playoff system.<ref name="Timeline"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-89.html|title=Story #89–Finally, there's a real final game, The IIHF adopts a playoff system|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-03|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref>

As the IIHF grew, more teams began to participate at the World Championships, so more pools were introduced. [[IIHF World Championship Division II|Pool C]] games were first played in 1961 and [[IIHF World Championship Division III|Pool D]] was introduced in 1987.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Hong Kong in over its head in Pool D |work=[[The Atlanta Journal]]|date=1988-02-20}}</ref> In 2001, the pools were renamed: Pool B became Division I, Pool C became Division II and Pool D became Division III.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/en/iihf-home/history/past-tournaments/iihf-championships-2000.html|title=IIHF Championships 2000|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/en/iihf-home/history/past-tournaments/iihf-championships-2001.html|title=IIHF Championships 2001|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref>

===Modern Champion Group, Division I, II and III format===

The modern format for the World Championship features a minimum of 40 teams: 16 teams in the main championship group, 12 teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. If there are more than 40 teams, the rest compete in Division III.

From 1998 to 2011, the teams were divided into four groups and played each other in a [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] format preliminary round, and the top 3 teams in each group advance into the qualifying round. The qualifying round is another round of group play with two groups of six, with the top four teams in each group advancing into the [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] playoff stage. The bottom four teams in the preliminary round played in another group as well; this group determined [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]]. After a round-robin format, the bottom two teams were usually relegated to play in Division I the following year.<ref name="Format"/>

Between 1998 and 2004, the IIHF held a "Far East" qualifying tournament for Asian teams with an automatic berth in the championship division on the line. Japan always won this tournament, but finished last at every World Championship except in [[2004 IIHF World Championship|2004]], when they finished 15th. The IIHF discontinued the qualifying tournament following the 2004 tournament, and Japan was relegated to compete in Division I.<ref>{{cite journal|editor=Edvinsson, Jan-Ake | title =News release–Hockey fans are the best in the world| publisher = International Ice Hockey Federation |date=November 2003  | volume=7|issue=5|format = PDF | url = http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/The_IIHF/IIHF_Vol7No5.pdf | page=11|accessdate = 2009-03-12|work=Ice Times|ref=harv}}</ref>

===Champion group format from 2012===
The main group features 16 teams. The 16 teams are split into two groups based on their [[2008 IIHF World Ranking|world ranking]]. The ranking is based on the standings of the last Winter Olympics and the last four World Championships. The results of more recent tournaments have a higher weight in the ranking. The last World Championship has 100% value, the tournament before 75% and so on. The Olympic tournament has the same value as the World Championship the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/world-ranking/mens-world-ranking/2008-ranking.html|title=2008 Men's World Ranking|year=2008|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|date=2009-03-08}}</ref>

Beginning with the 2012 tournament, the qualifying round will be eliminated, and the 16 teams will be divided into two groups of eight, with each team playing seven games in the preliminary round.

The top four teams from these groups will advance to the [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] playoff stage. In the quarterfinals, the first place team from one group plays the fourth place team from the opposite group, and the second place team from one group plays the third place team from the opposite group. The winners advance to the semi-finals. In cases where the quarter-final venues are deemed too far apart to allow easy travel between them, the teams stay within their groups for the quarters. The winners of the quarter-finals advance to the semi-finals, with the winners of the semi-finals advancing to the Gold medal game and the losers advancing to the Bronze medal game.<ref name="Format">{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/competition/272/homeiihf/format-rules.html|title=Format & Rules|accessdate=2012-05-15|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation}}</ref>

Also starting in 2012, there will no longer be a relegation round. Instead, the eighth-place team in each group will be relegated to Division I.<ref name="Format"/>

===Division I, II and III formats from 2012===

Division I is split into two groups of six, both groups play in round robin tournaments independent of each other and the championship division. Previously the top team from both groups was promoted to the championship, while the bottom team was relegated to Division II. Beginning in 2012, the top two teams from the 'A' group will be promoted to the championship, the bottom team will be exchanged with the group 'B' winner, and that group's last place team will go down to Division II.

Division II works similarly to Division I, with two six-team groups where group 'A' promotes one team to Division I and group 'B' exchanges its last placed team with Division III. Division III is now composed of one group of six, and if more than six nations register for this, the lowest level, then a qualification tournament will be held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/channels-11/iihf-world-championship-wc11/news/news-singleview-2011/browse/1/article/changes-in-worlds-structure.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=3650&cHash=5db3e0e757|title=Changes in World Structure|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2012-01-25}}</ref><ref name="IIHFCal">{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships.html|title=Championships|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref>

==Rules==

===Game rules===
{{see also|Ice hockey rules}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05472, St. Moritz, Winterolympiade.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A game between Canada and Sweden during the 1928 Winter Olympics.]]
At the first tournament in 1920, there were many differences from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed,<ref name="Birth">{{cite journal|title=The Birth of Swedish Ice Hockey&nbsp;— Antwerp 1920|author=Hansen, Kenth|journal=Citius, Altius, Fortius|publisher=[[International Society of Olympic Historians]]|date=May 1996|volume=4|issue=2|pages=5–27|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv4n2/JOHv4n2c.pdf|format=PDF|ref=harv}}</ref> the rink was 56x18&nbsp;metres (the current International standard is 61x30&nbsp;metres) and two twenty-minute periods were played.<ref name="Num21"/> Each side had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the [[Rover (ice hockey)|rover]].<ref name="Timeline" /> Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the "Canadian rules"–six men per side and three periods of play.<ref name="Birth" />

At an IIHF congress in 1969, officials voted to allow [[Checking (ice hockey)|body-checking]] in all three zones in a [[Ice hockey rink|rink]] similar to the NHL. Prior to that, body-checking was only allowed in the [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] in international hockey. The IIHF later described the rule change as "arguably the most substantial and dramatic rule changes in the history of international hockey" because it allowed for a more aggressive game.<ref name="Num19">{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-19.html|title=Story #19–IIHF allows bodychecking in all three zones|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref> The rule, which was first applied at the 1970 World Championships, was controversial: IIHF president [[Bunny Ahearne]] feared it would make ice hockey "a sport for goons."<ref name="Num19"/> Several other rule changes were implemented in the early 1970s: players were required to wear [[Hockey helmet|helmet]]s starting in 1970 and [[goaltender mask]]s became mandatory in 1972.<ref name="Timeline"/> In 1992, the IIHF switched to using a playoff system to determine medalists and decided that tie games in the medal round would be decided in a [[Penalty shootout|shootout]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.iihf.com/archive/Overtimes.pdf |title=All game-winning shot competitions ("shootouts") |accessdate=2009-03-12 |publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090318020205/http://stats.iihf.com/archive/Overtimes.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> The IIHF decided to test a new rule in 1997 that would allow two-line [[Pass (ice hockey)|passes]]. Prior to that, the [[neutral zone trap]] had slowed the game down and reduced scoring. At the 1997 World Championships, teams were allowed to decide if they wanted to test the rule. Although no team accepted the offer, the rule was adopted. The IIHF described it as "the most revolutionary rule change since allowing body-checking in all three zones in 1969. [...] The new rule almost immediately changed the game for the better. The 1999 IIHF World Championship in Norway was a stark contrast to the finals the year before with many more goals scored and with end-to-end action&nbsp;– not defence&nbsp;– dominating play."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-27.html|title=Story #27–Dropping the red-line, allowing the two-line pass changes the Game|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-11|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref>

The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the [[National Hockey League rules|rules used in the NHL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html|title=IIHF Rule Book|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> One difference between NHL and IIHF rules is [[ice hockey rink|rink]] dimensions: the NHL rink is narrower, measuring 61x26&nbsp;metres (200x85&nbsp;feet), instead of the international size of 61x30&nbsp;metres (200x98.5&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Olympics/2010Vancouver/2006/06/08/1620669-sun.html|title=VANOC shrinks Olympic ice|date=2009-02-24|accessdate=2009-03-11|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]}}</ref> Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how [[Icing (ice hockey)|icings]] are called.

The NHL and IIHF differ also in penalty rules. The NHL, in addition to the [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Types of penalties|minor and double minor penalties]] called in IIHF games, calls major penalties which are more dangerous infractions of the rules, such as fighting, and have a duration of five minutes.<ref name="major">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |title=Major penalties |author=National Hockey League |publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=2006-06-08 |year=2005}}</ref> This is in contrast to the IIHF rule, in which players who fight are ejected from the game.<ref name="fighting_iihf">{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeycentral.co.uk/olympics/diff_rules.html |title=Ice Hockey Essentials&nbsp;— International vs. NHL |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC Sports]] |accessdate=2009-03-12 |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090903112524/http://www.hockeycentral.co.uk:80/olympics/diff_rules.html |archivedate=3 September 2009 }}</ref>

Beginning with the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]], the NHL instituted several new rules.

The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-93.html|title=Story #93–Tie games are history; a win earns three points for teams|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref>

===Player eligibility===
The World Championships have been open to all players, both professional and amateur, since 1977.<ref name="Num13">{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-13.html|title=Story #13–After a seven-year absence, Canada returns to the Worlds|accessdate=2009-03-10|year=2008|author1=Szemberg, Szymon|author2=Podnieks, Andrew}}</ref> The IIHF lists the following requirements for a player to be eligible to play:<ref name="Eligibility">{{cite web|title=IIHF Eligibility|url=http://www.iihf.com/en/home-of-hockey/championships/iihf-eligibility.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IIHF Statutes and Bylaws|url=http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/The_IIHF/2008-2012_IIHF_Statutes_and_Bylaws.pdf|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref>

*"Each player must be under the jurisdiction of an IIHF member national association."
*"Each player must be a citizen of the country he represents."
* Each player must be at least 18 years of age on the day the respective championship starts, or be at least 16 and obtain an under age waiver

If a player who has never played in an IIHF competition changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country for at least two consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC).<ref name="Eligibility"/> If a player who has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team, they must have played in their new country for four years. A player can only do this once.<ref name="Eligibility"/>

As this tournament takes place during the same time period as the NHL's [[Stanley Cup playoffs]], NHL players generally only become available if their respective NHL team did not make the playoffs, or once they have been eliminated from [[Stanley Cup]] contention. It is therefore common for several NHL players to join the World Championships while the tournament is already in progress.

==Directorate Awards==
{{main|List of IIHF World Championship directorate award winners}}
Since 1954, the IIHF has given awards for play during the World Championship tournament. Voted on by the tournament directorate, the first awards recognised the top goaltender, forward and defenceman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/5051/la_id/1.htm|title=IIHF directorate awards and most valuable player|publisher=Hockey Canada|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> In 1999, an award for the [[most valuable player]] was added. There is also an all-star team voted on by members of the media. In 2004, Canadian [[Dany Heatley]] became the first player to lead in scoring, win the MVP award, win the best forward award and be named to the all-star team in the same year.<ref>{{cite journal|editor=Edvinsson, Jan-Ake | title =News release–There is nothing like the sweet taste of gold| publisher = International Ice Hockey Federation |date=June 2004| volume=8|issue=3|format = PDF | url = http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/The_IIHF/IIHF_Vol8No3.pdf | page=11|accessdate = 2009-03-13|ref=harv}}</ref> He repeated the feat in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|editor=Edvinsson, Jan-Ake | title =Past, present & future collide in Canada| publisher = International Ice Hockey Federation |date=July 2008| volume=11|issue=3|format = PDF | url = http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/The_IIHF/IIHF_IceTimes_Vol12-3.pdf| page=11|accessdate = 2009-03-13|ref=harv}}</ref>
