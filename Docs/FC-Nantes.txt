'''Football Club de Nantes''' ({{Lang-br|Naoned}}, [[Gallo language|Gallo]]: ''Naunnt''; commonly referred to as simply '''Nantes''') is a [[Football in France|French association football]] club based in [[Nantes]], [[Pays de la Loire]]. The club was founded on 21 April 1943, during World War II, as a result of local clubs based in the city coming together to form one large club. From 1992 to 2007, the club was referred to as '''FC Nantes Atlantique''' before reverting to its current name at the start of the [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]]. Nantes currently play in [[Ligue 1]], the first division of French football. The first-team is currently managed by Franco-Armenian coach [[René Girard (footballer)|René Girard]] and [[Captain (association football)|captained]] by [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Rémy Riou]].

Nantes is one of the [[List of French football champions|most successful clubs]] in [[French football]], having won eight Ligue 1 titles, three [[Coupe de France]] wins and attained one [[Coupe de la Ligue]] victory. The club is famous for its ''jeu à la nantaise'' ("Nantes-style play"), its collective spirit, mainly advocated under coaches [[José Arribas]], [[Jean-Claude Suaudeau]] and [[Raynald Denoueix]] and for its [[youth system]], which has produced players such as [[Marcel Desailly]], [[Didier Deschamps]], [[Mickaël Landreau]], [[Claude Makélélé]], [[Christian Karembeu]] and [[Jérémy Toulalan]]. As well as ''Les Canaris'' (''The Canaries''), Nantes is also nicknamed ''Les jaunes et verts'' (''The Green and Yellows'') and ''La Maison Jaune'' (''The Yellow House'').

== History ==

=== 1940s – 1980s===

The club was founded in 1943. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.soccerway.com/teams/france/fc-nantes/889/|title=FC Nantes|work=Soccerway|publisher=Perform|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref>

The first match played by Nantes as a professional team took place at the [[Stade Olympique de Colombes]] against [[CA Paris-Charenton|CA Paris]], where Nantes triumphed 2–0. The first home match was a defeat of the same score against [[Troyes AC|Troyes]]. The club finished fifth at the end of this first season following which the club's manager Aimé Nuic left the club following a dispute, and was succeeded by [[Antoine Raab]], who took over in a player-coach role. After winning 16 consecutive matches, Nantes bowed down 9–0 to [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]]. In 1963, the town council decided to give substantial subsidies to the club to give it an advantage to climb into the next division.

[[Image:FCNA supporters.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Supporters at an away match]]
On 1 June 1963, the club won its place in the first division against Sochaux.  
Marcel Saupin died on 10 June and would never see the club he created amongst the elite. Nantes went on to win the 1964–65 and 1965–66 league titles with a well polished game, partly thanks to [[José Arribas]], a fan of a more offensive game strategy who was making his first contributions to that which would become known as the ''jeu à la nantaise''.

It was during this period that the famous ''jeu à la nantaise'', made up of well-oiled and offensive tactics, made its appearance.{{cn|date=September 2013}} In the summer of 1976, Arribas departed his role as manager and the reins were handed to [[Jean Vincent (footballer)|Jean Vincent]]. The former player, who had played for [[Stade de Reims]] during the club's successful years, remained the team's manager until 1982 when [[Jean-Claude Suaudeau]], another fan of the jeu à la nantaise style of play and a former Nantes player, replaced him. {{cn|date=December 2014}}

Apart from the titles of French champion which Nantes held in 1973, 1977, 1980 and 1983, the club won their first [[Coupe de France]] in 1979 against [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] courtesy of a 4–1 victory after extra time. [[Eric Pécout]] inserted his name into Nantes folklore by converting a hat-trick in the match. In June 1983, Nantes battled-out a Coupe de France final against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. In the match, Nantes striker [[José Touré]] scored a memorable goal, but, nevertheless, Nantes lost the match 3–2 preventing the club from obtaining the [[Double (association football)|league and cup double]].

They finished second in the 1984–85 championship (behind [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]) and in 1985–86 (behind Paris Saint-Germain). {{cn|date=December 2014}}

=== 1990s===
In July 1991, the club re-instated Jean-Claude Suaudeau, and in July 1992, after spending a fortnight in the second division due to an administrative decision by the ''DNCG'' (French Football's financial regulator), FC Nantes was renamed FC Nantes Atlantique, and was able to take its place in the first division back.

In 1992, the ''jeu à la nantaise'' made its comeback. The club subsequently made the finals of the French Championship in 1992–93; semi-finals of the French Cup in 1993–94; won the 1994–95 Championship and was Semi finalist in the Champion's league of 1995–96. This period saw the development of a host of players such as [[Japhet N'Doram]], [[Patrice Loko]], [[Reynald Pedros]], [[Nicolas Ouédec]], [[Claude Makélélé]] and [[Christian Karembeu]]. {{cn|date=December 2014|http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1995/index.html# = UEFA confirmation of results}}

=== 2000 – present ===
In the 2003–04 season, Nantes was defeated by Sochaux after a penalty shoot-out, thus depriving the team of the League Cup, and a spot in the UEFA Cup. {{cn|date=December 2014}}

[[File:FC Nantes Atlantique logo.svg|120px|left|thumb|Former logo (2004–08)]]Before the start of the 2005–06 season, Serge Dassault's team asked executives [[Robert Budzynski]] and Kléber Bobin as well as the players [[Mickaël Landreau]] and [[Frédéric Da Rocha]] to leave. At the same time, [[Vahid Halilhodžić]] was approached to become manager, even though [[Serge Le Dizet]] had only been in place for six months. Jean-Luc Gripond was also finally replaced by [[Rudi Roussillon]] on 28 June 2005 following an Extraordinary meeting of the Dassault group. {{cn|date=March 2016}}

Nantes secured a return to Ligue 1 on 25 April 2008 with a 1–1 draw against [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]]. In the [[Ligue 1 2008–09|2008–09 Ligue 1 season]], Nantes finished 19th and were relegated back to Ligue 2. {{cn|date=December 2014}}

During the [[2014–15 Ligue 1]] season, they enjoyed a run of nine matches without defeat before losing to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] on 28 November.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.presseocean.fr/actualite/fc-nantes-le-fcn-stoppe-a-marseille-0-2-28-11-2014-139150|title=FC Nantes: Le FCN stoppé à Marseille (0-2)|date=28 November 2014|work=Presse-Océan|accessdate=2 December 2014|language=fr}}</ref>

==Stadium==
[[File:Stade de la Beaujoire.jpg|thumb|Stade de la Beaujoire]]
Nantes' home ground since 1984 has been the [[Stade de la Beaujoire|Stade de la Beaujoire-Louis Fontenau]], which has a capacity of 38,004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ligue1.com/club/fc-nantes|title=FC Nantes|publisher=LFP|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> It held six matches at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and was also a venue at the [[2007 IRB Rugby World Cup]]. FC Nantes played its first match in La Beaujoire the 17st May 1984 vs Toulon (3-1) in front of 15 116 spectators. The capacity of the stadium at that time is 52 923 standing and seating seats. {{cn|date=March 2016}}

La Joneliere is a sport complex located in La Chapelle-sur-Erdre, on the river Loire, the training center of Nantes. The artificial turf and grass football fields of the facility currently host training sessions for the professional team and the FCN Youth academy. {{cn|date=March 2016}}
