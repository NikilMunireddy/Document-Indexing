The Indian Navy can trace its lineage back to the ''[[Honourable East India Company's Marine]]'' which was founded in 1612 to protect British merchant shipping in the region. In 1793 the [[Company rule in India|East India Company]] established its rule over eastern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] i.e. Bengal, but it wasn't until 1830 that the colonial navy became known as ''Her Majesty's Indian Navy''. In 1858, East India Company rule gave way to the [[British Raj]] which lasted until [[Indian Independence Act 1947|India became independent]] in 1947. When [[Republic Day (India)|India became a republic]] in 1950, the ''[[Royal Indian Navy]]'' as it had been named since 1934 was renamed to ''Indian Navy''. The 17th-century [[Maratha Empire|Maratha emperor]] [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] is considered as the 'Father of the Indian Navy'.<ref name="Setumadhavarao S.

The primary objective of the navy is to secure the nation's maritime borders, [[India]] also uses its navy to enhance its [[Foreign relations of India|international relations]] through joint exercises, port visits and humanitarian missions, including disaster relief. In recent years, the Indian Navy has undergone rapid [[Indian Navy#Future of the Indian Navy|modernisation]] to replace its ageing equipment currently in service, this is often seen as part of "India's drive" to develop [[blue water navy|blue-water]] capabilities and enhance its position in the [[Indian Ocean]] region.<ref name=wcmp>{{cite book|last1=Preston|first1=Antony|last2=Jordan|first2=John|last3=Dent|first3=Stephen|title=Warships|year=2007|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=London|isbn=1844860418|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dytTKHJ0_mUC&pg=PA164&dq=kolkata+class+destroyer#v=onepage&q=india%20strong%20economic%20growth&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Dr. David|date=Winter 2007–2008|journal=Journal of Military and Strategic Studies|volume=10|issue=2|title=India's drive for a 'blue water' navy|url=http://www.jmss.org/2008/winter/articles/scott.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528002213/http://www.jmss.org/2008/winter/articles/scott.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>

As of 2015, the Indian Navy has a strength of 58,350 personnel and a large operational fleet consisting of two [[aircraft carrier]]s, one [[amphibious transport dock]], 9 [[Landing Ship, Tank|landing ship tanks]], 10 [[destroyer]]s, 14 [[frigate]]s, one [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|nuclear-powered attack submarine]], 14 conventionally-powered attack [[submarine]]s, 24 [[corvette]]s, 6 [[mine countermeasure vessel]]s, 25 [[Patrol boat|patrol vessels]], 4 [[Replenishment oiler|fleet tankers]] and various other [[Auxiliary ship|auxiliary vessels]].

The earliest known reference to an organisation devoted to ships in ancient India is to the [[Mauryan Empire]] from the fourth century BCE. Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]]'s Prime Minister [[Kautilya]]'s [[Arthashastra]] devotes a full chapter on the state department of waterways under ''navadhyaksha'' ([[Sanskrit]] for [[Management|Superintendent]] of ships) {{Ref|Kautilya}}. The term, ''nava dvipantaragamanam'' (Sanskrit for sailing to other lands by ships, i.e. Exploration) appears in this book in addition to appearing in the Sanskrit text, ''Baudhayana Dharmasastra'' as the interpretation of the term, ''Samudrasamyanam''.

Sea lanes between India and neighbouring lands were the usual form of trade for many centuries, and are responsible for the widespread influence of Indian Culture on other societies. Powerful navies included those of the [[Chola dynasty]], [[Maurya Empire]], [[Satavahana]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Pala Empire|Pala]], [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]], [[Vijayanagara Empire]], [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Maratha Empire]] empires.<ref>[http://indiannavy.nic.in/history.htm Indian Naval-Early History].

===1612 origins to independence===
{{main|Royal Indian Navy}}
{{Indian Navy}}
[[File:HMIS Bombay (305827).jpg|thumb|left|[[HMIS Bombay (J249)|HMIS ''Bombay'']] of [[Royal Indian Navy]] in Sydney Harbour during [[World War II]]]]
In 1612, the [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[East India Company]] established the ''East India Company's Marine'' to protect its merchant shipping off the [[Gulf of Cambay]] and up the [[Narmada]] and [[Tapti]] rivers. Its first fighting ships in India were acquired on 5 September 1612. This force evolved into ''Her Majesty's Indian Navy'' in 1830, while parts of India was under [[Company rule in India|British rule]]. The force at this time had British officers and Indian sailors. The Navy saw action in the [[First Opium War]] of 1840 and in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1852. During [[World War I]], the force then known as the ''Royal Indian Marine'' undertook mine sweeping, as well as supply and support operations for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

Sub Lieutenant D. N. Mukherji was the first Indian to be granted a commission as an engineer officer in 1928. In 1934, the navy was renamed as the ''Royal Indian Navy'' (RIN).

The onset of [[World War II]] led to an expansion in numbers of vessels and personnel. The navy was actively involved in operations during the war around the world. Its [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] {{ship|HMIS|Sutlej|U95|6}} and {{HMIS|Jumna|U21|6}} played a key role in [[Operation Husky]], the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080124112038/http://www.wewerethere.mod.uk/wewerethere_old/inmed.html The Second World War in the Mediterranean, North Africa and Italy]. wewerethere.mod.uk</ref> It was heavily involved in operations around the Indian Ocean, including convoy escorts, mine-sweeping, supply, as well as supporting amphibious assaults. At the end of the war, the navy underwent rapid, large-scale demobilization of vessels and personnel. In 1946, Indian sailors started the [[Royal Indian Navy mutiny]], a rebellion influenced by activities of [[Indian National Army]] and post-WWII political unrest in India on board ships and on shore establishments to protest discrimination against Indian officers and sailors by the British and the putting on trial of ex-Indian National Army soldiers and officers. A total of 78 ships, 20 shore establishments and 20,000 sailors were involved in the rebellion, which spread all over India. This rebellion failed as the rebels did not receive support from the political leaders. After the [[independence of India]] on 15 August 1947 and the ensuing [[partition of India|partition]], the RIN's depleted fleet of ships and remaining personnel were divided between the newly independent [[Union of India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan]].

When India became a republic on 26 January 1950, the ''Royal'' prefix was dropped and the name ''Indian Navy'' was officially adopted. The prefix on her ships was changed to ''Indian Naval Ship'' (INS).

===Independence to the end of the 20th century===
{{Main|1961 Indian annexation of Goa|Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts}}

During the early years following independence, the navy still had many British officers who continued to serve with the Indian Navy. Vice Admiral [[Ram Dass Katari]] was the first Indian to assume office as the Chief of Staff of the Indian Navy on 22 April 1958. The first engagement in action of the Indian Navy was against the [[Portuguese Navy]] during the [[liberation of Goa]] in 1961. ''Operation Vijay'' followed years of escalating tension due to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] refusal to relinquish its [[Portuguese India|colonies]] in India. On 21 November 1961, Portuguese troops fired on the passenger liner ''[[Sabarmati]]'' near [[Anjadip Island]], killing one person and injuring another. During Operation Vijay, the Indian Navy supported troop landings and provided fire support. {{ship|INS|Delhi|1948}} sank one Portuguese patrol boat, while frigates INS ''Betwa'' (1960) and INS ''Beas'' (1960) destroyed the Portuguese frigate [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'']].<ref>[http://www.indiannavy.nic.in/goa.htm Goa Operation].

Indian Naval activity in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] largely involved coastal patrols. During the war, the Pakistani Navy [[Operation Dwarka|attacked the Indian coastal city of Dwarka]], although there were no military resources in the area. While this attack was insignificant,<ref>''India's Quest for Security: defence policies, 1947–1965'' Lorne John Kavic, 1967, [[University of California Press]], p. 190</ref> India deployed naval resources to patrol the coast and deter further bombardment. Following these wars in the 1960s, India resolved to strengthen the profile and capabilities of its Armed Forces.

It played a crucial role in enforcing the naval blockade on [[East Pakistan]] and ensuring India's victory during the war.]]

The dramatic change in the Indian Navy's capabilities and stance was emphatically demonstrated during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Under the command of Admiral [[Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda]], the navy successfully enforced a [[naval blockade]] of [[West Pakistan|West]] and [[East Pakistan]].<ref name=link1/>

===Organization===
[[File:Indian Navy Dress No. 9 and 10.jpg|thumb|Some of the uniforms of Indian Navy]]

The Commander of the Navy is the [[Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy|Chief of Naval Staff]] (CNS), who holds the rank of [[Admiral]]. While the provision for the rank of [[Admiral of the Fleet]] exists, it is primarily intended for major wartime use and honour. No officer of the Indian Navy has yet been conferred this rank. The CNS is assisted in his role as commander of the Navy by the Vice Chief of Naval Staff (VCNS), a vice-admiral; the CNS also heads the Integrated Headquarters (IHQ) of the Ministry of Defence (Navy), based in New Delhi. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (DCNS), a vice-admiral, is the assistant head of IHQ, and is a Principal Staff Officer, along with the Chief of Personnel (COP) and the Chief of Materiel (COM), both of whom are also vice-admirals. The Director General Medical Services (Navy) is a Surgeon Vice-Admiral.<ref name=inhelm>{{cite web|title=Flag Officers - At the Helm|url=http://indiannavy.nic.in/about-indian-navy/flag-officers-helm|publisher=Indian Navy|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref>

The Indian Navy operates three [[Command (military formation)|Commands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiannavy.nic.in/content/commands/|title=The Commands|publisher=}}</ref> Each Command is headed by a [[Flag Officer|Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] of the rank of [[Vice Admiral]]. The Eastern and Western Commands each have a Fleet commanded by a rear admiral, and each also have a Commodore commanding submarines. The Southern Naval Command is home to the Flag Officer Sea Training.

Additionally, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Command]] headquartered at [[Port Blair]] is a unified tri-services command under the Commander in Chief Andaman and Nicobar (CINCAN) who reports to the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC) who is provided staff support by the Chief of Integrated Staff to the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CISC) in New Delhi. The [[Andaman and Nicobar Command]], a unified Indian Navy, [[Indian Army]] [[Indian Air Force]] and [[Coast Guard]] Command was set up in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in 2001.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20020211025804/http://indiareacts.com/archivespecialreports/nat2.asp?recno=21&ctg= Commanding the ocean].

India has a number of foreign made [[cruise missile]] systems, including the [[Klub]] [[SS-N-27]]. It also has its own [[Nirbhay]] cruise missile systems under development. Another successful programme has been the adaptation of the Yakhont anti-ship missile system into the [[BrahMos]] by the NPO and the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). The [[BrahMos]] has been tailored to Indian needs and uses a large proportion of Indian-designed components and technology, including its fire control systems, transporter erector launchers, and its onboard navigational attack systems. The successful test of Brahmos from [[INS Rajput (D51)]] provides Indian Navy with precision land attack capability.<ref>[http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=36060 Brahmos naval version tested successfully].

===Electronic warfare and systems management===

''Sangraha'' is a joint [[electronic warfare]] programme of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO) and the Indian Navy. The system comprises a family of electronic warfare suites, such as Ajanta and Ellora, for use on different naval platforms capable of intercepting, detecting, and classifying pulsed, [[carrier wave]], [[pulse repetition frequency]] agile, frequency agile and [[chirp]] [[radar]]s. The systems employ a modular approach facilitating deployment on various platforms like helicopters, vehicles, and small ships. Certain platforms, apart from [[electronic support measures|ESM]] (electronic support measures), have [[electronic countermeasures|ECM]] (electronic countermeasure) capabilities. Advanced technologies like multiple-beam phased array jammers are employed in the system for simultaneous handling of multiple threats.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061108101548/http://www.drdo.com/labs/ecs/dlrl/areas.shtml Sangraha electronic warfare system]. Defence Electronics Research Lboratory</ref>

The Indian Navy also relies on information technology to face the challenges of the 21st century. The Indian Navy is implementing a new strategy to move from a platform centric force to a network-centric force by linking all shore-based installations and ships via high-speed data networks and satellites.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/12/06/stories/2004120602511200.htm The Hindu : National : Navy building high-speed data network].

===Information technology cadre===
With increasing cyber terrorism and attacks on its networks, the navy has created a separate cell for communications, space and network centric operations (CS&NCO) under an officer of the rank of [[Rear Admiral]]. The cell would operate and maintain the naval network and will respond to cyber attacks from hostile hackers. It will be manned by a special information technology cadre of the Indian Navy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/careers/job-trends/Indian-Navy-to-create-cyber-cadre/articleshow/14864034.cms |title=Indian Navy to create cyber cadre |date=13 July 2012 |work=The Times of India |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120713124535/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/careers/job-trends/Indian-Navy-to-create-cyber-cadre/articleshow/14864034.cms |archivedate=13 July 2012 }}</ref>

===Naval satellite===
India's first exclusive defence satellite [[GSAT-7]] was successfully launched by European space consortium Arianespace's Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou spaceport in [[French Guiana]] in August, 2013, giving a major push to the country's maritime security. The Navy is the user of the multi-band home-built communication spacecraft, which has been operational since September 2013. GSAT-7 was designed and developed by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) and is expected to operate for seven years in its orbital slot at 74 degrees east, providing [[UHF]], [[S-band]], [[C-band]] and [[Ku-band]] relay capacity. Its Ku-band capacity is expected to provide high-density data transmission facility, both for voice and video. This satellite has been provided with additional power to communicate with smaller and mobile (not necessarily land-based) terminals. This dedicated satellite is expected to provide the Indian navy with an approximately 3,500- to 4,000-kilometer footprint over the Indian Ocean region, and over both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal region and enable real-time networking of all its operational assets in the water (and land). It also will help the navy to operate in a network-centric atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lele|first=Ajey|title=GSAT-7: India’s Strategic Satellite|url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/opinion/37142gsat-7-india%E2%80%99s-strategic-satellite|accessdate=2 October 2013}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>

By the end of the 14th Plan (2019), the Indian Navy expects to have over 150 ships and close to 500 aircraft and helicopters. In addition to the existing mission of securing both sea flanks in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian sea, the navy would be able to respond to emergency situations far away from the main land. Marine assault capabilities will be beefed-up by setting up a new amphibious warfare facility at [[Kakinada]], Andhra Pradesh.<ref>[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/brand-new-indian-navy-with-long-legs-by-2027-verma/208124-3.html Brand new Indian Navy with long legs by 2027: Admiral Verma] IBNLive.in.com. 3 December 2011.</ref>

The Indian Navy has initiated Phase II expansion of [[INS Kadamba]], the third largest naval base, near [[Karwar]]. Phase II will involve expansion of the berthing facilities to accommodate 40 more front-line warships, including the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, raise manpower to 300 officers and around 2,500 sailors, and build a naval air station with a 6,000-foot runway. This is to be followed by Phase IIA and IIB, at the end of which INS Kadamba will be able to base 50 front-line warships. The Indian Navy is also in the process of constructing an [[Extremely low frequency]] communication facility at [[INS Kattabomman]] to [[Communication with submarines|communicate]] with its [[Arihant-class submarine|Arihant class]] and [[Akula-class submarine|Akula class]] submarines. This facility is expected to be operational by 2015.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/article/11147/india-makes-headway-with-elf-site-construction India makes headway with ELF site construction], janes.com {{wayback|url=http://www.janes.com/article/11147/india-makes-headway-with-elf-site-construction |date=20140223135343 |df=y }}</ref>

The carriers of the [[Vikrant-class aircraft carrier|''Vikrant''-class]] are the first indigenous aircraft carriers to be built in India. The first, [[INS Vikrant (2013)|INS Vikrant'']], was launched in 2013 by [[Cochin Shipyard]] and is expected to undergo extensive sea trials in 2016 with commissioning planned for 2018. ''Vikrant'' displaces 40,000 tonnes and will be capable of operating up to 40 aircraft, including 30 [[HAL Tejas]] and [[MiG-29K]] fighters.<ref>{{cite news|title=India to launch aircraft carrier INS Vikrant today|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-to-launch-aircraft-carrier-INS-Vikrant-today/articleshow/21771520.cms|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=12 August 2013}}</ref> The second ship of the ''Vikrant''-class is [[INS Vishal- Vikrant class aircraft carrier|INS ''Vishal'']] (formerly known as ''Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-II'').

As of November 2011, the ''Defence Acquisition Council'' launched the [[Indian Navy Multi-Role Support Vessel programme]]. The Indian Navy has subsequently sent out an international RFP for up to 4 large [[landing helicopter dock]]s. The contenders are expected to tie up with local shipyards for construction of the ships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=202| title=Indian Navy launches Request For Proposal for 4 amphibious vessels (LHD type) |date=23 November 2011|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>

In addition to aircraft carriers and large amphibious assault ships, the Indian Navy is acquiring numerous surface combatants such as; the [[Kolkata-class destroyer|''Kolkata'']] and [[Visakhapatnam-class destroyer|''Visakhapatnam''-class]] destroyers, the [[Project 17A-class frigate]]s and the [[Kamorta-class corvette|''Kamorta''-class corvette]]s. New submarine types include; the conventional [[Kalvari-class submarine|''Kalvari''-class]] and the nuclear [[Arihant-class submarine|''Arihant''-class]].

The Indian navy from 1950 to 2001 used a modified version of the British Naval jack, with the Union flag replaced with the Indian Tricolor in the canton. In 2001, this flag was replaced with a white ensign bearing the Indian Navy crest, as the previous ensign was thought to reflect India's colonial past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/23navy.htm|title=Indian Navy to change its ensign|accessdate=10 April 2015}}</ref> However complaints arose that the new ensign was indistinguishable as the blue of the naval crest easily merged with the sky and the ocean. Hence in 2004, the ensign was changed back to the [[St. George's cross]] design, with the addition of the emblem of India in the intersection of the cross. In 2014, the ensign as well as the naval crest was further modified to include the [[Devanagari]] script: ''सत्यमेव जयते'' ([[Satyameva Jayate]]) which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs' in [[Sanskrit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2716049/Indian-Navy-launch-Satyameva-Jayate-credo-new-logo.html|title=Indian Navy to launch Satyameva Jayate credo with a new logo|accessdate=10 April 2015}}</ref>
