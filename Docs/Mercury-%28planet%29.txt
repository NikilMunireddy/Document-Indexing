'''Mercury''' is the smallest planet in the [[Solar System]] and the one closest to the [[Sun]],{{efn|name=dwarf planet}} with an [[orbital period]] of about 88 [[Earth]] days, which is much faster than any other planet in the Solar System. Seen from Earth, it appears to move around its [[orbit]] in about 116 days. It has no known [[natural satellite]]s. It is named after the [[Roman mythology|Roman deity]] [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the messenger to the gods.

Partly because it has almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury's surface temperature varies diurnally more than any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from {{convert|100|K}} at night to {{convert|700|K}} during the day in some equatorial regions. The poles are constantly below {{convert|180|K}}. Mercury's axis has the smallest [[axial tilt|tilt]] of any of the Solar System's planets (about {{frac|30}} of a degree), and its [[orbital eccentricity]] is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System.{{efn|name=dwarf planet}} At [[aphelion]], Mercury is about 1.5 times as far from the Sun as it is at [[perihelion]]. Mercury's surface is heavily cratered and similar in appearance to the [[Moon]], indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years.

Mercury is [[tidal locking|tidally or gravitationally locked]] with the Sun in a 3:2 resonance,<ref>{{cite book |title=Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and the Outer Solar System |first1=Linda T. |last1=Elkins-Tanton |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4381-0729-5 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJoYlBWbCAYC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bJoYlBWbCAYC&pg=PA51 Extract of page 51]</ref> and rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. As seen relative to the [[fixed stars]], it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.{{efn|name=rotation/revolution}}<ref name=orbit>{{cite web|title=Animated clip of orbit and rotation of Mercury|url=http://sciencenetlinks.com/interactives/messenger/or/OrbitRotation.html|publisher=Sciencenetlinks.com}}</ref>  As seen from the Sun, in a [[frame of reference]] that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two years.

Because Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit (as does [[Venus]]), it can appear in Earth's sky in the morning or the evening, but not in the middle of the night. Also, like Venus and the Moon, it displays a complete range of [[Planetary phase|phases]] as it moves around its orbit relative to Earth. Although Mercury can appear as a bright object when viewed from Earth, its proximity to the Sun makes it more difficult to see than Venus. Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: ''{{nowrap|[[Mariner 10]]}}'' flew by in the 1970s; and ''[[MESSENGER]]'', launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years, before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on April 30, 2015.<ref>http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=284</ref><ref name=EclipseReboost>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/10100759-from-mercury-orbit-messenger.html |title=From Mercury orbit, MESSENGER watches a lunar eclipse|publisher= Planetary Society|date=October 10, 2014|accessdate=January 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Pressurant2015>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2014/12/innovative-use-of-pressurant-extends-messengers-mercury-mission|title=Innovative use of pressurant extends MESSENGER's Mercury mission|publisher=Astronomy.com|date=December 29, 2014|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

Mercury's density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the [[planetary core|core]], Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.<ref>{{cite journal

Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System, and several theories have been proposed to explain this. The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury originally had a metal–silicate ratio similar to common [[chondrite]] meteorites, thought to be typical of the Solar System's rocky matter, and a mass approximately 2.25 times its current mass.<ref name="Benz" /> Early in the Solar System's history, Mercury may have been struck by a [[planetesimal]] of approximately 1/6 that mass and several thousand kilometers across.<ref name="Benz" /> The impact would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle, leaving the core behind as a relatively major component.<ref name="Benz" /> A similar process, known as the [[giant impact hypothesis]], has been proposed to explain the formation of the [[Moon]].<ref name="Benz" />

Alternatively, Mercury may have formed from the [[solar nebula]] before the Sun's energy output had stabilized. It would initially have had twice its present mass, but as the [[protostar|protosun]] contracted, temperatures near Mercury could have been between 2,500 and 3,500&nbsp;K and possibly even as high as 10,000&nbsp;K.<ref name="CameronAGW1">{{cite journal | title = The partial volatilization of Mercury | last=Cameron |first = A.

A third hypothesis proposes that the [[solar nebula]] caused [[drag (physics)|drag]] on the particles from which Mercury was [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]], which meant that lighter particles were lost from the accreting material and not gathered by Mercury.<ref>{{cite journal

Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive [[Lunar mare|mare]]-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Because knowledge of [[geology of Mercury|Mercury's geology]] has been based only on the 1975 [[#Mariner 10|Mariner&nbsp;10]] flyby and [[#Ground-based telescopic research|terrestrial]] observations, it is the least understood of the terrestrial planets.<ref name="nrao">{{cite news

Data from the October 2008 flyby of MESSENGER gave researchers a greater appreciation for the jumbled nature of Mercury's surface. Mercury's surface is more [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] than either [[Mars]]'s or the [[Moon]]'s, both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology, such as maria and plateaus.<ref name="awst169_18_18" />

At the [[antipodes|antipode]] of the Caloris Basin is a large region of unusual, hilly terrain known as the "Weird Terrain". One hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the Caloris impact traveled around Mercury, converging at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away).

Overall, about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury. A notable basin is the 400&nbsp;km wide, multi-ring [[Tolstoj Basin]] that has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500&nbsp;km from its rim and a floor that has been filled by smooth plains materials. [[Beethoven Basin]] has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625&nbsp;km diameter rim.<ref name="Spudis01" /> Like the [[Moon]], the surface of Mercury has likely incurred the effects of [[space weathering]] processes, including [[Solar wind]] and [[micrometeorite]] impacts.<ref>{{cite journal

Smooth plains are widespread flat areas that fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to the lunar maria. Notably, they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin. Unlike lunar maria, the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older inter-crater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics, the localisation and rounded, lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins.<ref name="Spudis01" /> All the smooth plains of Mercury formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.<ref name="Spudis01" /> The floor of the Caloris Basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of impact melt.<ref name="Spudis01" />

One unusual feature of Mercury's surface is the numerous compression folds, or [[rupes]], that crisscross the plains. As Mercury's interior cooled, it may have contracted and its surface began to deform, creating these features. The folds can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating that the folds are more recent.<ref name="Dzurisin1978">{{cite journal

Mercury's magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the [[solar wind]] around the planet, creating a [[magnetosphere]]. The planet's magnetosphere, though small enough to fit within Earth,<ref name="chaikin1" /> is strong enough to trap solar wind [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This contributes to the [[space weathering]] of the planet's surface.<ref name="qq" /> Observations taken by the {{nowrap|Mariner 10}} spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of the planet's nightside.  Bursts of energetic particles in the planet's magnetotail indicate a dynamic quality to the planet's magnetosphere.<ref name="chaikin1" />

During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, MESSENGER discovered that Mercury's magnetic field can be extremely "leaky". The spacecraft encountered magnetic "tornadoes" – twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary magnetic field to interplanetary space – that were up to {{nowrap|800 km}} wide or a third of the radius of the planet.  These twisted magnetic flux tubes, technically known as [[flux transfer event]]s, form open windows in the planet's magnetic shield through which the solar wind may enter and directly impact Mercury's surface.<ref name="NASA060209" />

The process of linking interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields, called [[magnetic reconnection]], is common throughout the cosmos. It occurs in Earth's magnetic field, where it generates magnetic tornadoes as well. The MESSENGER observations show the reconnection rate is ten times higher at Mercury. Mercury's proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by MESSENGER.<ref name="NASA060209">{{cite web

Mercury has the most [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbit of all the planets; its eccentricity is 0.21 with its distance from the Sun ranging from {{convert|46000000|to|70000000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It takes 87.969 Earth days to complete an orbit. The diagram on the right illustrates the effects of the eccentricity, showing Mercury's orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same [[semi-major axis]]. Mercury's higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in each 5-day interval. In the diagram the varying distance of Mercury to the Sun is represented by the size of the planet, which is inversely proportional to Mercury's distance from the Sun. This varying distance to the Sun, combined with a 3:2 [[#Spin–orbit resonance|spin–orbit resonance]] of the planet's rotation around its axis, result in complex variations of the surface temperature.<ref name="strom">{{cite book

Mercury's orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of Earth's orbit (the [[ecliptic]]), as shown in the diagram on the right. As a result, [[Transit of Mercury|transits]] of Mercury across the face of the Sun can only occur when the planet is crossing the plane of the ecliptic at the time it lies between Earth and the Sun. This occurs about every seven years on average.<ref>{{cite web

Mercury's [[axial tilt]] is almost zero,<ref name="Cosmic1" /> with the best measured value as low as 0.027 degrees.<ref name="Margot2007">{{cite journal| last=Margot | first=J.

This means that to an observer at Mercury's poles, the center of the Sun never rises more than 2.1 [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]] above the horizon.<ref name="Margot2007" />

At certain points on Mercury's surface, an observer would be able to see the Sun rise about halfway, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same [[Extraterrestrial skies#Mercury|Mercurian day]]. This is because approximately four Earth days before [[perihelion]], Mercury's angular [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] equals its angular [[rotational velocity]] so that the Sun's [[improper motion|apparent motion]] ceases; closer to perihelion, Mercury's angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational velocity. Thus, to a hypothetical observer on Mercury, the Sun appears to move in a [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde]] direction. Four Earth days after perihelion, the Sun's normal apparent motion resumes.<ref name="strom" />

For the same reason, there are two points on Mercury's equator, 180 degrees apart in [[longitude]], at either of which, around perihelion in alternate Mercurian years (once a Mercurian day), the Sun passes overhead, then reverses its apparent motion and passes overhead again, then reverses a second time and passes overhead a third time, taking a total of about 16 Earth-days for this entire process. In the other alternate Mercurian years, the same thing happens at the other of these two points. The amplitude of the retrograde motion is small, so the overall effect is that, for two or three weeks, the Sun is almost stationary overhead, and is at its most brilliant because Mercury is at perihelion, its closest to the Sun. This prolonged exposure to the Sun at its brightest makes these two points the hottest places on Mercury. Conversely, there are two other points on the equator, 90 degrees of longitude apart from the first ones, where the Sun passes overhead only when the planet is at aphelion in alternate years, when the apparent motion of the Sun in Mercury's sky is relatively rapid. These points, which are the ones on the equator where the apparent retrograde motion of the Sun happens when it is crossing the horizon as described in the preceding paragraph, receive much less solar heat than the first ones described above.

Mercury attains inferior conjunction (nearest approach to Earth) every 116 Earth days on average,<ref name="fact" /> but this interval can range from 105 days to 129 days due to the planet's eccentric orbit. Mercury can come as near as {{Convert|82.2|Gm|AU e6mi|abbr = off}} to Earth, and that is slowly declining: The next approach to within {{Convert|82.1|Gm|e6mi|abbr = in}} is in 2679, and to within {{Convert|82.0|Gm|e6mi|abbr = in}} in 4487, but it will not be closer to Earth than {{Convert|80|Gm|e6mi|abbr = in}} until AD 28,622.<ref>Mercury Closest Approaches to Earth generated with: <br> 1.

This large range arises from the planet's high orbital eccentricity.<ref name="strom" />

=== Longitude convention ===
The longitude convention for Mercury puts the zero of longitude at one of the two hottest points on the surface, as described above. However, when this area was first visited, by {{nowrap|Mariner 10}}, this zero meridian was in darkness, so it was impossible to select a feature on the surface to define the exact position of the meridian. Therefore, a small crater further west was chosen, called [[Hun Kal (crater)|Hun Kal]], which provides the exact reference point for measuring longitude. The center of Hun Kal defines the 20°&nbsp;West meridian.  A 1970 [[International Astronomical Union]] resolution suggests that longitudes be measured positively in the westerly direction on Mercury.<ref name="usgs">{{cite web|url=http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/WGCCRE/constants/iau2000_table1.html|accessdate=22 October 2009|title=USGS Astrogeology: Rotation and pole position for the Sun and planets (IAU WGCCRE) }}</ref> The two hottest places on the equator are therefore at longitudes 0°W and 180°W, and the coolest points on the equator are at longitudes 90°W and 270°W.

=== Spin–orbit resonance ===
[[File:Mercury's orbital resonance.svg|thumb|After one orbit, Mercury has rotated 1.5 times, so after two complete orbits the same hemisphere is again illuminated.]]

For many years it was thought that Mercury was synchronously [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] with the Sun, [[rotation|rotating]] once for each orbit and always keeping the same face directed towards the Sun, in the same way that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. [[Radar]] observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun; the eccentricity of Mercury's orbit makes this resonance stable—at perihelion, when the solar tide is strongest, the Sun is nearly still in Mercury's sky.<ref>{{cite journal

The original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously locked was that, whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, it was always nearly at the same point in its 3:2 resonance, hence showing the same face. This is because, coincidentally, Mercury's rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to Earth. Due to Mercury's 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, a [[solar day]] (the length between two [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] [[Astronomical transit|transits]] of the Sun) lasts about 176 Earth days.<ref name="strom" /> A [[sidereal day]] (the period of rotation) lasts about 58.7 Earth days.<ref name="strom" />

Simulations indicate that the [[orbital eccentricity]] of Mercury varies [[chaos theory|chaotically]] from nearly zero (circular) to more than 0.45 over millions of years due to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the other planets.<ref name="strom" /><ref name="Correia2009">{{cite journal

=== Advance of perihelion ===
{{Main|Perihelion precession of Mercury}}
In 1859, the French mathematician and astronomer [[Urbain Le Verrier]] reported that the slow [[precession]] of Mercury's orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by [[Newtonian mechanics]] and perturbations by the known planets. He suggested, among possible explanations, that another planet (or perhaps instead a series of smaller 'corpuscules') might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun than that of Mercury, to account for this perturbation.<ref>U. Le Verrier (1859), (in French), [https://archive.org/stream/comptesrendusheb49acad#page/378/mode/2up "Lettre de M. Le Verrier à M. Faye sur la théorie de Mercure et sur le mouvement du périhélie de cette planète"], Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences (Paris), vol. 49 (1859), pp. 379–383. (At p. 383 in the same volume Le Verrier's report is followed by another, from Faye, enthusiastically recommending to astronomers to search for a previously undetected intra-mercurial object.)</ref> (Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun.) The success of the search for [[Neptune]] based on its perturbations of the orbit of [[Uranus]] led astronomers to place faith in this possible explanation, and the hypothetical planet was named [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]], but no such planet was ever found.<ref>{{cite book

Mercury can, like several other planets and the brightest stars, be seen during a total [[solar eclipse]].<ref name="eclipse">{{cite web|date=January 22, 2003|title=Total Solar Eclipse of 2006 March 29|publisher=Department of Physics at Fizik Bolumu in Turkey|first=Tunç | last=Tezel |url=http://www.physics.metu.edu.tr/~aat/TSE2006/TSE2006.html|accessdate=2008-05-24 }}</ref>

Like the Moon and Venus, Mercury exhibits [[Lunar phase|phases]] as seen from Earth. It is "new" at [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|inferior conjunction]] and "full" at [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|superior conjunction]].

Nonetheless, the brightest (full phase) appearance of Mercury is an essentially impossible time for practical observation, because of the extreme proximity of the Sun.  Mercury is best observed at the first and last quarter, although they are phases of lesser brightness.  The first and last quarter phases occur at greatest [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] east and west, respectively.  At both of these times Mercury's separation from the Sun ranges anywhere from 17.9° at [[perihelion]] to 27.8° at [[aphelion]].<ref name="elongation">{{cite web|title=Mercury Chaser's Calculator|publisher=Fourmilab Switzerland|first=John | last=Walker|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/images/3planets/elongation.html|accessdate=2008-05-29}} (look at 1964 and 2013)</ref><ref name="MercHorizons">{{cite web|title=Mercury Elongation and Distance|url=http://home.surewest.net/kheider/astro/Mercury.txt|accessdate=2008-05-30}} – Numbers generated using the Solar System Dynamics Group, [http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi?find_body=1&body_group=mb&sstr=1 Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System]</ref> At greatest elongation west, Mercury rises at its earliest before the Sun, and at greatest elongation east, it sets at its latest after the Sun.<ref name="RASC2007">{{cite book |title=Observer's Handbook 2007 |editor-first=Patrick | editor-last=Kelly |publisher=[[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]]|date=2007|isbn=0-9738109-3-9 }}</ref>

At tropical and subtropical latitudes, Mercury is more easily seen than at higher latitudes. In low latitudes and at the right times of year, the [[ecliptic]] intersects the horizon at a steep angle. When Mercury is vertically above the Sun in the sky and is at maximum elongation from the Sun (28 degrees), and when the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon, so the sky is just completely dark,{{efn|See [[Twilight#Astronomical twilight]]}} Mercury is 10 degrees above the horizon. This is the greatest angle of elevation at which Mercury can be seen in a completely dark sky.
[[File:PIA19422-Mercury-CarnegieRupes-MDIS-MLA-20150416.jpg|thumb|200px|right|False-color image of Carnegie Rupes, a tectonic landform—high terrain (red); low (blue).]]
At temperate latitudes, Mercury is more often easily visible from Earth's [[Southern Hemisphere]] than from its [[Northern Hemisphere]]. This is because Mercury's maximum possible elongations west of the Sun always occur when it is early autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas its maximum possible eastern elongations happen during late winter in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name="RASC2007" /> In both of these cases, the angle Mercury strikes with the [[ecliptic]] is maximized, allowing it to rise several hours before the Sun in the former instance and not set until several hours after sundown in the latter in countries located at southern temperate zone latitudes, such as Argentina and South Africa.<ref name="RASC2007" />

An alternate method for viewing Mercury involves observing the planet during daylight hours when conditions are clear, ideally when it is at its point of greatest elongation. This allows the planet to be found easily, even when using telescopes with {{Convert|8|cm|abbr = on}} apertures. Care must be taken to ensure the instrument isn't pointed directly towards the Sun because of the risk for eye damage. This method bypasses the limitation of twilight observing when the ecliptic is located at a low elevation (e.g. on autumn evenings).

Ground-based telescope observations of Mercury reveal only an illuminated partial disk with limited detail. The first of two [[spacecraft]] to visit the planet was {{nowrap|Mariner 10}}, which mapped about 45% of its surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft, which after three Mercury flybys between 2008 and 2009, attained orbit around Mercury on March 17, 2011,<ref name="insertion">{{cite web

Because the shift of 0.15 revolutions in a year makes up a seven-year cycle (0.15 × 7 ≈ 1.0), in the seventh year Mercury follows almost exactly (earlier by 7 days) the sequence of phenomena it showed seven years before.<ref name="elongation" />

The first [[Telescope|telescopic]] observations of Mercury were made by [[Galileo]] in the early 17th century. Although he observed [[planetary phase|phases]] when he looked at Venus, his telescope was not powerful enough to see the phases of Mercury. In 1631, [[Pierre Gassendi]] made the first telescopic observations of the [[Astronomical transit|transit]] of a planet across the Sun when he saw a transit of Mercury predicted by [[Johannes Kepler]]. In 1639, [[Giovanni Battista Zupi|Giovanni Zupi]] used a telescope to discover that the planet had [[orbit]]al phases similar to Venus and the Moon. The observation demonstrated conclusively that Mercury orbited around the Sun.<ref name="strom" />

A rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of another ([[occultation]]), as seen from Earth. Mercury and Venus occult each other every few centuries, and the event of May 28, 1737 is the only one historically observed, having been seen by [[John Bevis]] at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sinnott |first1=R.

The difficulties inherent in observing Mercury mean that it has been far less studied than the other planets. In 1800, [[Johann Schröter]] made observations of surface features, claiming to have observed {{Convert|20|km|4 = -high|adj = mid}} mountains.

Reaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because it orbits so much closer to the Sun than Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel over {{Convert|91|e6km|e6mi|abbr = off}} into the Sun's [[gravity|gravitational]] [[potential well]]. Mercury has an [[orbital speed]] of {{Convert|48|km/s|abbr = on}}, whereas Earth's orbital speed is {{Convert|30|km/s|abbr = on}}. Therefore, the spacecraft must make a large change in [[velocity]] ([[delta-v]]) to enter a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that passes near Mercury, as compared to the delta-v required for other planetary missions.<ref name="DunneCh4">{{cite book|title=The Voyage of Mariner&nbsp;10 – Mission to Venus and Mercury|author=Dunne, J.

The [[potential energy]] liberated by moving down the Sun's [[potential well]] becomes [[kinetic energy]]; requiring another large delta-v change to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury.

The data revealed that the planet's magnetic field is much like Earth's, which deflects the [[solar wind]] around the planet. The origin of Mercury's magnetic field is still the subject of several competing theories.<ref name="Ness1">{{cite journal | last = Ness| first = Norman F. | date = 1978| title=Mercury – Magnetic field and interior| journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 527–553| bibcode = 1978SSRv...21..527N|doi=10.1007/BF00240907 }}</ref>

A second NASA mission to Mercury, named ''MESSENGER'' (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging), was launched on 3 August 2004. It made a fly-by of Earth in August 2005, and of Venus in October 2006 and June 2007 to place it onto the correct trajectory to reach an orbit around Mercury.<ref>{{cite web|date=2005|url = http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=18956| title = MESSENGER Engine Burn Puts Spacecraft on Track for Venus|publisher = SpaceRef.com | accessdate = 2006-03-02 }}</ref> A first fly-by of Mercury occurred on January 14, 2008, a second on October 6, 2008,<ref name="MessCountdown">{{cite web|url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=115|title=Countdown to MESSENGER's Closest Approach with Mercury|date=January 14, 2008 | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory |accessdate=2008-05-30 }}</ref> and a third on September 29, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title=MESSENGER Gains Critical Gravity Assist for Mercury Orbital Observations

<!--[[File:mercclose3.jpg|thumb|Mercury as imaged by the ''MESSENGER'' probe]]-->

The mission was designed to clear up six key issues: Mercury's high density, its geological history, the nature of its [[magnetic field]], the structure of its core, whether it has ice at its poles, and where its tenuous atmosphere comes from. To this end, the probe carried imaging devices that gathered much-higher-resolution images of much more of Mercury than {{nowrap|Mariner 10}}, assorted [[spectrometer]]s to determine abundances of elements in the crust, and [[magnetometer]]s and devices to measure velocities of charged particles.  Measurements of changes in the probe's orbital velocity were expected to be used to infer details of the planet's interior structure.<ref name="MSGRgrayzeck" /> MESSENGER's final maneuver was on April 24, 2015, and it crashed into Mercury's surface on April 30, 2015.<ref name="results 2015">{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |url=http://www.space.com/28948-messenger-mercury-probe-final-days.html |title=NASA Mercury Probe Trying to Survive for Another Month |work=Space.com |date=March 29, 2015 |accessdate=April 4, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="NYT-20150427">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=NASA's Messenger Mission Is Set to Crash Into Mercury |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/science/nasas-messenger-mission-is-set-to-crash-into-mercury.html |date=April 27, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=April 27, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="NYT-20150430">{{cite news |last=Corum |first=Jonathan |title=Messenger's Collision Course With Mercury |url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/30/science/space/messenger-collides-with-mercury.html |date=April 30, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=April 30, 2015 }}</ref> The spacecraft's impact with Mercury occurred near 3:26 PM EDT on April 30, 2015, leaving a crater estimated to be {{convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=1602 | title=Details of MESSENGER's Impact Location | work=MESSENGER Featured Images | date=April 29, 2015 | accessdate=April 29, 2015 | publisher=JHU – APL }}</ref>

{{efn
| name = dwarf planet
| [[Pluto]] was considered a [[planet]] from its discovery in 1930 to 2006, but after that it has been reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]]. Pluto's orbital eccentricity is greater than Mercury's. Pluto is also smaller than Mercury, but was thought to be larger until 1976.
}}

{{efn
| name = Cuneiform MUL
| Some sources precede the cuneiform transcription with "MUL". "MUL" is a cuneiform sign that was used in the Sumerian language to designate a star or planet, but it is not considered part of the actual name. The "4" is a reference number in the Sumero-Akkadian transliteration system to designate which of several syllables a certain cuneiform sign is most likely designating.
}}

{{efn
| name = rotation/revolution
| In astronomy, the words "rotation" and "revolution" have different meanings. "Rotation" is the turning of a body about an axis that passes through the body, as in "Earth rotates once a day." "Revolution" is motion around a centre that is external to the body, usually in orbit, as in "Earth takes a year for each revolution around the Sun." The verbs "rotate" and "revolve" mean doing rotation and revolution, respectively.
