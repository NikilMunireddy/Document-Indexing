==Controversies==

===Sports===
Cricket was among the five début sports in the Games. India, despite its historical record, decided not to send [[India national cricket team|its cricket team]] to the Games. According to the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]], the decision was due to other international commitments.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mohapatra|first=Bikash|title=Indian cricket team to skip Asian Games|url=http://cricket.rediff.com/report/2010/jun/01/indian-cricket-team-to-skip-asian-games.htm|accessdate=July 16, 2010|newspaper=Rediff Sports|date=June 1, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100715222858/http://cricket.rediff.com/report/2010/jun/01/indian-cricket-team-to-skip-asian-games.htm| archivedate= 15 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, its main rivals, [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], confirmed their participation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Welmilla|first=Hishan|title=From Delhi To Guangzhou|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/10/24/from-delhi-to-guangzhou/|accessdate=October 24, 2010|newspaper=The Sunday Leader|date=October 24, 2010}}</ref>

===Languages===
In July 2010, the citizens of Guangzhou opposed the proposal suggested by the city committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) to use [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] more in television news programmes, rather than Guangzhou's main language, [[Cantonese]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Shasha|first=Deng|title=Proposal for news in Mandarin angers Guangzhou citizens|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/09/c_13392543.htm|accessdate=July 10, 2010|newspaper=Xinhuanet|date=July 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100716003233/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/09/c_13392543.htm| archivedate= 16 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The debates [[Controversy over the use of Cantonese by Guangzhou Television|eventually led to a series of public protests]].

===Environment===
Like the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Guangzhou also attempted to raise the [[Air Quality Index|air quality]] of the city.

Between 2005 and 2008 about 150 Guolang villagers survived by growing tomatoes, beans and cabbages while fighting the government for fairer compensation after their homes were flattened for Asian games infrastructure. The [[Panyu District|Panyu]] government set aside a date to listen to petitioners complaint on October 18, 2010.<ref>SCMP. Games euphoria fails to impress villagers, Nov 16, 2010.</ref>

Prior to the opening of the games, [[Conghua]] reported 429 cases of [[Norovirus]] outbreak. The government officials stressed that the people recovered before November 12.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jingya|first=Zhang|title=Norovirus infects 429 people in Guangzhou|url=http://english.cntv.cn/20101217/106924.shtml|accessdate=December 19, 2010|newspaper=CNTV|date=December 17, 2010}}</ref>
