The '''Honda CBR600RR''' is a {{convert|599|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} [[sport bike|sport motorcycle]] that was introduced by [[Honda]] in 2003 as a [[race replica]] version of Honda's [[Honda CBR600F|CBR600F]] series. It won every [[Supersport World Championship]] title from 2002 to [[2008 Supersport World Championship season|2008]], and again in [[2010 Supersport World Championship season|2010]] and [[2014 Supersport World Championship season|2014]].

== History ==

=== Racing roots ===
The CBR600RR was developed from and inspired by the [[Honda RC211V]] [[MotoGP]] bike. The similar physical appearance of the CBR600RR and RC211V was intentional. Underneath the bike were MotoGP technologies that were made available for the first time on a production motorcycle, such as the [[Unit Pro-Link]] rear suspension and Dual Stage Fuel Injection (PGM-DSFI). Both were taken directly from Honda's MotoGP bike. The RR, or race replica, suffix was added to emphasize racing characteristics such as an advanced braced swingarm, center-up exhaust system, and more aggressive riding position. 

=== 2003-2004 revision ===
The 2003 model carried over to 2004 technically unchanged, with only the addition of an oxygen sensor and new color schemes.

=== 2005-2006 revision ===
{{double image|right|2006HondaCBR600RR-002.jpg|180|2006HondaCBR600RR-swingarm.jpg|180|2006 CBR600RR|[[Unit Pro-Link]] swingarm}}

In 2005, the CBR600RR received a major revision with new bodywork, fully adjustable inverted front forks, race-inspired disc brakes with radial-mounted four-piston calipers, and an entirely new aluminum frame, swingarm and rear shock. The midrange power was also increased. These changes along with additional refinements to the engine and exhaust system all came together to bring CBR600RR's [[Motorcycle testing and measurement#Wet weight|wet weight]] down by {{Convert|22|lb|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, and [[Motorcycle testing and measurement#Dry weight|dry weight]] by {{convert|9|lb|abbr=on|disp=flip}}<ref name=Duke2005>{{Citation |url= http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/9/731/Motorcycle-Article/2005-Supersport-Shootout-Street-Test.aspx |magazine= MotorcycleUSA |date= 21 March 2005 |title= 2005 Supersport Shootout Street Test |first=Kevin |last= Duke }}</ref><ref name=2004PressRelease/><ref name=2005PressRelease/> Except for new color schemes, the 2006 model was unchanged from the 2005 model.

=== 2007-2008 redesign ===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=2007HondaCBR600RR-003.jpg|image2=2007HondaCBR600RR-004.jpg|width=220|caption2=2007 CBR600RR at the [[International Motorcycle Show]]}}
On September 6, 2006, Honda revealed an all new CBR600RR for the 2007 model year.<ref name="2007preview">[http://powersports.honda.com/preview 2007 Model Preview] from official Honda Motorcycles site</ref>
{{cquote|''The CBR600's most radical redesign since the introduction of the RR in 2003 is highlighted by a whole new engine, frame, and bodywork that results in a smaller, lighter, more-powerful CBR600RR with a class-leading power-to-weight ratio and unparalleled performance.''<ref name="2007features">[http://www.hondanews.com/categories/97/releases/3709 2007 Honda CBR600RR Features] press release from HondaNews.com</ref>}}

Weight was the primary focus of the redesign. The result was a {{convert|20|lb|abbr=on|disp=flip}} reduction in dry weight over the 2006 model, from a claimed {{convert|361|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=2005PressRelease/> to {{convert|341|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=2005PressRelease/><ref name=2006PressRelease/> Tested weights without fuel were {{Convert|401|–|402|lb|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref name=CycleWorld2006/><ref name=Motorcyclist2006/>

In redesigning the CBR600RR for lighter weight and increased performance, Honda's engineers started with the engine. The completely new engine was smaller and lighter than its predecessor, the designers having used careful positioning of all internal components to achieve significant reductions in the motor's length, width, and height, as well as reducing weight by {{convert|2|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} compared to the 2006 model's powerplant. Horsepower increased to about {{Convert|105|hp|abbr=on}} measured in independent tests.<ref name= Carrithers2007/><ref name=Canet2009/>

The frame was lighter, slimmer, and more compact than that of the 2006 CBR600RR. The frame was produced using what Honda calls Fine Die-Cast (FDC) technology, which allowed them to build a lighter frame without compromising strength or rigidity. The handling of the new bike was sharpened by its {{convert|22|mm|abbr=on}} shorter wheelbase, as well as by the designer's focus on strict mass centralization. Despite the shorter wheelbase, the 2007 model's swingarm was {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} longer than that of the 2006, made possible by the more compact dimensions of the new bike's engine.

The suspension of the 2007 model was carried over almost unchanged from the 2006 bike, with the same {{convert|41|mm|abbr=on}} inverted fork in front, and Honda's Unit Pro-Link rear suspension configuration damping the rear wheel. The new three-spoke cast aluminum wheels were also lighter than those on the 2006 bike, which further contributed to the enhanced performance of the suspension. The brakes featured dual radial-mount four-piston calipers and twin {{convert|310|mm|abbr=on}} discs at the front, and a single-piston caliper and a {{convert|220|mm|abbr=on}} disc at the rear. Hidden below the steering head was an updated version of the Honda Electronic Steering Damper (HESD) system, which was also available on the [[Honda CBR1000RR|CBR1000RR]].

The smaller, sharper-edged new front upper fairing was dominated by the large central ram-air duct which fed the airbox through an opening in the steering head section of the frame and was separated from the sides of the fairing by a large gap which Honda said was for air management purposes. The tail-section was similarly smaller and sharper-edged, riding atop a heavily restyled under-seat muffler.

The motorcycle carried over with only color scheme changes for the 2008 model year.

==== Combined ABS prototype ====

On June 9, 2008, Honda revealed a CBR600RR prototype that featured an all new braking system branded as Combined ABS which integrated [[combined braking system|combined braking]], [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock braking]], and [[brake-by-wire]] systems.<ref name="CombinedABS">{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/news/2008/2080609Combined-ABS/ |title=Honda Announces World's First Electronically-Controlled "Combined ABS" for Super Sport Bikes |accessdate=2008-06-12 |date=2008-06-09 |work=[[Honda]] |publisher=Honda World News }}</ref> Combined ABS used a computer control unit to ensure the correct balance of front and rear brake use and also controlled when the ABS should engage.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blain|first=Loz|title=Honda announces 'brake by wire' supersport motorcycle|url=http://www.gizmag.com/honda-announces-brake-by-wire-supersport-motorcycle-system-incorporati/9455/|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=Gizmag|date=10 June 2008|quote=Lever inputs at both ends of the bike are input, analyzed by a braking ECU, and then braking force is distributed optimally between the wheels, with the goal of preventing the bike from pitching forward into a 'stoppie' under hard or emergency braking, as this forward roll often unsettles riders and prevents them from applying maximum braking force where required.}}</ref> The system was designed to be as unobtrusive as possible by delaying the engagement of the ABS until the last possible moment.

[[File:2009 Honda CBR600RR ABS Sensor on Front Wheel.jpg|thumb|2009 Honda CBR600RR ABS sensor]]

On September 5, 2008, Honda introduced a revised CBR600RR for the 2009 model year.<ref name="MCN2009into">{{cite web |url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/newsresults/mcn/2008/september/1-7/sep0508-honda-2009-cbr600rr/?R=EPI-102724 |title=2009 Honda CBR600RR ABS - First official pictures |accessdate=2008-09-05 |last=Farrell |first=Steve |date=2008-09-05 |work=motorcyclenews.com |publisher=[[Motor Cycle News]] }}</ref> Combined ABS became available as an option. Other changes included updates to the engine such as changes to its pistons, cylinder head and exhaust that Honda claims will increase torque delivery between 8,000-12,000 rpm with a 3.5% increase in torque at 10,000 rpm. The CBR600RR’s engine also received a new high resistance valve lifter and a popup valve system inherited from the CBR1000RR. Included also are improved fairings that enhance stability and reduce noise emission levels, and new color schemes which were designed to attract a wider range of riders. Although all of these changes involved the addition of some materials, the overall weight of the 2009 CBR600RR remained the same as the 2008 model. This was achieved through weight savings in the engine, exhaust, and the chassis.

The CBR600RR carried over with only color scheme changes for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 model years.

==== 2013-2015 revision ====

The 2013 CBR600RR includes new 12-spoke wheels, revised ECU settings, and a fine-tuned ram-air system to increase torque. It also gets a new Showa “Big Piston Fork" and retuned rear shock in a new bodywork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powersports.honda.com/2013/cbr600rr.aspx |title=2013 CBR600RR Overview - Honda Powersports |publisher=Powersports.honda.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}</ref> Three color schemes are available, including one in the MotoGP’s Repsol livery. The other two are red and tricolor. Another significant change is the newly designed front end, which makes it stand out from the earlier models.
