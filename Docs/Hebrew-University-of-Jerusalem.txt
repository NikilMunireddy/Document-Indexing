The '''Hebrew University of Jerusalem''' ({{lang-he|האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים}}, ''Ha-Universita ha-Ivrit bi-Yerushalayim''; {{lang-ar|الجامعة العبرية في القدس}}, ''Al-Jami'ah al-Ibriyyah fi al-Quds''; abbreviated '''HUJI''') is [[Israel]]'s second oldest university established in 1918, 30 years before the [[State of Israel]]. The Hebrew University has three campuses in [[Jerusalem]] and one in [[Rehovot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huji.ac.il/huji/eng/aboutHU_e.htm |title=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem – About |publisher=Huji.ac.il |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> The world's largest [[Jewish studies]] library is located on its Edmond J. Safra [[Givat Ram]] campus.

The first Board of Governors included [[Albert Einstein]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Martin Buber]], and [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Four of Israel's prime ministers are alumni of the Hebrew University. In the last decade, [[#Notable alumni|seven researchers and alumni]] of the University received the [[Nobel Prize]] and one was awarded the [[Fields Medal]].

One of the visions of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement was the establishment of a [[Jewish]] university in the [[Land of Israel]]. Founding a university was proposed as far back as 1884 in the [[Kattowitz|Kattowitz (Katowice)]] conference of the [[Hovevei Zion]] society.

The cornerstone for the university was laid on July 24, 1918. Seven years later, on April 1, 1925, the Hebrew University campus on [[Mount Scopus]] was opened at a gala ceremony attended by the leaders of the Jewish world, distinguished scholars and public figures, and British dignitaries, including the [[Arthur James Balfour|Earl of Balfour]], Viscount [[Edmund Allenby|Allenby]] and Sir [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]]. The University's first Chancellor was [[Judah Magnes]].

By 1947, the University had become a large research and teaching institution.  Plans for a medical school were approved in May 1949, and in November 1949, a faculty of law was inaugurated. In 1952, it was announced that the agricultural institute founded by the University in 1940 would become a full-fledged faculty.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weitz |first=Yechiam |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841024.html |title=The subversives on the hill |work=Haaretz |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

When the [[Jordan]] government denied Israeli access to Mount Scopus, a new campus was built at Givat Ram in western Jerusalem and completed in 1958. In the interim, classes were held in 40 different buildings around the city.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6x3S8eM3spAC&pg=PA193&lpg=PA193&dq=attacks+on+medical+convoys+to+mount+scopus&source=bl&ots=i3xSFCCEoQ&sig=OfknIC090FABGc6blXu_PbZtM80&hl=en&ei=d__gSan5I56RjAevpu3UDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10 |title=International dictionary of ... |publisher= |author= |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

The Terra Santa building in [[Rehavia]], rented from the Franciscan Custodians of the Latin Holy Places, was also used for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/jermandate.html |title=Jerusalem: Architecture in the British Mandate Period |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> A few years later, together with the [[Hadassah]] Medical Organization, a medical science campus was built in the south-west Jerusalem neighborhood of [[Ein Kerem]].

By the beginning of 1967, the students numbered 12,500, spread among the two campuses in Jerusalem and the agricultural faculty in [[Rehovot]]. After the unification of Jerusalem, following the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, the University was able to return to Mount Scopus, which was rebuilt. In 1981 the construction work was completed, and Mount Scopus again became the main campus of the University.

On July 31, 2002, a member of a terrorist cell [[Hebrew University massacre|detonated a bomb]] during lunch hour at the University's "Frank Sinatra" cafeteria when it was crowded with staff and students. Nine people — five Israelis, three Americans, and one dual French-American citizen — were killed and more than 70 wounded. World leaders, including [[Kofi Annan]], [[George W. Bush|President Bush]], and the President of the European Union issued statements of condemnation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memorial.huji.ac.il/eng-open.html |title=HUJI Memorial Pages |publisher=Memorial.huji.ac.il |date=July 31, 2002 |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/7/Terrorist%20bombing%20at%20Hebrew%20University%20cafeteria%20- |title=Terrorist bombing at Hebrew University cafeteria |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

[[Mount Scopus]] (Hebrew: Har HaTzofim הר הצופים), in the north-eastern part of Jerusalem, is home to the main campus, which contains the Faculties of Humanities, Social Sciences, Law, Jerusalem School of Business Administration, Bearwald School of Social Work, Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace, Rothberg International School, and the Mandel Institute of [[Jewish Studies]].

The Rothberg International School features secular studies and Jewish/Israeli studies. Included for foreign students is also a mandatory Ulpan program for Hebrew language study which includes a mandatory course in Israeli culture and customs. All Rothberg Ulpan classes are taught by Israeli natives. However, many other classes at the Rothberg School are taught by Jewish immigrants to Israel.

The land on Mt. Scopus was purchased before [[World War I]] from Sir John Gray-Hill, along with the Gray-Hill mansion.<ref name="docs.google.com">{{cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:BzVt66WQaxYJ:arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph3/12dolev.pdf+architecture+hebrew+university&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESh7pTs4UOFXL1OlcdB2jCvesR8GqakjTVnBHW5kojibwNbWcF_7mwDX7oZrtsk9MquSvjS7A_n_4xznhmS_3ddSnIxlCVpyqK3UbFxwRrkCnYU9QZyizlepFKMdaHgvwKLYcUn7&sig=AHIEtbR-5rKVO7r_TXl7G1ORKHubfSNj6g |title=Architectural Orientalism in the Hebrew University, Diana Dolev |publisher= |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> The master plan for the university was designed by [[Patrick Geddes]] and his son-in-law, [[Frank Mears]] in December 1919. Only three buildings of this original design were built: The Wolfson National Library, the Mathematics Institute, and the Physics Institute.<ref name="docs.google.com"/>

Housing for students at Hebrew University who live on Mount Scopus is located at the three dormitories located near the university. These are the Maiersdorf (מאירסדורף) dormitories, the Bronfman (ברונפמן) dormitories, and the Kfar HaStudentim (כפר הסטודנטים, the students' village).

Nearby is the [[Nicanor Cave]], an ancient cave which was planned to be a national pantheon.

==Libraries==
The [[Jewish National and University Library]] is the central and largest library of the Hebrew University and one of the most impressive book and manuscript collections in the world. It is also the oldest section of the university. Founded in 1892 as a world center for the preservation of books relating to Jewish thought and culture, it assumed the additional functions of a general university library in 1920. Its collections of [[Hebraica]] and [[Judaica]] are the largest in the world. It houses all materials published in Israel, and attempts to acquire all materials published in the world related to the country. It possesses over five million books and thousands of items in special sections, many of which are unique. Among these are the [[Albert Einstein Archives]], [[Hebrew]] [[manuscripts]] department, Eran Laor map collection, Edelstein science collection, [[Gershom Scholem]] collection, and a collection of [[Maimonides]]' manuscripts and early writings.

In his Will, Albert Einstein left the Hebrew University his personal papers and the copyright to them.
