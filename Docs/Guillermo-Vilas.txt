'''Guillermo Vilas''' ({{IPA-es|giˈʃeɾmo ˈbilas}}; born 17 August 1952) is a retired professional [[tennis]] player from [[Argentina]] who won four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|major]] singles titles. Known for his [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles#Matches played, won, win rate|prolific match play]], especially on clay, he became the second man to win more than 900 matches in the [[Open Era]], and his 659 wins on clay are by far the most of the era. His peak was the 1977 season during which he won two major titles (both on clay), had [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles#Win streaks|two long match win streaks]] of 46 all-surface and 53 on clay, and finished with an [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles#Single season records|Open Era record]] 134 match wins. He also popularized the between-the-legs [[tweener (tennis)|tweener]] shot, also known as the "Gran Willy" in his honor.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Career==
Raised in the seaside resort of [[Mar del Plata]], Vilas was a [[southpaw]] and played his first tour event in 1969. He was in the year-ending top ten from 1974 through 1982. He was a [[clay-court specialist]] but also played well on [[Tennis court#Hard courts|hard]], [[Tennis court#Grass courts|grass]], and [[Tennis court#Indoor courts|carpet]] surfaces.

He won four Grand Slam titles: the [[1977 French Open]] and the [[1977 US Open (tennis)|1977 US Open]] (both played on clay) and the [[1978 Australian Open|1978]] and [[1979 Australian Open]] (both played on grass). He was also the runner-up at the [[French Open]] three times ([[1975 French Open|1975]], [[1978 French Open|1978]], and [[1982 French Open|1982]]) and at the [[Australian Open]] once ([[1977 Australian Open (January)|January 1977]]).

In 1974 he won the year end [[ATP World Tour Finals|Masters Grand Prix]] title. In addition he won seven [[Grand Prix Super Series]] titles (1975–80) the precursors to the current [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters 1000]].

===Best year===
A left-handed [[baseliner]], Vilas's best year on tour was 1977 when he won two of the four Grand Slam singles tournaments and 16 of the 31 [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] tournaments he entered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Vi/G/Guillermo-Vilas.aspx?t=pa&y=1977&m=s&e=0#|title=Player Activity – Guillermo Vilas|year=1977|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> His playing record for 1977 was 145 wins against 15 losses (ATP win-loss record was 130–15). Not including the Masters year-end championship, he won 72 of his last 73 ATP matches in 1977. The highest point during this phenomenal run was winning the last [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] played at [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] against [[Jimmy Connors]] 2–6, 6–3, 7–6<sup>(7–4)</sup>, 6–0 in a match where Vilas surprised his American rival by attacking the net.<ref name="hall">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/guillermo-vilas|title=Guillermo Vilas |year=1991|work=Hall of Famers|publisher=International Tennis Hall of Fame}}</ref>

===Winning streak, most titles in a single year===
In 1977 he won seven consecutive titles after [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]&mdash;Kitzbühel (clay), Washington (clay), Louisville (clay), South Orange (clay), Columbus (clay), [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] (clay) and Paris (clay)&mdash;and set up a 46-match all-surface winning streak, third all-time behind [[Björn Borg]]'s records of 49 and 48 consecutive matches won. He also had a record 57-match winning streak on [[clay courts]] (including both Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and unofficial tournaments), which stood until the record was broken by [[Rafael Nadal]] in 2006. Both his winning streaks were terminated in October 1977 by [[Ilie Năstase]] in the final of the [[Aix-en-Provence]] tournament. In that best of five-set final, Vilas dropped the first two sets by 6–1, 7–5 and then retired in protest of Năstase's use of a [[Strings (tennis)#Stringing pattern|spaghetti strung]] racquet (which was banned shortly after by the ATP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/30/sports/tennis/30string.html?ex=1251604800&en=e981c21870d9ebdb&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland |title=With Few Exceptions, the String Remains the Same |first=Ron |last=Dicker |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=12 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20050420174702/http://www.nytimes.com:80/2004/08/30/sports/tennis/30string.html?ex=1251604800&en=e981c21870d9ebdb&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland |archivedate=20 April 2005 }}</ref> After that he won a further 28 matches in a row with titles at Tehran, Bogotá, Santiago, Buenos Aires (all on clay) and Johannesburg (hard). That run was ended in the [[1977 Colgate-Palmolive Masters|Masters]] semifinals by Björn Borg.

===World No. 1 controversy===
Even though he won 16 ATP singles titles, including the French Open and the US Open and was the runner-up at the January edition of the [[Australian Open]] in 1977, he was never ranked by the ATP as [[World number one male tennis player rankings|World No. 1]] during 1977 which was due to the fact that the rankings at the time were based on the average of a player’s results.<ref name="nyt_no1">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/sports/tennis/years-later-for-guillermo-vilas-hes-still-not-the-one.html |title=Years Later for Guillermo Vilas, He’s Still Not the One |first1=Christopher |last1=Clarey |date=May 27, 2015 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |access-date=January 26, 2016 }}</ref> He was instead year-end World No. 2, behind Jimmy Connors (who won the Masters and six other titles and was the runner-up at Wimbledon and the US Open in 1977).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/the-spin-of-the-ball/index.ssf/2015/05/guillermo_vilas_got_robbed_why.html |title=Guillermo Vilas got robbed: Why the ATP made the wrong call about controversial No. 1 ranking |first1=Douglas |last1=Perry |date=May 27, 2015 |publisher=''[[The Oregonian]]''/[[OregonLive.com]] |access-date=January 26, 2016 }}</ref> Argentine journalist Eduardo Puppo and Romanian mathematician Marian Ciulpan<ref>{{cite news|author1=Diego Amuy|title=Guillermo Vilas has been number one in the world|url=http://www.batennisworld.com/guillermo-vilas-has-been-number-one-in-the-world/?_r=1|work=[[BATennis World]]|date=26 May 2015}}</ref> investigated Vilas' tournament records and came to the conclusion that Vilas should have been ranked No. 1 for five weeks in 1975 as well as during the first two weeks of 1976 and handed over their research to the ATP at the end of 2014. In May 2015 the ATP announced it had decided not to grant Vilas the No. 1 position because it happened in the interval between the publication of the official rankings.<ref name="nyt_no1" />

===Retirement===
Vilas retired from the ATP tour in 1989 but still played [[ATP Challenger Series]] until 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Vi/G/Guillermo-Vilas.aspx?t=pa&y=1992&m=s&e=0#|title=Player activity – Guillermo Vilas|year=1992|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1991.<ref name="hall"/> Vilas was in the stands at [[Flushing Meadows]] to cheer on his countryman, [[Juan Martín del Potro]], who beat [[Roger Federer]] in an upset in the US Open finals in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Howard Fendrich|title=Federer stunned by del Potro in US Open final|url=http://www.usta.com/News/APNews/2009/09/15/Federer-stunned-by-del-Potro-in-US-Open-final/|publisher=[[USTA]]|date=1 January 2009}}</ref>

==Distinctions==
*Won the Grand Prix circuit in [[1974 Grand Prix (tennis)|1974]], [[1975 Grand Prix (tennis)|1975]], and [[1977 Grand Prix (tennis)|1977]].
*Held the [[History of tennis#Open Era|open era]] male record for the longest winning streak on clay courts at 53 matches, set in 1977, until it was bettered by [[Rafael Nadal]] in 2006. Nadal later extended this to 81 matches.
*Won 62 ATP singles titles (eighth highest during the open era) and was the runner-up in 40 singles tournaments (plus two unfinished finals). Won 16 doubles titles with other 10 doubles finals.
*He took Argentina to its first-ever [[Davis Cup]] final in 1981 (lost to the United States), together with [[José Luis Clerc]], who was also a top-ten player. The Argentine press often referred to the tensions between the two of them, which even reverberated to the [[2004 French Open]] awards ceremony, in which Vilas presented [[Gastón Gaudio]] with his trophy over Clerc's objections.
*Vilas's success on the court led to a surge in popularity of tennis in Argentina and throughout Latin America. [[Guillermo Cañas]] and [[Guillermo Coria]] were named after him.
*In 2005, ''[[Tennis (magazine)|TENNIS Magazine]]'' put Vilas in 24th place in its [[Tennis (magazine)#.22The 40 Greatest Players of the TENNIS Era.22 .282005.29|list of the 40 Greatest Players of the Tennis Open Era (women included)]].
*The only player to win ATP Tour singles titles in five different continents in the same year, 1977 – Europe, South America, North America, Africa, and Asia.
