'''Guizhou''' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:贵|贵]][[wikt:州|州]] |p={{Audio|zh-Guizhou.ogg|Guìzhōu|help=no}}}}; [[Postal romanization|postal]]: '''Kweichow''') is a [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|province]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] located in the [[Southwest China|southwestern part]] of the country. Its capital city is [[Guiyang]].

==Name==
The area was first organized as an imperially-controlled Chinese administrative region during the [[Tang dynasty]], and was named "Juzhou" ({{lang|zh|矩州}}, [[Middle Chinese]]: ''Kjú-jyuw'').{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=233}}  During the [[Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]], the element "Ju" ("carpenter's square") was changed to the more refined "Gui" ("precious").{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=233}} The region formally became a province in 1413, with its capital at old Guizhou (modern [[Guiyang]]).{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=233}}

== History ==
[[File:Atlas Van der Hagen-KW1049B13 050-QVEICHEV, IMPERII SINARVM PROVINCIA DECIMAQUATRA.jpeg|thumb|left|Guizhou in 1655.]]
From around 1046 BCE to the emergence of the [[Qin (state)|Qin Dynasty]], northwest Guizhou was part of the [[Shu (state)|State of Shu]].<ref name=lp>{{cite book|title=South-West China|edition=2|first=Bradley|last=Maygew|first2=Korina|last2=Miller|first3=Alex|last3=English|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2002|chapter=Facts about South-West China - History|pages=16–20, 24}}</ref> During the [[Warring States period]], the Chinese state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] conquered the area, and control later passed to the [[Dian Kingdom]]. During the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), to which the Dian was tributary, Guizhou was home to the [[Yelang]] collection of tribes, which largely governed themselves before the Han consolidated control in the southwest and established the [[Lingnan]] province.<ref name=lp/> During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, parts of Guizhou were governed by the [[Shu Han]] state based in [[Sichuan]], followed by [[Cao Wei]] (220–265) and the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420).<ref name=lp/>

During the 8th and 9th centuries in the [[Tang Dynasty]], Chinese soldiers moved into Guizhou (Kweichow) and married native women. Their descendants are known as ''Lǎohànrén'' ({{lang|zh|老汉人}}), in contrast to new Chinese who populated Guizhou at later times. They still speak an archaic dialect.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eG8cAAAAMAAJ&q=In+some+parts,+as+for+example+in+Kweichow,+the+distinction+is+made+between+the+Lao-han-jen+or+%22+Original+Chinese+%22+and+the++claim+ancestry+in+the+region+from+as+early+as+the+eighth+and+ninth+centuries+%3B+these+ancestors+were+as+a+rule+soldier-colonists+who+married+native+women,+and+their+descendants+speak+an+archaic+dialect.+The+new+Chinese,+much+more&dq=In+some+parts,+as+for+example+in+Kweichow,+the+distinction+is+made+between+the+Lao-han-jen+or+%22+Original+Chinese+%22+and+the++claim+ancestry+in+the+region+from+as+early+as+the+eighth+and+ninth+centuries+%3B+these+ancestors+were+as+a+rule+soldier-colonists+who+married+native+women,+and+their+descendants+speak+an+archaic+dialect.+The+new+Chinese,+much+more&hl=en&ei=SdPMTIrZOMaAlAez8YWbBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Scottish geographical magazine, Volumes 45-46|author=Scottish Geographical Society|year=1929|publisher=Royal Scottish Geographical Society.|location=|isbn=|page=70|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> Many immigrants to Guizhou were descended from these soldiers in garrisons who married these pre-Chinese women.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vqcSAAAAIAAJ&q=Among+them+were+forced+or+voluntary+immigrants+who+came+as+families+or+clans,+garrison+soldiers+without+families+who+married+women+from+non-Chinese+groups,+and+in+more+recent+years+farmers,+business+and+professional+men,+and+officials.&dq=Among+them+were+forced+or+voluntary+immigrants+who+came+as+families+or+clans,+garrison+soldiers+without+families+who+married+women+from+non-Chinese+groups,+and+in+more+recent+years+farmers,+business+and+professional+men,+and+officials.&hl=en&ei=r9LMTLz_AsTflgftkNzjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ|title=The Cowrie Shell Miao of Kweichow, Volume 32, Issue 1|author=Margaret Portia Mickey|year=1947|publisher=The Museum|location=|isbn=|page=6|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

[[Kublai Khan]] and [[Möngke Khan]] conquered the Chinese southwest in the process of defeating the Song during the [[Mongol invasion of China]], and the newly established [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279–1368) saw the importation of [[Chinese Muslim]] administrators and settlers from [[Bukhara]] in Central Asia.<ref name=lp/>

It was during the following [[Ming Dynasty]], which was once again led by [[Han Chinese]], that Guizhou was formally made a province in 1413. The Ming established many [[garrison]]s in Guizhou from which to pacify the [[Yao people|Yao]] and [[Miao people|Miao]] minorities during the [[Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)|Miao Rebellions]].<ref name=lp/> Chinese-style agriculture flourished with the expertise of farmers from Sichuan, [[Hunan]] and its surrounding provinces into Guizhou. [[Wu Sangui]] was responsible for the ousting the Ming in Guizhou and Yunnan during the [[Manchu conquest of China]]. During the governorship-general of the [[Qing Dynasty]]'s nobleman [[Ortai]], the ''[[tusi]]'' system of indirect governance of the southwest was abolished, prompting rebellions from disenfranchised chieftains and the further centralization of government. After the [[Second Opium War]], criminal [[Triad (underground society)|triads]] set up shop in Guangxi and Guizhou to sell British [[opium]]. For a time, [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Rebels]] took control of Guizhou, but they were ultimately suppressed by the Qing.<ref name=lp/> Concurrently, Han Chinese soldiers moved into the Taijiang region of Guizhou, married Miao women, and their children were brought up as Miao.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5wOBAAAAMAAJ&q=Despite+such+conflict,+Jin+Dan+informed+me+that,+in+the+past,+some+Miao+women+in+the+Taijiang+area+married+Han+soldiers,+though+the+children+were+raised+as+Miao.+Memories+also+exist+of+Nationalist+troops,+in+the+decades+before+1949&dq=Despite+such+conflict,+Jin+Dan+informed+me+that,+in+the+past,+some+Miao+women+in+the+Taijiang+area+married+Han+soldiers,+though+the+children+were+raised+as+Miao.+Memories+also+exist+of+Nationalist+troops,+in+the+decades+before+1949&hl=en&ei=BNLMTIfrLIK0lQfZkuT8CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Contributions to Southeast Asian ethnography, Issue 7|year=1988|publisher=Board of Editors, Contributions to Southeast Asian Ethnography|location=|isbn=|page=99|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HLERRaLvOXEC&pg=PR17&dq=taijiang+miao+rebellion&hl=en&ei=ruDMTKrdIsH_lgeH1uiYBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=taijiang%20miao%20rebellion&f=false|title=Butterfly mother: Miao (Hmong) creation epics from Guizhou, China|author1=Dan Jin |author2=Xueliang Ma |author3=Mark Bender |year=2006|publisher=Hackett Publishing|location=|isbn=0-87220-849-4|page=xvii|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

After the [[Chinese economic reform]] began in 1978, geographical factors led Guizhou to become the poorest province in China, with a GDP growth average of 9 percent from 1978 to 1993.<ref name="Hutchings"/>

== Geography ==
[[File:Shitoucun,Longtanzhen,Guizhou,China.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bouyei minority Shitou village, west Guizhou (near Longgong caves), China.]]
Guizhou is a mountainous province, although its higher altitudes are in the west and centre. It lies at the eastern end of the [[Yungui Plateau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatoday.com/city/guizhou.htm|title=Guizhou Province|publisher=ChinaToday.com|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>

Guizhou has a subtropical humid climate. There are few seasonal changes. Its annual average temperature is roughly 10 to 20&nbsp;°C, with January temperatures ranging from 1 to 10&nbsp;°C and July temperatures ranging from 17 to 28&nbsp;°C. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Like in China's other southwest provinces, rural areas of Guizhou suffered severe drought during spring 2010. One of China's poorest provinces, Guizhou is experiencing serious environmental problems, such as desertification and persistent water shortages. On 3–5 April 2010, China's Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] went on a three days inspection tour in the southwest drought-affected province of Guizhou, where he met villagers and called on agricultural scientists to develop drought-resistant technologies for the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/05/c_13238009.htm|title=China's premier concerned about drought in SW China|publisher=''[[Xinhua]]''|date=2010-04-05|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>
