[[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester City]], prior to 1851, was the county seat of both Delaware County and, before that, of Chester County.

Delaware County is adjacent to the [[consolidated city-county|city-county]] of [[Philadelphia]] and is included in the Philadelphia-[[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]]-[[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], PA-[[New Jersey|NJ]]-[[Delaware|DE]]-[[Maryland|MD]] [[Delaware Valley|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].  Delaware County is the only county covered in its entirety by [[Area codes 484, 610, and 835|area codes 610 and 484]].

==History==
[[File:Chester Courthouse 1724.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[1724 Chester Courthouse|old Chester Courthouse]], built in 1724.]]
Delaware County lies in the river and bay drainage area named "Delaware" in honor of [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], Governor of the nearby English colony of [[Virginia]].  The land was "discovered" and explored by [[Henry Hudson]] in 1609, and over the next several decades it was variously claimed and settled by the [[New Sweden|Swedes]], the [[New Netherland|Dutch]], and the [[Province of Pennsylvania|English]].  Its original human inhabitants were the [[Lenni-Lenape]] tribe of American Indians.

Once the Dutch were defeated and the extent of [[Province of New York|New York]] was determined, King [[Charles II of England]] made his grant to [[William Penn]] in order to found the colony which came to be named [[Pennsylvania]].  Penn divided his colony into three counties: Bucks, Philadelphia, and Chester.  The riverfront land south of Philadelphia, being the most accessible, was quickly granted and settled.  In 1789, the eastern portion of [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]] was divided from the rest.  Despite that the eastern portion was the first settled and contained the town of Chester, it was named Delaware County for [[Delaware River|its river]].

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|191|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|184|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|6.8|sqmi}} (3.5%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_42.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=March 6, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> It is the third-smallest county in Pennsylvania by area.

Delaware County is roughly diamond- or kite-shaped, with the four sides formed by the [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]] boundary to the northwest, the boundary with the state of [[Delaware]] (a portion of the "[[Twelve Mile Circle]]") to the southwest, the [[Delaware River]] (forming the border with the state of [[New Jersey]] to the southeast, and the city of [[Philadelphia]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] to the east and northeast.

The [[List of U.S. states by elevation|lowest point]] in the state of Pennsylvania is located on the Delaware River in [[Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania|Marcus Hook]] in Delaware County, where it flows out of Pennsylvania and into [[Delaware]].  The highest point in Delaware County is 500 feet at two points southeast of Wyola in Newtown Township [http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/pub/ic4.pdf].

Waterways in Delaware County generally flow in a southward direction and ultimately drain into the Delaware River.  The waterways are, from west to east: the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine River]] (forming a portion of the county's western boundary with Chester County), [[Chester Creek]], [[Ridley Creek]], [[Crum Creek]], Muckinipates Creek, [[Darby Creek (Pennsylvania)|Darby Creek]] and [[Cobbs Creek]] (forming a portion of the county's eastern boundary with Philadelphia).  Crum Creek was dammed in 1931 near [[Pennsylvania Route 252]] to fill [[Springton Lake]] (also known as Geist Reservoir), an approximately {{convert|391|acre|km2|sing=on}}<ref>[http://crcwatersheds.org/crum Chester - Ridley - Crum Watersheds Association<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> drinking water reservoir maintained by [[Aqua America]], the county's largest lake.

As of November 2008, there are 406,352 registered voters in Delaware County.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dos.state.pa.us/elections/lib/elections/055_voter_registration_statistics/currentstats/currentvotestats.xls |title=currentvotestats |website=Pennsylvania Department of State |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121113112424/http://www.dos.state.pa.us/elections/lib/elections/055_voter_registration_statistics/currentstats/currentvotestats.xls |archivedate=November 13, 2012 }}</ref>

* [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]: 190,716 (46.93%)
* [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]: 172,405 (42.43%)
* Other Parties: 43,231 (10.64%)

Politically, Delaware County traditionally voted [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].  It voted for the Republican candidate in nearly every election from 1854 through 1988, with exceptions including the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]]. As was the case in most of the Philadelphia suburbs, however, the brand of Republicanism that prevailed in the area was traditionally a [[Moderate republican|moderate one]]. It has operated under a home-rule charter with five at-large councilmembers since 1972. Republicans remain in control of many county council seats and row offices.

In recent elections, however, Delaware County has been trending [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and the Republican registration edge has declined rapidly from over twice as many voters as Democrats had in 2002.  It narrowly voted for [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992, but has gone Democratic in every Presidential election since then by 10 points or more by progressively-increasing margins.  In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]] Democratic presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] won the county by 14 points.  In the 2004 [[US Senate]] election, Republican [[Arlen Specter]] defeated [[Joe Hoeffel]] but Democrat [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] defeated [[Rick Santorum]] in the 2006 Senate election. In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Democratic Senator [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican Senator [[John McCain]] resoundingly, by over 21 points. All three Democratic state row office candidates also carried it in 2008.

Most of Delaware County is located in the state's [[Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]], represented by Republican [[Pat Meehan]].  The district had been held for 20 years by Republican [[Curt Weldon]] until he was ousted by [[Joe Sestak]], a retired admiral, in the 2006 [[U.S. House of Representatives]] election.  Also in the 2006 election, Democrat [[Bryan Lentz]] unseated Republican incumbent State Representative [[Tom Gannon]] in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 161|161st House district]].  In 2010 Sestak ran for the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2010|senate seat]] vacated by Arlen Specter and was replaced by Meehan, defeating Lentz, who ran as the Democrat.  Lentz was replaced in the State House by [[Joe Hackett (Pennsylvania)|Joe Hackett]], a Republican.  A small portion of the county, mostly consisting of the areas around Chester, Yeadon and Darby, is in the Philadelphia-based [[Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district|1st district]], represented by Democrat [[Bob Brady]].
