As of the 2010 census, the population was 37,819, making it the largest community in Hampshire County (although the county seat is [[Northampton, MA|Northampton]]).  The town is home to [[Amherst College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], three of the [[Five College Consortium|Five Colleges]]. The name of the town is pronounced without the ''h'' ("AM-erst"),<ref>[http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001533.php languagehat.com], [http://board.uscho.com/archive/index.php/t-58514.html uscho.com], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A649091 bbc.co.uk]</ref> giving rise to the local saying, "only the 'h' is silent", in reference both to the pronunciation and to the town's politically active populace.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.ajhastings.com/250th/250T.htm local T-shirt for sale]; Chris Rohmann, [http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=14216 "Stage Struck: Silent But Deadly"], ''Valley Advocate'', Oct. 20, 2011; and [http://www.cohousing.com/living-in-western-massachusetts.html "Living in Western Massachusetts"], Pioneer Valley Cohousing (last visited Sept. 16, 2012).</ref>

The communities of [[Amherst Center, Massachusetts|Amherst Center]], [[North Amherst, Massachusetts|North Amherst]], and [[South Amherst, Massachusetts|South Amherst]] are [[census-designated place]]s.

Amherst is part of the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] [[Springfield, Massachusetts metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Lying 18 miles (28.9&nbsp;km) northeast of the city of Springfield, Amherst is considered the northernmost town in the [[Hartford-Springfield]] [[Knowledge Corridor]] Metropolitan Region.

==History==
The earliest known document of the lands now comprising Amherst is the deed of purchase dated December 1658 between John Pynchon of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] and three native inhabitants, referred to as Umpanchla, Quonquont, and Chickwalopp.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Carpenter |first1=Edward Wilson |last2=Charles Frederick Morehouse |year=1896 |title=The History of the Town of Amherst, Massachusetts |location=Amherst, Mass. |publisher=Press of Carpenter & Morehouse |pages=1–2 |oclc=11223569 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAk1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1#v=twopage&q&f=false |access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref>  According to the deed, "ye Indians of Nolwotogg (Norwottuck) upon ye River of Quinecticott (Connecticut)" sold the entire area in exchange for "two Hundred fatham of [[Wampam]] & Twenty fatham, and one large Coate at Eight fatham wch Chickwollop set of, of trusts, besides severall small giftes" {{sic}}. Amherst celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2009. The Amherst 250th Anniversary Celebration Committee was established to oversee the creation and implementation of townwide activities throughout 2009. The Amherst Historical Society also organized events, including a book published by them and written by Elizabeth M. Sharpe, ''Amherst A to Z''.

When the first permanent English settlements arrived in 1727, this land and the surrounding area (including present-day South Hadley and Granby) belonged to the town of [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]]. It gained precinct status in 1734 and eventually township in 1759.

When it incorporated, the colonial governor assigned the town the name Amherst after [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst]]. Many colonial governors at the time scattered his name amidst the influx of new town applications, which is why several towns in the Northeast bear the name. Amherst was a hero of the [[French and Indian War]] who, according to popular legend, singlehandedly won Canada for the British and banished France from North America. Popular belief has it that he supported the American side in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary war]] and resigned his commission rather than fight for the British. Baron Amherst actually remained in the service of the Crown during the war—albeit in Great Britain rather than North America—where he organized the defense against the proposed Franco-Spanish [[Armada of 1779]]. Nonetheless, his previous service in the French and Indian War meant he remained popular in New England. Amherst is also infamous for recommending, in a letter to a subordinate, the use of [[smallpox]]-covered blankets in warfare against the Native Americans along with any "other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race".<ref>{{Cite web |first=Peter |last=d'Errico |title=Jeffrey Amherst and Smallpox Blankets |publisher=Peter d'Errico's Law Page |url=http://people.umass.edu/derrico/amherst/lord_jeff.html |access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref> For this reason, there have been occasional ad hoc movements to rename the town. Suggested new names have included "Emily", after [[Emily Dickinson]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Geography and climate==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Amherst has a total area of {{convert|27.8|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|27.7|sqmi|1}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|1}} (0.14%) is water. The town is bordered by [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] to the west, [[Sunderland, Massachusetts|Sunderland]] and [[Leverett, Massachusetts|Leverett]] to the north, [[Shutesbury, Massachusetts|Shutesbury]], [[Pelham, Massachusetts|Pelham]], and [[Belchertown]] to the east, and [[Granby, Massachusetts|Granby]] and [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]] to the south. The highest point in the town is on the northern shoulder of Mount Norwottuck; the peak is in Granby but the town's high point is a few yards away and is about 1100 feet. The town is nearly equidistant from both the northern and southern state lines. For interactive mapping provided by the Town of Amherst, see [[#External links|External Links]] on this page.

Amherst's [[ZIP code]] of 01002 is the second-lowest number in the continental United States after [[Agawam, Massachusetts|Agawam]] (not counting codes used for specific government buildings such as the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]).

As of the 2008 U.S. Census, there were 35,564 people, 9,174 households, and 4,550 families residing in the town.  The [[population density]] was 1,283.4 people per square mile (485.7/km²).  There were 9,427 housing units at an average density of 340.1 per square mile (131.3/km²).  The racial makeup of the town was 76.7% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 5.10% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.21% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 9.02% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.09% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.89% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.35% from two or more races.  6.19% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

There were 9,174 households out of which 27.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 10.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.4% were non-families. Of all households 28.6% were made up of individuals and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 2.97.

In the town the population was spread out with 12.8% under the age of 18, 50.0% from 18 to 24, 17.2% from 25 to 44, 13.4% from 45 to 64, and 6.6% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females there were 91.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.8 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $40,017, and the median income for a family was $61,237. Males had a median income of $44,795 versus $32,672 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $17,427.  About 7.2% of families and 20.2% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 9.3% of those under age 18 and 3.5% of those age 65 or over. The reason for the large population living below the poverty line is the large number of students that live in Amherst.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

According to the 2010 5-year American Community Survey estimates, occupied housing units had a median household income of $50,063, which includes both renter and owner-occupied units. More specifically, owner-occupied units had a median income of $100,208, while renter-occupied housing units had a median income of $23,925. Large disparities in income between the two groups could explain the high poverty rate and lower median income, as students are the primary tenants of renter-occupied units within Amherst.

Of residents 25 years old or older, 41.7% have a graduate or professional degree, and only 4.9% did not graduate from high school. The largest industry is education, health, and social services, in which 51.9% of employed persons work.

These statistics given above include some but not all of the large [[student]] population, roughly 30,000 in 2010, many of whom only reside in the town part of the year.  Amherst is home to thousands of part-time and full-time residents associated with the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Amherst College]], and [[Hampshire College]] and many of those students are involved with the liberal politics of the town.

==Government==
[[Image:Town Hall, Amherst MA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|<center>Town Hall</center>]]
Amherst is among relatively few towns of its size in Massachusetts without a [[mayor-council government|mayor-council]] or [[council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government. Instead, it has maintained its traditional system, with a [[representative town meeting]] for the legislative branch and a [[selectman|select board]] for the executive. The Select Board hires a [[town manager]] for daily administrative issues.<ref name="AmherstWebsite-TM">[https://www.amherstma.gov/index.aspx?nid=790 "Town Meeting"], Town of Amherst Official Website (last visited March 21, 2014).</ref>

By a special state law, Amherst's town meeting is modified from the traditional, by designating ten precincts, each with 24 elected representatives.<ref name="AmherstWebsite-TM" />  With an additional 14 ''ex officio'' members (the 5 Select Board members; the 5 School Committee members; President of the Library Trustees; Chair of the Finance Committee; Town Manager; and a Moderator), the total membership of Town Meeting is 254.<ref name="AmherstWebsite-TM" />
