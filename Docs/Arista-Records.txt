'''Arista Records, Inc.''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|.|r|ɪ|.|s|t|ə}} was an [[United States|American]] major [[record label]]. It was a wholly owned [[Strategic business unit|unit]] of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and was previously handled by [[Bertelsmann Music Group]]. The company operated under the [[RCA Music Group]] until 2011. The label was founded in 1974 by [[Clive Davis]], who formerly worked for [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] (which would become Sony Music Entertainment). Until its demise in 2011, it was a major distributor and promoter of albums throughout the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]].

Today, the label's reissues and catalog releases are handled both by [[RCA Records]] and [[Legacy Recordings]].

==History==

===Background===
After being fired from [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aQkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false "CPI Tabs Davis to Expand Line"] ''Billboard'' on Google Books (June 1, 1974). Retrieved March 18, 2011</ref> [[Clive Davis]] was hired by [[Columbia Pictures]] (which later became sister to the former CBS Records in 1989) in June 1974 to be a consultant for the company’s record and music operations.  By November 1974, and with a 10 million dollar investment from Columbia Pictures, Davis folded the various Columbia legacy labels ([[Colpix Records]], [[Colgems Records]], and [[Bell Records]]) into a new entity named Arista Records,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eQkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT25&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false "The New Record Company: Arista Records"] ''Billboard'' on Google Books (November 23, 1974). Retrieved March 18, 2011</ref> ultimately owning 20 percent of the company. The label was named Arista after New York City's secondary school honor society (of which Davis was a member at [[Erasmus Hall High School]]). In early 1975, most of the artists who had been signed to Bell were let go, except [[David Cassidy]] (left for [[RCA Records]]), [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]] (left for [[Elektra Records]]), and [[The 5th Dimension]] (departed for [[ABC Records]]).  Others, such as [[Suzi Quatro]] and [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]], were farmed out to the Bell/Arista-distributed label, [[Big Tree Records|Big Tree]]. Several Bell acts, such as [[Barry Manilow]], the [[Bay City Rollers]], and [[Melissa Manchester]] moved to Arista. The British Bell label kept that name for a couple of years before changing its name to Arista. The label was immortalized in the 1978 [[Rockpile]] song "They Called It Rock," in the lyric, "Arista says they love you/But the kids can't dance to this."

Besides boasting such big name stars as Manilow, [[the Kinks]], and [[Dionne Warwick]]; one of the pivotal moments in Arista's history was the signing of [[Aretha Franklin]] in 1980, after her long relationship with [[Atlantic Records]] ended.  The label's most significant acquisition, however, came in 1983, when Davis signed Warwick's cousin [[Whitney Houston]].  Houston would eventually become Arista's biggest selling recording artist, with sales of 200 million records worldwide—according to the [[RIAA|Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>[[RIAA]] sales statistics [http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt]</ref>

===Subsidiary imprint labels===
Arista had an imprint label in the 1970s called [[Arista Novus]], which focused on contemporary jazz artists. It distributed two other jazz labels, "Arista Freedom," which specialized in [[avant-garde jazz]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzdiscography.com/Labels/freedom.htm |title=Arista/Freedom Records Listing |publisher=Jazzdiscography.com |date=April 26, 1998 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref> and, until 1982, [[GRP Records]], which specialized in contemporary jazz and what came to be known as [[smooth jazz]].  A country music division, Career Records, was merged into the [[Arista Nashville]] division in 1997. Arista Austin was used in the late 1990s as a country label.  Additionally, Arista was the North American distributor of [[Jive Records]] from 1981 until 1987.  During the 1990s, Arista also distributed the [[Logic Records|Logic]], [[Rowdy Records|Rowdy]] and [[Heavenly Records|Heavenly]] labels.

===Acquisitions, sell-offs===
Looking to stave off bankruptcy, Columbia Pictures sold Arista to German-based [[Ariola Records]] in 1979.  After Ariola purchased [[General Electric]]'s [[RCA Records]] in 1986, the combined company was renamed [[Bertelsmann Music Group]], though Arista's US releases would not note BMG until 1987.

Into the 1980s, Arista continued its success, including major UK act [[Secret Affair]]. Over the years it acquired [[Northwestside Records]], [[deConstruction Records]], [[First Avenue Records]], and [[Dedicated Records]] in the UK. In 1989, Arista entered into a joint venture with [[Antonio Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]] and [[Kenneth Edmonds|Babyface]] in the creation of [[LaFace Records]] record company of [[TLC (band)|TLC]], which it fully acquired in 1999. In 1993, Arista also entered into a joint-venture with Sean "[[P. Diddy]]" Combs to form [[Bad Boy Records]]. Arista acquired [[Profile Records]], the home of [[Run-D.M.C.]] and [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], in 1997.

===Milli Vanilli controversy===
In 1989, Arista signed a German-based duo named [[Milli Vanilli]], consisting of [[Rob Pilatus]] and [[Fab Morvan]], and released its wildly successful multi-platinum debut album (which had been previously released in Europe the year before), ''[[Girl You Know It's True]]'', the same year in the U.S. and Canada. The album became a success, was certified sextuple platinum in the United States, and charted five top-ten singles, three of which peaked at number one. In 1990, the duo won two [[American Music Awards]] and a [[Grammy Award]] for Best New Artist. Despite their success, rumors began to surface about the duo, and were confirmed later that year, when Milli Vanilli's svengali producer and manager, [[Frank Farian]], publicly revealed that the two hadn't performed a single note on their album. Carol Decker, the lead singer of the short-lived group [[T'Pau (band)|T'Pau]], in an interview after a performance on [[MTV]], said that the two were using a [[Synclavier]] and not singing at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

This revelation caused a firestorm in the music industry, as recording artists, particularly [[pop music|pop]] acts that heavily relied on electronic processing and [[over-dub]]bing (what they referred to as "studio magic"), were now under scrutiny and subsequently forced to cut back on lip-synching to show that they were authentic. Milli Vanilli's Grammy Award was subsequently revoked.<ref name=nyt-grammy>{{cite news|last=PARELES|first=JON|title=Wages of Silence: Milli Vanilli Loses A Grammy Award|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/20/arts/wages-of-silence-milli-vanilli-loses-a-grammy-award.html?_r=1|accessdate=February 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1990}}</ref> Clive Davis promptly released the duo from its contract and deleted the album and its masters from their catalogue—making ''Girl You Know It's True'' the largest-selling album to be deleted. A court ruling in the U.S. allowed anyone who had bought the album to get a partial refund.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In response to the scandal, Arista's position was that the company had been completely unaware of Morvan and Pilatus having not themselves recorded their album.  In a post-debacle interview, Morvan defended himself by saying, "[Before Milli Vanilli] I was working at a McDonald's.  What would you have done?" {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The impact on the Arista label was significant. Arista sales suffered across the board with only one release that was certified Gold, [[KLF]]'s "[[Justified & Ancient]]", that entire year.

===Reconstructing Arista===
At the end of 2000, following its 25th anniversary, BMG pushed Davis out as label head {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and promoted [[L.A. Reid]] as its new President and CEO. Under Reid, the label had success with newer acts such as [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] and [[Adema]], as well as legacy acts like [[TLC (band)|TLC]] and [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]. Reid, however, seemed to lose focus when it came to promoting its established acts such as [[Whitney Houston]], who had been the label's biggest seller over the years.  Reid's extravagant spending, meanwhile, caused the company to lose money. After the formation of the joint venture of BMG and [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (the former CBS Records) in 2004, Reid was let go. Arista, always an independently managed front line label at BMG, was merged with [[J Records]] in August 2005 and began operating under the newly formed [[RCA Music Group]]—of which Davis had become CEO, and thus again became in control of Arista. The Arista label continued to be used for new releases, although heavily scaled back, while its reissues are released through Sony Music's [[Legacy Recordings]]. Also, as a result of the Sony-BMG merger, Arista once again became related to [[Columbia Pictures]], which is fully owned by the [[Sony Corporation of America]] (through [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]]) - who would buy out BMG's share in 2008.

===Dissolution===
During the summer of 2011, the RCA Music Group underwent a restructuring that saw the elimination of the Arista name later on that year, along with sister labels [[Jive Records|Jive]] and [[J Records|J]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Halperin |first=Shirley |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rca-records-peter-edge-tom-245241 |title=RCA Records' Peter Edge and Tom Corson on Why the Label Downsized and its Place in Sony's Big Picture (Q&A) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref> [[RCA Records]] started releasing all RCA Music Group releases under RCA Records.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christman |first=Ed |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-new-executive-team-named-under-ceo-1005324782.story |title=RCA's New Executive Team Named Under CEO Peter Edge Amid Layoffs (Update) |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=August 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2268707 |title=Unveiling The New Look RCA Records |publisher=FMQB |date=August 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Halperin |first=Shirley |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-peter-edge-tom-corson-on-the-shuttering-1005394732.story |title=RCA's Peter Edge, Tom Corson on the Shuttering of Jive, J and Arista |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref> [[Arista Nashville]] continued to operate through [[Sony Music Nashville]] and was not affected by the closing of Arista Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/08/entertainment/la-et-quick-20111008 |title=Quick Takes: RCA closes subsidiaries |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref>
