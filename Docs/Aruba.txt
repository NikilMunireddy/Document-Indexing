'''Aruba''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|uː|b|ə}} {{respell|ə|ROO|bə}}; {{IPA-nl|aːˈrubaː|lang}}) is a [[constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]], located about {{convert|1600|km}} west of the main part of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and {{convert|29|km|0}}<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37333/Aruba|title=Aruba|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref> north of the coast of [[Venezuela]]. It measures {{convert|32|km|0}} long from its northwestern to its southeastern end and {{convert|10|km|0}} across at its widest point.<ref name="Britannica"/> Together with [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], Aruba forms a group referred to as the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the [[Dutch Caribbean]].

Aruba is one of the four countries that form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], along with the [[Netherlands]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]]. The citizens of these countries all share a single nationality: Dutch. Aruba has no administrative subdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions. Its capital is [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].

Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, [[cactus]]-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of {{convert|179|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and is densely populated, with a total of 102,484 inhabitants at the 2010 Census. It lies outside [[Hurricane Alley]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Aruba}}
[[File:Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|left|The capital, [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]]]

Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to have been [[Caquetios Indian|Caquetío Amerindians]] from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] tribe, who migrated there from [[Venezuela]] to escape attacks by the [[Kalina people|Caribs]]. Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. As sea currents made [[canoe]] travel to other [[Caribbean islands]] difficult, [[Caquetio]] culture remained more closely associated with that of mainland South America.

Europeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations for Spain by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in the summer of 1499. Both described Aruba as an "island of giants", remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetíos compared to Europeans. Gold was not discovered on Aruba for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and [[Caesalpinia echinata|brazilwood]] from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and Spaniards soon colonized the island.<ref name=advent>{{cite book |last=Sullivan| first=Lynne M.| year=2006| title=Adventure Guide to Aruba, Bonaire & Curaçao| publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc.| location=Edison, NJ| pages=57–58| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC&lpg=PA58}}</ref><ref name=early>{{cite book | last=Sauer| first=Carl Ortwin| year=1966| title=The Early Spanish Main| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| page=112| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plzS7SL_-f0C&lpg=PA112}}</ref>

Because it had low rainfall, Aruba was not considered profitable for the plantation system and the economics of the [[slave trade]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Aruba was colonized by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] for over a century. ''Simas'', the ''[[Cacique]]'', or [[Tribal chief|chief]], in Aruba, welcomed the first Catholic priests in Aruba, who gave him a wooden cross as a gift. In 1508, the Spanish Crown appointed Alonso de Ojeda as its first Governor of Aruba, as part of ''Nueva Andalucía''. Arawaks spoke the "broken Spanish" which their ancestors had learned on [[Hispaniola]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Another governor appointed by Spain was [[Juan Martínez de Ampiés]]. A ''cédula real'' decreed in November 1525 gave Ampiés, factor of Española, the right to repopulate Aruba. In 1528, Ampiés was replaced by a representative of the [[Welser|House of Welser]].

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] statutes have applied to Aruba since 1629.{{clarify|how could The Netherlands govern Aruba without owning it?|date=July 2015}} The Netherlands acquired Aruba in 1636. Since 1636, Aruba has been under [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] administration, initially governed by [[Peter Stuyvesant]], later appointed to [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City). Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. The island was included under the [[Dutch West India Company]] (W.I.C.) administration, as "New Netherland and Curaçao", from 1648 to 1664. In 1667 the Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as "Commandeur" in Aruba.

The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, leaving the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean.{{citation needed|reason=no direct linkage has been supplied to demonstrate that one lead to the other|date=August 2012}}

During the Napoleonic wars, the [[British Empire]] took control over the island, between 1799 and 1802, and between 1804 and 1816, before handing it back to the Dutch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/aruba.htm|title=British Empire: Caribbean: Aruba|publisher=}}</ref> 

During World War II with the [[Netherlands in World War II#German occupation|occupation of the Netherlands]] in 1940 the oil facilities in Aruba came under the administration of the [[Dutch government-in-exile]] in London, and Aruba continued to supply oil to the British and their allies.

=== Move towards independence ===
In August 1947, Aruba presented its first ''Staatsreglement'' (constitution), for Aruba's ''[[Independence|status aparte]]'' as an autonomous state within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. By 1954, the [[Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robbers|first=Gerhard|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|volume=1|year=2007|location=New York City|page=649|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&lpg=PA649|isbn=0-8160-6078-9}}</ref>

In 1972, at a conference in [[Suriname]], [[Betico Croes]] (MEP), a politician from Aruba, proposed a ''sui-generis'' Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], each to have its own nationality. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a [[referendum]] so that the people of Aruba could choose whether they wanted total independence or ''Status Aparte'' as a full autonomous state under the Crown.

Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, he appointed a committee that chose the national flag and anthem, introducing them as symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence. He set 1981 as a target date for independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the United Nations; 82% of the participants voted for independence.<ref name="BBC Aruba Profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20211986 |title=BBC News&nbsp;— Aruba profile&nbsp;— Timeline |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>

The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in [[The Hague]] to prepare a study for independence; it was titled ''Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg'' (Aruba and independence, backgrounds, modalities and opportunities; a preliminary report) (1978). At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.

In March 1983, Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for its independence, to be developed in a series of steps as the Crown granted increasing autonomy. In August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles; it officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was projected in 1996.

After his death in 1986, Croes was proclaimed ''Libertador di Aruba''. At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's [[Nelson Oduber|Prime Minister]], the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely its transition to full independence. The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process could be revived after another referendum.

[[File:197306 aruba naturalbridge.jpg|thumb|Natural bridge in Aruba (collapsed 2 September 2005)]]

Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the [[Leeward Antilles]] island arc of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the southern part of the Caribbean. It has white sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents.<ref name="Aruba: the happy island">{{cite web|author=Canoe inc. |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Travel/Activities/SunSand/2011/06/22/18320936.html |title=Aruba: the happy island |publisher=Slam.canoe.ca |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> This is where most tourist development has occurred.<ref name="Aruba: the happy island" /> The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.

The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called [[Hooiberg]] at {{convert|165|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and [[Mount Jamanota]], the highest on the island at {{convert|188|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at {{Coord|12|19|N|70|1|W|}}.

To the east of Aruba are [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. This group of islands is sometimes called the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. They are located on the South American [[continental shelf]] and therefore geographically listed as part of South America.

The [[Aruba Natural Bridge|Natural Bridge]] was a large, naturally formed limestone bridge on the island's north shore. It was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005.

=== Cities and towns ===
{{main|List of cities in Aruba}}
The island, with a population of just over 100,000 inhabitants, does not have major cities. However, most of the island's population resides in or surrounding the two major city-like districts of Oranjestad (Capital) and San Nicolaas. Furthermore, the island is divided into eight districts, which are:
* [[Noord]]
* [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]] (33,000 in 2006), divided in two districts
* [[Paradera]]
* [[San Nicolaas]], divided in two districts
* [[Santa Cruz, Aruba|Santa Cruz]]
* [[Savaneta]]

=== Fauna ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}

The island of Aruba, being isolated from the main land of South America, has helped the evolution of multiple endemic animals. The island provides a habitat for the endemic [[Cnemidophorus arubensis|Aruban Whiptail]] and [[Crotalus durissus unicolor|Aruba Rattlesnake]], as well as endemic subspecies of [[Athene cunicularia|Burrowing Owl]] and [[Eupsittula pertinax|Brown-throated Parakeet]].

The rattlesnake and the owl are printed on the Aruban [[Aruban Florin|currency]].

=== Flora ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2015}}

The flora of Aruba differs from the typical tropical island vegetation. [[Xeric scrublands]] are common, with various forms of [[cacti]], thorny shrubs and evergreens. With the most known plant being the [[Aloe vera]], which has a place on the [[Coat of Arms of Aruba]].

=== Climate ===
{{main|Climate of Aruba}}
In the [[Köppen climate classification]], Aruba has a [[tropics|tropical]] [[semi-arid climate]].<ref name=extremes /> Mean monthly temperature in Oranjestad varies little from {{convert|26.7|°C|1}} to {{convert|29.2|C}}, moderated by constant [[trade winds]] from the Atlantic Ocean, which comes from north-east. Yearly precipitation barely exceeds {{convert|470|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Oranjestad.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Aruba}}
[[File:Aruba-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.60|Population of Aruba 1961–2003, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in 2005; number of inhabitants given in thousands.]]

The population is estimated to be 75% mixed [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]/[[Amerindian]], 15% [[Afro-Aruban|Black]] and 10% other ethnicities.

The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Aboriginals]] remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] heritage. Most of the population is descended from Caquetio Indians and Dutch and to a lesser extent of Africans, Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Sephardic Jewish ancestors.

Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting [[foreign worker]]s to a maximum of three years residency on the island.

Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela. Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants. There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages of Aruba}}

The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and&nbsp;– since 2003&nbsp;– [[Papiamento]]. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. It is a [[creole language]], spoken on Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], that incorporates words from Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. English is known by many; its usage has grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken, based on the size of their community, are Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French.

In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. "y" instead of "j"), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.

The book ''The Buccaneers of America'', first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the natives on Aruba spoke "Spanish". The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.<ref name=cia>{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |year=2009|accessdate=2011-06-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604234830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: ''Diario'', ''Bon Dia'', ''Solo di Pueblo'' and ''Awe Mainta''; and three in English: ''Aruba Daily'', ''Aruba Today'' and ''The News''. ''Amigoe'' is a newspaper published in Dutch. Aruba also has 18 radio stations (two AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations ([[Telearuba]], Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).

=== Regions ===
For census purposes, Aruba is divided into eight regions, which have no administrative functions:

As a [[constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], Aruba's politics take place within a framework of a 21-member [[parliamentary democracy|Parliament]] and an eight-member Cabinet. The [[governor of Aruba]] is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or "Parlamento") for four-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arubaforeignaffairs.com/afa/readBlob.do?id=694|title=Political Stability|accessdate=2011-06-07 |work= |publisher=Aruba Department of Foreign Affairs|date= }}</ref>

Together with the [[Netherlands]], the countries of Aruba, [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport. As Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration. To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands.

Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the [[European Union]], though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.<ref name=euprofile>{{cite web |url=http://www.eeas.europa.eu/aruba/index_en.htm |title=EU Relations with Aruba |accessdate=2011-06-06 |work= |publisher=European Union |date= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609050531/http://eeas.europa.eu/aruba/index_en.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/development/overseas_countries_territories/index_en.htm |title=Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) |accessdate=2011-06-06 |work= |publisher=European Union |date= }}</ref>

=== Politics ===
The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model. Instead of juries or grand juries, in Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with the ''Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg'' ([[Court of First Instance]]) on Aruba, the ''Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie van Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten en van Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba'' ([[Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba]]) and the ''[[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden]]'' (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).<ref>[http://www.aruba.com/ExploretheIsland/IslandFacts/law.aspx Aruba.com] {{wayback|url=http://www.aruba.com/ExploretheIsland/IslandFacts/law.aspx |date=20130215045034 }}</ref> The ''Korps Politie Aruba'' ([[Aruba Police Force]]) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.<ref name="KPA-districts">{{cite web|url=http://www.kparuba.com/districts.html|title=Korps Politie Aruba: district precincts|publisher=Aruba Police Force|accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>

[[Deficit spending]] has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. By 2006, the government's debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.<ref>{{cite web |author=Central Bureau of Statistics|title=Key Indicators General Government, 1997–2006|url=http://www.cbs.aw/cbs/manageDocument.do?dispatch=view&id=927|accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> Aruba received some [[development aid]] from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as "Aruba's Financial Independence") in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year.

In 2006, the Aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit. [[Direct tax]]es have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%. The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007.

== Education ==
Aruba's educational system is patterned after the [[Education in the Netherlands|Dutch system of education]].<ref name="Bogaerts (Transitional times)">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/redsox/2013/09/03/usa-today-minor-league-player-of-the-year-xander-bogaerts-boston-red-sox/2760091/ |title=Bogaerts: USA TODAY Sports' Minor League Player of Year |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>

The Government of Aruba finances the public national education system.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

There are private schools including the [[International School of Aruba]] and Schakel College.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

There are two [[medical schools]] [[Aureus University School of Medicine]] and [[Xavier University School of Medicine]],{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} as well as its own national university, the University of Aruba.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Aruba}}

Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region. There is a low unemployment rate.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $28,924 in 2014; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas.<ref name="cia" /> Its main trading partners are Colombia, the United States, Venezuela, and the [[Netherlands]].

[[File:Aruba export map.png|thumb|upright=1.70|A graphical breakdown of Aruba's economy by exports]]

The island's economy has been dominated by three main industries: tourism, [[aloe]] export, and [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]] (The Lago Oil and Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Before the "Status Aparte" (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector. Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.

The official exchange rate of the [[Aruban florin]] is pegged to the US dollar at 1.79 florins to 1 USD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.currency.me.uk/convert/usd/awg |title=Convert Dollars to Aruba Florin &#124; USD to AWG Currency Converter |publisher=Currency.me.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://themoneyconverter.com/USD/AWG.aspx |title=Convert United States Dollar to Aruban Florin &#124; USD to AWG Currency Converter |publisher=Themoneyconverter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref><!---note that currency fluctuates slightly because of the necessity of forcing the florin to the dollar by buying or selling florins or dollars---> Because of this fact, and due to a large number of American tourists, many businesses operate using US dollars instead of florins, especially in the hotel and resort districts.

=== Tourism ===
About three quarters of the Aruban [[gross national product]] is earned through tourism or related activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Most tourists are from the United States (predominantly from the north-east US), the Netherlands and South America, mainly Venezuela and Colombia.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, citizens of the Netherlands can travel with relative ease to Aruba and other islands of the Dutch Antilles. No visas are needed for Dutch citizens, only a passport, and although the currency used in Aruba is different (the Netherlands uses the [[Euro]]), money can be  easily exchanged at a local bank for [[Aruban Florin]]s.

For the facilitation of the passengers whose destination is the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since 1 February 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport. United States and Aruba have had the agreement since 1986. It began as a USDA and Customs post. Since 2008, Aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Military ===
In 1999, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] established a [[Forward Operating Site|Forward Operating Location]] (FOL) at the airport.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There is also a small Dutch marines base by Savaneta containing approximately 120 Dutch Marines and about 100 AruMil forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Culture ==

On 18 March, Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.

Aruba has a varied culture. According to the ''Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister'' (BBSB), in 2005 there were ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of "[[Sinterklaas]]" on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 27 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the King's birthday or "Dia di Rey" ([[Koningsdag]]) is celebrated.
[[File:Iguanas Aruba.JPG|left|thumb|[[Iguana]]s on a rooftop in Aruba.]]

Christmas and [[New Year's Eve]] are celebrated with the typical music and songs for [[Gaita flutes|gaita]]s for Christmas and the Dande{{clarify|date=November 2012}} for New Year, and "[[Hallaca|ayaca]]", "[[ponche crema]]", ham, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of florins worth of [[fireworks]] are burnt at midnight on New Year's Eve. On 25 January, [[Betico Croes]]' birthday is celebrated. [[St John's Eve|Dia di San Juan]] is celebrated on June 24.

Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the [[Feast of the Ascension]] and [[Good Friday]] are holidays on the island.

The holiday of [[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like [[Mardi Gras]], that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from Venezuela and the nearby islands (Curaçao, St. Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).

Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as [[Halloween]] and Thanksgiving Day in November.

== Infrastructure ==
[[File:Aruba Palm Beach.JPG|thumb|Palm Beach.]]

Aruba's [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]] is located near Oranjestad. According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, 61% of whom were Americans.

Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad and Barcadera. The Port of Playa services all the cruise-ship lines, including [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]], [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], [[Norwegian Cruise Line|NCL]], [[Holland America Line]], [[Disney Cruise Line]] and others. Nearly one million tourists enter this port per year. Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government, runs these seaports.

Arubus is a government-owned bus company. Its buses operate from 3:30&nbsp;a.m. until 12:30&nbsp;a.m. 365 days a year. Small private vans also provide transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.
