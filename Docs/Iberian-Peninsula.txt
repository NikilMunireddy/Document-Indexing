===Greek name===

Strabo<ref>III.4.11.</ref> refers to the Carretanians as people "of the Iberian stock" living in the Pyrenees, who are to be distinguished from either Celts or Celtiberians.

===Roman names===
{{main|Hispania}}
According to Charles Ebel, the ancient sources in both Latin and Greek use Hispania and Hiberia (Greek: Iberia) as synonyms. The confusion of the words was because of an overlapping in political and geographic perspectives. The Latin word ''Hiberia'', similar to the Greek ''Iberia'', literally translates to "land of the Hiberians". This word was derived from the river Ebro, which the Romans called ''Hiberus''. ''Hiber'' (Iberian) was thus used as a term for peoples living near the river Ebro.<ref name="Ebel1976" /><ref name="Gaffiot1934">{{cite book|author=Félix Gaffiot|title=Dictionnaire illustré latin-français|url=https://archive.org/stream/FelixGaffiotDictionnaireIllustr.LatinFrancais/DictionnaireIllustr-Latin-Franais#page/n773/mode/2up|year=1934|publisher=Hachette|page=764}}</ref> The first mention in Roman literature was by the annalist poet [[Ennius]] in 200 BC.<ref name="Woolf2012">{{cite book|author=[[Greg Woolf]]|title=Rome: An Empire's Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wb13HpLmecgC&pg=PA18|date=8 June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-997217-3|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Berkshire Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?&id=WJ4xAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Quintus%20Ennius%22|year=1965|publisher=Williams College|page=7}}</ref><ref name="Vega2003">{{cite book|author=Carlos B.

As they became politically interested in the former Carthaginian territories, the Romans began to use the names ''Hispania Citerior'' and ''Hispania Ulterior'' for 'near' and 'far' Hispania. At the time Hispania was made up of three [[Roman province]]s: [[Hispania Baetica]], [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], and [[Lusitania]]. Strabo says<ref name="III.4.19"/> that the Romans use ''Hispania'' and ''Iberia'' synonymously, distinguishing between the ''near'' northern and the ''far'' southern provinces. (The name "Iberia" was ambiguous, being also the name of the [[Kingdom of Iberia]] in the Caucasus.)

Whatever language may generally have been spoken on the peninsula soon gave way to Latin, except for that of the [[Vascones]], which was preserved as a [[language isolate]] by the barrier of the Pyrenees.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Sesars.svg|thumb|Northeast Iberian script from [[Huesca (province)|Huesca]].]]

The Iberian Peninsula has always been associated with the [[Ebro]], Ibēros in [[ancient Greek]] and Ibērus or Hibērus in [[Latin]]. The association was so well known it was hardly necessary to state; for example, Ibēria was the country "this side of the Ibērus" in Strabo. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] goes so far as to assert that the Greeks had called "the whole of Spain" Hiberia because of the Hiberus River.<ref>III.3.21.</ref> The river appears in the [[Ebro Treaty]] of 226 BC between Rome and Carthage, setting the limit of Carthaginian interest at the Ebro. The fullest description of the treaty, stated in [[Appian]],<ref>{{cite web|first=Horace| last=White|author2=Jona Lendering|title=Appian's History of Rome: The Spanish Wars (§§6–10)|url= http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_spain_02.html#%A77|publisher=livius.org|accessdate= 1 December 2008|pages=Chapter 7}}</ref> uses Ibērus. With reference to this border, [[Polybius]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Polybius: The Histories: III.6.2|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/3*.html|publisher=Bill Thayer}}</ref> states that the "native name" is ''Ibēr'', apparently the original word, stripped of its Greek or Latin ''-os'' or ''-us'' termination.

The early range of these natives, stated by the geographers and historians to be from today's, southern Spain to today's, southern France along the Mediterranean coast, is marked by instances of a readable script expressing a yet unknown language, dubbed "[[Iberian language|Iberian]]." Whether this was the native name or was given to them by the Greeks for their residence on the Ebro remains unknown. Credence in Polybius imposes certain limitations on etymologizing: if the language remains unknown, the meanings of the words, including Iber, must also remain unknown. In modern [[basque language|Basque]], the word ''ibar''<ref name="Morris">[http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/dictionary.htm Morris Student Plus], Basque-English dictionary</ref> means "valley" or "watered meadow", while ''ibai''<ref name="Morris"/> means "river", but there is no proof relating the etymology of the Ebro River with these Basque names.

==Prehistory==
{{Main|Prehistoric Iberia}}
[[Image:Arte esquemático-Cigüeña.png|thumb|Schematic rock art from the Iberian Peninsula.]]
[[Image:Iberia Late Bronze.svg|thumb|Iberian Late Bronze Age since c. 1300 BC]]

===Palaeolithic===
The Iberian Peninsula has been inhabited for at least 1.2 million years as remains found in the sites in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]] demonstrate. Among these sites is the cave of Gran Dolina, where six [[hominini|hominin]] skeletons, dated between 780,000 and one million years ago, were found in 1994. Experts have debated whether these skeletons belong to the species ''[[Homo erectus]]'', ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', or a new species called ''[[Homo antecessor]]''.

Around 200,000 [[Before Present|BP]], during the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period, Neanderthals first entered the Iberian Peninsula. Around 70,000 BP, during the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period, the last glacial event began and the Neanderthal [[Mousterian]] culture was established. Around 37,000 BP, during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], the Neanderthal [[Châtelperronian]] cultural period began. Emanating from [[Southern France]], this culture extended into the north of the peninsula. It continued to exist until around 30,000 BP, when Neanderthal man faced extinction.

About 40,000 years ago, [[anatomically modern humans]] entered the Iberian Peninsula from [[Southern France]].<ref name="Adams2010">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Adams|title=Species Richness: Patterns in the Diversity of Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&pg=PA208|date=26 February 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-74278-4|page=208}}</ref> Here, this [[Population genetics|genetically homogeneous population]] (characterized by the [[Haplogroup R1#Paragroup R-M173|M173 mutation]] in the [[Y chromosome]]), developed the M343 mutation, giving rise to [[Haplogroup R1b]], still the most common in modern [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] males.<ref>{{cite web|title=Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|url=http://www.northamericanpharmacal.com/wiki/wiki.pl/Haplogroup_R1b_%28Y-DNA%29|work=NAP Professional|publisher=North American Pharmacal|author=Persistent Entity|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312025815/http://www.northamericanpharmacal.com/wiki/wiki.pl/Haplogroup_R1b_(Y-DNA)|archivedate=12 March 2014}}</ref>  On the Iberian Peninsula, modern humans developed a series of different cultures, such as the [[Aurignacian]], [[Gravettian]], [[Solutrean]] and [[Magdalenian]] cultures, some of them characterized by the complex forms of the [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]].

===Neolithic===
During the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic expansion]], various [[megalithic]] cultures developed in the Iberian Peninsula. An open seas navigation culture from the east Mediterranean, called the [[Cardium Pottery|Cardium culture]], also extended its influence to the eastern coasts of the peninsula, possibly as early as the 5th millennium BC. These people may have had some relation to the subsequent development of the [[Iberians|Iberian civilization]].

===Chalcolithic===
In the [[Chalcolithic]] (c. 3000 BC), a series of complex cultures developed that would give rise to the peninsula's first civilizations and to extensive exchange networks reaching to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. Around 2800 – 2700 BC, the [[Beaker culture]], which produced the ''Maritime Bell Beaker'', probably originated in the vibrant copper-using communities of the [[Tagus]] estuary in Portugal and spread from there to many parts of western Europe.<ref name=case>{{cite book|last=Case|first=H|title='Beakers and Beaker Culture' Beyond Stonehenge: Essays on the Bronze Age in honour of Colin Burgess|year=2007|publisher=Oxbow|location=Oxford|pages=237–254}}</ref>

===Bronze Age===
[[Bronze Age]] cultures developed beginning c.1800 BC, when the civilization of [[Los Millares]] was followed by that of [[El Argar]]. From this centre, bronze technology spread to other cultures like the [[Bronze of Levante]], [[South-Western Iberian Bronze]] and [[Las Cogotas]].

In the Late Bronze Age, the urban civilisation of [[Tartessos]] developed in the area of modern western [[Andalusia]], characterized by [[Phoenicia]]n influence and using the [[Southwest Paleohispanic script]] for its [[Tartessian language]], not related to the [[Iberian language]].

Early in the first millennium BC, several waves of Pre-Celts and [[Celts]] migrated from [[Central Europe]], thus partially changing the peninsula's ethnic landscape to [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] in its northern and western regions.  In Northwestern Iberia (modern Northern Portugal, Asturias and Galicia), a Celtic culture developed, the [[Castro culture]], with a large number of hill forts and some fortified cities.

==Proto-history==
{{Main|Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula}}

By the [[Iron Age]], starting in the 7th century BC, the Iberian Peninsula consisted of complex agrarian and urban civilizations, either Pre-Celtic or Celtic (such as the [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtiberians]], [[Gallaeci]], [[Astures]], [[Celtici]] and others), the cultures of the Iberians in the eastern and southern zones and the cultures of the [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] in the western portion of the Pyrenees.

The seafaring Phoenicians, [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] successively settled along the Mediterranean coast and founded trading colonies there over a period of several centuries. Around 1100 BC, Phoenician merchants founded the trading colony of Gadir or Gades (modern day [[Cádiz]]) near [[Tartessos]]. In the 8th century BC, the first [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|Greek colonies]], such as Emporion (modern [[Empúries]]), were founded along the Mediterranean coast on the east, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians. The Greeks coined the name Iberia, after the river Iber (Ebro). In the sixth century BC, the Carthaginians arrived in the peninsula while struggling with the Greeks for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was Carthago Nova (modern-day [[Cartagena, Spain]]).

==History==

===Roman rule===
{{Main|Hispania}}
[[Image:Conquista Hispania.svg|thumb|Roman conquest: 220 BC - 19 BC]]

In 218 BC, during the [[Second Punic War]] against the Carthaginians, the first [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] troops invaded the Iberian Peninsula; however, it was not until the reign of [[Augustus]] that it was annexed after two centuries of war with the Celtic and Iberian tribes and the Phoenician, Greek and Carthaginian colonies. The result was the creation of the province of [[Hispania]]. It was divided into [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]] during the late [[Roman Republic]], and during the [[Roman Empire]], it was divided into [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] in the northeast, [[Hispania Baetica]] in the south and [[Lusitania]] in the southwest.

Hispania supplied the Roman Empire with food, olive oil, wine, and metal. The emperors [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], and [[Theodosius I]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger]], and the poets [[Martial]] and [[Lucan]] were born from families living on the peninsula.

===Germanic kingdoms===
{{Main|Visigothic Kingdom|Spania}}
[[File:Hispania 560 AD.PNG|thumb|left|Germanic and Byzantine rule c.560]]

In the early fifth century, [[Germanic peoples]] invaded the peninsula, namely the [[Suebi]], the [[Vandals]] ([[Silingi]] and [[Hasdingi]]) and their allies, the [[Alans]]. Only the kingdom of the Suebi ([[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]]) would endure after the arrival of another wave of Germanic invaders, the [[Visigoths]], who conquered all of the Iberian Peninsula and expelled or partially integrated the Vandals and the Alans. The Visigoths eventually conquered the Suebi kingdom and its capital city, Bracara (modern day [[Braga]]), in 584–585. They would also conquer the [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (552–624) of [[Spania]] in the south of the peninsula and the [[Balearic Islands]].

===Islamic Caliphate===
{{Main|Al-Andalus|Islam in Spain|Islam in Portugal}}
[[File:Al Andalus & Christian Kingdoms.png|thumb|Islamic rule: [[al-Andalus]] c.1000]]

In 711, a Muslim army invaded the [[Visigoths|Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania]]. Under [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the Islamic army landed at Gibraltar and, in an eight-year campaign, occupied all except the northern kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula in the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]]. [[Al-Andalus]] ({{lang-ar|الإندلس}},  tr. ''al-ʾAndalūs'', possibly "Land of the Vandals"),<ref>{{cite book|title=Abraham Ibn Daud's Dorot 'Olam (Generations of the Ages): A Critical Edition and Translation of Zikhron Divrey Romi, Divrey Malkhey Yisra?el, and the Midrash on Zechariah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqNR6MqN8csC&pg=PA57|accessdate=10 August 2013|date=7 June 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-24815-1|page=57}}</ref><ref name="Samsó1998">{{cite book|author=Julio Samsó|title=The Formation of Al-Andalus: History and society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3k9pAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 August 2013|year=1998|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-86078-708-2|pages=41–42}}</ref> is the Arabic name given the what is today southern Spain by its [[Muslim]] Berber and Arab occupiers.

From the 8th–15th centuries, only the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula was incorporated into the Islamic world and became a center of culture and learning, especially during the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], which reached its height under the rule of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]. The Muslims, which were initially [[Arabs]] and [[Berbers]], included some local converts, the so-called [[Muladi]]. The Muslims were referred to by the generic name, ''[[Moors]]''. The  [[Reconquista]] gained momentum on c. 718, when the Christian Asturians opposed the Moors, the southern march to push out the Muslims continued for three hundred years, so for another four hundred years, only the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula was transformed into a Romance-speaking and Arabic-speaking Muslim land, along with pockets of a large minority of Arabic-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]].

===Reconquest===
{{Main|Reconquista}}
Many of the ousted [[Goths|Gothic]] nobles took refuge in the unconquered north [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. From there, they aimed to reconquer their lands from the Moors; this war of reconquest is known as the [[Reconquista]]. Christian and Muslim kingdoms fought and allied among themselves. The Muslim [[taifa]] kings competed in patronage of the arts, the [[Camino de Santiago]] attracted pilgrims from all Western Europe, and the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jewish population]] set the basis of Sephardi culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

During the Middle Ages, the peninsula housed many small states including the [[Kingdom of Castile]], [[Crown of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre]], [[Kingdom of León]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. The peninsula was part of the [[Almohad Caliphate]] until they were finally uprooted. The last major Muslim stronghold was [[Granada]], which was conquered by a combined Castilian and Aragonese force in 1492. Muslims and Jews throughout the period were variously tolerated or shown intolerance in different Christian kingdoms. However, after the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of Granada]], all Muslims and Jews were ordered to convert to Christianity or face expulsion. Many Jews and Muslims fled to [[North Africa]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while others publicly converted to Christianity and became known respectively as [[Marrano]]s and [[Morisco]]s. However, many of these continued to practice their religion in secret. The Moriscos revolted several times and were ultimately [[expulsion of the Moriscos|forcibly expelled]] from Spain in the early 17th century.

[[Image:Carte historique des Royaumes d'Espagne et Portugal.jpg|thumb|Map of Spain and Portugal, ''Atlas historique'', dated approximately 1705–1739, of H.A. Chatelain.]]

===Post-reconquest===
{{Main|History of Andorra|History of Gibraltar|History of Portugal|History of Spain}}

The small states gradually amalgamated over time, with the exception of Portugal, even if for a brief period (1580–1640) the whole peninsula was united politically under the [[Iberian Union]]. After that point, the modern position was reached and the peninsula now consists of the countries of Spain and Portugal (excluding their islands—the Portuguese [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]] and the Spanish [[Canary Islands]] and [[Balearic Islands]]; and the Spanish [[exclave]]s of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]), [[Andorra]], [[French Cerdagne]] and Gibraltar.

==Geography and geology==
{{Main|Geography of Portugal|Geography of Spain}}
The Iberian Peninsula is the westernmost of the three major southern European peninsulas—the Iberian, [[Italian Peninsula|Italian]], and [[Balkans|Balkan]]. It is bordered on the southeast and east by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and on the north, west, and southwest by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The Pyrenees mountains form the northeast edge of the peninsula, separating it from the rest of Europe. Its southern tip is very close to the northwest coast of Africa, separated from it by the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].

The Iberian Peninsula extends from the southernmost extremity at [[Punta de Tarifa]] ({{Coord|36|00|15|N|5|36|37|W|display=inline}}) to the northernmost extremity at [[Punta de Estaca de Bares]] ({{Coord|43|47|38|N|7|41|17|W|display=inline}}) over a distance between lines of latitude of about {{convert|865|km|mi|abbr=on}} based on a [[Latitude#Degree length|degree length]] of {{convert|111|km|mi|abbr=on}} per degree, and from the westernmost extremity at [[Cabo da Roca]] ({{Coord|38|46|51|N|9|29|54|W|display=inline}}) to the easternmost extremity at [[Cap de Creus]] ({{Coord|42|19|09|N|3|19|19|E|display=inline}}) over a distance between lines of longitude at [[40th parallel north|40° N latitude]] of about {{convert|1155|km|mi|abbr=on}} based on an estimated degree length of about {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} for that latitude. The irregular, roughly octagonal shape of the peninsula contained within this spherical [[Quadrangle (geography)|quadrangle]] was compared to an ox-hide by the geographer [[Strabo]].<ref>III.1.3.</ref>

About three quarters of that rough octagon is the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]], a vast plateau ranging from 610 to 760 m in altitude.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fischer|first=T|year=1920|contribution=The Iberian Peninsula: Spain|editor-last=Mill|editor-first=Hugh Robert|title=The International Geography|publication-place=New York and London|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|pages=368–377|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyUbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA368}}</ref> It is located approximately in the centre, staggered slightly to the east and tilted slightly toward the west (the conventional centre of the Iberian Peninsula has long been considered to be [[Getafe]] just south of [[Madrid]]). It is ringed by mountains and contains the sources of most of the rivers, which find their way through gaps in the mountain barriers on all sides.

===Coastline===
The coastline of the Iberian Peninsula is {{convert|3313|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1660|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the Mediterranean side and {{convert|1653|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the Atlantic side.<ref>These figures sum the figures given in the Wikipedia articles on the geography of Spain and Portugal. Most figures from Internet sources on Spain and Portugal include the coastlines of the islands owned by each country and thus are not a reliable guide to the coastline of the peninsula. Moreover, the length of a coastline may vary significantly depending on where and how it is measured.</ref> The coast has been inundated over time, with sea levels having risen from a minimum of {{convert|115|-|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} lower than today at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) to its current level at 4,000 years [[Before Present|BP]].<ref>{{cite book|page=305|contribution=Evolution of groundwater systems at the European coastline|first=WM|last=Edmunds|author2=K Hinsby |author3=C Marlin |author4=MT Condesso de Melo |author5=M Manyano |author6=R Vaikmae |author7= Y Travi |title=Palaeowaters in Coastal Europe: Evolution of Groundwater Since the Late Pleistocene|editor1-first=W.

At the {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[isobath]], on the edge, the shelf drops off to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book| contribution=Iberian Peninsula – Atlantic Coast|title=An Atlas of Oceanic Internal Solitary Waves| date=February 2004|publisher=Global Ocean Associates|url=http://www.internalwaveatlas.com/Atlas2_PDF/IWAtlas2_Pg087_IberianPeninsula.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref>

The submarine topography of the coastal waters of the Iberian Peninsula has been studied extensively in the process of drilling for oil. Ultimately, the shelf drops into the [[Bay of Biscay]] on the north (an abyss), the Iberian abyssal plain at {{convert|4800|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the west and Tagus abyssal plain to the south. In the north, between the continental shelf and the abyss, is an extension, the Galicia Bank, a plateau also containing the Porto, Vigo and Vasco da Gama [[seamount]]s, creating the Galicia interior basin. The southern border of these features is marked by [[Nazaré Canyon]], splitting the continental shelf and leading directly into the abyss.

===Rivers===
{{Main|List of rivers of Portugal|List of rivers of Spain}}
[[Image:Rios peninsula Iberica-es.png|thumb|Major rivers of the Iberian Peninsula: [[Minho River|Miño / Minho]], [[Douro|Duero / Douro]], [[Tagus|Tajo / Tejo]], [[Guadiana]], [[Guadalquivir]], [[Segura]], [[Júcar|Júcar / Xúquer]] and [[Ebro|Ebro / Ebre]].]]

The major rivers flow through the wide valleys between the mountain systems. These are the [[Ebro]], [[Douro]], [[Tagus]], [[Guadiana]] and [[Guadalquivir]]. All rivers in the Iberian Peninsula are subject to seasonal variations in flow.

The Tagus is the longest river in the peninsula and, like the Douro, flows westwards with its lower course in Portugal.
The Guadiana bends southwards and forms the border between Spain and Portugal in the last stretch of its course.

===Mountains===
[[File:Geological units of the Iberian Peninsula EN.svg|thumb|Major Geologic Units of the Iberian Peninsula]]

The terrain of the Iberian Peninsula is largely [[mountainous]]. The major mountain systems are:
* The [[Pyrenees]] and their foothills, the [[Pre-Pyrenees]], crossing the isthmus of the peninsula so completely as to allow no passage except by mountain road, trail, coastal road or tunnel. [[Aneto]] in the [[Maladeta]] massif, at 3,404 m, is the highest point.
* The [[Cantabrian Mountains]] along the northern coast with the massive [[Picos de Europa]]. [[Torre de Cerredo]], at 2,648 m, is the highest point.
* The [[Galician Massif|Galicia/Trás-os-Montes Massif]] in the Northwest is made up of very old heavily eroded rocks.<ref>[http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/30737 Silurian graptolite biostratigraphy of the Galicia - Tras-os-Montes Zone (Spain and Portugal)]</ref> [[Pena Trevinca]], at 2,127 m, is the highest point.
* The [[Sistema Ibérico]], a complex system at the heart of the Peninsula, in its central/eastern region. It contains a great number of ranges and divides the watershed of the Tagus, Douro and Ebro rivers. [[Moncayo]], at 2,313 m, is the highest point.
* The [[Sistema Central]], dividing the [[Iberian Plateau]] into a northern and a southern half and stretching into Portugal (where the highest point of [[Continental Portugal]] (1,993 m) is located in the [[Serra da Estrela]]). [[Pico Almanzor]] in the [[Sierra de Gredos]] is the highest point, at 2,592 m.
* The [[Montes de Toledo]], which also stretches into Portugal from the [[La Mancha]] natural region at the eastern end. Its highest point, at 1,603 m, is [[La Villuerca]] in the [[Sierra de Villuercas]], [[Extremadura]].
* The [[Sierra Morena]], which divides the watershed of the Guadiana and Guadalquivir rivers. At 1,332 m, [[Bañuela]] is the highest point.
* The [[Baetic System]], which stretches between [[Cádiz]] and Gibraltar and northeast towards [[Alicante Province]]. It is divided into three subsystems:
** [[Prebaetic System]], which begins west of the [[Sierra Sur de Jaén]], reaching the [[Mediterranean Sea]] shores in [[Alicante Province]]. [[La Sagra (peak)|La Sagra]] is the highest point at 2,382 m.
** [[Subbaetic System]], which is in a central position within the Baetic Systems, stretching from [[Cape Trafalgar]] in [[Cádiz Province]] across Andalusia to the [[Region of Murcia]].<ref>Edited by W Gibbons & T Moreno, ''Geology of Spain'', 2002, ISBN 978-1-86239-110-9</ref> The highest point, at {{convert|2027|m|abbr=on}}, is Peña de la Cruz in [[Sierra Arana]].
** [[Penibaetic System]], located in the far southeastern area stretching between Gibraltar across the Mediterranean coastal Andalusian provinces. It includes the highest point in the peninsula, the 3,478 m high [[Mulhacén]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]].<ref>[http://www.spanishnature.com/birds/63-general-information/12-introduction-to-the-birds-of-spain.html?ml=5&mlt=system&tmpl=component Introduction to the Birds of Spain]</ref>

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of the Iberian Peninsula}}

The Iberian Peninsula contains rocks of every geological period from the [[Ediacaran]] to the [[Holocene|Recent]], and almost every kind of rock is represented. World-class [[mineral deposit]]s can also be found there. The core of the Iberian Peninsula consists of a [[Hercynian]] [[craton]]ic block known as the [[Iberian Massif]]. On the northeast, this is bounded by the Pyrenean fold belt, and on the southeast it is bounded by the [[Baetic System]]. These twofold chains are part of the [[Geology of the Alps|Alpine belt]]. To the west, the peninsula is delimited by the continental boundary formed by the [[magma]]-poor opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Hercynian Foldbelt is mostly buried by Mesozoic and Tertiary cover rocks to the east, but nevertheless outcrops through the [[Sistema Ibérico]] and the [[Catalan Mediterranean System]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Portugal|Climate of Spain}}

The Iberian peninsula has two dominant climate types. One of these is the [[oceanic climate]] seen in the Atlantic coastal region resulting in evenly temperatures with relatively cool summers. However, most of Portugal and Spain have a [[mediterranean climate]] with various precipitation and temperatures depending on latitude and position versus the sea. There are also more localized [[semi-arid climate]]s in central Spain, with temperatures resembling a more continental mediterranean climate. In other extreme cases highland alpine climates such as in [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and areas with extremely low precitipation such as the [[Almería]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=6325O&k=and|title=Standard climate values for Almería|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> area can be found. In the Spanish interior the hottest temperatures in Europe are found, with [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] averaging around {{convert|37|C|F}} in July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=5402&k=and|title=Standard climate values for Córdoba|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> The Spanish mediterranean coast usually averages around {{convert|30|C|F}} in summer. In sharp contrast [[A Coruña]] at the northern tip of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] has a summer daytime high average at just below {{convert|23|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1387&k=gal|title=Standard climate values for A Coruña|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> This cool and wet summer climate is replicated throughout most of the northern coastline. Winter temperatures are more consistent throughout the peninsula, although frosts are common in the Spanish interior, even though daytime highs are usually above the freezing point.

Various other notable cities are also present on the peninsula, such as: [[Elche]] (230,354), [[Oviedo]] (225,973), [[Badalona]] (220,977) and [[Terrassa]] (215 678) in Spain; and [[Braga]] (181,874), [[Amadora]] (175,558), [[Coimbra]] (102,455) and [[Setúbal]] (90,640) in Portugal.

==Ecology==

===Forests===
{{Main|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula}}

The woodlands of the Iberian Peninsula are distinct [[ecosystem]]s. Although the various regions are each characterized by distinct vegetation, there are some similarities across the peninsula.

While the borders between these regions are not clearly defined, there is a mutual influence that makes it very hard to establish boundaries and some species find their optimal habitat in the intermediate areas.

===East Atlantic flyway===
The Iberian Peninsula in an important stopover on the East Atlantic [[flyway]] for birds migrating from northern Europe to Africa. For example, [[curlew sandpiper]]s rest in the region of  the [[Bay of Cádiz]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Migration pattern of Curlew Sandpipers Calidris ferruginea on the south-western coastline of the Iberian Peninsula|first=Francisco|last=Hortas|author2=Jordi Figuerols|format=pdf|url=http://www.ebd.csic.es/jordi/Hortas06.pdf|accessdate= 7 December 2008|year=2006|journal=International Wader Studies|volume=19|pages=144–147}}</ref>

In addition to the birds migrating through, some seven million wading birds from the north spend the winter in the estuaries and wetlands of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly at locations on the Atlantic coast. In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] are [[Ría de Arousa]] (a home of [[grey plover]]), Ria de [[Ortigueira]], Ria de Corme and Ria de Laxe. In Portugal, the [[Aveiro Lagoon]] hosts [[Avocet|''Recurvirostra avosetta'']], the [[common ringed plover]], [[grey plover]] and [[little stint]]. [[Ribatejo Province]] on the [[Tagus]] supports [[Avocet|''Recurvirostra arosetta'']], grey plover, [[dunlin]], [[bar-tailed godwit]] and [[common redshank]]. In the [[Sado River|Sado Estuary]] are [[dunlin]], [[Eurasian curlew]], grey plover and [[common redshank]]. The [[Algarve]] hosts [[red knot]], [[common greenshank]] and [[turnstone]]. The [[Guadalquivir Marshes]] region of [[Andalusia]] and the Salinas de [[Cádiz]] are especially rich in wintering wading birds: [[Kentish plover]], common ringed plover, [[sanderling]], and [[black-tailed godwit]] in addition to the others. And finally, the Ebro delta is home to all the species mentioned above.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Jesus|last=Dominguez|title=Distribution of estuarine waders wintering in the Iberian Peninsula in 1978–1982|journal=Wader Study Group Bulletin|year=1990|

==Languages==
{{main|Languages of Iberia}}
{{further|Languages of Andorra|Languages of Gibraltar|Languages of Spain|Languages of Portugal}}

Except for Basque, which is of [[language isolate|unknown origin]], most modern Iberian languages descend from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Throughout history (and pre-history), many different languages have been spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, contributing to the formation and differentiation of the contemporaneous languages of Iberia; however, most of them have become extinct or fallen into disuse. Basque is the only non-Indo-European surviving language in Iberia and Western Europe.

In modern times, Spanish (cf. 30 to 40 million speakers), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (cf. around 10 million speakers), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (cf. around 9 million speakers), [[Galician language|Galician]] (cf. around 3 million speakers) and [[Basque language|Basque]] (cf. around 1 million speakers)<ref>http://www.euskara.euskadi.eus/r59-738/es/contenidos/noticia/inkesta_soziol_2012/es_berria/berria.html</ref> are the most widely spoken languages in the Iberian Peninsula. Spanish and Portuguese have expanded beyond Iberia to the rest of world, becoming [[world language|global languages]].
