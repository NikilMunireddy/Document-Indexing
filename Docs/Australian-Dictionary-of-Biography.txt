The '''''Australian Dictionary of Biography''''' (ADB or AuDB) is a national co-operative enterprise founded and maintained by the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) to produce authoritative biographical articles on eminent people in Australia's history. Initially published in a series of twelve hard-copy volumes between 1966 and 2005, the dictionary has been published online since 2006.

The ADB project has been operating since 1957. Staff are located at the National Centre of Biography in the History Department of the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University. Since its inception, 4,000 authors have contributed to the ADB and its published volumes contain 9,800 scholarly articles on 12,000 individuals.<ref name=ADBabout>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/about-us/ |title=About Us |website=Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=[[Australian National University]] |date= |access-date= }}</ref>

The ADB project should not be confused with the much smaller and older ''[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]]'' by [[Percival Serle]], first published in 1949, nor with the German ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'' (published 1875–1912) which may also be referred to as ADB in English sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?q=Allgemeine+Deutsche+Biographie+%2BADB&btnG=Search+Books|title=Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie +ADB - Google Search |website=Google }}</ref>

==Hardcopy volumes==
To date, the ADB has produced eighteen hard copy volumes of biographical articles on important and representative figures in [[Australian history]], published by [[Melbourne University Press]]. In addition to publishing these works, the ADB makes its primary research material available to the academic community and the public.
