'''''House''''' (also called '''''House, M.D.''''') is an American television [[medical drama]] that originally ran on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network for eight seasons, from November 16, 2004 to May 21, 2012. The show's main character is [[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]), a pain medication-dependent, unconventional, [[misanthropic]] medical genius who leads a team of [[medical diagnosis|diagnosticians]] at the fictional Princeton–Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in [[New Jersey]]. The show's premise originated with [[Paul Attanasio]], while [[David Shore]], who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for the conception of the title character. The show's executive producers included Shore, Attanasio, Attanasio's business partner [[Katie Jacobs]], and film director [[Bryan Singer]]. It was filmed largely in [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]].

House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights. His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss, hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine [[Lisa Cuddy|Dr. Lisa Cuddy]] ([[Lisa Edelstein]]). House's only true friend is [[James Wilson (House)|Dr. James Wilson]] ([[Robert Sean Leonard]]), head of the Department of [[Oncology]]. During the first three seasons, House's diagnostic team consists of [[Robert Chase|Dr. Robert Chase]] ([[Jesse Spencer]]), [[Allison Cameron|Dr. Allison Cameron]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]), and [[Eric Foreman|Dr. Eric Foreman]] ([[Omar Epps]]). At the end of the [[House (season 3)|third season]], this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: [[Thirteen (House)|Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley]] ([[Olivia Wilde]]), [[Chris Taub|Dr. Chris Taub]] ([[Peter Jacobson]]), and [[Lawrence Kutner (House)|Dr. Lawrence Kutner]] ([[Kal Penn]]). Kutner makes an appearance late in [[House (season 5)|season five]] and then reappears in season 8 episode 22. Chase and Cameron continue to appear in different roles at the hospital until early in [[House (season 6)|season six]]. Cameron then departs the hospital, and Chase returns to the diagnostic team. Thirteen takes a leave of absence for most of [[House (season 7)|season seven]], and her position is filled by medical student [[Martha Masters (House)|Martha M. Masters]] ([[Amber Tamblyn]]). Cuddy and Masters depart before [[House (season 8)|season eight]]; Foreman becomes the new Dean of Medicine, while [[Jessica Adams|Dr. Jessica Adams]] ([[Odette Annable]]) and [[Chi Park|Dr. Chi Park]] ([[Charlyne Yi]]) join House's team.

''House'' was among the top 10 shows in the United States from its second through [[House (season 4)|fourth seasons]]. Distributed to 66 countries, ''House'' was the most-watched television program in the world in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gGRhjVWTeAVMws-iEDRJOY3IDH7g |title='House' is the world′s most popular TV show |first=Agence France Presse |last=Eurodata TV Worldwide |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120401043907/http://www.google.com:80/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gGRhjVWTeAVMws-iEDRJOY3IDH7g |archivedate=April 1, 2012 }}</ref> The show received [[List of awards and nominations received by House|numerous awards]], including five [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, two [[Golden Globe Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], and nine [[People's Choice Awards]].

=== Conception ===
In 2004, [[David Shore]] and [[Paul Attanasio]], along with Attanasio's business partner [[Katie Jacobs]], pitched the show (untitled at the time) to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] as a ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]''-style medical detective program,<ref name="macleans">{{cite web|last=Frum |first=Linda |title=Q&A with 'House' creator David Shore |work=[[Maclean's]] |publisher=[[Rogers Communications]] |date=March 14, 2006 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20060320_123370_123370 |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071010052544/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20060320_123370_123370 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 }}</ref> a hospital [[whodunit]] in which the doctors investigated symptoms and their causes.<ref name="Housebuilt">{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Stacey|title=The House That Dave Built|url=http://www.magazine.utoronto.ca/cover-story/the-house-that-dave-built/|journal=University of Toronto Magazine|publisher=University of Toronto|date=March 2008|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref> Attanasio was inspired to develop a medical [[procedural drama]] by ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' column, "Diagnosis", written by physician [[Lisa Sanders]], who is an attending physician at [[Yale-New Haven Hospital]] (YNHH), and [[Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital]] (PPTH) is modeled after this teaching institution.<ref name="Challenpg96">Challen, p. 96.</ref> Fox bought the series, though the network's then-president, [[Gail Berman]], told the creative team, "I want a medical show, but I don't want to see white coats going down the hallway".<ref name="M&Cjacobsinterview">{{cite news|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/features/article_1443308.php |publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]] |author=MacIntyre, April |date=November 17, 2008 |title='House M.D.' interview: Katie Jacobs talks Cuddy, Cameron and House triangle |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090111082226/http://www.monstersandcritics.com:80/smallscreen/features/article_1443308.php |archivedate=January 11, 2009 }}</ref> Jacobs has said that this stipulation was one of the many influences that led to the show's ultimate form.<ref name="M&Cjacobsinterview" />

After Fox picked up the show, it acquired the [[working title]] ''Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain''<ref name="House-Holmes">{{cite news|title=House... and Holmes|date=January 2006|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=BBC Magazines Ltd.|page=57|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705103940/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/|archivedate=2010-07-05}}</ref> ("[[Zebra (medicine)|zebra]]" is [[medical slang]] for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while "circling the drain" refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline).<ref name="fullhouse" /> The original premise of the show was of a team of doctors working together trying to "diagnose the undiagnosable".<ref name="The Concept">{{cite video |people=Jacobs, Katie; Laurie, Hugh; Shore, David; Singer, Bryan |title=[[House (season 1)|House Season One]], The Concept |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal Studios |date=2005}}</ref> Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies.<ref name="The Concept" /> As Shore and the rest of the creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role.<ref name="Variety110eps">{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117999278.html|title=Fox's medical marvel stays on top|author=Werts, Diane|date=January 29, 2009|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> The character was named "House", which was adopted as the show's title, as well.<ref name="House-Holmes" /> Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the [[Pilot (House)|pilot episode]].<ref name="macleans" /> [[Bryan Singer]], who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show".<ref name="Variety110eps" /> Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of [[Berton Roueché]], a staff writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.<ref name="Housebuilt" />

Shore traced the concept for the title character to his experience as a patient at a teaching hospital.<ref name="EWinfo" /> Shore recalled: "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room."<ref name="hulu-developing the concept">{{cite web|author=Shore, David |year=2006 |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/21606/house-house---developing-the-concept#s-p2-st-i1 |title=Developing The Concept |work=[[Hulu.com]] |publisher=[[The Paley Center for Media]] |accessdate=September 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913031621/http://www.hulu.com:80/watch/21606/house-house---developing-the-concept |archivedate=September 13, 2008 }}</ref> A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way.<ref name="int-disability" /> The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this.

=== Opening sequence ===
The opening sequence begins with an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of a head with an image of the boxed "H" from the logo (the international symbol for hospital) in the foreground. This is then overlaid with an image of Dr. House's face taken from the pilot episode with the show's full title appearing across his face. House's head then fades and the show's title is underlined and has the "M.D." appear next to it, producing the entire logo of the show. This was the full extent of the title sequence in the pilot episode.<ref name="pilot">{{cite episode| title = Pilot| episodelink = Pilot_(House)| credits=Writer: Shore, David. Director: Singer, Bryan | network = Fox | series = House| airdate = November 16, 2004| season = 1| number = 1}}</ref> All subsequent episodes contain a longer sequence including the names of the six featured cast members and creator David Shore. Laurie's name appears first, followed by the names of the five other featured cast members in alphabetical order (Edelstein, Epps, Leonard, Morrison, and Spencer, then Shore).<ref name="Paternity">{{cite episode |title=Paternity |episodelink=Paternity_(House) |credits=Writer: Kaplow, Lawrence.

After the show's title fades, an aerial view of PPTH (actually various Princeton University buildings, primarily Frist Campus Center)<ref name="Holtz" /> is followed by a series of images accompanying each member's name; most are shown next to, or superimposed upon, illustrations of the human anatomy. Laurie's name appears next to a model of a human head with the brain exposed; Edelstein's name appears next to a visual effects–produced graphic of an angiogram of the heart. Epps's name is superimposed upon a [[Human rib cage|rib cage]] X-ray; Leonard's name appears on a drawing of the two [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres]] of the brain.<ref name="Paternity" /> The producers originally wanted to include an image of a cane and an image of a Vicodin bottle, but Fox objected. Morrison's title card was thus lacking an image; an aerial shot of rowers on Princeton University's [[Lake Carnegie (New Jersey)|Lake Carnegie]] was finally agreed upon to accompany her name.<ref name="SeasonPass">{{cite news |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2008/12/house-qa-you-li.html |title=''House'' Q&A: 'You live alongside your characters' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |author=Lyford, Kathy |date=December 18, 2008 |accessdate=December 20, 2008}}</ref> Spencer's name appears next to an old-fashioned anatomical drawing of a [[Human vertebral column|spine]].

[[Gregory House]], [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], often construed as a [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] medical genius, heads a team <!-- The head of a team is part of the team except in special cases. If you think that hasn't been made clear by this point, make it clearer by this point, but stop using language that hints "the team" means House's subordinates, to the exclusion of House himself -->of [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosticians]] at the Princeton-Plainsboro [[Teaching hospital|Teaching Hospital]] in [[New Jersey]].<ref name="pilot" /> Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a [[cold open|precredits scene]] set outside the hospital, showing events ending with the onset of the patient's symptoms.<ref name="Season 1 DVD review" /> The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness,<ref name="PopMatters" /><ref name="C42">Challen, p. 42.</ref> which often fail until the patient's condition is critical.<ref name="PopMatters" /> They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed,<ref name="Holtz" /> and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting.<ref name="Season 1 DVD review" /> The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.<ref name="macleans" />

The team employs the [[differential diagnosis]] method,<ref name="C42" /> listing possible [[etiology|etiologies]] on a [[whiteboard]], then eliminating most of them, usually because one of the team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out.<ref>Holtz, p. 3.</ref> Typically, the patient is [[Medical error|misdiagnosed]] at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless;<ref name="C42" /> this usually causes further [[Complication (medicine)|complications]], but—as the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidence—eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly.<ref name="Season 1 DVD review" /> House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character.<ref name="C42" /> Diagnoses range from relatively common to very [[rare disease]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=How "House" Finds all Those Strange Diseases|work=[[New York Post]]|author=Albiniak, Paige|date=May 7, 2006}}</ref>

The team faces many diagnostic difficulties from patients' concealment of symptoms, circumstances, or personal histories, so House frequently proclaims during the team's deliberations, "The patient is lying", or mutters "Everybody lies"; such an assumption guides House's decisions and diagnoses,<ref name="fullhouse" /> and makes the countermeasure of [[burglary|housebreaking]] a routine procedure. Because many of his hypotheses are based on [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanies]] or controversial insights, he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior, who in all but the final season is hospital administrator [[Lisa Cuddy|Dr. Lisa Cuddy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=House calls: TV doctor's bedside manner is atrocious, but if you're sick, he's the one you want|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|author=Duffy, Mike|date=November 15, 2004}}</ref> This is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are [[Medical ethics|ethically]] questionable.

Like all of the hospital's doctors, House is required to treat patients in the facility's [[Convenient care clinic|walk-in clinic]].<ref name="pilot" /><ref>Wilson, p. 78.</ref> His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring [[subplot]], which often serves as the series' [[comic relief]].<ref name="PopMatters" /><ref>Challen, pp. 103, 114; Wilson, pp. 78, 214–215.</ref> During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments.<ref name="pilot" /> However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses.<ref name="FactCheckEd" /> Analogies with some of the simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.<ref name="Season 1 DVD review" /><ref>Challen, p. 103.</ref>

''USA Today'' praised Laurie's performance and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating "a carry-over from last season's brilliant finale, ''House'' is firmly in the forefront.

{{Quote box|width=25em|quote="''House'' has redefined the medical television show.
