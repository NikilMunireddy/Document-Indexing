'''Victoria''' (abbreviated as '''Vic''') is a [[States and territories of Australia|state]] in the south-east of [[Australia]]. Victoria is Australia's most densely populated state and its second-most populous state overall. Most of its population is concentrated in the area surrounding [[Port Phillip Bay]], which includes the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, [[Melbourne]], which is Australia's second-largest city. Geographically the smallest state on the Australian mainland, Victoria is bordered by [[Bass Strait]] and [[Tasmania]] to the south,<ref group="note">Due to a previous surveying error, Victoria and Tasmania share a land border on [[Boundary Islet]]. At {{convert|85|m|yd}} in length, the border is the smallest between any two Australian states or territories.</ref> [[New South Wales]] to the north, the [[Tasman Sea]] to the east, and [[South Australia]] to the west.

Prior to [[European settlement of Australia|European settlement]], the area now constituting Victoria was inhabited by a large number of [[Victorian Aborigines|Aboriginal peoples]], collectively known as the [[Koori]]. With [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] having claimed the entire [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]] east of the [[135th meridian east]] in 1788, Victoria was included in the wider colony of New South Wales. The first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at [[Sullivan Bay, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]], and much of what is now Victoria was included in the [[Port Phillip District]] in 1836, an administrative division of New South Wales. Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851, and achieved [[self-government]] in 1855.<ref>[http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/publications/fact-sheets/2333-fact-sheet-i1-victorias-parliamentary-history Victoria's Parliamentary History (Parliament of Victoria website)] {{wayback|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/publications/fact-sheets/2333-fact-sheet-i1-victorias-parliamentary-history |date=20130309135053 |df=y }}</ref> The [[Victorian gold rush]] in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony, and by the [[Federation of Australia]] in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in [[Australasia]]. Melbourne also served as capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927, with the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] meeting in Melbourne's [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]] and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne.

Politically, Victoria has 37 seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] and 12 seats in the [[Senate (Australia)|Australian Senate]]. At state level, the [[Parliament of Victoria]] consists of the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]) and the [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (the [[upper house]]). Victoria is currently governed by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], with [[Daniel Andrews]] the current Premier. The [[Governors of the Australian states|personal representative]] of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]] in the state is the [[Governor of Victoria]], currently [[Linda Dessau]]. [[Local government in Victoria|Local government]] is concentrated in [[Local government areas of Victoria|79 municipal districts]], including 33 cities, although a number of [[unincorporated areas]] still exist, which are administered directly by the state.

The economy of Victoria is highly diversified: service sectors including financial and property services, health, education, wholesale, retail, hospitality and manufacturing constitute the majority of employment. Victoria's total [[List of Australian states and territories by gross state product|gross state product]] (GSP) is ranked second in Australia, although Victoria is ranked fourth in terms of GSP [[per capita]] because of its limited mining activity. Culturally, Melbourne is home to a number of museums, art galleries and theatres and is also described as the "sporting capital of Australia". The [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] is the largest stadium in Australia, and the host of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. The ground is also considered the "spiritual home" of [[Cricket in Australia|Australian cricket]] and [[Australian rules football]], and hosts the [[AFL Grand Final|grand final]] of the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) each year, drawing crowds of approximately 100,000. Victoria includes [[List of universities in Australia|eight public universities]], with the oldest, the [[University of Melbourne]], having been founded in 1853.

==Etymology==
Victoria, like [[Queensland]], was named after [[Queen Victoria]], who had been on the British throne for 14 years when the colony was established in 1851.<ref name = "RecordOffice">{{Cite web | author = House of Lords Record Office  | title = An Act for the better Government of Her Majesty's Australian Colonies (1850) | url = http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-76.html | accessdate = 2016-01-01}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Victoria}}
After the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788, Australia was divided into an eastern half named New South Wales and a western half named [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], under the [[Administration (government)|administration]] of the colonial government in Sydney. The first European settlement in the area later known as Victoria was established in October 1803 under Lieutenant-Governor [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]] at [[Sullivan Bay, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]] on [[Port Phillip]]. It consisted of 402 people (5 Government officials, 9 officers of marines, 2 drummers, and 39 privates, 5 soldiers' wives, and a child, 307 convicts, 17 convicts' wives, and 7 children).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4890461 |title=CORRESPONDENCE. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889 – 1931)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=14 October 1901 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> They had been sent from England in [[HMS Calcutta (1795)|HMS ''Calcutta'']] under the command of Captain [[Daniel Woodriff]], principally out of fear that the French, who had been exploring the area, might establish their own settlement and thereby challenge British rights to the continent.

In the year 1826 Colonel Stewart, Captain S. Wright, and Lieutenant Burchell were sent in H.M.S. Fly (Captain Wetherall) and the brigs ''Dragon'' and ''Amity'', took a number of convicts and a small force composed of detachments of the 3rd and 93rd regiments. The expedition landed at Settlement Point (now [[Corinella, Victoria|Corinella]]), on the eastern side of the bay, which was the headquarters until the abandonment of Western Port at the insistence of Governor Darling about twelve months afterwards.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65840366 |title=ATTEMPTED COLONISATION AT WESTERN PORT. |newspaper=[[Mornington Standard|Mornington Standard (Vic. : 1889 – 1908)]] |location=Vic. |date=12 August 1905 |accessdate=24 January 2012 |page=5 Edition: MORNING. |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>[http://www.visitcorinella.com/topic/index.html Corinella – Victoria's Best Kept Secret<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Victoria's next settlement was at [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]], on the south west coast of what is now Victoria. [[Edward Henty]] settled Portland Bay in 1834.<ref>James Boyce (2011) 1835: The Founding of Melbourne and the Conquest of Australia, Black Inc, p.12</ref>

Melbourne was founded in 1835 by [[John Batman]], who set up a base in [[Indented Head]], and [[John Pascoe Fawkner]]. From settlement the region around Melbourne was known as the Port Phillip District, a separately administered part of New South Wales. Shortly after the site now known as Geelong was surveyed by Assistant Surveyor W. H. Smythe, three weeks after Melbourne. And in 1838 [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]] was officially declared a town, despite earlier white settlements dating back to 1826.

On 1 July 1851, writs were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute independence of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4097366 |title=Anniversary of the Week. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 – 1956)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=4 July 1930 |accessdate=26 January 2012 |page=2 Supplement: Saturday Camera Supplement |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Days later, still in 1851 gold was discovered near [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], and subsequently at [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]]. Later discoveries occurred at many sites across Victoria. This triggered one of the [[Victorian gold rush|largest gold rushes]] the world has ever seen. The colony grew rapidly in both population and economic power. In ten years the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. All sorts of gold records were produced including the "richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world" and the [[Welcome Stranger|largest gold nugget]]. Victoria produced in the decade 1851–1860 20 million ounces of gold, one third of the world's output{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.

Immigrants arrived from all over the world to search for gold, especially from Ireland and China. Many Chinese miners worked in Victoria, and their legacy is particularly strong in Bendigo and its environs. Although there was some racism directed at them, there was not the level of anti-Chinese violence that was seen at the [[Lambing Flat riots]] in New South Wales. However, there was a [[Buckland Riot|riot at Buckland Valley]] near [[Bright, Victoria|Bright]] in 1857. Conditions on the gold fields were cramped and unsanitary; an outbreak of typhoid at Buckland Valley in 1854 killed over 1,000 miners.

In 1854 at Ballarat there was an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria by miners protesting against [[Miner's Licence|mining taxes]] (the "[[Eureka Stockade]]"). This was crushed by British troops, but the discontents prompted colonial authorities to reform the administration (particularly reducing the hated mining licence fees) and extend the franchise. Within a short time, the Imperial Parliament granted Victoria responsible government with the passage of the Colony of Victoria Act 1855. Some of the leaders of the Eureka rebellion went on to become members of the Victorian Parliament.

The first foreign military action by the colony of Victoria was to send troops and a warship to [[New Zealand]] as part of the [[New Zealand land wars|Māori Wars]]. Troops from New South Wales had previously participated in the [[Crimean War]].

In 1901 Victoria became a state in the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. As a result of the gold rush, Melbourne had by then become the financial centre of Australia and New Zealand. Between 1901 and 1927, Melbourne was the capital of Australia while [[Canberra]] was under construction. It was also the largest city in Australia at the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

===Parliament===
{{Main|Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Legislative Assembly|Victorian Legislative Council}}

Victoria has a parliamentary form of government based on the [[Westminster System]]. Legislative power resides in the Parliament consisting of the Governor (the representative of the Queen), the executive (the Government), and two legislative chambers. The [[Parliament of Victoria]] consists of the lower house [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], the upper house [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] and the [[Queen of Australia]].

Eighty-eight members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member electorates.

In November 2006, the Victorian Legislative Council elections were held under a new multi-member proportional representation system. The State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates with each electorate represented by five representatives elected by [[Single Transferable Vote]]. The total number of upper house members was reduced from 44 to 40 and their term of office is now the same as the lower house members—four years. Elections for the Victorian Parliament are now fixed and occur in November every four years. Prior to the 2006 election, the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected to eight-year terms from 22 two-member electorates.

===Premier and cabinet===
The [[Premier of Victoria]] is the leader of the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Premier is the public face of government and, with cabinet, sets the legislative and political agenda. Cabinet consists of representatives elected to either house of parliament. It is responsible for managing areas of government that are not exclusively the Commonwealth's, by the [[Australian Constitution]], such as education, health and law enforcement. The current Premier of Victoria is [[Daniel Andrews]].

===Governor===
{{Main|Governors of Victoria}}
Executive authority is vested in the [[Governor of Victoria]] who represents and is appointed by [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The post is usually filled by a retired prominent Victorian. The governor acts on the advice of the premier and cabinet. The current Governor of Victoria is [[Linda Dessau]].

===Constitution===
Victoria has a written constitution enacted in 1975,<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca1975188/ CONSTITUTION ACT 1975]</ref> but based on the 1855 colonial constitution, passed by the United Kingdom Parliament as the ''Victoria Constitution Act 1855'', which establishes the Parliament as the state's law-making body for matters coming under state responsibility. The Victorian Constitution can be amended by the Parliament of Victoria, except for certain "entrenched" provisions that require either an absolute majority in both houses, a three-fifths majority in both houses, or the approval of the Victorian people in a referendum, depending on the provision.

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Victoria}}
Victorians, and Melburnians in particular, are said to be "more progressive than other Australians", and although "most Australians support gay marriage", it is supported "nowhere more strongly than in Victoria." At the republic referendum in 1999, the state with the highest ''yes'' vote was Victoria. Victorians are also said to be "generally socially progressive, supportive of multiculturalism, wary of extremes of any kind."<ref>{{cite news |title=Welcome to Victoria, the progressive state |author=Gay Alcorn |url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/welcome-to-victoria-the-progressive-state-20130509-2jak0.html#ixzz2gYTfr55q |newspaper=The Age |date=10 May 2013 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}</ref>

Premier [[Daniel Andrews]] leads the [[Australian Labor Party]] that won the [[Victorian state election, 2014|November 2014 Victorian state election]].

The centre-left [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), the centre-right [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the rural-based [[National Party of Australia]], and the environmentalist [[Australian Greens]] are Victoria's main political parties. Traditionally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne's working class western and northern suburbs, and the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. The Liberals' main support lies in Melbourne's more affluent eastern and outer suburbs, and some rural and regional centres. The Nationals are strongest in Victoria's North Western and Eastern rural regional areas. The Greens, who won their first lower house seats in 2014, are strongest in inner Melbourne.

===Federal government===
Victorian voters elect 49 representatives to the [[Parliament of Australia]], including 37 members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 12 members of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. Since 2013, the ALP has held 19 Victorian house seats, the Liberals 14, the Nationals two, the Greens one, and one held by an Independent. As of 1 July 2014, the Liberals have held three senate seats, the Nationals one, the ALP four, the Greens two, and the Democratic Labor Party one.

===Local government===
{{Main|Local government areas of Victoria}}
Victoria is incorporated into 79 municipalities for the purposes of local government, including 39 shires, 32 cities, seven rural cities and one borough. Shire and city councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Victorian parliament, such as city planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.<ref>Victorian Parliamentary Library, Department of Victorian Communities, Australian Electoral Commission</ref>

[[File:Melbourne skyline.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Melbourne, the state capital, is home to more than three in four Victorians.]]

The 2011 Australian census reported that Victoria had 5,354,042 people resident at the time of the census.<ref>{{Census 2011 AUS|id=2|name=Victoria|accessdate=12 February 2013|quick=on}}</ref> The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] estimates that the population may well reach 7.2&nbsp;million by 2050.

Victoria's founding [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] population has been supplemented by successive waves of [[Immigration to Australia|migrants]] from southern and eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and, most recently, the [[Horn of Africa]] and the Middle East. Victoria's population is ageing in proportion with the average of the remainder of the Australian population.<!--What does the last sentence really mean? Woolly.-->

About 72% of Victorians are Australian-born. This figure falls to around 66% in Melbourne but rises to higher than 95% in some rural areas in the north west of the state. Around two-thirds of Victorians claim Australian, Scottish, English or Irish ancestry. Less than 1% of Victorians identify themselves as [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]]. The largest groups of people born outside Australia came from the British Isles, China, [[Italian Australian|Italy]], [[Vietnamese Australian|Vietnam]], [[Greek Australian|Greece]] and New Zealand.

More than 75% of Victorians live in Melbourne, located in the state's south.

Victoria is Australia's most urbanised state: nearly 90% of residents living in cities and towns. State Government efforts to decentralise population have included an official campaign run since 2003 to encourage Victorians to settle in regional areas,<ref>[http://www.provincialvictoria.vic.gov.au/about.aspx Provincial Victoria – About<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{wayback|url=http://www.provincialvictoria.vic.gov.au/about.aspx |date=20100426113502 |df=y }}</ref> however Melbourne continues to rapidly outpace these areas in terms of population growth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pressure-grows-as-melbourne-rockets-to-4-million-20090423-agt5.html |location=Australia |work=The Age | title=Pressure grows as Melbourne rockets to 4 million | first=Tim | last=Colebatch | date=24 April 2009}}</ref>

===Age structure and fertility===

==Education==

{{Main|Education in Victoria}}

===Primary and secondary===

Victoria's [[Public school (government funded)|state school]] system dates back to 1872, when the colonial government legislated to make schooling both free and compulsory. The state's public secondary school system began in 1905. Before then, only private secondary schooling was available. Today, a Victorian school education consists of seven years of primary schooling (including one preparatory year) and six years of secondary schooling.

The final years of secondary school are optional for children aged over 17. Victorian children generally begin school at age five or six. On completing secondary school, students earn the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]]. Students who successfully complete their secondary education also receive a tertiary entrance ranking, or [[ATAR]] score, to determine university admittance.

Victorian schools are either publicly or privately funded. Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the [[Government of Victoria#Department of Education (DoE)|Victoria Department of Education]] [http://www.education.vic.gov.au/]. Students do not pay tuition fees, but some extra costs are levied. Private fee-paying schools include parish schools run by the Roman Catholic Church and independent schools similar to British public schools. Independent schools are usually affiliated with Protestant churches. Victoria also has several private Jewish and Islamic primary and secondary schools. Private schools also receive some public funding. All schools must comply with government-set curriculum standards. In addition, Victoria has four government [[selective school]]s, [[Melbourne High School]] for boys, [[MacRobertson Girls' High School]] for girls, the coeducational schools [[John Monash Science School]], [[Nossal High School]] and [[Suzanne Cory High School]], and The Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School. Students at these schools are exclusively admitted on the basis of an academic selective entry test.

As of August 2010, Victoria had 1,548 public schools, 489 Catholic schools and 214 independent schools. Just under 540,800 students were enrolled in public schools, and just over 311,800 in private schools. Over 61 per cent of private students attend Catholic schools. More than 462,000 students were enrolled in primary schools and more than 390,000 in secondary schools. Retention rates for the final two years of secondary school were 77 per cent for public school students and 90 per cent for private school students. Victoria has about 63,519 full-time teachers.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4221.0 4221.0 Schools, Australia 2010], Australian Bureau of Statistics, 17 March 2011.</ref>

===Tertiary education===

[[File:Melbourne University south lawn.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[University of Melbourne]], ranked 1st in Australia and in the Southern Hemisphere, is Victoria's oldest university.]]
Victoria has [[List of universities in Australia#Victoria|nine universities]]. The first to offer degrees, the [[University of Melbourne]], enrolled its first student in 1855. The largest, [[Monash University]], has an enrolment of nearly 56,000 students—more than any other Australian university.

The number of students enrolled in Victorian universities was 241,755 at 2004, an increase of 2% on the previous year. International students made up 30% of enrolments and account for the highest percentage of pre-paid university tuition fees. The largest number of enrolments were recorded in the fields of business, administration and economics, with nearly a third of all students, followed by arts, humanities, and social science, with 20% of enrolments.

Victoria has 18 government-run institutions of “technical and further education” ([[TAFE#Victoria|TAFE]]). The first vocational institution in the state was the Melbourne Mechanics' Institute (established in 1839), which is now the [[Athenaeum, Melbourne|Melbourne Athenaeum]]. More than 1,000 adult education organisations are registered to provide recognised TAFE programs. In 2004, there were about 480,700 students enrolled in vocational education programs in the state.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics, Department of Education and Training (Victoria), Department of Education, Science and Training (Commonwealth), National Centre for Vocational Education Research</ref>

[[File:State Library at Night.jpg|thumb|230px|The State Library of Victoria forecourt]]

===Libraries===

The [[State Library of Victoria]] is the State's research and reference library. It is responsible for collecting and preserving Victoria's documentary heritage and making it available through a range of services and programs. Material in the collection includes books, newspapers, magazines, journals, manuscripts, maps, pictures, objects, sound and video recordings and databases.

In addition, [[Local Government Areas of Victoria|local governments]] maintain local lending libraries, typically with multiple branches in their respective municipal areas.

The state of Victoria is the second largest economy in Australia after New South Wales, accounting for a quarter of the nation's gross domestic product. The total [[gross state product]] (GSP) at current prices for Victoria was at just over A$293&nbsp;billion, with a GSP per capita of A$52,872. The economy grew by 2.0 per cent in 2010, less than the Australian average of 2.3 per cent.

Finance, insurance and property services form Victoria's largest income producing sector, while the community, social and personal services sector is the state's biggest employer. Despite the shift towards service industries, the manufacturing sector remains Victoria's single largest employer and income producer.

===Agriculture===

{{update|date=February 2014}}
{{see also|Agriculture in Australia}}
[[File:Victorian stand in 1867.jpg|thumb|left|Victoria's stand at the Paris ''Exhibition Universal'' of 1867, showing bales of wool]]
During 2003–04, the gross value of Victorian agricultural production increased by 17% to $8.7&nbsp;billion. This represented 24% of national agricultural production total gross value. As of 2004, an estimated 32,463 farms occupied around 136,000 square kilometres (52,500&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of Victorian land. This comprises more than 60% of the state's total land surface. Victorian farms range from small horticultural outfits to large-scale livestock and grain productions. A quarter of farmland is used to grow consumable crops.

More than 26,000 square kilometres (10,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of Victorian farmland are sown for grain, mostly in the state's west. More than 50% of this area is sown for wheat, 33% for barley and 7% for oats. A further 6,000 square kilometres (2,300&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is sown for hay. In 2003–04, Victorian farmers produced more than 3 million tonnes of wheat and 2&nbsp;million tonnes of barley. Victorian farms produce nearly 90% of Australian pears and third of apples. It is also a leader in stone fruit production. The main vegetable crops include asparagus, broccoli, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes. Last year, 121,200 tonnes of pears and 270,000 tonnes of tomatoes were produced.

More than 14&nbsp;million sheep and 5&nbsp;million lambs graze over 10% of Victorian farms, mostly in the state's north and west. In 2004, nearly 10&nbsp;million lambs and sheep were slaughtered for local consumption and export. Victoria also exports live sheep to the Middle East for meat and to the rest of the world for breeding. More than 108,000 tonnes of wool clip was also produced—one-fifth of the Australian total.

Victoria is the centre of dairy farming in Australia. It is home to 60% of Australia's 3&nbsp;million dairy cattle and produces nearly two-thirds of the nation's milk, almost 6.4&nbsp;billion litres. The state also has 2.4&nbsp;million beef cattle, with more than 2.2&nbsp;million cattle and calves slaughtered each year. In 2003–04, Victorian commercial fishing crews and aquaculture industry produced 11,634 tonnes of seafood valued at nearly A$109&nbsp;million. Blacklipped [[abalone]] is the mainstay of the catch, bringing in A$46&nbsp;million, followed by southern [[spiny lobster|rock lobster]] worth A$13.7&nbsp;million. Most abalone and rock lobster is exported to Asia.

===Manufacturing===

Victoria has a diverse range of manufacturing enterprises and Melbourne is Victoria's (and Australia's) most important industrial city, followed by [[Geelong]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Additionally, energy production has aided industrial growth in the [[Latrobe Valley]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Machinery and equipment manufacturing is the state's most valuable manufacturing activity, followed by food and beverage products, petrochemicals and chemicals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} More than 15% of Victorian workers, are employed directly in manufacturing, the highest percentage in Australia.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The state is marginally behind New South Wales in the total value of manufacturing output.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Prominent manufacturing plants in the state include the [[Portland aluminium smelter|Portland]] and [[Point Henry smelter|Point Henry]] aluminium smelters, owned by [[Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals|Alcoa]]; oil refineries at [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]] and [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]]; a major petrochemical facility at [[Laverton, Victoria|Laverton]]; and Victorian-based [[CSL Limited|CSL]], a global biotechnology company that produces vaccines and plasma products, among others. Victoria also plays an important role in providing goods for the [[Defence industry of Victoria|defence industry]].

Historically, Victoria has been the base for the manufacturing plants of the major car brands [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]], [[Toyota Australia|Toyota]] and [[Holden]]; however, closure announcements by all three companies in the 21st century will mean that Australia will no longer be a base for the global car industry, with Toyota's statement in February 2014 outlining a closure year of 2017. Holden's announcement occurred in May 2013, followed by Ford's decision in December of the same year (Ford's Victorian plants—in Broadmeadows and Geelong—will close in October 2016).<ref>{{cite news|title=South Australia stunned as GM announces Holden's closure in Adelaide in 2017|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/holden-announces-it-will-stop-producing-cars-in-australia-leading-to-the-loss-of-2900-jobs/story-fnda1bsz-1226780247370|accessdate=12 February 2014|newspaper=News.com.au|date=12 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ford closure sends shockwave through manufacturing industry|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-23/ford-closure-sends-shockwave-through-manufacturing-industry/4708584|accessdate=12 February 2014|newspaper=ABC News|date=24 May 2013}}</ref>

===Mining===

[[File:Yallourn-w-power-station-australia.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Yallourn Power Station]] in the Latrobe Valley]]
{{See also|Energy in Victoria}}
Mining in Victoria contributes around A$3&nbsp;billion to the gross state product (~1%) but employs less than 1% of workers. The Victorian mining industry is concentrated on energy producing minerals, with [[brown coal]], petroleum and [[natural gas|gas]] accounting for nearly 90% of local production. The oil and gas industries are centred off the coast of [[Gippsland]] in the state's east, while brown coal mining and power generation is based in the [[Latrobe Valley]].

In the 2005/2006 fiscal year, the average gas production was over {{convert|700|Mcuft|m3}} per day (M cuft/d) and represented 18% of the total national gas sales, with demand growing at 2% per year.<ref name="macrabbit">{{Wayback |date=20080719055505 |url=http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/DPI/nrenmp.nsf/childdocs/-56D4D5E9AEF563E84A256A800011E5D6?open |title=Department of Primary Industries: Oil and Gas }}</ref>

In 1985, oil production from the offshore Gippsland Basin peaked to an annual average of {{convert|450000|oilbbl|m3}} per day. In 2005–2006, the average daily oil production declined to {{convert|83000|oilbbl|m3|abbr=on}}/d, but despite the decline Victoria still produces almost 19.5% of crude oil in Australia.<ref name="macrabbit" />

[[Brown coal]] is Victoria's leading mineral, with 66 million tonnes mined each year for electricity generation in the Latrobe Valley, Gippsland.<ref>[http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/dc057c1016e548b4ca256c470025ff88/B43CD5ECE4E63E4BCA256DEA00053A0E?opendocument Australian Bureau of Statistics: Year Book Australia, 2004 – Profile of major commodities]</ref> The region is home to the world's largest known reserves of brown coal.

Despite being the historic centre of Australia's gold rush, Victoria today contributes a mere 1% of national gold production. Victoria also produces limited amounts of [[gypsum]] and [[kaolin]].

===Service industry===

The service industries sector is the fastest growing component of the Victorian economy. It includes the wide range of activities generally classified as community, social and personal services; finances, insurance and property services, government services, transportation and communication, and wholesale and retail trade. Most service industries are located in Melbourne and the state's larger regional centres.

As of 2004–05, service industries employed nearly three-quarters of Victorian workers and generated three-quarters of the state's GSP. Finance, insurance and property services, as a group, provide a larger share of GSP than any other economic activity in Victoria. More than a quarter of Victorian workers are employed by the community, social and personal services sector.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics, Department of Primary Industries</ref>

Victoria's northern border is the southern bank of the [[Murray River]]. This precise definition was not established until 1980, when a ruling by [[Ninian Stephen|Justice Ninian Stephen]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] settled the question as to which state had jurisdiction in the unlawful death of a man on an island in the middle of the river. The ruling clarified that no part of the watercourse is in Victoria.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/national/stateless-old-jack-beyond-all-borders-20120413-1wyvj.html "Stateless old Jack, beyond all borders", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 14 April 2012].

Victoria contains many topographically, geologically and climatically diverse areas, ranging from the wet, [[temperate]] climate of [[Gippsland]] in the southeast to the snow-covered [[Victorian Alps|Victorian alpine areas]] which rise to almost {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with [[Mount Bogong]] the highest peak at {{convert|1,986|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are extensive semi-arid plains to the west and northwest. There is an extensive series of river systems in Victoria. Most notable is the [[Murray River]] system. Other rivers include: [[Ovens River]], [[Goulburn River, Victoria|Goulburn River]], [[Patterson River]], [[King River, Victoria|King River]], [[Campaspe River]], [[Loddon River]], [[Wimmera River]], [[Elgin River]], [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]], [[Thomson River, Victoria|Thomson River]], [[Snowy River]], [[Latrobe River]], [[Yarra River]], [[Maribyrnong River]], [[Mitta River]], Hopkins River, Merri River and [[Kiewa River]]. The state symbols include the [[pink heath]] (state flower), [[Leadbeater's possum]] (state animal) and the [[helmeted honeyeater]] (state bird).

The state's capital, Melbourne, contains about 70% of the state's population and dominates its economy, media, and culture. For other cities and towns, see [[list of localities (Victoria)]] and [[local government areas of Victoria]].

{{Commons category|Climate diagrams of Victoria}}

Victoria has a varied climate despite its small size. It ranges from semi-arid temperate with hot summers in the north-west, to temperate and cool along the coast. Victoria's main land feature, the Great Dividing Range, produces a cooler, mountain climate in the centre of the state. Winters along the coast of the state, particularly around [[Melbourne]], are relatively mild (''see chart at right)''.

Victoria's southernmost position on the Australian mainland means it is cooler and wetter than other mainland states and territories. The coastal plain south of the Great Dividing Range has Victoria's mildest climate. Air from the [[Southern Ocean]] helps reduce the heat of summer and the cold of winter. Melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region. The [[autumn]] months of April/May are mild and bring some of Australia's colourful [[deciduous tree|foliage]] across many parts of the state.

[[The Mallee]] and upper [[Wimmera]] are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby semi-deserts. Average temperatures exceed {{convert|32|°C|0}} during summer and {{convert|15|C|F}} in winter. Except at cool mountain elevations, the inland monthly temperatures are {{convert|2|-|7|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer than around Melbourne (see chart). Victoria's highest maximum temperature since World War II, of {{convert|48.8|C|F}} was recorded in [[Hopetoun, Victoria|Hopetoun]] on 7 February 2009, during the [[Early 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave|2009 southeastern Australia heat wave]].<ref name="weatherrecords">{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf|title=Rainfall and Temperature Records: National|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|accessdate=14 November 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>

The Victorian Alps in the northeast are the coldest part of Victoria. The Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system extending east-west through the centre of Victoria. Average temperatures are less than {{convert|9|C|F|0}} in winter and below {{convert|0|C|F|0}} in the highest parts of the ranges. The state's lowest minimum temperature of {{convert|−11.7|°C|1}} was recorded at [[Omeo, Victoria|Omeo]] on 13 June 1965, and again at [[Falls Creek, Victoria|Falls Creek]] on 3 July 1970.<ref name="weatherrecords"/>  Temperature extremes for the state are listed in the table below:

====Rainfall====

Victoria is the wettest Australian state after [[Tasmania]]. Rainfall in Victoria increases from south to north, with higher averages in areas of high altitude. Mean annual rainfall exceeds {{convert|1800|mm|in|abbr=off}} in some parts of the northeast but is less than {{convert|280|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the Mallee.

Rain is heaviest in the [[Otway Ranges]] and Gippsland in southern Victoria and in the mountainous northeast. Snow generally falls only in the mountains and hills in the centre of the state. Rain falls most frequently in winter, but summer precipitation is heavier. Rainfall is most reliable in Gippsland and the [[Western District, Victoria|Western District]], making them both leading farming areas. Victoria's highest recorded daily rainfall was {{convert|375|mm|in|abbr=on}} at Tanybryn in the Otway Ranges on 22 March 1983.<ref name="weatherrecords"/>

==Transport==

{{See also|Transport in Melbourne|Rail transport in Victoria}}
Victoria has the highest population density in any state in Australia, with population centres spread out over most of the state; only the far northwest and the [[Victorian Alps]] lack permanent settlement.

The [[Road transport in Victoria|Victorian road network]] services the population centres, with highways generally radiating from Melbourne and other major cities and rural centres with secondary roads interconnecting the highways to each other. Many of the highways are built to freeway standard ("M"&nbsp;freeways), while most are generally sealed and of reasonable quality.

[[Rail transport in Victoria]] is provided by several private and public railway operators who operate over government-owned lines. Major operators include: [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] which runs an extensive, electrified, passenger system throughout Melbourne and suburbs; [[V/Line]] which is now owned by the Victorian Government, operates a concentrated service to major regional centres, as well as long distance services on other lines; [[Pacific National]], [[CFCL Australia]] which operate freight services; [[Great Southern Rail (Australia)|Great Southern Rail]] which operates ''[[The Overland]]'' Melbourne—Adelaide; and [[NSW TrainLink]] which operates [[New South Wales XPT|XPTs]] Melbourne—Sydney.

There are also several smaller freight operators and numerous tourist railways operating over lines which were once parts of a state-owned system. Victorian lines mainly use the {{convert|5|ft|3|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Victorian broad gauge|broad gauge]]. However, the interstate trunk routes, as well as a number of branch lines in the west of the state have been converted to {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[standard gauge]]. Two tourist railways operate over {{convert|2|ft|6|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways|narrow gauge]] lines, which are the remnants of five formerly government-owned lines which were built in mountainous areas.

Melbourne has the world's largest [[Trams in Melbourne|tram network]],<ref>DoI (2008). [http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/DOIElect.nsf/alldocs/1173456893D78FD4CA25741A000461EE/$FILE/Investing_in_Transport_East_West-Chapter03.pdf]. Retrieved 28 April 2008. {{Dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> currently operated by [[Yarra Trams]]. As well as being a popular form of public transport, over the last few decades trams have become one of Melbourne's major tourist attractions. There are also tourist trams operating over portions of the former [[Ballarat Tramway Museum|Ballarat]] and Bendigo systems. There are also tramway museums at [[Tramway Museum Society Of Victoria|Bylands]] and Haddon.

[[Melbourne Airport]] is the major domestic and international gateway for the state. [[Avalon Airport]] is the state's second busiest airport, which complements [[Essendon Airport|Essendon]] and [[Moorabbin Airport]]s to see the remainder of Melbourne's air traffic. [[Hamilton Airport (Australia)|Hamilton Airport]], [[Mildura Airport]], [[Mount Hotham]] and [[Portland Airport (Australia)|Portland Airport]] are the remaining airports with scheduled domestic flights. There are no fewer than 27 [[List of airports in Australia|other airports]] in the state with no scheduled flights.

The [[Port of Melbourne]] is the largest port for containerised and general cargo in Australia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/798c8b072d117a01ca256c8c0019bb01/1b374a6d8cae09e9ca2571cb0003c23a!OpenDocument |title=DoI media release – 'Government outlines vision for Port of Melbourne Freight Hub' – 14 August 2006 |accessdate=26 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070917095230/http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/798c8b072d117a01ca256c8c0019bb01/1b374a6d8cae09e9ca2571cb0003c23a!OpenDocument |archivedate=17 September 2007 }}</ref> and is located in Melbourne on the mouth of the [[Yarra River]], which is at the head of [[Port Phillip]]. Additional seaports are at [[Westernport]], [[Port of Geelong|Geelong]], and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]].

As of October 2013, smoking tobacco is prohibited in the sheltered areas of train stations, and tram and bus stops—between 2012 and 2013, 2002 people were issued with infringement notices. The state government announced a plan in October 2013 to prohibit smoking on all Victorian railway station platforms and raised tram stops.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vic transport smoking bans to be extended|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/vic-transport-smoking-bans-to-be-extended/story-fn3dxiwe-1226739043065?from=public_rss&utm_source=The%20Australian&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=editorial&net_sub_uid=44933799|accessdate=14 October 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=13 October 2013|author=AAP}}</ref>

==Utilities==

===Energy===

Victoria's major utilities include a collection of brown-coal-fired power stations, particularly in the Latrobe Valley. One of these is [[Hazelwood Power Station]], which is number&nbsp;1 in the worldwide [[List of least carbon efficient power stations]].

===Water===

Victoria's water infrastructure includes a series of dams and reservoirs, predominantly in Central Victoria, that hold and collect water for much of the state. The water collected is of a very high quality and requires little chlorination treatment, giving the water a taste more like water collected in a rainwater tank. In regional areas however, such as in the west of the state, chlorination levels are much higher.

The Victorian Water Grid consists of a number of new connections and pipelines being built across the State. This allows water to be moved around Victoria to where it is needed most and reduces the impact of localised droughts in an era thought to be influenced by climate change. Major projects already completed as part of the Grid include the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline and the Goldfields Superpipe.<ref>"Department of Sustainability & Environment, "Expansion of the Water Grid", http://www.ourwater.vic.gov.au/programs/water-grid, accessed 27 January 2011".</ref>
