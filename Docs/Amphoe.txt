Amphoe

An '''amphoe''' (sometimes also '''amphur''', {{lang-th|อำเภอ}}, {{IPA-th|ʔāmpʰɤ̄ː|}}) is the second level administrative subdivision of [[Thailand]]. Usually translated as "[[district]]". Amphoe make up the [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]], and are analogous to [[county|counties]]. The chief district officer is the [[wikt:นาย|Nai]] Amphoe ({{lang|th|นายอำเภอ}}). Amphoe are divided into [[tambon]]s, or sub-districts.

Altogether Thailand has 878 districts, not including the [[Districts of Bangkok|50 districts]] of [[Bangkok]] which are called ''[[Khet_(country_subdivision)|khet]]'' (เขต) since the Bangkok administrative reform of 1972. The number of amphoe in provinces varies, from only three in the smallest provinces, up to the 50 urban districts of [[Bangkok]]. Also the sizes and population of amphoe differ greatly. The smallest population is in [[King Amphoe Ko Kut|Ko Kut]] ([[Trat Province]]) with just 2,042 citizens, while [[Amphoe Mueang Samut Prakan|Mueang Samut Prakan]] ([[Samut Prakan Province]]) has 509,262 citizens. The khet of Bangkok have the smallest areas—Khet [[Samphanthawong]] is the smallest, with only 1.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>—while the amphoe of the sparsely populated mountain regions are bigger than some provinces. [[Amphoe Umphang|Umphang]] ([[Tak Province]]) at 4,325.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is the largest and also has the lowest population density.

The names of amphoe are usually unique, but in a few cases different Thai names have the same form in English due to the flaws of the [[romanization#Thai|romanization]] system. The notable exception, however, is the name [[Amphoe Chaloem Phra Kiat (disambiguation)|Amphoe Chaloem Phra Kiat]], which was given to five districts created in 1996 in celebration of the 50th anniversary of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]'s accession to the throne. ''Chaloem Phra Kiat'' (เฉลิมพระเกียรติ) means "in commemoration of" or "in honour of" a royal family member.

== Local administration ==
Each district is led by a district chief officer (nai amphoe, นายอำเภอ), who is appointed by the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]]. The officer is a subordinate of the provincial governor.

==Amphoe mueang==
{{see|Mueang|Muban|Sukhaphiban|Tambon|Thesaban}}
The district which contains the administrative office of the province is the ''amphoe mueang'' (lit. ''town district''). The district should not to be confused with the capital town itself, which is a different administrative entity usually much smaller than the district. Until the 1930s, most of the capital districts had names just like other districts, whereas districts dating back to old provinces had the word ''mueang'' in their name. In 1938 all the capital districts were renamed ''amphoe mueang'', whereas in all non-capital districts ''mueang'' was removed from the name.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=55|issue=ก|pages=658–666|script-title=th:พระราชกฤษฎีกาเปลี่ยนนามจังหวัด และอำเภอบางแห่ง พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๑|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2481/A/658.PDF|date=1938-11-14|language=Thai}}</ref> The notable exception to this rule is [[Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya]], where the capital district is named [[Amphoe Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya]] (instead of ''Amphoe Mueang Ayutthaya'')&nbsp:, the same as the province, which is fully named ''Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya''. Also the capital districts of Thonburi and Phra Nakhon Provinces had the same name as the province, which they kept when the two provinces were merged to form Bangkok metropolis.

In most cases the capital district is also the most populous district of the province, as the provincial administration is usually in the largest town of the province. [[Songkhla Province]] is the most striking exception, as the town (and thus also the district) [[Hat Yai]] grew much faster than the capital [[Mueang Songkhla District|Mueang Songkhla]] due to its better transport connections.

There are four districts in Thailand ([[Amphoe Mueang Chan|Chan]], [[Amphoe Mueang Pan|Pan]], [[Amphoe Mueang Suang|Suang]], and [[Amphoe Mueang Yang|Yang]]) which contain the term ''mueang'' in their name as well, even though they are not capital districts. All of these were created relatively recently, between 1973 and 1995.

==King amphoe==
Minor districts (''king amphoe'', กิ่งอำเภอ &mdash; ''"กิ่ง"'' literally "branch") are set up when the administration of areas remote from the district center is inconvenient for citizens. Most of the tasks of the amphoe are transferred to the king amphoe, but it is still partially a subordinate of the amphoe it was created from. When the king amphoe meets the necessary qualifications to become an amphoe, it is usually promoted. However, not every newly created amphoe begins as a king amphoe: if the qualifications are met directly, this phase is skipped. While usually a minor district is upgraded after a few years, in some cases it remains a minor district for decades. For example, [[Amphoe Ko Yao|Ko Yao]] was a minor district for 85 years until it was upgraded in 1988. Sometimes a district is downgraded to a minor district. [[Amphoe Thung Wa|Thung Wa]] lost a lot of its population to neighboring [[Amphoe La-ngu|La-ngu minor district]], so finally La-ngu was upgraded and Thung Wa downgraded. Another example is [[Amphoe Chumphon Buri|Chumphon Buri]], which was reduced after the more developed part was split off to form a new district and the remaining district was downgraded.

The criteria required for an amphoe are a population of at least 30,000 people and at least five ''tambon'', or, if the area is more than 25&nbsp;km from the district office, a population of at least 15,000 and four ''tambon''. <!--how to translate ได้รับความเห็นชอบจากสภาตำบลหรือองค์การบริหารส่วนตำบล หัวหน้าส่วนราชการประจำอำเภอ หัวหน้าส่วนราชการประจำจังหวัดและสภาจังหวัด-->

A minor district is led by a chief officer (Hua Na King Amphoe, หัวหน้ากิ่งอำเภอ).

The Thai word ''king'' (กิ่ง) means "branch" and should not be confused with the English word "king". The officially recommended translation is "minor district"&nbsp;—however they are also quite commonly translated as sub-district, which is the recommended translation for ''tambon'', and also wrongly suggests that they are at a lower administrative level than the ''amphoe''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Thai-English Transcription of Changwat, Amphoe, King Amphoe and Tambon|isbn=978-974-7857-04-7|url=http://www.dopa.go.th/web_pages/m03050000/documents/thai_eng.zip|year=2007

The Thai government upgraded all remaining 81 minor districts to full districts on 15 May 2007 in order to streamline administration.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9500000055625|work=Manager Online|script-title=th:แถลงผลการประชุม ครม. ประจำวันที่ 15 พ.ค. 2550|language=Thai}}</ref> With publication in the ''Royal Gazette'' on 24 August the order became official.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=124|issue=46 ก|pages=14–21|script-title=th:พระราชกฤษฎีกาตั้งอำเภอฆ้องชัย...และอำเภอเหล่าเสือโก้ก พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๐|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2550/A/046/14.PDF|format=PDF|date=Aug 24, 2007|language=Thai}}</ref>

==District office==
{{Commons category|District offices of Thailand}}
The administration of the district is housed in an office building called ''Thi wa kan Amphoe'' (ที่ว่าการอำเภอ), which also marks the center of each district. Distances on road signs are always calculated to this office building. The office is usually in the largest settlement of the district, to make it easily accessible to the majority of the population&nbsp;—one of the tasks of the amphoe is the [[civil registry]], which makes the district the most important of the administrative levels for the Thai public.
