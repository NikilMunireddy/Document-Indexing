These territories also exhibited a variety of customs, laws, languages and currencies until the mid nineteenth century.<ref name=morenopaper/>

From the 18th century onwards, the Bourbon kings and the government tried to establish a more centralized regime. Leading figures of the [[Spanish Enlightenment]] advocated for the building of a Spanish nation beyond the internal territorial boundaries.<ref name=morenopaper/>

However, unlike in other European countries such as France, where regional languages were spoken in rural areas or less developed regions, two important regional languages of Spain were spoken in some of the most industrialized areas,<ref name=jackson>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Spanish_Republic_and_the_Civil_War_1.html?id=lvoNAQAAMAAJ|title=The Spanish Republic and the Civil War |last=Jackson |first=Gabriel |year=1965 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=United States of America|page=15|isbn=0-691-00757-8}}</ref>  which, moreover, enjoyed higher levels of prosperity, in addition to having their own cultures and historical consciousness.

Therefore, economic and social changes that had produced a national cultural unification in France had the opposite effect in Spain.<ref name=frans/> As such, Spanish history since the late 19th century has been shaped by a dialectical struggle between Spanish nationalism and peripheral nationalisms,<ref name=conversi>{{cite web| url=http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/conversi/smooth.pdf| last=Conversi|first=Daniele|title=The Smooth Transition: Spain’s 1978 Constitution and the Nationalities Question| publisher=Carfax Publishing, Inc.|work=National Identities, Vol 4, No. 3|year=2002|accessdate=28 January 2008}}</ref><ref name=moreno98>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/La_Federalizaci%C3%B3n_de_Espa%C3%B1a.html?id=OVzC9t5sxBMC|title=La federalización de España.

In a response to Catalan demands, limited autonomy was granted to Catalonia in 1913—abolished in 1920—and granted again in 1932 during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], when the [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat]], Catalonia's mediaeval institution of government, was restored. The constitution of 1931 envisaged a territorial division for all Spain in "autonomous regions", which was never fully attained—only Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia had approved "[[Statute of Autonomy|Statutes of Autonomy]]"—the process being thwarted by the [[Spanish Civil War]] that broke out in 1936, and the victory of the rebel national forces under [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name="conversi"/>

When Franco died in 1975, Spain entered into a phase of [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition towards democracy]]. The most difficult task of the newly democratically elected [[Cortes Generales]] (the Spanish Parliament) in 1977 acting as a Constituent Assembly was to transition from a unitary centralized state into a decentralized state<ref name=colomer>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54171792.html|title=The Spanish 'state of autonomies': non-institutional federalism.(Special Issue on Politics and Policy in Democratic Spain: No Longer Different?)|last=Colomer|first=Josep M.|work=[[West European Politics]]|date=1 October 1998|accessdate=7 October 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> in a way that would satisfy the demands of the peripheral nationalists.<ref name=mundo>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2005/06/espana/estatutos_autonomia/historia.html|title=Café para Todos|work=La España de las Autonomías.

An agreement was made so that the Generalitat would be restored and limited competencies would be transferred while the constitution was still being written. Shortly after, the government allowed the creation of "assemblies of members of parliament" integrated by deputies and senators of the different territories of Spain, so that they could constitute "pre-autonomic regimes" for their regions as well. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The so-called [[Fathers of the Constitution]] had to strike a balance between the opposing views of Spain, on the one hand, the centralist view inherited from Franco's regime,<ref name=colomer/> and on the other hand [[federalism]] and a pluralistic view of Spain as a "nation of nations";<ref name=sinopsis2>{{cite web |url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=2&tipo=2|title=Sinópsis artículo 2|work=Constitución española (con sinópsis) |last=Delgado-Ibarren García-Campero|first=Manuel| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> between a uniform decentralization of entities with the same competencies and an asymmetrical structure that would distinguish the nationalities. Peripheral nationalist parties wanted a multinational state with a federal or confederal model, whereas the governing [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] (UCD) and the [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance]] (AP) wanted minimum decentralization; the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) was sympathetic to a federal system.<ref name=frans/>

In the end, the constitution, published and ratified in 1979, found a balance in recognizing the existence of "nationalities and regions" in Spain, within the "indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation". In order to manage the tensions present in the Spanish transition to democracy, the drafters of the current Spanish constitution avoided giving labels such as 'federal' to the territorial arrangements,<ref>[http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/18/why-talk-of-federalism-wont-help-peace-in-syria-assad/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&utm_term=*Editors%20Picks Why Talk of Federalism Won't Help Peace in Syria|[[Foreign Policy]]]</ref> while enshrining in the constitution the right to autonomy or self-government of the "nationalities and regions", through a process of asymmetric [[devolution]] of power to the "autonomous communities" that were to be created.<ref>[http://www.mreza-mira.net/wp-content/uploads/Devolution-in-Spain-May-2014.pdf Devolution of Powers in Spain]</ref><ref>[http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/politics/researchcircle/publications/docs/chernyha-burgpaper.pdf  Devolution and Democracy: Identity, Preferences, and Voting in the Spanish “State of Autonomies”]</ref>

The starting point in the territorial organization of Spain was the second article of the constitution,<ref name=perez>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/El_Funcionamiento_Del_Estado_Autonomico.html?id=4SnZBb6pIZkC|work=El Funcionamiento del Estado Autonómico|title=Desarrollo y Evolución del Estado Autonómico: El Proceso Constituyente y el Consenso Constitucional|last=Pérez Royo|first=Javier|editor-last=Hernández Lafuente|editor-first=Adolfo|pages=50–67|publisher=Ministerio de Administraciones Públicas|date=December 1999|accessdate=7 October 2012|isbn=8470886908}}</ref> which reads:

In order to exercise this right, the constitution established an open process whereby the "nationalities and regions" could be constituted as "autonomous communities". First, it recognized the pre-existing 50 [[provinces of Spain]], a territorial division of the liberal centralizing regime of the 19th century created for purely administrative purposes. (It also recognized the [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] that integrated the provinces). These provinces would serve as the building blocks and constituent parts of the autonomous communities. The constitution stipulated that the following could be constituted as autonomous communities:<ref name=article143>{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=143&fin=158&tipo=2|title=Título VIII. De la Organización Territorial del Estado. Capítulo tercero. De las Comunidades Autónomas. Artículos 143 a 158|author=Congreso de los Diputados|work=Constitución española|year=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref>
* Two or more adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural and economic characteristics.
* Insular territories.
* A single province with a "historical regional identity".

It also allowed for exceptions to the above criteria, in that the Spanish Parliament could:<ref name=article143/>
* Authorize, in the nation's interest, the constitution of an autonomous community even if it was a single province without a historical regional identity.
* Authorize or grant autonomy to entities or territories that were not provinces.

The constitution also established two "routes" to accede to autonomy. The "fast route" or "fast track",<ref name=nunez/> also called the "exception",<ref name=perez/> was established in article 151, and was implicitly reserved for the three "historical nationalities"<ref name=tanja/><ref name=clavero/><ref name=sinopsisDT2>{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=2&tipo=4|title=Sinópsis Disposición Transitoria 2|publisher=[[Congress of Deputies]]|first=José Antonio|last=Alonso de Antonio|date=December 2003|accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>—the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia—in that the very strict requirements to opt for this route were waived via the second transitory disposition for those territories that had approved a "Statute of Autonomy" during the Second Spanish Republic.<ref name=sinopsisDT2/> (Otherwise, the constitution required the approval of three-fourths of the municipalities involved whose population would sum up at least the majority of the electoral census of each province, and required the ratification through a [[referendum]] with the affirmative vote of the absolute majority of the electoral census of each province—that is, of all registered citizens, not only of those who would vote).

The constitution also explicitly established that the institutional framework for these communities would be a [[parliamentary system]], with a Legislative Assembly elected by [[universal suffrage]], a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] or "council of government", a president of such a council, elected by the Assembly, and a High Court of Justice. They were also granted a maximum level of devolved competencies.

The "slow route" or "slow track",<ref name=nunez/> also called the "norm",<ref name=perez/> was established in article 143. This route could be taken—via the first transitory disposition—by the "pre-autonomic regimes" that had been constituted in 1978, while the constitution was still being drafted, if approved by two-thirds of all municipalities involved whose population would sum up to at least the majority of the electoral census of each province or insular territory. These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government. However, the constitution did not explicitly establish an institutional framework for these communities. They could have established a parliamentary system like the "historical nationalities", or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the competences they were granted.<ref name=perez/><ref name=clavero/>

Once the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the "federation of autonomous communities".  This was understood as any agreement between communities that would produce an alteration to the political and territorial equilibrium that would cause a confrontation between different blocks of communities, an action incompatible with the principle of solidarity and the unity of the nation.<ref name=gonzalez>{{cite web|url=http://congreso.us.es/cidc/Ponencias/federalismo/IgnacioGonzalez.pdf|title=La Prohibición de la Federación entre Territorios Autónomos en el Constitucionalismo Español|last=González García|first=Ignacio|publisher=Congreso Iberoamericano de Derecho Constitucional|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref>

The so-called "additional" and  "transitory" dispositions of the constitution allowed for some exceptions to the above-mentioned framework. In terms of territorial organization, the fifth transitory disposition established that the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], Spanish exclaves located on the northern coast of Africa, could be constituted as "autonomous communities" if the absolute majority of the members of their city councils would agree on such a motion, and with the approval of the Spanish Parliament, which would exercise its prerogatives to grant autonomy to other entities besides provinces.<ref name=transitorias>{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=1&fin=9&tipo=4|title=Disposiciones transitorias|work=Constitución española|author=Congreso de los Diputados|year=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref>

In terms of the scope of competences, the first additional disposition recognized the historical rights of the "chartered" territories,{{efn-lr|name=lurraldeak}} namely the Basque-speaking provinces, which were to be updated in accordance with the constitution.<ref name=adicionales>{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=1&fin=4&tipo=3|title=Disposiciones transitorias|work=Constitución española|author=Congreso de los Diputados|year=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref>  This recognition would allow them to establish a financial "[[communities of chartered regime|chartered regime]]" whereby they would not only have independence to manage their own finances, like all other communities, but to have their own public financial ministries with the ability to levy and collect all taxes. In the rest of the communities, all taxes are levied and collected by or for the central government and then redistributed among all.

===Autonomic pacts===
The Statutes of Autonomy of the Basque Country and Catalonia were sanctioned by the Spanish Parliament on 18 December 1979. The position of the party in government, the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] (UCD), was that only the three "historical nationalities" would assume full competences, while the rest would accede to autonomy via article 143, assuming fewer powers and perhaps not even establishing institutions of government.<ref name=rebollo>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Auv9-CI_Mv8C&source=gbs_book_similarbooks|last=Rebollo|first=Luis Martín|title=Consideraciones sobre la Reforma de los Estatutos de Autonomía de las Comunidades Autónomas|editor=Ministerio de Justicia|work=La Reforma Constitucional: XXVI Jornadas de Estudio (27, 28 y 29 de octubre de 2004)|year=2005|accessdate=3 November 2012|publisher=Dirección del Servicio Jurídico del Estado|isbn=84-7787-815-3}}</ref> This was firmly opposed by the representatives of [[Andalusia]], who demanded for their region the maximum level of competences granted to the "nationalities".<ref name=clavero/>

After a massive rally in support of autonomy, a referendum was organized for Andalusia to attain autonomy through the strict requirements of article 151, or the "fast route"—with UCD calling for abstention, and the main party in opposition in Parliament, the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) calling for a vote in favour.<ref name=clavero/> These requirements were not met, as in one of the eight provinces, [[province of Almería|Almería]], votes in favour—although the majority—did not amount to half of the electoral census as required. Yet, in general, the results of the referendum had been clear and unequivocal.<ref name=perez/>

After several months of discussion, the then prime minister of Spain, [[Adolfo Suárez]] and the [[Leader of the Opposition (Spain)|leader of the opposition]], [[Felipe González]], reached an agreement to resolve the Andalusian issue, whereby the Parliament approved an amendment to the law that regulated referendums, and used a prerogative of article 144c of the constitution, both actions which combined would allow Andalusia to take the fast route. They also agreed that no other region would take the "fast route", but that all regions would establish a parliamentary system with all institutions of government.<ref name=clavero/> This opened a phase that was dubbed as ''café para todos'', "coffee for all".<ref name=tanja/> This agreement was eventually put into writing in July 1981 in what has been called the "first autonomic pacts".<ref name=nunez>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Spanish_History_since_1808.html?id=ogvsITQ0cmwC|title=The awakening of peripheral nationalisms and the State of the Autonomous Communities|last=Núñez Seixas|first=Xosé M|editor1-last=Álvarez Junco|editor1-first=José|editor2-last=Schubert|editor2-first=Adrian|work=Spanish History since 1808|publisher=Arnold Publishers|year=2000|accessdate=9 October 2008|pages=315–330|isbn=0340662298}}</ref>

These "autonomic pacts"{{efn-lr|"Autonomic pacts" or "autonomic agreements" (in Spanish: ''pactos autonómicos'' or ''acuerdos autonómicos'').}} filled in the gap left by the open character of the constitution. Among other things:<ref name=perez/><ref name=acuerdos>{{cite web|url=http://www.idpbarcelona.net/docs/recerca/ccaa/pdf/documentos/acuerd_auton_gob_psoe_1981.pdf|title=Acuerdos Autonómicos firmados por el Gobierno de la Nación y el Partido Socialista Obrero Español el 31 de julio de 1981|date=31 July 1981|accessdate=11 October 2012}}</ref>
*They described the final outline of the territorial division of Spain, with the specific number and name of the autonomous communities to be created.
*They restricted the "fast-route" to the "historical nationalities" and Andalusia; all the rest had to take the "slow-route".
*They established that all autonomous communities would have institutions of government within a parliamentary system.
*They set up a deadline for all the remaining communities to be constituted: 1 February 1983.

In the end, 17 autonomous communities were created:
* Andalusia, and the three "historical nationalities"—the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia—took the "fast-route" and assumed the maximum level of competences immediately; the rest took the "slow route".
* [[Aragon]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]] and the [[Valencian Community]] acceded to autonomy as communities integrated by two or more provinces with common historical, economic and cultural characteristics.
* The [[Balearic Islands]] and the [[Canary Islands]] acceded to autonomy as insular territories, the latter integrated by two provinces.
* [[Asturias|Principality of Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] and [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] acceded to autonomy as single provinces with historical identity (also called "uniprovincial" autonomous communities).
* [[Navarre]], as a single province, acceded to autonomy through the recognition, update and improvement of its historical and local "law" (charters; Spanish ''fueros''), and as such, it is known as a "chartered community".
* The province of Madrid was removed from Castile-La Mancha (formerly [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]]), to which it previously belonged, and constituted as a uniprovincial autonomous community as the capital of the nation with the name ''[[Community of Madrid]]''.

Special provisions were made for the Valencian Community and the Canary Islands in that, although they took the "slow route", through the subsequent approval of specific organic laws, they were to assume the maximum level of competences in less than 5 years, since they had started a process towards the "fast route" prior to the approval of the "autonomic pacts".

On the other hand, Cantabria and La Rioja, although originally part of [[Old Castile]]—and both originally included in the "pre-autonomic regime" of Castile and León—were granted autonomy as single provinces with historical identity, a move supported by the majority of their populations.<ref name=conversi/><ref name="clavero"/><ref name=garciaruiz>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Estudios_sobre_descentralizaci%C3%B3n_territ.html?id=7eOCDrlpOC0C|work=Estudios sobre descentralización territorial.

[[File:Congreso de los Diputados (España) 14.jpg|thumb|The Spanish Parliament, Congress of Deputies]]
During the second half of the 1980s, the central government seemed reluctant to transfer all competences to the "slow route" communities.<ref name="mundo" /> After the five years set up by the constitution, all "slow route" communities demanded the maximum transfer guaranteed by the constitution. This led to what has been called the "second autonomic pacts" of 1992, between the then prime minister of Spain [[Felipe González]] from PSOE and the leader of the opposition, [[José María Aznar]] from the newly created [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) successor of the [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance party]]. Through these agreements new competences were transferred, with the reforms to many Statutes of Autonomy of the "slow-route" communities with the aim of "equalizing" them to the "fast route" communities.<ref name=mundo/> In 1995, the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] were constituted as "autonomous cities" without legislative powers, but with an autonomous assembly{{clarify|reason=How can an autonomous assembly not have legislative powers?|date=October 2014}} not subordinated to any other province or community.

The creation of the autonomous communities was a diverse process, that started with the constitution, was normalized with the autonomic pacts and was completed with the Statutes of Autonomy.<ref name=perez/> It is, however, an ongoing process; further devolution—or even the return of transferred competences—is always a possibility. This has been evidenced in the 2000s, at the beginning with a wave of approval of new Statutes of Autonomy for many communities, and more recently with many considering the recentralization of some competences in the wake of the economic and financial crisis of 2008. Nonetheless Spain is now a highly decentralized country with a structure unlike any other, similar but not equal to a [[federation]],<ref name=perez/> even though in many respects the country can be compared to countries which are undeniably federal.<ref>The Federal Option and Constitutional Management of Diversity in Spain Xavier Arbós Marín, page 381; included in 'The Ways of Federalism in Western Countries and the Horizons of Territorial Autonomy in Spain' (volume 2), edited by Alberto López-Eguren and Leire Escajedo San Epifanio; edited by [[Axel Springer SE|Springer]] ISBN 978-3-642-27716-0, ISBN 978-3-642-27717-7(eBook)</ref> The unique resulting system is referred to as "Autonomous state", or more precisely "State of Autonomies".<ref name=colomer/>

===Current state of affairs===

====Overview====
By means of the State of Autonomies implemented after the Spanish Constitution of 1978, Spain has been quoted to be "remarkable for the extent of the powers peacefully devolved over the past 30 years" and "an extraordinarily decentralized country", with the central government accounting for just 18% of public spending,<ref name="Mallet">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/de6c00f0-8c25-11de-b14f-00144feabdc0.html|title=Flimsier footings|last=Mallet|first=Victor|date=18 August 2010|publisher=''Financial Times''|accessdate=25 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100929175305/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/de6c00f0-8c25-11de-b14f-00144feabdc0.html| archivedate= 29 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{Registration required}}</ref> 38% for the regional governments, 13% for the local councils, and the remaining 31% for the [[social insurance|social security system]].<ref name="economist.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12501023|title=A survey of Spain: How much is enough?|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=25 August 2010|date=6 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100717011500/http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12501023| archivedate= 17 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{Subscription required}}</ref>

In terms of personnel, by 2010 almost 1,350,000 people or 50.3% of the total [[civil servants]] in Spain were employed by the autonomous communities;<ref>[http://www.mpt.gob.es/servicios/empleo_publico/boletin/boletin/document_es/documento.pdf ] {{wayback|url=http://www.mpt.gob.es/servicios/empleo_publico/boletin/boletin/document_es/documento.pdf |date=20120328090825 }}</ref> city and provincial councils accounted for 23.6% and those employees working for the central administration (police and military included) represented 22.2% of the total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/funcionario/le/cunda/elpepisoc/20110730elpepisoc_1/Tes |title=Que al funcionario le cunda más &#124; Edición impresa &#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Elpais.com |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref>

====Tensions within the system====
Peripheral nationalism continues to play a key role in Spanish politics. Some peripheral nationalists view that there is a vanishing practical distinction between the terms "nationalities" and "regions",<ref name=keatings>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/61/8/37890628.pdf |title=Federalism and the Balance of power in European States|first=Michael|last=Keatings  |year=2007 |work=Support for Improvement in Governance and Management |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], Inc.  |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> as more competences are transferred to all communities in roughly the same degree and as other communities have chosen to identify themselves as "nationalities". In fact, it has been argued that the establishment of the State of Autonomies "has led to the creation of "new regional identities",<ref name=smith/><ref name=junco>{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/09/28/opinion/1348855849_016658.html|title=El sueño ilustrado y el Estado-nación|last=Junco|first=José Álvarez|publisher=[[El País]]|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> and "invented communities".<ref name=junco/>
{{double image|right|Fanals-Banc P1150940.JPG|180|BCN12-o.jpg|160|Pro-Catalan independence and pro-Spanish pertenence demonstrations in [[Barcelona]].}}
Many in Galicia, the Basque Country, and Catalonia still view their communities as "nations", not just "nationalities", and Spain as a "plurinational state" or a "nation of nations", and they have made demands for further devolution or secession.

In 2004 the Basque Parliament approved the [[Ibarretxe Plan]], whereby the Basque Country would approve a new Statute of Autonomy containing key provisions such as shared sovereignty with Spain, full independence of the [[judiciary]], and the right to [[self-determination]], and assuming all competences except that of the [[Spanish nationality law]], defense, and monetary policy. The plan was rejected by the Spanish Parliament in 2005 and the situation has remained largely stable in that front so far.

The severe [[Economy of Spain|economic crisis in Spain]] that started in 2008 produced different reactions in the different communities. On one hand, some began to consider a return of some responsibilities to the central government.<ref name=abc>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/20110729/espana/abcp-varias-autonomias-meditan-devolver-20110729.html|title=Varias autonomías meditan devolver competencias por el bloqueo del gobierno|publisher=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|date=29 July 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> while, on the other hand, in Catalonia debate on the fiscal deficit—Catalonia being one of the largest net contributors in taxes— led many who are not necessarily separatist but who are enraged by the financial deficit to support secession.<ref name=nextstate>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21563347|title=Catalonia: Europe's next state.

One scholar summarises the current situation as follows <blockquote>"''the autonomous state appears to have come full circle, with reproaches from all sides. According to some, it has not gone far enough and has failed to satisfy their aspirations for improved self-government. For others it has gone too far, fostering inefficiency or reprehensible linguistic policies''".<ref>The Federal Option and Constitutional Management of Diversity in Spain, Xavier Arbós Marín, page 395; included in 'The Ways of Federalism in Western Countries and the Horizons of Territorial Autonomy in Spain' (volume 2), edited by Alberto López-Eguren and Leire Escajedo San Epifanio; published by [[Axel Springer SE|Springer]] ISBN 978-3-642-27716-0, ISBN 978-3-642-27717-7(eBook)</ref>
</blockquote>

==Constitutional and statutory framework==
The State of Autonomies, as established in Article 2 of the constitution, has been argued to be based on four principles: willingness to accede to autonomy, unity in diversity, autonomy but not sovereignty of the communities, and solidarity among them all.<ref name=carreras/> The structure of the autonomous communities is determined both by the devolution allowed by the constitution and the competences assumed in their respective Statutes of Autonomy. While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an "equalization" of all communities, differences still remain.

===The Statute of Autonomy===
{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}

The Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an "Organic Law", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].

For communities that acceded to autonomy through the "fast route", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.

The constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state—the central government—in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name="article143" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].

===Institutional organization===
All autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:
* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented
* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is "president",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|"Autonomic president", "regional president", or simply "president" (in Spanish: ''presidente autonómico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan or Valencian: ''president autonòmic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente autonómico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente''). In the Basque language ''lehendakari'' is not translated.}} elected by the Legislative Assembly—usually the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Assembly—and nominated by the [[King of Spain]]
* A High Court of Justice, hierarchically under the [[Supreme Court of Spain]]

[[File:Oviedo03.jpg|thumb|Regional Palace, seat of the [[General Junta]], the Parliament of the [[Asturias|Principality of Asturias]]]]
The majority of the communities have approved regional electoral laws within the limits set up by the laws for the entire country. Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities, with the exception of the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia, elections are celebrated the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.<ref name=carreras>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonomías en España|work=Descentralización en Perspectiva Comparada: España, Colombia y Brasil|publisher=Plural Editores|year=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=9990563578}}</ref>

The names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown—like the Generalitat of Catalonia— while others are entirely new creations.

In some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. It should be noted, though, that a specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.

Given the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three "historical nationalities", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].

{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.

=== Legal powers ===
The autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an "asymmetrical homogeneity".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their "homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences. The autonomic regime is characterized by an equilibrium between homogeneity and diversity [...] Without the former there will be no unity or integration in the state's ensemble; without the latter, there would not be [a] true plurality and the capacity of self-government".<ref name=sinopsis137>{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=137&tipo=2|title=Sinópsis artículo 137|first=Julio|last=Castelao|work=Constitución española (con sinópsis)| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Ertzaintza Volkswagen Bilbao.jpg|thumb|An [[Ertzaintza]] police car in the Basque Country]]
The asymmetrical devolution is a unique characteristic of the territorial structure of Spain, in that the autonomous communities have a different range of devolved competences. These were based on what has been called in Spanish as ''hechos diferenciales'', "differential facts" or "differential traits".{{efn-lr|"Differential facts", or, "traits" (in Spanish: ''hechos diferenciales'', in Basque: ''eragin diferentziala'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''fets diferencials'', in Galician: ''feitos diferenciais'').}}<ref name=aja>{{cite web|url=http://congreso.us.es/cidc/Ponencias/federalismo/eliseo%20AJA.pdf|title=El Estado Autonómico de España a los 25 años de su constitución|last=Aja|first=Eliseo|publisher=Congreso Ibeoramericano de Derecho Constitucional|year=2003|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref>

This expression refers to the idea that some communities have particular traits, with respect to Spain as a whole. In practice these traits are a native "language proper to their own territories" separate from Spanish, a particular financial regime or special civil rights expressed in a code, which generate a distinct political personality.<ref name=aja/> These ''hechos diferenciales'' of their distinct political and historical personality are constitutionally and statutorily (i.e., in their Statutes of Autonomy) recognized in the exceptions granted to some of them and the additional competences they assume.<ref name=aja/>

Competences can be divided into three groups: exclusive to the central state or central government, shared competences, and devolved competences exclusive to the communities. Article 149 states which powers are exclusive to the central government: international relations, defense, administration of justice, commercial, criminal, civil, and labour legislation, customs, general finances and state debt, public health, basic legislation, and general coordination.<ref name=fiscal/> All autonomous communities have the power to manage their own finances in the way they see fit, and are responsible for the administration of education—school and universities—health and social services and cultural and urban development.<ref name=howmuch>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12501023|title=How much is enough? Devolution has been good for Spain, but it may have gone too far|publisher=The Economist|date=6 November 2008|accessdate=14 October 2012}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Yet there are differences as stipulated in their Statutes and the constitution:<ref name=carreras/>
* Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, [[Civil Code of Catalonia|Catalonia]], Galicia and the Valencian Community have a regional civil code
* Basque Country, Catalonia, and Navarre have their own police corps—the [[Ertzaintza]], the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Policía Foral|Nafarroako Foruzaingoa]], respectively
* The Canary Islands have a special financial regime in virtue of its location as an overseas territories, while the Basque Country and Navarre have a distinct financial regime called "chartered regime"
* The Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, Navarre, and the Valencian Community have a co-official language and therefore a distinct linguistic regime<ref name=carreras/>

===Degree of financial autonomy===
{{main|Communities of chartered regime}}

How the communities are financed has been one of the most contentious aspects in their relationship with the central government.<ref name=smith/> The constitution gave all communities significant control over spending, but the central government retained effective control of their revenue supply.<ref name=smith/> That is, the central government is still charge of levying and collecting most taxes, which it then redistributes to the autonomous communities with the aim of producing "[[fiscal equalization]]".<ref name=fiscal>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fiscal_Federalism_and_Political_Decentra.html?id=ngoAEwlqMIsC|work=Fiscal Federalism and Political Decentralization: Lessons from Spain, Germany and Canada|editor1-last=Bosch|editor1-first=Núria|editor2-last=Durán|editor2-first=José María|last1=Ruíz-Huerta Carbonell|first1=Jesús|last2=Herrero Alcalde|first2=Ana|title=Fiscal Equalization in Spain|publisher=Edward Elgar Publisher Limited|year=2008|isbn=9781847204677|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref> This applies to all communities, with the exception of the Basque Country and Navarre.

This financial scheme is known as the "common regime". In essence, fiscal equalization implies that richer communities become net contributors to the system, while poorer communities become net recipients. The two largest net contributors to the system are the Balearic Islands and the Community of Madrid, in percentage terms, or the Community of Madrid and Catalonia in absolute terms.<ref name=fiscal/><ref name=cinco>{{cite web|url=http://www.cincodias.com/articulo/economia/madrid-aporta-estado-doble-cataluna/20071129cdscdieco_1/|title=Madrid aporta al Estado más del doble que Cataluña|publisher=Cinco Días|date=29 November 2007|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref>

Central government funding is the main source of revenue for the communities of "common regime". Redistribution, or [[transfer payments]], are given to the communities of common regime to manage the responsibilities they have assumed. The amount they receive is based upon several calculations which include a consideration for population, land area, administrative units, dispersal of population, relative poverty, fiscal pressure and insularity.<ref name=tanja/> The central government is committed to returning a specific percentage of taxes to all communities with common regime, within the differences allowed for fiscal equalization. The communities of common regime have the ability to add a surcharge to the so-called "ceded taxes"—taxes set at the central level, but collected locally—and they can lower or raise personal income taxes up to a limit.<ref name=smith/>

The Basque Country and Navarre were granted an exception in the fiscal and financial system through the first additional disposition of the constitution that recognizes their historical "charters"{{efn-lr|"Charters" (in Spanish: ''fueros'', in Basque: ''foruak'').}}&nbsp;—hence they are known as "[[communities of chartered regime]]" or "foral regime".<ref name=smith/> Through their "chartered regime", these communities are allowed to levy and collect all so-called "contracted taxes", including income tax and corporate tax, and they have much more flexibility to lower or raise them.<ref name=smith/> This "chartered" or "foral" contract entails true financial autonomy.<ref name=smith/>

Since they collect almost all taxes, they send to the central government a pre-arranged amount known as ''cupo'', "quota" or ''aportación'', "contribution", and the treaty whereby this system is recognized is known as ''concierto'', "treaty", or ''convenio'', "pact".<ref name=hacienda>{{cite web|url=http://www.minhap.gob.es/es-ES/Areas%20Tematicas/Financiacion%20Autonomica/Paginas/Regimen%20foral.aspx|title=Régimen foral|author=Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Públicas (Ministry of the Treasury and Public Administrations)|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> Hence they are also said to have ''concierto económico'', an "economic treaty". Since they collect all taxes themselves and only send a prearranged amount to the central government for the competences exclusive to the state, they do not participate in "fiscal equalization", in that they do not receive any money back.

=== Spending ===
As more responsibilities have been assumed by the autonomous communities in areas such as social welfare, health, and education, public expenditure patterns have seen a shift from the central government towards the communities since the 1980s.<ref name=smith/> In the late 2000s, autonomous communities accounted for 35% of all public expenditure in Spain, a percentage that is even higher than that of states within a federation.<ref name=fiscal/> With no legal constraints to balance budgets, and since the central government retains control over fiscal revenue in the communities of common regime, these are in a way encouraged to build up debt.<ref name=smith/>

The [[Council on Fiscal and Financial Policy]], which includes representatives of the central government and of the autonomous communities, has become one of the most efficient institutions of coordination in matters of public expenditures and revenue.<ref name=toboso>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-870986501.html|title=Un Primer Análisis Cuantitativo de la Organización Territorial de las Tareas de Gobierno en España, Alemania y Suiza|last=Toboso|first=Fernando|publisher=El Trimestre Económico|date=1 April 2001|accessdate=21 October 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> Through the Council several agreements of financing have been agreed, as well as limits to the communities' public debt. The Organic Law of the Financing of Autonomous Communities of 1988 requires that the communities obtain the authorization of the central Ministry of Finance to issue public debt.<ref name=toboso/>

===Linguistic regimes===
[[File:BilingualSign Spain.svg|thumb|A bilingual sign in Basque and Spanish]]
The preamble to the constitution explicitly stated that it is the nation's will to protect "all Spaniards and the peoples of Spain in the exercise of human rights, their cultures and traditions, languages and institutions".<ref name=preamble>Preamble to the Constitution. {{cite web |url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/constitucion/Pages/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#i1 |title=Spanish Constitution |author=[[Cortes Generales]] |date=27 December 1978 |work= |publisher=Tribunal Constitucional de España |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> This is a significant recognition not only in that it differed drastically from the restrictive linguistic policies during the Franco era, but also because part of the distinctiveness of the "historical nationalities" lies on their own regional languages.<ref name="villar"/><ref name="shabad"/> The nation is thus openly multilingual,<ref name=conversi/> in which [[Names given to the Spanish language|Castilian]]—that is, Spanish—is the official language in all territories, but the "other Spanish languages" can also be official in their respective communities, in accordance with their Statutes of Autonomy.

Article 3 of the constitution ends up declaring that the "richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of Spain represents a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protection."<ref name=third>Third article. {{cite web |url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/constitucion/Pages/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#i1 |title=Spanish Constitution |author=[[Cortes Generales]] |date=27 December 1978 |work= |publisher=Tribunal Constitucional de España |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> Spanish remains the only official language of the state; other languages are only co-official with Spanish in the communities that have so regulated. In addition, knowledge of the Spanish language was declared a right and an obligation of all Spaniards.

Spanish legislation, most notably in the Statutes of Autonomy of the bilingual communities, use the term "own language", or "language proper to a community",{{efn-lr| "Own language (of a community)"  or "language proper [to a community]" (in Spanish: ''lengua propia'', in Basque: ''berezko hizkuntza'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''llengua pròpia'', in Galician: ''lingua propia'').}} to refer to a language other than Spanish that originated or had historical roots in that particular territory. The Statutes of Autonomy of the respective autonomous communities have declared [[Basque language|Basque]] the language proper to the Basque Country and Navarre, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] the language proper to Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community—where it is historically, traditionally and officially known as [[Valencian language|Valencian]]—and [[Galician language|Galician]] to be the language proper to Galicia. There are other protected regional languages in other autonomous communities. As a percentage of total population in Spain, [[Basque language|Basque]] is spoken by 2%, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] by 17%, and [[Galician language|Galician]] by 7% of all Spaniards.<ref name=cia>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html|title=Spain|work=The CIA World Factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref>

===Subdivisions===
{{main|Provinces of Spain|Municipalities of Spain}}
{{see also|Comarcas of Spain}}
The Spanish constitution recognizes the municipalities{{efn-lr|"Municipalities" (in Spanish: ''municipios'', in Basque: ''udalerriak'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''municipis'', in Galician: ''concellos'' or ''municipios'').}} and guarantees their autonomy. Municipal, or city, councils{{efn-lr|"City councils" or "municipal councils" (in Spanish: ''ayuntamientos'', in Basque: ''udalak'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''ajuntaments'', in Galician: ''concellos'').}} are in charge of the municipalities' government and administration, and they are integrated by a mayor{{efn-lr|"Mayor" (in Spanish: ''alcalde'', in Basque: ''alkatea'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''alcalde'' or ''batlle'' / ''batle'', in Galician: ''alcalde'').}} and councillors,{{efn-lr|"Councillors" (in Spanish: ''concejales'', in Basque: ''zinegotziak'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''regidors'', in Galician: ''concelleiros'').}} the latter elected by universal suffrage, and the former elected either by the councillor or by suffrage.

Provinces{{efn-lr|"Provinces" (in Spanish: ''provincias'', in Basque: ''probintziak'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''províncies'', in Galician: ''provincias'').}} are groups of municipalities and recognized by the constitution. Their competences and institutions of government vary greatly among communities. In all communities integrated by more than province, provinces are governed by "provincial deputations" or "provincial councils",{{efn-lr|"Provincial deputations" or "provincial councils" (in Spanish: ''diputaciones provinciales'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''diputacions provincials'', in Galician: ''deputacións provinciais'').}} with a limited scope administrative competences.<ref name=smith>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/64.pdf|title=Regional Government in France and Spain|last1=Smith|first1=Andy|last2=Heywood|first2=Paul|publisher=University College London|date=August 2000|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref>

In the Basque Country, the provinces, renamed as "[[historical territories]]",{{efn-lr|name=lurraldeak|"Historical territories" or "chartered territories" (in Spanish: ''territorios históricos'' or ''territorios forales'', in Basque: ''lurralde historikoak'' or ''foru lurraldeak'').}} are governed by "chartered deputations"{{efn-lr|"Chartered deputations" (in Spanish: ''diputaciones forales'', in Basque: ''foru aldundiek'').}}—with assume the competences of a provincial deputation as well as the fiscal powers of their "[[communities of chartered regime|chartered regime]]"—and by "General Juntas" {{efn-lr|"General Juntas" (in Spanish: ''Juntas Generales'', in Basque: ''Biltzar Nagusiak'').}}—parliaments with legislative powers.<ref name="smith"/>

In the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, each major island is governed by an "insular council".{{efn-lr|"Insular council" (in Spanish: ''consejo insular'' or ''cabildo insular'', in Catalan: ''consell insular'').}} In Catalonia, the "provincial deputations" have very little power, as other territorial subdivisions have been created.<ref name="smith"/>

In those seven autonomous communities formed by a single province, the provincial deputations have been replaced by the communities' institutions of government; in fact, the provinces themselves are not only coterminous with the communities, but correspond in essence to the communities themselves. The two-tier territorial organization common to most communities—first province, then municipalities—is therefore non-existent in these "uniprovincial" communities.<ref name=fiscal/>

The constitution also allows the creation of other territorial entities formed by groups of municipalities. One of such territorial subdivision is the ''comarca'' (equivalent of a "district", "shire" or "county"). While all communities have unofficial historical, cultural or natural ''comarcas'',{{efn-lr|"Comarcas" (in Spanish: ''comarcas'', in Basque: ''eskualdeak'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''comarques'', in Galician: ''comarcas'' or ''bisbarras'').}} only in Aragon and Catalonia they have been legally recognized as territorial entities with administrative powers (see [[comarcal council]]s).{{efn-lr|"Comarcal councils" (in Spanish: ''consejos comarcales'', in Catalan or Valencian: ''consells comarcals'').}}

===Competences of the autonomous governments===
The competences of the autonomous communities are not homogeneous.<ref>[http://www.seap.minhap.es/es/areas/politica_autonomica/Estatutos_Autonomia/estatutos_materias.html Estatutos de Autonomía comparados por materias] seap.minhap.es</ref> Broadly the competences are divided into "Exclusive", "Shared" and "Executive". In some cases the autonomous community may have exclusive responsibility for the administration of a policy area but may only have executive (i.e.,carries out) powers as far as the policy itself is concerned, meaning it must enforce policy and laws decided at the national level.
