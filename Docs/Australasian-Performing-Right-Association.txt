Australasian Performing Right Association

The '''Australasian Performing Right Association''' ('''APRA''') is a [[copyright collective]] representing [[New Zealand]] and [[Australian]] composers, lyricists and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishers]]. The association's head offices are located in [[Sydney]], Australia, with branch offices in [[Auckland]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. APRA is a member of the [[International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers]] (CISAC).

== History ==
APRA was established in 1926 by a number of companies including [[J. Albert & Son]] to represent the interests of Australasian music copyright holders. In 1929, commercial radio broadcasters in Sydney and Melbourne paid APRA Â£7 a week for royalties with music broadcasts limited to 66 hours a week.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Australian Events 1997|year=1997|publisher=Macquarie Library}}</ref> This arrangement broke down in 1931 with APRA banning the playing of records on air. The Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations was established in that year to resolve royalty and copyright related issues and as a result, member broadcasters agreed to pay a fixed sum for broadcasting rights.

With the introduction of the [[Australian copyright law|Australian ''Copyright Act 1968'']], APRA extended its services to any Australian business with copyright obligations. Demand for the service increased steadily over the following thirty years and by 2005, APRA represented the interests of 28,000 members within Australasia, and about 2 million creative artists and publishers from elsewhere in the world,  and gathered $146 million in royalty payments, of which $127 million was distributed to copyright holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/About/AboutAPRAAMCOS.aspx|title=About Us|publisher=APRA}}</ref>

Today the Association provides businesses a range of licences to use copyrighted music with APRA monitoring radio and television stations, concert promoters and cinemas in particular. Since 1997, APRA has also represented the Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society representing Australasian music publishers.

In 2008 and 2009, APRA supported aggressive new copyright law in New Zealand, including punishment of persons accused but not proven to be infringing copyright.  This position was opposed by artists<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativefreedom.org.nz/|title=Creative Freedom Foundation}}</ref> and APRA members.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=10553059|title=Copyright law dust-up turns into a war of words|author=Pat Pilcher|date=22 January 2009|work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref>
