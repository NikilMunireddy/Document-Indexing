'''Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr.''' (born January 17, 1982) is an American professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He has established himself as one of the most well-known and popular players in the league. Wade had the top selling jersey in the NBA for nearly two years, leading the league in jersey sales from the [[2005 NBA Playoffs]], until the midpoint of the [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07 season]].<ref name="sports.espn.go.com">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2727029 "Bryant passes Wade for top-selling jersey at NBA stores."] ''www.espn.com'', January 10, 2007.

After entering the league as the fifth pick in the [[2003 NBA draft]], Wade was named to the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|All-Rookie]] team and the All-Star team the following eleven seasons. In his third season, Wade led the Miami Heat to their first NBA championship in franchise history. He was named the [[NBA Finals MVP|2006 NBA Finals MVP]] as the Heat won the series 4-2 over the [[Dallas Mavericks]]. At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], Wade led the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States men's basketball team]], commonly known as the "[[The Redeem Team|Redeem Team]]", in scoring, and helped them capture gold medal honors in [[Beijing, China]]. In the [[2008–09 NBA season|2008–09 season]], Wade led the league in scoring and earned his first [[List of National Basketball Association season scoring leaders|NBA scoring title]].

After [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]] joined the Heat, Wade was part of Miami's second championship win in the [[2012 NBA Finals]], when Miami defeated the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. He won his third NBA championship in 2013, when the Heat defeated the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the [[2013 NBA Finals]]. In 2014, the Heat reached the [[2014 NBA Finals|Finals]] for the fourth consecutive year, but lost in five games to the San Antonio Spurs.

==Early life==
Dwyane Wade was born on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side of Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr. In 1977, JoLinda, at the age of 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that "[his] mom was on drugs and [his] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated - and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." At the age of 6, he recalls police - with guns drawn - raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him - by telling him they were going to the movies - into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to [[Robbins, Illinois|Robbins]], Illinois.<ref name=schooled /> After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester - i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/spirit/spiritual-growth/12086-she-aint-playin|title=She Ain't Playin'|author=Jennifer  LeClaire|work=Charisma Magazine|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}</ref>

Wade turned to sports, especially basketball and football, to avoid the temptations of participating in drug and gang-related activities. Wade's mom and dad would often take him to the park to play basketball. He cites one of his older sisters, Tragil, as the individual most responsible for his childhood upbringing and for steering him in the proper direction.<ref name="DJoseph">Joseph, Dave.

Wade attended [[Harold L. Richards High School]] in [[Oak Lawn, Illinois|Oak Lawn]]. Wade quickly found success as a wide receiver on the football team, but he needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during his junior year.<ref name="DJoseph" /> While he did not acquire much playing time during his second year, his stepbrother, Demetris McDaniel, was the star of the team.<ref name="askmen">[http://www.askmen.com/men/sports_60/88_dwyane_wade.html "Dwyane Wade."] ''www.askmen.com.''

Wade was [[recruiting (athletics)|recruited]] by only three college basketball teams ([[Marquette University]], [[Illinois State Redbirds|Illinois State]], and [[DePaul University]]) due to academic problems.<ref name=schooled>Shipley, Amy. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/09/AR2005050901254_pf.html "Schooled With Hard Knocks."], [[Washington Post]], May 10, 2005. Retrieved June 15, 2007.</ref>

During most of Wade's time at Marquette, his mother was either eluding the law or serving time in jail for selling crack cocaine. On October 14, 2001, JoLinda declared that she would change her life and get clean while attending a service at a Chicago church. Wade, then a sophomore at Marquette, went home for Christmas to be with his mom, whom he believed was clean and sober for the first time in his life. However,  JoLinda admitted to him that she was actually going back to prison. Wade told ESPN, "I was hurt because I felt like I was just getting my mom back, and now she had to leave again." On January 2, 2002, his mother went back to prison to serve her 14-month sentence. She says she has been clean since 2003.

==College career==
Wade chose to play college basketball for [[Tom Crean (basketball)|Tom Crean]] at [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. During Wade's freshman year at Marquette, he was ineligible to play with the men's team due to a violation of the NCAA's [[Proposition 48 (NCAA)|Proposition 48]]. Wade sought [[tutor]]ing to improve his writing skills in order to regain eligibility.<ref name="draft.net">Kamalsky, Matt.

===2001-2002 Season===
Wade became eligible to play for the [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2001–2002 season]], and he led the Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 [[Points per game|ppg]], led the conference in steals at 2.47 per game, and averaged of 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] per game.<ref name="dbbb">[http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=WADEDW01 "Dwyane Wade."] ''www.databasketball.com.''

===2002-2003 Season===
In [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2002–03]], Wade led Marquette in scoring again with 21.5 [[points per game|ppg]],<ref name="dbbb" /> and Marquette won the school's first and only [[Conference USA]] championship with a 27–6 record. That season Wade led the Golden Eagles to the [[Final Four]], the school's first appearance in the Final Four since winning the 1977 national championship. After the season, he was named to the All-America First Team by the [[Associated Press]]; Wade is the first Marquette basketball player since 1978 to do so.<ref name="MQbio" />

Wade's performance during the Midwest Regional Final of the 2003 [[NCAA]] Tournament was highly publicized by the national press. Against heavily favored, top-ranked and top-seeded [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky Wildcats]], Wade recorded a [[triple-double]] with 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists.<ref name="nbabio">[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/dwyane_wade/bio.html "Dwyane Wade: Biography."] [[NBA.com]].

On February 3, 2007, almost four years after Wade played in his final collegiate game, Marquette retired his jersey at halftime of a game against [[Providence College|Providence]]. Although Marquette requires student-athletes to graduate prior to receiving jersey retirement honors, the University made a special exception for Wade based on his accomplishments since leaving Marquette.<ref name="jersey">[http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/stories/092906aaf.html "Marquette to Retire Dwyane Wade's Number. 3 Jersey."] ''www.cstv.com'', September 29, 2006.

On March 5, 2003, JoLinda Wade was released from prison. Three days later she saw Dwyane play basketball for the first time in five years. She watched Marquette beat Cincinnati, 70-61, at the Bradley Center to win the Conference USA regular-season championship. Dwyane had 26 points, 10 rebounds, and five assists.

==NBA career==

===Rookie year (2003–04)===
[[File:2004 Got Milk Rookie Challenge - Dwayne Wade.jpg|thumb|Wade dunking the ball during the [[:en:2004 NBA All-Star Game|2004]] [[Rising Stars Challenge|Rookie Challenge]] game for the Rookies team.]]
Selected 5th overall in the [[2003 NBA draft]] by the [[Miami Heat]], Wade quickly emerged as a productive player on a youthful Miami Heat team and averaged 16.2 points on 46.5% [[Field goal percentage|shooting]] with averages of 4.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game. Wade is one of only four Marquette University players to be drafted in the first round; his is the highest draft selection in school history.<ref name="dbbb"/><ref name="nbabio" /> After a 5–15 start,<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=MIA&yr=2003&lg=N "Miami Heat 2003–04 Game Log and Scores."], ''www.databasebasketball.com.''

Retrieved January 20, 2007.</ref> He further distinguished himself with outstanding performances in the playoffs,<ref name="nbabio"/> particularly against the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Semi-finals. In the end, however, Wade's successful rookie season was somewhat overshadowed by the success of fellow rookies [[Carmelo Anthony]] and [[LeBron James]]. Wade did earn unanimous selection to the 2004 [[NBA All-Rookie Team]],<ref name="nbabio" /> and also finished third in rookie of the year voting (behind James and Anthony).<ref name="nbabio" /> He was ranked in the top five among rookies in several major statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.<ref name="nbabio" /> In [[2004 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] Wade hit a game winning shot in Game 1 of the Heat's first round series against the [[New Orleans Hornets]]. The Heat won the series 4–3 and advanced to the second round to face the top-seeded and best record team in the NBA, the Indiana Pacers, in a very entertaining series that almost pushed the 61-win Pacers to the edge, though Miami would eventually lose the series in six games. He became the fourth rookie since the [[shot clock]] era began to lead his team in scoring and assist average in the postseason.<ref name="nbabio" />

===Breakthrough year (2004–05)===
[[File:Wade-Kukoc.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Wade with the ball versus the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in 2005]]
Before the [[2004–05 NBA season|2004–05 season]], Shaquille O'Neal was traded from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] to the Heat. The following season, Miami improved by 17 games, from a 42–40 record in the [[2003–04 NBA season|2003–04 season]] to an Eastern Conference-best 59–23 record in the [[2004–05 NBA season|2004–05 season]].<ref name="dbbb Heat" /> The league's coaches selected Wade to be a reserve in the [[2005 NBA All-Star Game|2005 All-Star Game]]. He scored 14 points in 24 minutes of play.

In the first round of the [[2005 NBA Playoffs]], Wade averaged 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6.0 rebounds while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage<ref name="nbabio" /> as the Heat swept the [[New Jersey Nets]].<ref name="dbbheat">[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=MIA&yr=2004&lg=n "Miami Heat 2004–05 Game Log and Scores."] ''www.databasebasketball.com.''

Wade scored 42 and 36 points in Games 2 and 3 respectively despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He also suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 of the Conference Finals that prevented him from playing in the series' sixth game<ref>[http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/MIADET_050604.html "2005 Playoff Eastern Conference Finals Game 6."] ''www.nba.com.''

The Heat lost the series in the seventh game despite leading three games to two after the fifth game and holding a lead with three minutes remaining in Game 7.<ref name="dbbheat" />

===NBA champion and Finals MVP (2005–06)===
[[File:Dwayne Wade.jpg|thumb|160px|Wade at the free throw line]]
By the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06 season]] Wade had developed into one of the most prominent players in the NBA and was elected to his second [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], this time a starter. In the [[2006 NBA All-Star Game|2006 All-Star Game]], Wade made the game winning put-back off of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]' [[Allen Iverson]]'s missed shot, to lead the East to a 122–120 victory over the West. He scored 20 points on 9/11 field goals in 30 minutes of play.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/allstar2006/allstar_game/ "2006 NBA All-Star Game."] ''www.nba.com.''

Against the [[Chicago Bulls]] in the first round of the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]], Wade shook off a few injuries that scared Heat fans, including a severely bruised hip in Game 5.<ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gametracker/recap/NBA_20060504_MIA@CHI "Shaq Daddy's double-double drops 'Baby Bulls' out of postseason."] ''www.cbs.sportsline.com'', May 4, 2006.

After this, Wade successfully led his team to the [[2006 NBA Finals]], despite suffering from [[flu]]-like symptoms in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Pistons.<ref name="flu">[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2006/series_detmia.html "Heat Headed To First NBA Finals."] ''www.nba.com.''

In his first trip to the NBA Finals, in which Miami faced off against the [[Dallas Mavericks]], Wade had some especially memorable moments. His performance in games three, four, and five, in which he scored 42, 36, and 43 points,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20060618/DALMIA/recap.html "Wade's heroics Have Heat One Win From Title."] ''www.nba.com'', June 8, 2006.

In the 2013–14 season, Wade played in 54 games due to injury and the team's decision to rest him during back-to-back games.  Wade averaged 19 points per game and posted a career high 54 percent field goal percentage, and had notable games in victories against elite teams such as a 32-point outing against the Pacers on November 7 and 29 points against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] on December 18. In the playoffs, the team increased Wade's minutes per game, noted by a 28-point performance in the closing game of Miami's second round victory over the [[Brooklyn Nets]] and a 23-point outing in a crucial game 2 road victory against Indiana in the Eastern Finals. The Heat would go on to win the series in six games, advancing to their fourth straight NBA Finals. Wade averaged 19.1 points a game during the playoffs on 52 percent shooting, his best percentage in a playoff run since 2010. The Heat would once again face the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the [[2014 NBA Finals]]. However, they would lose in five games.

==Player profile==
[[File:Dwyane Wade hanging on the rim.jpg|thumb|left|Wade's pre-game ritual consists of doing [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-ups]] at the rim.]]
Wade plays the [[shooting guard]] position, but is also capable of playing [[point guard]] as he did during his rookie season and in subsequent seasons with smaller lineups. On offense, he has established himself as one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best [[slasher (basketball)|slashers]] in the NBA. Wade's signature one-two step allows him to dash past bigger defenders and occasionally get the extra foul shot.<ref name="Holl">Hollinger, John. [http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/players/hollinger?statsId=3708 "Hollinger stats-Dwyane Wade."] ''www.espn.com.''

He has proven himself an unselfish player, averaging 6.1 [[assist (basketball)|assists per game]] throughout his career.<ref name="dbbb" /> After winning the [[NBA Finals MVP Award]] in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the premier clutch players in the NBA.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20060620/MIADAL/recap.html "Wade Leads Heat to First NBA Championship."] ''www.nba.com'', June 20, 2006.
