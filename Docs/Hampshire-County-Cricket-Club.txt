'''Hampshire County Cricket Club''' is one of eighteen [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket|county clubs]] within the domestic [[cricket]] structure of [[England]] and [[Wales]]. It represents the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Hampshire]]. Hampshire teams formed by earlier organisations, principally the [[Hambledon Club]], always had major status and so the county club was rated accordingly from inception: i.e., classified as an ''unofficial'' [[first-class cricket|first-class]] team by substantial sources from 1863 to 1885. Because of poor performances for several seasons, Hampshire then lost its status for nine seasons until it was invited into the [[County Championship]] in 1895.<ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |first= |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 – 1863|year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |first= |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}</ref> Hampshire is classified as an ''official'' first-class team from 1895 by [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and the County Championship clubs;<ref>Birley, p. 145.</ref> classified as a [[List A]] team since the beginning of [[limited overs cricket]] in 1963;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/130/List_A_Events.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=List A events played by Hampshire |accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref> and classified as a major [[Twenty20]] team since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/130/Twenty20_Events.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Twenty20 events played by Hampshire |accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>

The club was founded in 1863 as a successor to the [[Hampshire county cricket teams]] and played at the [[Antelope Ground]], [[Southampton]] from then until 1885, before moving to the [[County Ground, Southampton|County Ground]], also in Southampton, where it played from then until 2000, before moving to the purpose built [[Rose Bowl (cricket ground)|Rose Bowl]] in West End which is in the Borough of [[Eastleigh]]. In 1864 the club played its [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut, losing to [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at the Antelope Ground. Hampshire was never a champion county before the County Championship was officially founded in 1889; more often than not the results for the county were poor. As a result of this it lost its major status in 1885, but regained it 1895, the season in which it first featured in the County Championship. The club won its first title in 1961 and its second in 1973. These remain its only Championship titles.

Hampshire played their first [[list A cricket|one-day match]] in [[1963 Gillette Cup|1963]], but did not win their first one-day silverware until 1975 when the club won the [[Sunday League (cricket)|Sunday League]] which it won twice more, in 1978 and 1986.  It has twice won the [[Benson & Hedges Cup]], in 1988 and 1991; the [[Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy]] once in 2005 and the [[Friends Provident Trophy]] once in 2009.  Having first played [[Twenty20 cricket]] in 2003, Hampshire won the [[Friends Provident t20]] in 2010.  The County Championship was restructured in 2000, and at the end of the 2002 Hampshire was relegated for the first time. The club remained in the second division for three seasons and since 2004 had competed in the top tier.  However, the club was relegated once more in 2011.

[[Phil Mead]] is the club's leading run-scorer with 48,892&nbsp;runs in 700&nbsp;matches for Hampshire between 1905 and 1936. Fast bowler [[Derek Shackleton]] took 2,669&nbsp;wickets in 583&nbsp;first-class matches between 1948 and 1969 which remains a club record.  [[Alec Kennedy]], whose career lasted from 1907 to 1936, was the first player to score 10,000&nbsp;runs and take 1,000&nbsp;wickets for Hampshire.  [[Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie]] was both Hampshire last amateur captain and first professional captain.

==History==

===Earliest cricket===
{{See also|History of cricket to 1725}}
A Latin poem by Robert Matthew in 1647 contains a probable reference to cricket being played by pupils of [[Winchester College]] on nearby [[St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire|St. Catherine’s Hill]].  If authentic, this is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire.  But, with the sport having originated in Saxon or Norman times on the [[Weald]], it must have reached Hampshire long before 1647.  In 1680, lines written in an old Bible invite "All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets".  [[Marden, West Sussex|Marden]] is in [[Sussex]], north of [[Chichester]], and interestingly close to [[Hambledon, Hampshire|Hambledon]], which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire.  Hampshire is used in a team name for the first time in August 1729, when a combined Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex XI played against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]].

===Hambledon and after===
[[File:HambledonCCPitch.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Broadhalfpenny Down]], the original ground of the Hambledon Club]]
{{For|information about Hampshire county teams before the formation of Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire county cricket teams}}
The origin of the legendary [[Hambledon Club]] is lost.  There remains no definite knowledge of Hambledon cricket before 1756, when its team had gained sufficient repute to be capable of attempting three matches against [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]], itself a famous club since the 1720s if not earlier. Hambledon had presumably earned recognition as the best parish team in Hampshire, but no reports of their local matches have been found. We do not know when the Hambledon Club was founded and it seems likely that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, although there may well have been a patron involved.  The Sussex v Hampshire match in June 1766 is the earliest reference to Hampshire as an individual county team.  Whether the Hambledon Club was involved is unrecorded but presumably it was. Some historians believe it was at about this time that the club, as distinct from a parish organisation, was founded.  The Hambledon Club was in many respects a Hampshire county club for it organised Hampshire matches, although it was a multi-functional club and not dedicated to cricket alone. Its membership attracted large numbers of sporting gentry and it dominated the sport, both on and off the field, for about thirty years until the formation of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1787. Hambledon produced some legendary Hampshire players including master [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] and the two great fast bowlers [[Thomas Brett]] and [[David Harris (Hambledon cricketer)|David Harris]].  Following the demise of the Hambledon Club towards the end of the 18th century, Hampshire continued to be recognised as a major county into the 19th century. But after the 1828 season, Hampshire had long spells without any important matches until the county club was founded in 1864. The county played some important fixtures during 1842 to 1845 and one match versus [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] in 1861 but was otherwise outside cricket’s mainstream through 1829 to 1863.

===Origin of club===
[[File:James Southerton.JPG|thumb|right|200px| James Southerton, who played in the first ever [[Test cricket|Test match]] ]]
Hampshire County Cricket Club was founded on 12 August 1863<ref>''Guinness Book of Cricket Facts and Feats''</ref> and played its initial first-class match versus [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at the [[Antelope Ground]], [[Southampton]] on 7 and 8 July 1864, with Sussex winning by 10 wickets with [[James Lillywhite]] claiming ten wickets in the match for 80 runs, including taking his 100th wicket in [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches.<ref>{{cite web|date=7 July 1864|url= http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1333.html|title= Hampshire v Sussex, 1864|publisher=cricketarchive.com|accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref> The club was recognised as a [[first-class cricket|first-class]] team from 1864 and was a contender for the "Champion County" title.  This was not a permanent state of affairs, however.  In 1886, Hampshire ceased to be a first-class team after years of difficult circumstances and poor results.  It did play matches against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and Sussex in 1886 but these matches are not recognised as first-class. Hampshire did not recover first-class status until the beginning of the [[1895 County Championship]] season when it was readmitted to the now official County Championship.  Hampshire is thus recognised as first-class from 1864 to 1885 and from 1895 to the present day. In Hampshire's return to the [[1895 County Championship|County Championship]], the club finished the season in tenth place, some 16 points behind winners Surrey.<ref>{{cite web| year= 1895| url= http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1895.html| title= 1895 County Championship table| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=19 October 2009}}</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:CB Fry batting.jpg|thumb|left|200px| C.B. Fry who represented Hampshire between 1909–1921]]
Between 1900 and 1905, Hampshire were almost continuously struggling as their key officer-batsmen, [[Robert Poore|Major Poore]] and [[Teddy Wynyard|Captain Wynyard]] were faced with either moving to South Africa or increased military duties at home from the [[Boer War]]. The club finished last or equal last in 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905, failing to win a single game in the first of those seasons; however in 1901, with the temporary acquisition of [[J. G. Greig|Captain Greig]] from India and the qualification of [[Charlie Llewellyn]], Hampshire won as many games as it lost. From 1906 onwards, with the qualification of [[Phil Mead]], [[Jack Newman (English cricketer)|Jack Newman]] and later [[George Brown (cricketer, born 1887)|George Brown]], Hampshire became a much more competitive side, though not until 1910 did they win as many games as they lost in a season.

The period from 1912 to 1926, though they never got near [[County Championship]] honours, was to be the most successful for a long time in Hampshire’s history: in those eleven seasons they won 98 and lost 96 of 292 games – only once otherwise until 1954 did they win more games than they lost.<ref>Wynne-Thomas, Peter; '''The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records'''; pp. 55–59 ISBN 0-7270-1868-X</ref> Mead, Brown, Kennedy and Newman were in the prime during this period, and they had the services of [[Lionel Tennyson, 3rd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] who captained the side from 1919–1932 as well as captaining the England team in three Tests, and the occasional aid of many other amateurs including the great [[C. B. Fry]], who averaged an amazing 102 in seven games during [[1912 English cricket season|1912]]. In 1922, Hampshire won one of the most remarkable victories in County Championship history when, they defeated [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] by 155 runs after having followed on when dismissed for just 15. They scored 521 after being invited to bat again, set Warwickshire 314 to win and bowled them out for 158. Brown, with 172, and Livsey who scored 110* at number 10, were the heroes.<ref>{{cite web| url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Hampshire/Scorecards/10/10456.html| title= Warwickshire v Hampshire, 1922 (scorecard)| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref>

From 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With [[Stuart Boyes]] and [[Lofty Herman]] not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from [[1929 English cricket season|1929]] onwards. In 1937 [[Dick Moore (cricketer)|Dick Moore]] set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at [[Dean Park Cricket Ground]] in [[Bournemouth]]. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 [[Boundary (cricket)|fours]] and three sixes.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Hampshire/Scorecards/16/16325.html| title= Hampshire v Warwickshire, 1937 (scorecard)| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> After [[World War II]], [[Derek Shackleton]] became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by [[Victor Cannings]], but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and [[Peter Sainsbury]] around 100, with [[Roy Marshall]] was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time.

The following years were mixed: a rise to second in 1958 with [[Malcolm Heath]] replacing Cannings as Shackleton’s partner was followed by two disappointing years before Hampshire won the 1961 County Championship, their first ever County Championship success, finishing the season with 268 points, 18 ahead of Yorkshire. Hampshire won 19 of their 32 matches, losing only seven matches all season.<ref>{{cite web| date= 17 October 2009  | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1961.html| title= 1961 County Championship Table| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> The club were led by [[Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie]] with Marshall scoring the most runs for the club with 2,455. [[Derek Shackleton]] took the most wickets for the club with 153, and [[Butch White]]’s tearaway speed was equally dangerous in a dry summer.

Again, however, Hampshire were disappointing until [[Barry Richards]] joined the county in 1968, when they rose from tenth to fifth in the Championship and established themselves as a power in limited-overs cricket. [[Bob Cottam]] was the second-highest first-class wicket-taker in 1968 and the highest in 1969, but did not maintain this excellence before joining [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] and in 1970 and 1971 Hampshire fell to mid-table. In the 1973 County Championship Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time, winning the competition by 31 points from Surrey.<ref>{{cite web| date= 17 October 2009  | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1973.html| title= 1973 County Championship Table| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> The club won 10 of their 20 matches and drew the other 10. During this season they were led by [[Richard Gilliat]] with [[Gordon Greenidge]] scoring the most runs for the club with 1,620. [[Bob Herman]] and [[Mike Taylor (cricketer, born 1942)|Mike Taylor]] both took 63 wickets. This remains Hampshires last success in the tournament.  In 1979 West Indian [[Malcolm Marshall]], widely regarded as one of the best bowlers to grace the game joined the club. This was to be the start of a 14-year stay with the club. During that time Marshall would go on to take 824 first-class wickets at an anverage of 18.64<ref>{{cite web| date= 20 October 2009 | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/1/1571/f_Bowling_by_Team.html| title= Malcolm Marshall first-class breakdown by team| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> and 239 wickets at 24.88 in one-day cricket.<ref>{{cite web| date= 20 October 2009 | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/1/1571/a_Bowling_by_Team.html| title= Malcolm Marshall List A breakdown by team| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> 1984 also saw the last game of [[Venezuela]]n  captain [[Nick Pocock]] ([[Maracaibo]], 1951) and the  arrival of another West Indian, [[Cardigan Connor]] who would spend 14 years with the club. Regarded as one of the best players not to play [[Test cricket]], Connor took 614 first-class wickets for Hampshire at an average of 31.74<ref>{{cite web| date= 20 October 2009 | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/1/1571/f_Bowling_by_Team.html| title= Cardigan Connor first-class bowling record| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> and 411 wickets at 25.07 in one-day cricket.<ref>{{cite web| date= 20 October 2009 | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/1/1571/a_Bowling_by_Team.html| title= Cardigan Connor List A bowling record| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref>  In 1985 Hampshire finished second in the County Championship, finishing 18 points behind winners [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]]. [[Chris Smith (cricketer, born 1958)|Chris Smith]] led the way with the bat, scoring 1,720 runs.<ref>{{cite web| year= 1985| url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/ENG/Britannic_Assurance_County_Championship_1985/Hampshire_Batting.html| title= 1985 County Championship Hampshire batting averages| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> and was well backed up by the bowling of [[Malcolm Marshall]] who took 95 wickets at the impressive average of 17.68.<ref>{{cite web| year= 1985| url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/ENG/Britannic_Assurance_County_Championship_1985/Hampshire_Bowling.html| title= 1985 County Championship Hampshire bowling averages| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref>  Later in, 1988 the club won the [[Benson & Hedges Cup]] by beating [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] by 7 wickets at Lord's, largely thanks to a five wicket haul by [[Stephen Jefferies]]. The 1990s brought about further success in the first half of the decade, and later struggles in the latter half. In the 1991 County Championship season Hampshire won the [[1991 NatWest Trophy|NatWest Trophy]], defeating [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] by 4 wickets, with [[Shaun Udal]] claiming the man of the match award. This was the clubs first [[List-A cricket|one day]] honour in this competition. Hampshire again repeated their 1988 success in the Benson & Hedges Cup by winning the 1992 competition. In the final at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] they beat [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] by 41 runs, including 90 runs from [[Robin Smith (cricketer)|Robin Smith]] and three wickets each from [[Malcolm Marshall]] and Shaun Udal.  This marked Hampshire's second success in the competition. In 1996 Malcolm Marshall returned to coach the club. In 1997 work begun on Hampshire's long-awaited new ground. The realisation of this move almost led the club to financial ruin, as encouragement from financial partners [[Sport England]] and the hiring of architect [[Sir Michael Hopkins]] had led the then part-time voluntary committee running the club to lose control of the budget.<ref>{{cite web| date= 17 October 2009  | url=  http://www.rosebowlplc.com/news/from-groupie-to-godfather-/| title= Rod Bransgrove interview| publisher =rosebowlplc.com| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref>

The club ended up finishing in third place, twelve points behind winners Durham.<ref>{{cite web| date=24 September 2008 | url= http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/LV_County_Championship_2008.html| title= 2008 County Championship Division 1 table| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref>  On 25 July the club won the [[2009 Friends Provident Trophy]] final at Lord's, beating rivals [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]<ref>{{cite web| date=25 July 2009 | url= http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/204/204541.html| title= Hampshire v Sussex (scorecard)| publisher =cricketarchive.com| accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref> thanks to a man-of-the-match performance from [[Dominic Cork]], with him taking 4/41.  Hampshire created history by winning the [[2010 Friends Provident t20]] in front of home support after defeating Somerset – the first team to win a Twenty20 trophy on home turf in England and Wales. On 14 September 2011, in their four-day game against Warwickshire at The Rose Bowl, Hampshire were officially relegated to the County Championship Second Division. The 2012 season though, under new captain [[James Adams (cricketer, born 1980)|Jimmy Adams]] after the retirement of Cork, would prove to be highly successful for Hampshire with the county winning both the [[2012 Friends Life t20]]<ref>{{cite web| date=25 August 2012 | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/match/542720.html| title=Final: Yorkshire v Hampshire at Cardiff, Aug 25, 2012| publisher=ESPN Cricinfo| accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> - their 2nd [[Twenty20]] title, and the [[2012 Clydesdale Bank 40]] where a final ball dot ball from [[Kabir Ali]] led to Hampshire winning as a result of losing less wickets than opponents [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]].<ref>{{cite web| date=15 September 2012 | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/clydesdale-bank-40-2012/content/match/542849.html| title=Final: Hampshire v Warwickshire at Lord's, Sep 15, 2012 | publisher=ESPN Cricinfo | accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> Club legend [[Dimitri Mascarenhas]] played in both finals but retired at the end of the 2013 season.

He currently has over 16,000 runs in all formats for Hampshire]]However, despite constant success in limited overs cricket the county continued to struggle in [[First class cricket]] leading to coach [[Giles White]] moving into a Director of Cricket position and [[Dale Benkenstein]] being appointed the new coach at the beginning of 2014. He brought instant success as Hampshire won promotion as champions to the County Championship First Division with victory over [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] on 23 September 2014. The 2015 season was reasonable successful with Hampshire qualifying for a record 6th successive Twenty20 Finals Day, however their [[First class cricket|First class]] performances at the beginning of the season were poor leading to Adams' resignation as captain. [[James Vince]] took over as captain, having already become [[List A cricket|List A]] and [[Twenty20|T20]] captain previously, and led a revival as Hampshire won 4 from their last 5 games meaning that Hampshire completed the 'Great Escape' as victory over [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] in their final games thanks to 10 wickets from [[West Indies|West Indian]] [[Fidel Edwards]], and [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire's]] victory over [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] meant that Sussex and [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] were relegated to Division Two with Hampshire staying up.

In the winter of 2015 Hampshire completed the signing of [[England national cricket team|England]] seamer [[Reece Topley]] from [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]]. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and [[South Africa national cricket team|South African]] all rounder [[Ryan McLaren]] had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's [[Twenty20]] competition against the other team.<ref>{{cite web| date=14 January 2016 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/35312785 |title=Women's Cricket Super League:Six successful bids announced for new T20 league | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach Nick Denning as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the Southern Vipers.

===The Rose Bowl===
[[File:Rose Bowl, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Rose Bowl, seen before redevelopment started in 2009]]
{{details|Rose Bowl (cricket ground)}}
Hampshire play the majority of their home matches at The Rose Bowl. One reason for building the new Rose Bowl ground was to attract international cricket to the south coast of England. The old [[County Ground, Southampton|County Ground]], Hampshire's home since 1885, no longer had the capability to do this. Land in [[West End, Hampshire|West End]], on the outskirts of Southampton was chosen as the location for The Rose Bowl. Construction began in March 1997 and was completed in time for the [[2001 English cricket season|2001 season]].  Hampshire's first first-class match on the ground was against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], ending in a victory by 124 runs for Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web| date= 22 October 2009  | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/72/72089.html| title= First match at the Rose Bowl| publisher =[http://www.cricketarchive.com]| accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref>  In July 2008 the ground hosted the [[Twenty20 Cup]] final, with [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] defeating [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] by 3 runs in the final.  In August 2010, the ground hosted the [[2010 Friends Provident t20|Friends Provident t20]] finals day, in which history was created when Hampshire became the first team to win the tournament at their home ground as they defeated [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in dramatic scenes off the last ball of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosebowlplc.com/news/friends-provident-t20-final/ |title=Hampshire Cricket Club &#124; Wedding Venue &#124; Exhibitions & Meetings &#124; The Ageas Bowl - News |publisher=Rosebowlplc.com |date=2010-08-14 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref>  In 2011, [[England cricket team|England]] played their first [[Test cricket|Test match]] at the Rose Bowl during their series with [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]].

The ends are called the ''Pavilion End'' and the ''Northern End''.
