A '''house show''' or '''live event''' is a [[professional wrestling]] event produced by a major [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] that is not televised, though they can be recorded. Promotions use house shows mainly to cash in on the exposure that they and their wrestlers receive during televised events, as well as to test reactions to matches, wrestlers, and [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmicks]] that are being considered for the main televised programming.

House shows are often used to promote upcoming televised events, especially [[pay-per-view]]s, and will then feature matches between wrestlers who are scheduled to [[Work (professional wrestling)|work a match]] at the pay-per-view. This allows them to secure a 'feel' for each other's style and test out specific parts of matches planned for pay-per-view.

From the 1950s to late 1980s, most major matches and title changes happened at house shows, largely due to the costs to produce a TV show at the time, plus the lack of more modern technology making it significantly harder to tape a TV show. TV shows were taped in small studios, and featured [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squash match]]es, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Run-in|run-ins]], and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promos]] which revolved around feuds to be settled at the house show. Some of these big matches later aired, often scheduled "for TV time remaining", which usually ran out as the match built to a finish, hopefully making fans regret missing it and buy tickets to the next show. This changed in the 1990s as the formula for TV shows had changed completely by the time, largely due to the then-new ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' produced by the World Wrestling Federation (today known as WWE) which changed the way TV shows were taped and proved to be a huge success for the WWF. And later with the advent of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''. 

House shows are similar to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark matches]] with both being untelevised events. The only difference is that dark matches are untelevised matches in TV programs which were already being televised.

House shows are also often designed to make the [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] wrestlers to win most matches, largely to send the crowd home happy. Though, if a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] holds a title, the face may win by DQ if this is the case.

Since house shows are not televised, promotions do not usually deploy the setup for staging or [[pyrotechnics]] used for their television counterparts. In the past, a [[WWE]] house show would consist mainly of a ring, essential lighting, and a crowd.<ref name="bishop">{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2012/03/11/19488101.html |title=House show upgrade helps WWE show in East Lansing |last1=Bishop |first1=Matt |website=Slam! Sports |publisher=Canoe.ca |accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref> In late 2011, WWE invested US$1.5 million in production improvements, which included three [[LED]]-lit entrance stages (one for ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', one for ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' and one backup)<ref name="styles012012">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/wwe-debuts-new-live-event-set | title=WWE debuts set for live events | last1=Styles | first1=Joey | last2=Patts | first2=James | website=WWE.com | publisher=[[WWE]]| accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref> featuring a ramp and video display. They also began utilizing the arena's multimedia equipment to play wrestler entrance and promo videos.<ref name="bishop" /> Exceptions are made, however, when the events are held in areas the promotion does not often tape a televised event (''e.g.'' international tours) or in select markets. WWE often uses the full television set-up for their "home base" [[Madison Square Garden]], televised event or not.

Because house shows are not televised, sometimes controversial things occur during them (although this is rare) which might not happen on a televised show. For example, on May 19, 1996, the [[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|"MSG incident"]], which was also a rare example of a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]], occurred at a house show taped at [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the same show, [[The Bodydonnas]] lost their WWF Tag Team Championship to [[The Godwinns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321233|title=The Godwinns's First Reign|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

== Title changes ==
Most major promotions try to develop their [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angles]] only during televised shows and will rarely [[Professional wrestling booker|book]] a major development (such as a title change) for house shows. If there is a title change, the title usually changes back during the same show or at another show on the loop before another televised event. These changes are usually not mentioned on television and happen more frequently during tours in areas that get shows rarely.<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/08/16/162182.html|title=Final chapter for Booker T?|author=TJ Madigan|publisher=SLAM!

==== Unrecognized title changes ====

Some notable house show title changes include an August 10, 1987 match where [[The Fabulous Rougeaus|The Rougeau Brothers]] ([[Raymond Rougeau|Raymond]] and [[Jacques Rougeau|Jacques]]) went over the champion [[Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]) to take the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team championship]] in the Rougeau's home town of Montreal. This change (and the eventual "decision reversal") was only ever mentioned during segments taped specifically for and shown in the Montreal market. 

A similar incident occurred in 1990 when [[The Rockers]] ([[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Marty Jannetty]]) took the title from the Hart Foundation. During the match a problem with the ring ropes meant the match could not air on television as originally planned, so [[kayfabe]] President [[Jack Tunney]] "reversed the decision" in [[Bill Apter|print media]] which had reported the change before the decision not to air it was made. The match was not acknowledged on television at the time.<ref name=slam/>

==== WWF Championship ====
Even rarer is the top title of a promotion changing hands. This has occurred relatively few times, a notable occurrence including [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] winning the then [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Championship]] from [[Bob Backlund]] in 1994 at a live event in Madison Square Garden.

==== WWF/E Intercontinental Championship ====
On January 17, 1992, [[Jacques Rougeau|The Mountie]] beat [[Bret Hart]] in [[Springfield, MA]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]]. The reason this was done is because Hart was going through contract negotiations. He lost the title two days later to [[Roddy Piper]] at the [[1992 Royal Rumble]].

[[Shawn Michaels]] won his second Intercontinental title in [[Albany, NY]] from [[Marty Jannetty]] with help from his debuting bodyguard [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] on June 6, 1993.

On May 19, 1995, [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] beat [[Jeff Jarrett]] in a [[ladder match]] at the Montreal Forum for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Then Jarrett beat Ramon to regain the belt in a regular match two days later on May 21, in [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec]]. Although neither one of these house show matches was taped, the title changes are officially recognized by WWE on its website. On the ''Monday Night Raw'' following the Sunday night match in Trois-Rivieres, [[Vince McMahon]] informed the audience about the title changes from that weekend, and they were referenced several times in the weeks that followed on WWF television whenever Jarrett appeared on TV with the championship belt.

House show title changes can occur both to test the reaction of the win or as a "special treat" for a specific audience. [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] was given his first Intercontinental Championship win over [[Jeff Jarrett]] in [[Toronto]]<ref name=slam/><ref>{{cite book|last=Copeland|first=Adam|authorlink=Edge (wrestler)|title=Adam Copeland On Edge|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment Books|year=2004|page=130|isbn=978-1-4165-0523-5}}</ref> to excite the fans in Edge's hometown.<ref name=slam/> As per usual, he dropped the belt back to Jarrett the following evening at [[Fully Loaded (1999)|Fully Loaded]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Copeland|first=Adam|authorlink=Edge (wrestler)|title=Adam Copeland On Edge|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment Books|year=2004|page=131|isbn=978-1-4165-0523-5}}</ref> 

On August 10, 2003 in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] defeated [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] as Booker had suffered an injury.<ref name=slam/>

==== WWE Cruiserweight Championship ====
Title changes at house shows most commonly occur when a promotion is overseas promoting their brand. For example, [[James Maritato|Nunzio]] won the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]] from [[Juventud Guerrera]] in [[Rome]] on November 15, 2005.

==== WWF/E Women's Championship ====
At a [[France|French]] house show on April 24, 2007, [[Mickie James]] pinned [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] to win [[Melina Perez|Melina]]'s [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWE Women's Championship]] in a [[Triple Threat match|triple threat match]]. Two matches later, Melina had a one on one rematch with James and pinned her to recapture the title after. On its website WWE recognized both title changes, making James a three time Women's Champion and Melina a two-time Women's Champion.<ref name=wwetitle>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/|title=History of the Women's Championship|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>

The World Tag Team Championship changed hands again at a house show on December 13, 2008 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, when [[John Morrison and The Miz]] defeated [[Evan Bourne]] and [[Kofi Kingston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/20081213WorldTagChamps|title=History of the World Tag Team Championship - The Miz & John Morrison|date=2008-12-13|accessdate=2009-03-12|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> Evan Bourne & Kofi Kingston (Air Boom) dropped the Tag Team Titles to Primo & Epico (due to a suspension to Evan Bourne) at a House Show in Oakland, CA January 15 2012

==== WCW Television Championship ====
[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] and [[Chris Benoit]] traded the [[WCW World Television Championship]] back-and-forth on several house shows, with Booker (the official champion) always having the title back in time for ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''.
