'''Hispaniola''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''La Española''; [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Hispaniola''; [[Taíno (language)|Taíno]]: ''Haiti'')<ref name="anghiera"/><ref name="casas"/> is the [[List of islands by area|22nd-largest island in the world]], located in the [[Caribbean]] [[island group]], the [[Greater Antilles]]. It is the second largest island in the [[Caribbean]] after [[Cuba]], and the tenth [[List of islands by population|most populous island]] in the world.

Two sovereign nations share the {{convert|76192|km2|adj=on}} island. The [[Dominican Republic]], at {{convert|48445|km2|abbr=on}}, is nearly twice as large as its neighbor, [[Haiti]], which comprises {{convert|27750|km2|abbr=on}}. The only other shared island in the Caribbean is [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]], which is shared between [[France]] ([[Collectivity of Saint-Martin|Saint-Martin]]) and [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] ([[Sint Maarten]]).

Hispaniola is the site of the first European settlement in the Americas founded by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his voyages in 1492 and 1493.<ref name=embassy>{{cite web |url=http://www.domrep.org/gen_info.html |title=Embassy of the Dominican Republic, in the United States |accessdate=February 27, 2009}}</ref><ref name="cia.gov">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html Central America and Caribbean: Haiti, CIA World Factbook]</ref>

===Etymology===
The island was called by various names by its native people, the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]]. When Columbus took possession of the island in 1492, he named it ''Insula [[Hispania|Hispana]]'', meaning "the Spanish Island" in [[Latin]]<ref>"Quam protinus Hispanam dixi": [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/columbus.html EPISTOLA DE INSULIS NUPER REPERTIS] (Letter to Lord Raphael Sanchez, March 14, 1493).</ref> and ''La Isla Española'', meaning "the Spanish Island", in Spanish.<ref name=McIntosh>{{cite book |title=The Piri Reis Map of 1513 |first=Gregory C |last=McIntosh |publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8203-2157-8 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgRXuOWah7MC&pg=PA88&dq=Hispaniola+Espa%C3%B1ola}}</ref> [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] shortened the name to "Española", and when [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|Pietro Martyr d‘Anghiera]] detailed his account of the island in [[Latin]], he rendered its name as ''Hispaniola''.<ref name=McIntosh/>

[[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés|Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]] and de las Casas documented that the island was called ''Haiti'' ("Mountainous Land") by the Taíno. D'Anghiera added another name, ''Quizqueia'' (supposedly "Mother of all Lands"), but later research shows that the word does not seem to derive from the original [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] Taíno language.<ref name="anghiera">{{cite book| last = Anglería| first =  Pedro Mártir de| title = Décadas del Nuevo Mundo, Tercera Década, Libro&nbsp;VII| publisher = Editorial Bajel| year = 1949| location = Buenos Aires| language = Spanish }}</ref> Although the Taínos use of ''Haiti'' is verified and the name was used by all three historians, evidence suggests that it probably was not the Taíno name of the whole island. However, Haiti was the Taíno name of a region (now known as ''[[Los Haitises National Park|Los Haitises]]'') in the northeastern section of the present-day Dominican Republic. In the oldest documented map of the island, created by Andrés de Morales, that region is named ''Montes de Haití'' ("Haiti Mountains"). Las Casas apparently named the whole island Haiti on the basis of that particular region;<ref name="casas">{{cite book| last = Las Casas| first =  Fray Bartolomé de| title = Apologética Histórica Sumaria| publisher = UNAM| year = 1966| location = Mexico| language = Spanish }}</ref> d'Anghiera said that the name of one part was given to the whole island.<ref name="anghiera" />

Due to Taíno, Spanish and French influences on the island, historically the whole island was often referred to as ''Haiti,'' ''Hayti,'' ''Santo Domingo,'' ''St. Domingue,'' or ''San Domingo,'' which didn't favor either side of the island as the locality of these names could have been anywhere on Hispaniola. Only recently has the term of Hispaniola come into use as a name for the geographic unit. The colonial terms ''[[Saint-Domingue]]'' and ''[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]'' are sometimes still applied to the whole island, though these names refer, respectively, to the colonies that became Haiti and the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Albert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hL2JlqVLuP4C&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq=names+of+hispaniola&source=bl&ots=0srHDtycs8&sig=aYjtKeSsFWQVsDKfCG_atFNDIS4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNkqVYj-LI33yQTd04HgAg&ved=0CGYQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=names%20of%20hispaniola&f=false |title=The Butterflies of Hispaniola |page=10 |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-8130-0902-5 |accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref>

Since Anghiera's literary work was translated into [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] in a short period of time, the name "Hispaniola" became the most frequently used term in English-speaking countries for the island in scientific and cartographic works. In 1918, the United States occupation government presided by [[Harry Shepard Knapp]] obliged the use of the name Hispaniola on the island, and recommended the use of that name to the [[National Geographic Society]].<ref>{{cite book|last1={{Smallcaps|Castillo Pantaleón}}|first1=Juan Miguel|title=La Nacionalidad Dominicana|date=2012|publisher=Editora Nacional, Ministerio de Cultura|location=Santo Domingo|isbn=978-9945-469-97-4|page=329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcJBAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA328|accessdate=15 June 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref>

The name ''Haïti'' was adopted by Haitian revolutionary [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] in 1804, as the official name of independent Saint-Domingue, as a tribute to the Amerindian predecessors. It was also adopted as the official name of independent Santo Domingo as the ''[[Republic of Spanish Haiti]],'' which was a brief independent state that resulted from the defeat of Spanish colonialists from Santo Domingo on November 9, 1821, led by General [[José Núñez de Cáceres]] until being annexed by Haiti in February, 1822.<ref name="allempires">{{cite web | last = Lancer | first = Jalisco | title = The Conflict Between Haiti and the Dominican Republic | publisher = All Empires Online History Community | url = http://www.allempires.info/article/index.php?q=conflict_haiti_dominican | accessdate = 2007-12-24 }}</ref><ref name="flag">{{cite web | title = Haiti - Historical Flags | work = Flags of the World | url = http://www.flag.de/FOTW/flags/ht-hist.html#span | accessdate = 2007-12-24 }}</ref>

''Quisqueya'' (from ''Quizqueia'') although used on both sides of the island is mostly adopted in the Dominican Republic.

===Post-Columbian===
[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|thumbnail|left|Columbus landing on Hispaniola]]
[[Christopher Columbus]] inadvertently landed on the island during his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492, where his flagship, the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'', sank after running aground on December 25. A contingent of men were left at an outpost christened [[La Navidad]] on the north coast of present-day [[Haiti]]. On his return the subsequent year, on 22 November 1493 significantly,<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/articles/some-facts-about-christopher-columbus.html Voyage 2 - Columbus and Dominica [[Isabella I of Castile]] ]</ref> following the destruction of La Navidad by the local population, Columbus quickly established a second compound farther east in present-day [[Dominican Republic]], [[La Isabela]].

The island was inhabited by the [[Taíno people|Taíno]], one of the indigenous [[Arawak peoples]]. The Taino were at first tolerant of Columbus and his crew, and helped him to construct [[La Navidad]] on what is now [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas]], Haiti, in December 1492. European colonization of the island began in earnest the following year, when 1,300 men arrived from [[Spain]] under the watch of [[Bartolomeo Columbus]]. In 1496 the town of ''Nueva Isabela'' was founded. After being destroyed by a [[hurricane]], it was rebuilt on the opposite side of the Ozama River and called [[Santo Domingo]]. It is the oldest permanent European settlement in the Americas.

As Spain conquered new regions on the mainland of the Americas, its interest in Hispaniola waned, and the colony’s population grew slowly. By the early 17th century, the island and its smaller neighbors (notably [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]) became regular stopping points for [[Piracy in the Caribbean|Caribbean pirates]]. In 1606, the government of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] ordered all inhabitants of Hispaniola to move close to Santo Domingo, to avoid interaction with pirates. Rather than secure the island, his action meant that French, English and Dutch pirates established their own bases on the abandoned north and west coasts of the island.

[[File:Map of Hispaniola.JPG|thumb|300px|French map of Hispaniola by Nicolas de Fer]]
In 1665, French colonization of the island was officially recognized by [[Louis XIV|King Louis&nbsp;XIV]]. The French colony was given the name [[Saint-Domingue]]. In the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], Spain formally ceded the western third of the island to France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266962/Hispaniola |title=Hispaniola Article |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cardiostart.org/blog/ |title=Dominican Republic 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> Saint-Domingue quickly came to overshadow the east in both [[wealth]] and [[population]]. Nicknamed the "Pearl of the Antilles," it became the richest and most prosperous colony in the [[West Indies]], with a system of human enslavement used to grow and harvest sugar cane, during a time when demand for sugar was high in Europe. Slavery kept prices low and profit was maximized at the expense of human lives. It was an important port in the Americas for goods and products flowing to and from France and Europe.

With the treaty of [[Peace of Basel]], revolutionary France emerged as a major European power. In the second 1795 Treaty of Basel (July 22), Spain ceded the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, later to become the Dominican Republic. French settlers had begun to colonize some areas in the Spanish side of the territory.

European colonists often died young due to tropical fevers, as well as from slave resistance in the late eighteenth century. When the [[French Revolution]] abolished slavery in the colonies on February 4, 1794, it was a European first,<ref>Popkin, Jeremy D. (2008) ''Facing Racial Revolution: Eyewitness Accounts of the Haitian Insurrection''. pp. 184–213. ISBN 0226675831</ref> and when Napoleon [[Law of 20 May 1802|reimposed slavery in 1802]] it led to a major upheaval by the emancipated black slaves.

Thousands succumbed to a [[yellow fever]] during the summer months and more than half of the French army died because of disease.<ref name=Bollet_2004>{{cite book | last= Bollet | first= A.J. |  title= Plagues and Poxes: The Impact of Human History on Epidemic Disease | pages=48–49 | publisher= Demos Medical Publishing | year= 2004 | isbn = 1-888799-79-X }}</ref> After the French removed the surviving 7,000 troops in late 1803, the leaders of the revolution declared the new nation of independent Haiti in early 1804.

Fearing the influence of a society that had successfully fought and won against their enslavers, the United States and European powers refused to recognize Haiti, the second republic in the western hemisphere. In addition, the US maintained an arms and goods embargo against the country during the years of its own conflict with Great Britain. France demanded a high payment for compensation to slaveholders who lost their property, and Haiti was saddled with unmanageable debt for decades.<ref name="natural">Diamond, Jared M. and Robinson, James A. (2011) ''Natural Experiments of History''. pp. 126–128.

==Geography==
{{see also|Geography of Haiti|Geography of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Hispaniola lrg.jpg|thumb|300px|Topographic map of Hispaniola]]
Hispaniola is the second-largest island in the [[Caribbean]] (after [[Cuba]]), with an area of {{convert|76192|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, {{convert|48440|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dr.html Central America and Caribbean: Dominican Republic, CIA World Factbook]</ref> of which is under the sovereignty of the [[Dominican Republic]] occupying the eastern portion and {{convert|27750|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}<ref name="cia.gov"/> under the sovereignty of [[Haiti]] occupying the western portion.

The island of Cuba lies {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} to the northwest across the [[Windward Passage]]; to the southwest lies [[Jamaica]], separated by the [[Jamaica Channel]]. [[Puerto Rico]] lies east of Hispaniola across the [[Mona Passage]]. [[The Bahamas]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] lie to the north. Its westernmost point is known as Cap Carcasse.

Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico are collectively known as the [[Greater Antilles]]. The Greater Antilles are made up of [[continent]]al rock.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The island has five major mountain ranges: The Central Range, known in the Dominican Republic as the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'', spans the central part of the island, extending from the south coast of the Dominican Republic into northwestern Haiti, where it is known as the ''Massif du Nord''. This mountain range boasts the highest peak in the Antilles, [[Pico Duarte]] at {{convert|3087|m|ft|sp=us}} above [[sea level]]. The ''[[Cordillera Septentrional]]'' runs parallel to the Central Range across the northern end of the Dominican Republic, extending into the Atlantic Ocean as the [[Samaná Peninsula]]. The ''Cordillera Central'' and ''Cordillera Septentrional'' are separated by the lowlands of the [[Cibao|Cibao Valley]] and the Atlantic coastal plains, which extend westward into Haiti as the ''Plaine du Nord'' (Northern Plain). The lowest of the ranges is the ''Cordillera Oriental'', in the eastern part of the country.

The ''Sierra de Neiba'' rises in the southwest of the Dominican Republic, and continues northwest into Haiti, parallel to the ''Cordillera Central'', as the ''Montagnes Noires'', ''Chaîne des Matheux'' and the ''Montagnes du Trou d'Eau''. ''The Plateau Central'' lies between the ''Massif du Nord'' and the ''Montagnes Noires'', and the ''Plaine de l‘Artibonite'' lies between the ''Montagnes Noires'' and the ''Chaîne des Matheux'', opening westward toward the [[Gulf of Gonâve]], the largest gulf of the Antilles.

The southern range begins in the southwestern most Dominican Republic as the Sierra de Bahoruco, and extends west into Haiti as the Massif de la Selle and the Massif de la Hotte, which form the mountainous spine of Haiti’s southern peninsula. [[Pic la Selle|Pic de la Selle]] is the highest peak in the southern range, the third highest peak in the Antilles and consequently the highest point in Haiti, at {{convert|2680|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level. A [[Depression (geology)|depression]] runs parallel to the southern range, between the southern range and the ''Chaîne des Matheux''-''Sierra de Neiba''. It is known as the ''[[Plaine du Cul-de-Sac]]'' in Haiti, and Haiti’s capital [[Port-au-Prince]] lies at its western end. The depression is home to a chain of [[salt lake]]s, including [[Etang Saumâtre|Lake Azuei]] in Haiti and [[Lake Enriquillo]] in the Dominican Republic.

The island has four distinct [[ecoregion]]s. The [[Hispaniolan moist forests]] ecoregion covers approximately 50% of the island, especially the northern and eastern portions, predominantly in the lowlands but extending up to {{convert|2100|m|ft|sp=us}} elevation. The [[Hispaniolan dry forests]] ecoregion occupies approximately 20% of the island, lying in the [[rain shadow]] of the mountains in the southern and western portion of the island and in the [[Cibao]] valley in the center-north of the island. The [[Hispaniolan pine forests]] occupy the mountainous 15% of the island, above {{convert|850|m|ft}} elevation. The [[flooded grasslands and savannas]] ecoregion in the south central region of the island surrounds a chain of lakes and lagoons in which the most notable include that of [[Etang Saumatre|Lake Azuei]] and [[Trou Caïman]] in Haiti and the nearby [[Lake Enriquillo]] in the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

[[File:Haiti deforestation.jpg|thumbnail|235x235px|right|Satellite image depicting the border between [[Haiti]] (left) and the [[Dominican Republic]] (right)]]

In Haiti, [[Deforestation in Haiti|deforestation]] has long been cited by scientists as a source of ecological crisis; the timber industry dates back to French colonial rule.

Haiti has seen a dramatic reduction of forests due to the excessive and increasing use of [[charcoal]] as fuel for cooking, to the point that today less than 2% of Haitian territory is covered by forest.<ref>[http://www.un.org/spanish/News/story.asp?newsID=20666#.Uvg-7mJdWDo ONU - República Dominicana subraya descontento por desigualdad en Haití]</ref> The consequence has been that most Haitians rivers have dried up, its fertile agricultural land has decreased and the Haitian territory is becoming desertified. In the extreme northwest, on the peninsula of San Nicolas, there has emerged the largest desert in the [[Antilles]] and it continues to expand due to the widespread [[deforestation]]. Most Haitian mountain ranges look totally deforested and in many cases the rains have removed sediment, exposing the rock foundation of the mountains and doing catastrophic irreversible [[ecological]] damage.

In the [[Dominican Republic]] the forest cover has increased. In 2003 the Dominican forest cover had been reduced to 32% of the territory, but in 2011 the trend towards reducing reverts to increase [[forest]] cover by eight percentage points to stand at nearly 40% of territory. The success of the Dominican forest growth is due to several Dominican government policies and private organizations for the purpose, and a strong educational campaign that has resulted in increased awareness on the [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican people]] of the importance of forests for their welfare and in other forms of life on the [[island]].<ref>[http://www.funglode.org/notice/republica-dominicana-aumenta-su-cobertura-boscosa-a-39-7/ FUNGLODE - República Dominicana aumenta su cobertura boscosa a 39.7%]</ref>

===Climate===

[[File:Cordillera Central.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic]]]]
Owing to its mountainous topography, Hispaniola’s climate shows considerable variation over short distance, and is the most varied of all the [[Antilles]].<ref name="areal">{{cite journal |last=Alpert |first=Leo |title=The Areal Distribution of Mean Annual Rainfall Over the Island of Hispaniola|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1941)069<0201:TADOMA>2.0.CO;2|year=1941|volume=69|pages=201|journal=Monthly Weather Review|issue=7}}</ref>

Except in the Northern Hemisphere summer season, the predominant winds over Hispaniola are the northeast [[trade winds]]. As in Jamaica and Cuba, these winds deposit their moisture on the northern mountains and create a distinct [[rain shadow]] on the southern coast, where some areas receive as little as {{convert|400|mm|in|0}} of rainfall and have [[semi-arid climate]]s. Annual rainfalls under {{convert|600|mm|in|0}} also occur on the southern coast of Haiti’s northwest peninsula and in the central Azúa region of the ''Plaine du Cul-de-Sac''. In these regions, moreover, there is generally little rainfall outside hurricane season from August to October and droughts are by no means uncommon when hurricanes do not come.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Camberlin |first=Pierre |doi=10.3354/cr00856|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/49/82/26/PDF/camberlin_CR_revised.pdf|title=More variable tropical climates have a slower demographic growth|year=2010|journal=Climate Research|volume=41|pages=157}}</ref>
[[File:View of Haitian Landscape hispaniola.jpg|thumbnail|Landscape, [[Haiti]]]]

On the northern coast, in contrast, rainfall may peak between December and February, though some rain falls in all months of the year. Annual amounts typically range from {{convert|1700|to|2000|mm|in|0}} on the northern coastal lowlands;<ref name="areal"/> there is probably much more in the [[Cordillera Septentrional]], though no data exist.

The interior of Hispaniola, along with the southeastern coast centred around Santo Domingo, typically receive around {{convert|1400|mm|in|0}} per year with a distinct wet season from May to October. Usually this wet season has two peaks: one around May, the other around the hurricane season. In the interior highlands rainfall is much greater, around {{convert|3100|mm|in}} per year, but with a similar pattern to that observed in the central lowlands.

As is usual for tropical islands, variations of temperature are much less marked than with rainfall and depend only on altitude. Lowland Hispaniola is generally oppressively hot and humid, with temperatures averaging {{convert|28|C|F}} with high humidity during the daytime and around {{convert|20|C|F}} at night. At higher altitudes, temperatures fall steadily, so that [[frost]]s occur during the dry season on the highest peaks, where maxima are no higher than {{convert|18|C|F}}.

==Demographics==
[[File:La espanola.JPG|left|thumbnail|315x315px]]The island is divided into two sovereign states: the Dominican Republic, which occupies most of the island and is the heir to the Spanish province of Santo Domingo; and the Republic of Haiti which occupies the western third of the island.

The Dominican Republic is a [[Hispanophone]] nation of approximately 10 million people. Spanish is spoken by all Dominicans as a primary language. Roman Catholicism is the official and dominant religion.

Haiti is a [[Francophone countries|Francophone nation]] of roughly 10 million people. Although French is spoken as a primary language by the educated and wealthy minority, virtually the entire population speaks [[Haitian Creole]], one of several French-derived creole languages. Roman Catholisism is the dominant religion, practiced by more than half the population, although in some cases in combination with [[Haitian Vodou]] faith. Another 25% of the populace belong to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html</ref> Haiti emerged as the first Black republic<ref>http://www.palmbeachschools.org/pao/creole/documents/HaitiansHeroesandHaitiPostersPDF.pdf</ref> in the world, and is the poorest in Latin America.

===Ethnic composition===

The ethnic composition of the Dominican population is 73% Mixed, 16% white and 11% black.

The ethnic composition of Haiti is estimated to be 95% black, 5% white and mixed.

==Economics==
