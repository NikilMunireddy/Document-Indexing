Hamlet (place)

[[File:Waldkirch Oberwil.jpg|thumb|Oberwil in [[Waldkirch, St. Gallen]], Switzerland is an example of a hamlet.]]

A '''hamlet''' is a type of [[Human settlement|settlement]]. The definition of hamlet varies by [[country]]. It usually refers to a small settlement, with a small population that is usually under 100, in a [[rural]] area, or a component of a larger settlement or municipality. Hamlets are typically [[unincorporated community|unincorporated communities]].

== Etymology ==
The word comes from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''hamelet(t)e'', corresponding to [[Old French]] ''hamelet'', the diminutive of Old French ''hamel''. This, in turn, is a diminutive of Old French ''ham'', possibly borrowed from [[Franconian languages]]. Compare with modern [[French language|French]] ''Hameau'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''heem'', [[German language|German]] ''Heim'', [[Old English]] ''hām'' and [[Modern English]] ''home''.<ref>T. F. Hoad, ''English Etymology'', Oxford University Press, 1993, ISBN 0-19-283098-8.</ref>

== Bangladesh ==
In [[Bangladesh]], Hamlet is known as "Para" or "Paara" ([[Bengali language]]: পাড়া). A [[village]] is divided by more than one "Para". That is the smallest partition of a place in Bangladesh. Each para contains some families, or a group of [[Family|families]].

== Canada ==
In [[Canada]]'s three [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]], hamlets are officially designated [[municipalities]].<ref name="StatCanMuniStatus">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/92f0009x/92f0009x2010000-eng.pdf |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |title=Interim List of Changes to Municipal Boundaries, Status, and Names (From January 2, 2009 to January 1, 2010) |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> As of January 1, 2010:

In Canada's provinces, hamlets are usually small [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] communities within a larger [[municipality]], such as many communities within the [[single-tier municipality|single-tier municipalities]] of [[Ontario]]{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} or within [[Alberta]]'s [[Specialized municipalities of Alberta|specialized]] and [[List of communities in Alberta#Rural municipalities|rural]] municipalities.<ref name="MuniLocationsAB">{{cite web |url=http://www.municipalaffairs.alberta.ca/documents/msb/2010-ruralmun.pdf |author=Alberta Municipal Affairs |authorlink=Alberta Municipal Affairs |title=Specialized and Rural Municipalities and Their Communities |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref>

== France ==
During the 18th century, for rich or [[nobility|noble]] people, it was up-to-date to create their own ''hameau'' (hamlet) in their gardens. They were a group of some houses or farms with rustic appearance, but in fact were very comfortable. The best known in the [[Hameau de la Reine]] built by the queen [[Marie-Antoinette]] in the park of the [[Château de Versailles]]. Or the [[Hameau de Chantilly]] built by [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé]] in [[Chantilly, Oise]].

''Lieu-dit'' (local name) is another name for hamlet. The difference is that a hamlet is permanently inhabited, but a lieu-dit is not (in winter for example, or when the lieu-dit is only an important road crossing).

== Germany ==
In [[Germany]] hamlets are called ''Weiler'' ({{IPA-de|ˈva͡ɪlɐ|lang}}). They are often part of bigger [[village]]s and municipalities. Most German hamlets are situated in [[Bavaria]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Hesse]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  In the low Saxon dialect of northwestern Germany hamlets are called ''Bauerschaft''.

== India ==
In different states of [[India]], there are different words for hamlet. In [[Gujarat]] a hamlet is called a "nesada," which are more prevalent in the [[Gir Forest National Park|Gir forest]]. In [[Maharashtra]] it's called a "paadaa". In southern Bihar, especially in the [[Magadh division]], a hamlet is called a "bigha".

== Indonesia ==
[[File:DSC00029 Java Little Sundanais Traditional Village Kampung Naga (6219569245).jpg|thumb|The hamlet [[Kampung Naga]] in [[West Java]] Province, Indonesia]]
All over [[Indonesia]], hamlets are translated as "small village", or ''kampung''. They are known as ''dusun'' in Central Java and East Java, ''banjar'' in Bali, ''jorong'' or ''kampuang'' in [[West Sumatra]].

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan a hamlet is called a "gaon" (pronounced as "wow" with some nasilisation at the end).

== Romania ==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Romania}}
In [[Romania]] hamlets are called ''cătunuri'' (singular: ''[[:ro:Cătun|cătun]]''), and they represent villages that contain several houses at most. They are legally considered villages, and statistically, they are placed in the same category. Like villages, they do not have a separate administration, and thus are not an administrative division, but are part of a parent [[Communes of Romania|commune]].

==Switzerland==
In the four national languages hamlets are known as ''Weiler'' ([[German language|German]]), ''hameaux'' ([[French language|French]]), ''frazioni'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]) and ''fracziun'' ([[Romansh language|Romansh]]).  A hamlet is always part of a larger [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]] or may be shared between two municipalities.  The difference between a hamlet and a village is that typically a hamlet lacks a compact core settlement and lacks a central building such as a church or inn.  However, some hamlets (''Kirchwiler'') may have grown up as an unplanned settlement around a church.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Projektteam SINUS |title= Landschaftsökologische Strukturmerkmale als Indikatoren der Nachhaltigkeit, Spatial INdices for LandUSe Sustainability (SINUS)|url= http://131.130.59.133/projekte/sinus/pdf/kap10.pdf |publisher= University of Vienna |page= 308-317|accessdate=16 May 2013}}</ref>  There is no population limit that defines a hamlet and some hamlets have a larger population than some of the smallest municipalities.  Generally there are no street names in a hamlet; rather, addresses are given by hamlet name and a number.  House numbers might start at one side of the hamlet and continue to the other side or may have no clear organization.

A hamlet may form or have formed a [[Bürgergemeinde]] (legal place of citizenship regardless of where a person was born or currently lives) and may own common property for the Bürgergemeinde.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the word 'hamlet' has no defined legal meaning, although hamlets are recognised as part of [[land use planning]] policies and administration. A hamlet is traditionally defined [[ecclesiastic]]ally as a [[village]] or settlement that usually does not have its own [[church (building)|church]],<ref>Greg Stevenson (2006) [http://web.archive.org/web/20060823165408/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/restoration/2006/exploring_brit_villages_01.shtml "What is a Village?"], ''Exploring British Villages'', BBC, accessed 20 December 2011</ref> belonging to a [[parish]] of another village or town.  In modern usage it generally refers to a secondary settlement in a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]], after the main settlement (if any). Hamlets may have been formed around a single source of economic activity such as a farm, mill, mine or harbour that employed its working population. Some hamlets, particularly those that have a [[medieval]] church, may be the result of the [[Deserted medieval village|depopulation of a village]]; an example of such a hamlet is [[Dowsby#Graby|Graby]].

The term hamlet was used in some parts of the country {{clarify|date=June 2009|<!-- which country Eng/Wal/Scot/NI? -->}} for a geographical subdivision of a parish (which might or might not contain a settlement). Elsewhere, these subdivisions were called "townships" or "tithings".<ref>Kain R J P, Oliver R D, ''Historic Parishes of England & Wales'',HDS, 2001, ISBN 0-9540032-0-9, p 12</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/types/status_page.jsp?unit_status=Hmlt |title=Status definition: Hamlet |work=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=Great Britain Historical GIS Project |accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref>

In the [[Scottish Highlands]] the term ''[[clachan]]'', of Gaelic derivation, may be preferred to the term "hamlet".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=2540&startset=6123628&query=CLACHAN&fhit=clachan&dregion=form&dtext=snd#fhit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404033415/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=2540&startset=6123628&query=CLACHAN&fhit=clachan&dregion=form&dtext=snd|archivedate=4 April 2012 |title=Clachan |publisher=Dictionary of the Scots Language |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> Also found in [[Scotland]] more generally is "fermtoun" used in the specific case of a settlement of agricultural workers' homes.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In [[Northern Ireland]] the common Irish place name element ''baile'' is sometimes considered equivalent to the term "hamlet" in English, although ''baile'' would actually have referred to what is known in English today as a [[townland]]: that is to say, a geographical locality rather than a small village.

== United States ==

=== Mississippi ===
In Mississippi, a 2009 state law (§ 17-27-5) set aside the term "municipal historical hamlet" to designate any former city, town or village with a current population of less than six hundred (600) inhabitants that lost its charter before 1945. The first such designation was applied to the town of [[Bogue Chitto, Lincoln County, Mississippi]].

=== New York ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of New York}}
In [[New York]], hamlets are [[unincorporated community|unincorporated settlements]] within [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|towns]].  Hamlets are usually not legal entities and have no local government or official boundaries. Their approximate locations will often be noted on road signs, however.

A hamlet usually depends upon the town that contains it for municipal services and government. A hamlet could be described as the rural or suburban equivalent of a neighborhood in a city or village. The area of a hamlet may not be exactly defined and may simply be contained within the [[ZIP code]] of its post office, or may be defined by its school or fire district. Some hamlets proximate to urban areas are sometimes continuous with their cities and appear to be neighborhoods, but they still are under the jurisdiction of the town.  Some hamlets, such as [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]] in the [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Town of Hempstead]], with a population of over 50,000, are more populous than some incorporated cities in the state. Others, like [[Bellmore, New York|The Bellmores]] in the [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Town of Hempstead]], have a population of 16,218.

=== Oregon ===
{{main|Hamlet (Oregon)}}
In [[Oregon]], specifically in [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas County]], a hamlet is a form of local government for small communities, which allows the citizens therein to organize and co-ordinate community activities.  Hamlets do not provide services such as utilities or fire protection, and do not have the authority to levy [[taxes]] or fees.  There are four hamlets in Oregon: [[Beavercreek, Oregon|Beavercreek]], [[Mulino, Oregon|Mulino]], [[Molalla Prairie, Oregon|Molalla Prairie]], and [[Stafford, Oregon|Stafford]].

==Vietnam==
In [[Vietnam]] hamlet (''xóm'', ''ấp'') is the lowest unofficial subdivision. It is a subdivision of a commune (''xã'').
