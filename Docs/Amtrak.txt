The '''National Railroad Passenger Corporation''', [[doing business as]] '''Amtrak''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|t|r|æ|k}}, is a partially government-funded American passenger [[Rail transport#Passenger trains|railroad]] service.

From the mid-19th century until about 1920, nearly all intercity travelers in the United States moved by rail.<ref name="Schafer 2001">{{Harvnb|Schafer|Welsh|Holland|2001}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2015}} Historically, passenger trains in the US were owned and operated by the same privately owned companies that operated freight trains. About 65,000 railroad passenger cars operated in 1929.<ref name="Carper-1968-112-113">{{Harvnb|Carper|1968|pp=112–113}}</ref>

From 1920 into the later 20th century, passenger rail's popularity diminished and there was a series of pullbacks and tentative recoveries. Rail passenger revenues declined dramatically between 1920 and 1934 because of the rise of the automobile.<ref name="Schafer 2001"/>{{page needed|date=July 2015}} In the same period, many travelers were lost to interstate bus companies such as [[Greyhound Lines]]. However, in the mid-1930s, railroads reignited popular imagination with service improvements and new, diesel-powered [[streamliner]]s, such as the gleaming silver ''[[Pioneer Zephyr]]'' and ''[[Flying Yankee]]''.<ref name="Schafer 2001"/>{{page needed|date=July 2015}} Even with the improvements, on a relative basis, traffic continued to decline, and by 1940 railroads held 67 percent of passenger-miles in the United States.<ref name="Schafer 2001"/>{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

[[World War II]] broke the malaise; passenger traffic soared sixfold thanks to troop movements and restrictions on automobile fuel.<ref name="Schafer 2001"/>{{page needed|date=July 2015}} After the war, railroads rejuvenated overworked and neglected fleets with fast and often luxurious streamliners – epitomized by the ''[[Super Chief]]'' and ''[[California Zephyr]]'' – which inspired the last major resurgence in passenger rail travel.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The postwar resurgence was short-lived. In 1946, there remained 45 percent fewer passenger trains than in 1929,<ref name="Schafer 2001"/>{{page needed|date=July 2015}} and the decline quickened despite railroad optimism. Passengers disappeared and so did trains. Few trains generated profits; most produced losses. Broad-based passenger rail deficits appeared as early as 1948<ref name="Schafer 2001"/>{{page needed|date=July 2015}} and by the mid-1950s railroads claimed aggregate annual losses on passenger services of more than $700&nbsp;million (almost $5&nbsp;billion in 2005 dollars when adjusted for inflation).<ref name="Carper-1968-112-113"/><ref name="mw-williamson1">{{cite web |url= http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/ |title= Six Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount, 1774 to Present |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |last= Williamson |first= Samuel H. |year= 2008 |publisher=MeasuringWorth | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080521024144/http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/| archivedate= May 21, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hosmer|1958}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

====Causes of the decline of privately operated passenger rail service====
The causes of the decline of passenger rail in the United States were complex. Until 1920, rail was the only practical form of intercity transport, but the industry was subject to government regulation and labor inflexibility.<ref name="MorganD" /><ref name="SlasonT" /> By 1930, the railroad companies had constructed, with private funding, a vast and relatively efficient transportation network.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

When the federal government began to construct the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], the railroads found themselves faced with unprecedented competition for passengers and freight with automobiles, buses, trucks, and aircraft, all of which were heavily subsidized by the government road and airport building programs. In 1916, the amount of track in the United States peaked at {{convert|254251|mi|km}}, compared to {{convert|140695|mi|km}} in 2007 (although it remained the largest rail network of any country in the world).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=220263 |title=Railroads|work=Funk & Wagnall's New Encyclopedia|publisher=History.com|year=2006|accessdate=February 6, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080423135710/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=220263 |archivedate = April 23, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html|title=United States|work=CIA World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=February 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100205194235/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html| archivedate= February 5, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Some routes had been built primarily to facilitate the sale of stock in the railroad companies; they were redundant from the beginning{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}. These were the first to be abandoned as the railroads' financial positions deteriorated, and the rails were routinely removed to save money on taxes. Many [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]] were destroyed by being broken up and built over, but others remained the property of the railroad or were taken over by local or state authorities and turned into [[rail trail]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=====Government regulation=====
From approximately 1910 to 1921, the federal government introduced a populist rate-setting scheme. During [[World War I]] the railroads proved incapable of functioning as a cohesive network. This forced the United States Government to [[United States Railroad Administration|nationalize the rail industry temporarily]]. In the 1920s railroad profits stagnated, many redundant and unprofitable lines were abandoned, and many passenger facilities were allowed to fall into a cycle of [[deferred maintenance]], all of which in small ways drove passengers away, either by higher fares or less appealing service.<ref name=SlasonT>Slason Thompson, ''A Short History of American Railways'', Books for Libraries Press: Freeport, NY (1925, reprinted 1971), p. 324–391, 405.</ref> At the same time, the rise in popularity of the automobile and US Highways such as the [[Lincoln Highway]] began to eat away at local rail passenger traffic. Increases in labor costs also further hindered the railroads' ability to make profits on smaller and more sparsely populated lines.<ref name="SlasonT" />

The primary regulatory authority affecting railroads, beginning in the late 19th century, was the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC). The ICC played a leading role in rate-setting which at times hindered railroads' ability to be profitable in the passenger market. In the 1930s, train speeds were ever increasing, but no advancements were being made in signalling and safety systems to prevent collisions. This led to the horrific [[Naperville train disaster]] of 1946 and other crashes in New York in 1950. In 1947<ref name="dieselization">{{cite web|url=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/steam_tech/message/54227|title=Hiawatha dieselization|author=William Wendt|publisher=Yahoo Groups|date=July 30, 2007|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="gruber-solomon">{{cite book|first=John |last=Gruber|first2=Brian|last2=Solomon|title=The Milwaukee Road's Hiawathas|publisher=Voyageur Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7603-2395-3}}</ref> the ICC issued an order requiring US railroads, by the end of 1951, to install [[automatic train stop]], [[automatic train control]] or [[cab signalling]] wherever any trains would travel at {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on|adj=on}} or faster.<ref name=Signals>{{cite journal|last=Abbey|first=Wallace W.|title=Millions for Signals|journal=Trains|date=November 1950|pages=45–49}}</ref>

Such technology was not widely implemented outside the Northeast,<ref name="asktrains08">{{cite web|url=http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&id=4424|title=Ask Trains from November 2008|date=December 23, 2008|publisher=Trains Magazine|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref> effectively placing a [[Speed limits in the United States (rail)#Signal speeds|speed limit]] in other areas which is still in effect today, and why the {{convert|79|mph|abbr=on}} maximum passenger train speed is common in the United States. In 1958, the ICC was granted authority to allow or reject modifications and eliminations of passenger routes (''train-offs'').<ref>Shafer, Mike, ''supra'' at 125. Previously, individual states made those judgments, and the reform that came about with the Transportation Act of 1958 was intended to streamline the process.</ref> Many routes required beneficial pruning, but the ICC delayed action by an average of eight months and when it did authorize modifications, the ICC insisted that unsuccessful routes be merged with profitable ones. Thus, fast, popular rail service was transformed into slow, unpopular service.<ref name="MorganD" />

The ICC was even more critical of corporate mergers. Many combinations which railroads sought to complete were delayed for years and even decades, such as the merger of the [[New York Central Railroad]] and [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], into what eventually became [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], and the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] and [[Erie Railroad]] into the [[Erie Lackawanna Railway]]. By the time the ICC approved the mergers in the 1960s, slower trains, years of deteriorating equipment and station facilities, and the flight of passengers to air and automobile transportation had taken their toll and the mergers were unsuccessful at preserving these railroad's passenger train service.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It is important to note the Erie Lackawanna was never a major hauler of passengers, nor its predecessor roads, and was mostly a freight railroad. The Penn Central merger was a failure because it merged two large struggling railroads on paper only, two separate management structures remained with little or no integration of assets or management of the former Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central system. The massive overhead costs of this operating scheme played a far greater role in the Penn Central failure than any actions take by the ICC or any other US Government agency.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

=====Taxation=====
At the same time, railroads carried a substantial tax burden. A World War II–era excise tax of 15% on passenger rail travel survived until 1962.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/adaccess/rails-history.html | title=Brief History of the U.S. Passenger Rail Industry}}</ref> Local governments, far from providing needed support to passenger rail, viewed rail infrastructure as a ready source for property tax revenues. In one extreme example, in 1959, the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], which owned about a third of one percent (0.34%) of the land in [[Lincoln County, Montana]], was assessed more than 91% of all school taxes in the county.<ref name="MorganD"/> To this day, railroads are generally taxed at a higher rate than other industries, and the rates vary greatly from state to state.<ref>[http://www.bcnys.org/whatsnew/2002/0211rail.htm Study: NYS rail property taxes harm employment in rail, manufacturing - Feb. 11, 2002].

=====Labor-related issues=====

}}
Railroads also faced antiquated work rules and inflexible relationships with trade unions. Work rules did not adapt to [[technological change]].<ref name="MorganD"/> Average train speeds had doubled from 1919 to 1959, but unions resisted efforts to modify their existing 100- to 150-mile work days. As a result, railroad workers' average work days were roughly cut in half, from 5–7½ hours in 1919 to 2½–3¾ hours in 1959. Labor rules also perpetuated positions that had been obviated by technology; for example, when [[steam locomotives]] were replaced with [[diesel locomotives]] the rules required a [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman or stoker]] aboard the engine at all times, even in switching yards.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Between 1947 and 1957, passenger railroad financial efficiency dropped by 42% per mile.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=====Subsidized competition=====
While passenger rail faced internal and governmental pressures, new challenges appeared that undermined the dominance of passenger rail: highways and commercial aviation. The passenger rail industry declined as governments put money into the construction of highways and government-owned airports and the air traffic control system.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

As automobiles became more attainable to most Americans, the freedom, increased convenience and individualization of automobile travel became the norm. Government actively began to respond with funds from its treasury and later with fuel-tax funds to build a non-profit network of roads not subject to property taxation. Highways then surpassed the for-profit rail network that the railroads had built in previous generations with corporate capital and government land grants. All told between 1921 and 1955 governmental entities, using taxpayer money and in response to taxpayer demand, financed more than $93&nbsp;billion worth of pavement, construction, and maintenance.<ref name=MorganD>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=David P.|title=Who Shot the Passenger Train?|journal=Trains|pages=14–15, 20–21 |date=April 1959}}</ref>

In the 1950s affordable commercial aviation expanded as the [[Jet Age]] arrived. Governmental entities built urban and suburban airports, funded construction of highways to provide access to the airports, and provided air traffic control services.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=====Loss of U.S. Mail contracts=====
Until 1966, most [[U.S. Postal Service]] mail was transported on passenger trains. The mail contracts kept many passenger trains economically viable. In 1966, the U.S. Postal Service switched to trucks and airplanes, subsidizing planes instead of trains, which no longer had mail as a source of revenue.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the late 1960s, the end of passenger rail in the United States seemed near. First had come the requests for termination of services; then came the bankruptcy filings. The [[Pullman Company]] became insolvent in 1969,<ref>{{Welsh-Pullman}}</ref>{{rp|147}} followed, in 1970, by the dominant railroad in the Northeastern United States, the [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]].<ref name="Stover">{{cite book |title=American Railroads |last=Stover |first=John F. |year=1997 |edition = 2nd |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-77658-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4vjgmic44QC |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|234}} It now seemed that passenger rail's financial problems might bring down the railroad industry as a whole, yet few in government wanted to be held responsible for the extinction of the passenger train.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1970, Congress passed, and President Richard Nixon signed into law, the Rail Passenger Service Act. Proponents of the bill, led by the [[National Association of Railroad Passengers]] (NARP), sought government funding to assure the continuation of passenger trains. They conceived the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (NRPC), a hybrid public-private entity that would receive taxpayer funding and assume operation of intercity passenger trains. The original working [[brand name]] for NRPC was Railpax, but shortly before the company started operating it was changed to Amtrak. There were several key provisions:{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* Any railroad operating intercity passenger service could contract with the NRPC, thereby joining the national system.
* Participating railroads bought into the NRPC using a formula based on their recent intercity passenger losses. The purchase price could be satisfied either by cash or rolling stock; in exchange, the railroads received NRPC common stock.
* Any participating railroad was freed of the obligation to operate intercity passenger service after May 1, 1971, except for those services chosen by the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] (DOT) as part of a "basic system" of service and paid for by NRPC using its federal funds.
* Railroads that chose not to join the NRPC system were required to continue operating their existing passenger service until 1975 and thenceforth had to pursue the customary ICC approval process for any discontinuance or alteration to the service.

Of the twenty-six railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970, only six declined to join Amtrak.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanders|2006|pp=7–8}}</ref> Nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived. The Nixon administration and many Washington insiders viewed the NRPC as a politically expedient way for the President and Congress to give passenger trains a "last hurrah" as demanded by the public. They expected Amtrak to quietly disappear as public interest waned.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Luberoff|first=David|title=Amtrak and the States|journal=Governing Magazine|page=85|date=November 1996}}</ref> After ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine exposed the manufactured mismanagement in 1974, Louis W. Menk, chairman of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]], remarked that the story was undermining the scheme to dismantle Amtrak.<ref name="agreedsecretly">{{cite journal|journal=Trains|date=March 2009|title=Trains formula for fixing Amtrak|first=Rush |last=Loving, Jr.}}</ref> Proponents also hoped that government intervention would be brief, but their view was that Amtrak would soon support itself. Neither view has proved correct. Popular support has allowed Amtrak to continue in operation longer than critics imagined, while financial results have made a return to private operation infeasible.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===1970s: the Rainbow Era===
Amtrak began operations on May 1, 1971.<ref name="Stover" /> Amtrak received no [[rail tracks]] or [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] at its inception. All Amtrak's routes were continuations of prior service, although Amtrak pruned about half the passenger rail network. Of the 364 trains operated previously, Amtrak only continued 182. On trains that continued, to the extent possible, schedules were retained with only minor changes from the ''[[Official Guide of the Railways]]'', and under the same names.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Several major corridors became freight-only, including the ex-[[New York Central Railroad]]'s [[Water Level Route]] across New York and Ohio and [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]]'s Chicago to Detroit route. Reduced passenger train schedules created headaches. A 19-hour layover became necessary for eastbound travel on the ''[[James Whitcomb Riley (train)|James Whitcomb Riley]]'' between Chicago and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Amtrak inherited problems with train stations, most notably [[deferred maintenance]], and redundant facilities resulting from competing companies that served the same areas. On the day it started, Amtrak was given the responsibility of rerouting passenger trains from the seven train terminals in Chicago ([[LaSalle Street Station|LaSalle]], [[Dearborn Station|Dearborn]], [[Grand Central Station (Chicago)|Grand Central]], [[Millennium Station|Randolph]], [[Ogilvie Transportation Center|Chicago Northwestern Terminal]], [[Central Station (Chicago terminal)|Central]], and [[Chicago Union Station|Union]]) into just one, Union Station. In [[New York City]], Amtrak had to pay to maintain both [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] and [[Grand Central Terminal]] because of the lack of track connections to bring trains from upstate New York into Penn Station, a problem not rectified until the building of the [[West Side Line (NYCRR)|Empire Connection]] in 1991.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Amtrak would abandon numerous large stations whose upkeep could no longer be justified. On the other hand, the creation of the Los Angeles–Seattle ''[[Coast Starlight]]'' from three formerly separate trains was an immediate success.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Amtrak's early years are often called the ''Rainbow Era'', which refers to the ad hoc arrangement of the rolling stock and locomotives from a pool of equipment, acquired by Amtrak, at its formation, that consisted of a large mix of paint schemes from their former owners. This rolling stock, which for the most part still bore the pre-Amtrak colors and logos, formed the multi-colored consists of early Amtrak trains. By mid-1971, Amtrak began purchasing some of the equipment it had leased, including 286 second-hand locomotives, of the [[Electro-Motive Division|EMD]] E and F types, 30 [[PRR GG1|GG1]] electric locomotives, and 1290 passenger cars, and continued leasing even more motive power. By 1975 the official Amtrak color scheme was painted on most Amtrak equipment and newly purchased locomotives and rolling stock began appearing.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.trains.com/ctr/default.aspx?c=a&id=54 |first=John |last=Kelly |title=Amtrak's beginnings |journal=Classic Trains Magazine |date=June 5, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref>

Amtrak soon had the opportunity to acquire [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]]. Following the bankruptcy of several northeastern railroads in the early 1970s, including Penn Central, which owned and operated the [[Northeast Corridor]] (NEC), Congress passed the [[Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act]] of 1976.<ref>Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act, {{USPL|94|210}}, {{USStat|90|31}}, {{USC|45|801}}. February 5, 1976.</ref> A large part of the legislation was directed to the creation of [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]], but the law also enabled the transfer of the portions of the NEC not already owned by state authorities to Amtrak. Amtrak acquired the majority of the NEC on April 1, 1976.<ref>U.S. Federal Railroad Administration, Washington, DC. [http://www.fra.dot.gov/rpd/passenger/643.shtml "Northeast Corridor Main Line."] Accessed November 15, 2011.</ref> (The portion in Massachusetts is owned by the Commonwealth and managed by Amtrak. The route from New Haven to New Rochelle is owned by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] as the [[New Haven Line]].){{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This main line became Amtrak's "jewel" asset, and helped the railroad generate significant revenues. While the NEC ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system, the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming. As a result, Amtrak's federal subsidy was increased dramatically. In subsequent years, other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to Amtrak.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In its first decade, Amtrak fell far short of financial independence, which continues today, but it did find modest success rebuilding trade. Outside factors discouraged competing transport, such as fuel shortages which increased costs of automobile and airline travel, and strikes which disrupted airline operations. Investments in Amtrak's track, equipment and information also made Amtrak more relevant to America's transportation needs.<ref name="washpost-jones1">{{cite news | first = William H. | last = Jones | title = Americans Rediscover The Train; Trains are rediscovered | newspaper=Washington Post | page = D8 | date = May 12, 1979}}</ref><ref name="csm-yemma1">{{cite news | first = John | last = Yemma | title = Years Later, Amtrak is Keeping Riders Won in Gas Pinch | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0721/072139.html | work=Christian Science Monitor | page = 4 | date = July 21, 1980 | accessdate =June 12, 2008}}</ref> Amtrak's ridership increased from 16.6&nbsp;million in 1972 to 21 million in 1981.<ref name=NiceD>{{cite book |last= Nice |first= David C. |title= Amtrak: The History and Politics of a National Railroad |year= 1998 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn= 978-1-55587-734-7 |page= 24}}</ref>

[[George Warrington]] became president in 1998 with a mandate to make Amtrak financially self-sufficient. Passengers became "guests" and there were expansions into express freight work, but the financial plans failed. Amtrak's inroads in express freight delivery created additional friction with competing freight operators, including the [[Trucking industry in the United States|trucking industry]]. Delivery was delayed of much anticipated high-speed trainsets for the improved ''[[Acela Express]]'' service, which promised to be a strong source of income and favorable publicity along the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===21st century===
Ridership increased during the first decade of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the NEC and rises in automobile fuel costs. The inauguration of the [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] ''[[Acela Express]]'' in late 2000 generated considerable publicity and led to major ridership gains. However, through the late 1990s and very early 21st century, Amtrak could not add sufficient express freight revenue or cut sufficient other expenditures to break even. By 2002, it was clear that Amtrak could not achieve self-sufficiency, but Congress continued to authorize funding and released Amtrak from the requirement.<ref name="bg-wirzbicki1">{{cite news | first = Alan | last = Wirzbicki | title = Senate votes to increase funding for Amtrak service | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/10/31/senate_votes_to_increase_funding_for_amtrak_service?mode=PF | work=Boston Globe| date = October 31, 2007 | accessdate =June 12, 2008}}</ref> In early 2002 [[David L.

===Routes===
{{Main|List of Amtrak routes|List of busiest Amtrak stations|List of major cities in U.S. lacking Amtrak service}}
Amtrak is no longer required by law to operate a national route system, but it is encouraged to do so.<ref>''Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997.'' 105th Cong., Senate Report 105-85 (September 24, 1997).</ref> Amtrak has presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (except Wyoming and South Dakota). Amtrak services fall into three groups: short-haul service on the [[Northeast Corridor]], short-haul corridor service outside the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance service.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Service on the Northeast Corridor, between [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and Washington, D.C., as well as between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], is powered by overhead electric wires; for the rest of the system, diesel locomotives are used. Routes vary widely in frequency of service, from three-days-a-week trains on the ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' to weekday service several times per hour on the [[Northeast Corridor]] (NEC).<ref name="amtrakschedules">{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrak.com/train-schedules-timetables |title=Amtrak Train Schedules, Timetables |publisher=Amtrak.com |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> Amtrak also operates a captive bus service, [[Thruway Motorcoach]], which provides connections to train routes.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The most popular and heavily used services are those running on the NEC, including the ''[[Acela Express]]'' and ''[[Northeast Regional]]''. The NEC runs from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] via [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]]. Some services continue into [[Virginia]]. The NEC services accounted for 11.4&nbsp;million of Amtrak's 31.6&nbsp;million passengers in fiscal year 2013.<ref name="National Railroad Passenger Corporation"/> Outside the NEC the most popular services are the short-haul corridors in California. These include the ''[[Pacific Surfliner]]'', ''[[Capitol Corridor]]'', and ''[[San Joaquin (train)|San Joaquin]]'', supplemented by an extensive network of connecting buses. Together the California corridor trains accounted for a combined 5,627,000 passengers in fiscal year 2013.<ref name="National Railroad Passenger Corporation"/> Other popular corridors include New York State's ''Empire Service'', NYC-Albany-Syracuse-Rochester-Buffalo-Niagara Falls-Toronto, with 1,488,000 passengers last year,{{when|date=July 2015}} and Pennsylvania's ''Keystone'' Service NYC-Philadelphia-Lancaster-Harrisburg with 1,467,000 passengers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Four of the six stations busiest by boardings are on the NEC: [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York (Penn Station)]] (first), [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Washington (Union Station)]] (second), [[30th Street Station|Philadelphia (30th Street Station)]] (third), and [[South Station|Boston (South Station)]] (sixth). The other two are [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago (Union Station)]] (fourth) and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles (Union Station)]] (fifth).<ref>[http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Title_Image_Copy_Page&c=am2Copy&cid=1081442674300 Amtrak National Facts].

===Efficiency===
Per passenger mile, Amtrak is 30–40&nbsp;percent more energy-efficient than commercial airlines and automobiles overall,<ref name="bts-energy">Figures are from 2008. {{cite web | title=Table 4-20: Energy Intensity of Passenger Modes | work=Bureau of Transportation Statistics | accessdate=October 25, 2010 | url=http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_04_20.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101007061308/http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_04_20.html| archivedate= October 7, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> though the exact figures for particular routes depend on load factor along with other variables. The electrified trains in the NEC are considerably more efficient than Amtrak's diesels and can feed energy captured from [[Regenerative brake#The motor as a brake|regenerative braking]] back to the electrical grid. Passenger rail is also very competitive with other modes in terms of safety per mile.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Intermodal connections===
[[Intermodal passenger transport|Intermodal]] connections between Amtrak trains and other transportation are available at many stations. Most Amtrak rail stations in [[Central business district|downtown areas]] have connections to local public transport.

===On-time performance===
Outside the [[Northeast Corridor]] and stretches of track in Southern California and Michigan, most Amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by privately owned freight railroads. Freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to Amtrak trains. Some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations, allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings for an hour or longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track. The railroads' dispatching practices were investigated in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/3874|title=Root Causes of Amtrak Train Delays|date=September 8, 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref> resulting in stricter laws about train priority. Subsequently Amtrak's overall on-time performance went up from 74.7% in fiscal 2008 to 84.7% in 2009, with long-distance trains and others outside the NEC seeing the greatest benefit. The ''[[Missouri River Runner]]'' jumped from 11% to 95%, becoming one of Amtrak's best performers. The ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' went from 22.4% to 96.7%, and the ''[[California Zephyr]]'', with a 5% on-time record in 2008, went up to 78.3%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=1249203347496&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobheadername1=Content-disposition&blobheadervalue1=attachment;filename=Amtrak_0909monthly.pdf|title=Monthly Performance Report for September 2009|date=December 31, 2009|publisher=Amtrak|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref> This improved performance coincided with a general economic downturn, resulting in the lowest freight rail traffic volumes since at least 1988, meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/01/rail-traffic-in-2009-lowest-since-at.html|title=Rail Traffic in 2009: Lowest since at least 1988|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=Calculated Risk|accessdate=February 7, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100117181110/http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/01/rail-traffic-in-2009-lowest-since-at.html| archivedate= January 17, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

}}
{{As of|2015}} Amtrak offers four classes of service: First Class, Sleeper Service, Business Class, and Coach Class:
* '''First Class''': First Class service is currently offered on the ''[[Acela Express]]'' only. Previously First Class was offered on the ''Northeast Direct'' (predecessor to the ''[[Northeast Regional]]'') as well as the ''[[Metroliner (train)|Metroliner]]'' up until that service's discontinuation in 2006. Seats are larger than those of Business Class and come in a variety of seating modes (single, single with table, double, double with table and wheelchair accessible). First Class is located in separate cars from the other classes. First Class includes complimentary meal and beverage service along with free newspapers and hot towel service. First Class passengers have access to Amtrak ClubAcela lounges in Washington D.C., Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.
* '''Sleeper Service''': Sleeper Service comprises room accommodations on long-distance trains. Rooms are classified into roomettes, bedrooms, family bedrooms and accessible bedrooms. Included in the price of a room are full meals and attendant service. At night, attendants convert rooms into sleeping areas with fold-down beds and fresh linens. Complimentary juice, coffee and bottled water are included as well. Sleeper car passengers have access to all passenger facilities aboard the train. Sleeper passengers have access to the ClubAcela lounges along the Northeast Corridor, Metropolitan Lounges in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland (Oregon), and unattended First Class Lounges in New Orleans, Raleigh, St. Louis, and St. Paul/Minneapolis.
* '''Business Class''': Business Class is offered on the ''Acela Express'', ''Northeast Regional'', many short-haul corridor trains and some long-distance trains. Business Class passengers receive complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and newspapers.
* '''Coach Class''': Coach Class is the standard class of service on all Amtrak trains except the ''Acela Express''. Seats in coach recline and feature fold-down trays, lighting, and 120v power outlets. Coaches on long-distance trains are configured with fewer seats per car so that passengers have additional legroom. Most Amtrak trains are all-reserved; a limited number of short-haul corridor trains offer unreserved coach. There is no difference in equipment between reserved and unreserved.<ref name="Amtrak Seat Plan">{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrak.com/onboard-the-train-seating-accommodations|title=Amtrak - Plan - Onboard - Seating Accommodations|publisher=''Amtrak Official Website''|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Labor issues==
In the modern era, Amtrak faces a number of important labor issues. In the area of pension funding, because of limitations originally imposed by Congress, most Amtrak workers were traditionally classified as "railroad employees" and contributions to the Railroad Retirement system have been made for those employees. However, because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work, some critics, such as the [[National Association of Railroad Passengers]], maintain that Amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as US$150 million/year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narprail.org/resources/fact-sheets/328-amtrak-myths-a-facts |title=Amtrak Myths & Facts: 4. Myth: Private Freight Railroad companies subsidize Amtrak. |publisher=National Association of Railroad Passengers |date=3 August 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref>

In recent times, efforts at reforming passenger rail have addressed labor issues. In 1997 Congress released Amtrak from a prohibition on contracting for labor outside the corporation (and outside its unions), opening the door to privatization.<ref>''Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997.'' 105th Cong. (January 7, 1997)</ref> Since that time, many of Amtrak's employees have been working without a contract. The most recent contract, signed in 1999, was mainly retroactive.

Because of the fragmentation of railroad unions by job, {{as of|2009|lc=y}} Amtrak has 14 separate unions to negotiate with. Plus, it has 24 separate contracts with those unions.<ref name="redortibit">{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/934121/sidetracked_negotiations_the_contract_for_nearly_10000_unionized_amtrak_employees/index.html |title=Sidetracked Negotiations: The Contract for Nearly 10,000 Unionized Amtrak Employees Expired on December 31, 1999.

In late 2007 and early 2008, however, major labor issues arose, a result of a dispute between Amtrak and 16 unions regarding which employees should receive healthcare benefits.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The dispute was not resolved quickly, and the situation escalated to the point of President Bush declaring a Presidential Emergency Board to resolve the issues. It was not immediately successful, and a strike was threatened to begin on January 30, 2008. In the middle of that month, however, it was announced that Amtrak and the unions had come to terms and January 30 passed without a strike. In late February it was announced that three more unions had worked out their differences, and as of that time it seemed unlikely that any more issues would arise in the near future.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===History of funding===

====1970s to 1990s====
Amtrak commenced operations in 1971 with $40&nbsp;million in direct federal aid, $100&nbsp;million in federally insured loans, and a somewhat larger private contribution.<ref>Phillips, Don. ''Railpax Rescue.'' in ''Journey to Amtrak; The year history rode the passenger train''. Ed. Harold A. Edmonson. Milwaukee, WI: Kalmbach Pub. Co., pp. 8–11 (1972).</ref> Officials expected that Amtrak would break even by 1974, but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct Federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of $1.25&nbsp;billion.<ref>$709&nbsp;million of the 1981 aid package was for operations. The remainder was capital appropriations. {{Harvnb|Vranich|1997|p=37}}</ref> During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], appropriations were halved and by 1986, federal support fell to a decade low of $601&nbsp;million, almost none of which were capital appropriations.<ref name="1995manual">National Railroad Passenger Corp. ''Statistical Appendix to Amtrak FY1995 Annual Report'', ''1995 Annual Report, p.1.</ref> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress continued the reductionist trend even while Amtrak expenses held steady or rose. Amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs, and by 1995 Amtrak was on the brink of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts.<ref name="1999reportp41">National Railroad Passenger Corp. ''1999 Annual Report'', p.41.</ref> In response, in 1997 Congress authorized $5.2&nbsp;billion for Amtrak over the next five years – largely to complete the ''Acela'' capital project – on the condition that Amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation.<ref>''Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997''. 105th Cong. (January 7, 1997). Congressional Budget Office. ''S. 738 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act'' (July 22, 1997), in ''104th Cong. Senate Report 105-85'' (September 24, 1997).</ref> While Amtrak made financial improvements during this period,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} it did not achieve self-sufficiency.<ref name="railroadingscuts"/>

====2000s====
In 2004, a stalemate in federal support of Amtrak forced cutbacks in services and routes as well as resumption of deferred maintenance. In fiscal 2004 and 2005, Congress appropriated about $1.2&nbsp;billion for Amtrak, $300&nbsp;million more than President [[George W. Bush]] had requested. However, the company's board requested $1.8&nbsp;billion through fiscal 2006, the majority of which (about $1.3&nbsp;billion) would be used to bring infrastructure, rolling stock, and motive power back to a state of good repair. In Congressional testimony, the DOT Inspector General confirmed that Amtrak would need at least $1.4&nbsp;billion to $1.5&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2006 and $2&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo. In 2006, Amtrak received just under $1.4&nbsp;billion, with the condition that Amtrak would reduce (but not eliminate) food and sleeper service losses. Thus, dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers. Only ''[[Auto Train]]'' and ''[[Empire Builder]]'' services continue regular made-on-board meal service. In 2010 the Senate approved a bill to provide $1.96&nbsp;billion to Amtrak, but cut the approval for high-speed rail to a $1&nbsp;billion appropriation.<ref name="railroadingscuts">{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article.asp?id=23903 |title=Senate committee ups Amtrak appropriation, cuts high-speed rail funding |publisher=Progressiverailroading.com |date=July 23, 2010 |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref>

State governments have partially filled the breach left by reductions in federal aid. Several states have entered into operating partnerships with Amtrak, notably California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, Missouri, [[Washington (state)|Washington]], North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin, Vermont, Maine, and New York, as well as the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]], which provides some of the resources for the operation of the ''[[Amtrak Cascades|Cascades]]'' route.

====2010s====
Amtrak points out that in 2010, its farebox recovery (percentage of operating costs covered by revenues generated by passenger fares) was 79%, the highest reported for any U.S. passenger railroad.<ref name="National Railroad Passenger Corporation">{{cite web|last=National Railroad Passenger Corporation|title=Basic Amtrak Facts|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=Page&pagename=am%2FLayout&cid=1246041980246|work=Amtrak National Facts, FY 2011|publisher=National Railroad Passenger Corporation|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>

Amtrak has argued that it needs to increase capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds what it would cost to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years. However, despite an initial request for more than $2.1 billion in funding for the year, the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations, dropping to under $1.4 billion for the first time in several years.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the [[Northeast Corridor]] included over 200 bridges, most dating to the 19th century, tunnels under Baltimore dating to the [[American Civil War]] Era and functionally obsolete [[track switch]]es which would cost $5.2 billion to repair (more than triple Amtrak's total annual budget).<ref name="comprehenfy13">Pg. 25, Amtrak FY13 Comprehensive Business Plan, http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/338/576/AmtrakFY13%20Budget-Comprehensive-Business-Plan-w-appx.pdf</ref> Amtrak's budget is only allocated on a yearly basis, and it has been argued by Joseph Vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossible.<ref name="Vranich 2004">{{Harvnb|Vranich|2004}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

===Controversy===
Government aid to Amtrak was controversial from the beginning. The formation of Amtrak in 1971 was criticized as a bailout serving corporate rail interests and union railroaders, not the traveling public. Critics have asserted that Amtrak has proven incapable of operating as a business and that it does not provide valuable transportation services meriting public support,<ref name="Vranich 2004"/>{{page needed|date=July 2015}} a "mobile money-burning machine."<ref>Wicker, Tom. ''In the Nation; Young David's Tantrum.'' ''The New York Times'', p.A31 (May 3, 1985)</ref> Many argued that subsidies should be ended, national rail service terminated, and the NEC turned over to private interests. "To fund a ''Nostalgia Limited'' is not in the public interest."<ref name="canamtraksurvive">Frailey, Fred W. ''Can Amtrak Survive the Budget Cutters?'', ''U.S. News & World Report'', p.52 (April 13, 1981).</ref> Critics also question Amtrak's energy efficiency,<ref name=FedAmtrak>[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Budget/bg2072.cfm Congress Should Link Amtrak's Generous Subsidy to Improved Performance], Ronald D. Utt PhD, ''Heritage.org'' September 20, 2007</ref> though the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] considers Amtrak among the most energy-efficient forms of transportation.<ref name="newsandmediaamtrak">{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Title_File:_Copy_Page&cid=1093554056875&c=am2Copy&ssid=565 |title=Inside Amtrak – News & Media – Energy Efficient Travel |publisher=Amtrak |accessdate=January 20, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212012051/http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Title_File:_Copy_Page&cid=1093554056875&c=am2Copy&ssid=565 |archivedate = December 12, 2007}}</ref>

Proponents{{who|date=June 2015}} have pointed out that the government heavily subsidizes the [[Interstate Highway System]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], many airports, among many aspects of passenger aviation. Massive government aid to those forms of travel was a primary factor in the decline of passenger service on privately owned railroads in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, Amtrak pays property taxes (through fees to host railroads) that highway users do not pay. Advocates have asserted that Amtrak should only be expected to be as self-sufficient as those competing modes of transit.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Along these lines, in a June 2008 interview with Reuters,<ref name="rnw-szep1" /> Amtrak President Alex Kummant made specific observations: $10&nbsp;billion per year is transferred from the general fund to the [[Highway Trust Fund]]; $2.7&nbsp;billion is granted to the FAA; $8&nbsp;billion goes to "security and life safety for cruise ships."<ref name="rnw-szep1" /> Kummant makes a comparison of public subsidies: "it's like $40 a passenger for Amtrak and $500 to $700 per automobile." Moreover, Amtrak provides all of its own security, while airport security is a separate federal subsidy. Kummant added: "Let's not even get into airport construction which is a miasma of state, federal and local tax breaks and tax refinancing and God knows what."<ref name="rnw-szep1" />

The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, which established Amtrak, specifically states that "The Corporation will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government,"<ref name="firstamtrak">{{cite web|last=91st Congress of the United States of America|title=Section 301: Creation of the Corporation|url=http://history.amtrak.com/archives/rail-passenger-service-act-of-1970|work=Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> [[common stock]] was issued in 1971 to railroads that contributed capital and equipment; these shares convey almost no benefits<ref name="thepastandfuture">[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4571&type=0&sequence=6 ''The Past and Future of U.S. Passenger Rail Service'', sec. 4 n.21] (September 2003).</ref> but their current holders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/transportation/rail/04-30-03/04-30-03memo.html |title=Web archive of U.S. House of Representatives report |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061110231722/http://www.house.gov/transportation/rail/04-30-03/04-30-03memo.html |archivedate = November 10, 2006}}</ref> declined a 2002 buy-out offer by Amtrak. There are currently 109,396,994 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $100 per share, all held by the US government. There are currently 9,385,694 shares of common stock with a par value of $10 per share held by four other railroad companies: APU (formerly Penn Central) 53%, [[BNSF]] (35%), [[Canadian Pacific]] (7%), and [[Canadian National]] (5%).<ref name="objectcato">[http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa425.pdf PDF: Cato.org]</ref>

Supporters of Amtrak and transit systems also point out that as the first decade of the 21st century came to a close, the user fees from the Highway Trust Fund did not cover the cost of maintaining the national highway system.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Transportation advocacy groups such as the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials note that since 2008, the U.S. Congress has authorized transfers of money from the General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund to keep it solvent.<ref name="aashto2011impossible"/> Transfers from the General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund include: $8 billion (FY 2008); $7 billion (FY 2009); and $19.5 billion (FY 2010).<ref name="aashto2011impossible">{{cite web|last=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|title=CBO: Highway Account Faces Possible Insolvency Next Fiscal Year (28 Jan 2011)|url=http://www.aashtojournal.org/Pages/012811htf.aspx|work=AASHTO Journal|publisher=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>
