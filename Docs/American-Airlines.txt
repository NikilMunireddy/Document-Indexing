==History==

===Predecessors===
American Airlines has merged with several carriers since its formation in 1930 (which itself happened by a merger of 80 carriers). These have included [[Trans Caribbean Airways]] in 1971,<ref name=bi1>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/questions-about-the-american-us-airways-merger-2013-2 |title=The American Airlines-US Airways Merger Will Unite 2 Companies With Tumultuous Pasts |last1=Harty |first1=Jack |last2=Sloan |first2=Chris |date=February 14, 2013 |website= |publisher=Business Insider, Inc. |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref> [[Air California]] in 1987, [[Reno Air]] in 1999,<ref name=bi1/> [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) in 2001,<ref name=bi1/> and [[US Airways]] in 2015.

[[File:American DC-3.jpg|thumb|left|DC-3 "Flagship", American's chief aircraft type during the World War II period]]
In 1934 American Airways Company was acquired by [[Errett Lobban Cord|E.&nbsp;L. Cord]], who renamed it "American Air Lines". Cord hired Texas businessman [[C. R. Smith]] to run the company. Smith worked with [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]] to develop the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], which American Airlines was first to fly, in 1936. American's DC-3 made it the first airline to be able to operate a route that could earn a profit solely by transporting passengers; other carriers could not earn a profit without U.S. Mail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/american-blemish-distinguished-history-222159291.html|title=For American, a blemish on a distinguished history|date=November 29, 2011|work=Yahoo News|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> With the DC-3, American began calling its aircraft "[[Flagships]]" and establishing the Admirals Club for valued passengers. The DC-3s had a four-star "admiral's pennant" outside the cockpit window while the aircraft was parked. American operated daily overnight transcontinental service between New York and Los Angeles through Dallas/Fort Worth and other intermediate stops, advertising the service as an "all-year southern route."<ref>{{cite web|title=1938 - August 5 - American Airlines Timetables, Route Maps, and History|url=http://airchive.com/html/timetable-and-route-maps/american-airlines-timetables-route-maps-and-history/1938-august-5-american-airlines-timetables-route-maps-and-history/4710|publisher=Airchive|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>

After World War II American acquired American Export Airlines, renaming it as [[American Overseas Airways]], to serve Europe. AOA was sold to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] in 1950. AA launched another subsidiary, American Airlines de Mexico S.A., to fly to Mexico and built several airports there.

American opened a second hub in the new Terminal 3 at Chicago O'Hare in 1982, and began transatlantic service between Dallas and London in May 1982.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Led by its new chairman and CEO, [[Robert Crandall]], American expanded its service from these hubs through the 1980s, adding service to other European destinations as well as Japan.

In the late 1980s, American Airlines opened three hubs for north-south traffic. [[Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport|San Jose International Airport]] was added after American purchased [[AirCal]]. American built a terminal and runway at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]] for the growing [[Research Triangle Park]] nearby,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and to compete with [[US Airways|USAir]]'s hub in [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport]]. [[Nashville International Airport]] was also added as a hub. American also planned a north-south hub at [[Stapleton International Airport]] in Denver during the mid-1980s, but postponed those plans due to the planned development of [[Denver International Airport]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Washburn|first=Gary|title=American Airlines Plans Nashville Hub |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-06-06/business/8502050708_1_chicago-and-dallas-ft-american-airlines-nashville-metropolitan-airport|accessdate=December 9, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 6, 1985}}</ref>

In 1990, American Airlines bought the assets of TWA's operations at London Heathrow for $445&nbsp;million. Until [[open skies]] came into effect in April 2008, American Airlines and [[United Airlines]] were the only U.S. carriers permitted to serve Heathrow.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Lower fuel prices and a favorable{{vague|date=December 2013}} business climate led to higher profits in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The industry's expansion was not lost on pilots who on February 17, 1997 went on strike for higher wages. President [[Bill Clinton]] invoked the [[Railway Labor Act]] citing economic impact to the United States, quashing the strike.<ref name="strike">{{cite news|title=American Airlines Resuming Service After Clinton Stops Strike |last=Knowlton |first=Brian |work=International Herald Tribune |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/02/17/fly.t_1.php |date=February 17, 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080606080802/http://www.iht.com:80/articles/1997/02/17/fly.t_1.php |archivedate=June 6, 2008 }}</ref> Pilots settled for wages lower than their demands.

The three new hubs were abandoned in the 1990s: some San Jose facilities were sold to [[Reno Air]], and at Raleigh/Durham to [[Midway Airlines (1993–2003)|Midway Airlines]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Midway went out of business in 2001. American Airlines purchased Reno Air in February 1999 and integrated its operations on 31 August 1999,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but did not resume hub operations in San Jose. American discontinued most of Reno Air's routes, and sold most of the Reno Air aircraft, as it did with [[Air California]] 12 years earlier. The only remaining route from the [[Air California]] and Reno Air purchases is from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

During this time concern over airline bankruptcies and falling stock prices brought a warning from American's CEO [[Robert Crandall]].<ref>Petzinger Jr., Thomas (1995). Hard landing. Three River Press, New York, 594 p. ISBN 0-8129--2835-0.</ref> "I've never invested in any airline", Crandall said. "I'm an airline manager. I don't invest in airlines. And I always said to the employees of American, 'This is not an appropriate investment. It's a great place to work and it's a great company that does important work. But airlines are not an investment.'" Crandall noted that since [[airline deregulation]] of the 1970s, 150 airlines had gone out of business. "A lot of people came into the airline business. Most of them promptly exited, minus their money", he said.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside American Airlines, A Week in the Life|url=http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=1193494763|publisher=CNBC|accessdate= August 17, 2013}}</ref>

[[Miami International Airport]] became a hub after American Airlines bought Central and South American routes ("El Interamericano") from [[Eastern Air Lines]] in 1990 (inherited from [[Braniff International Airways]] but originated by [[Pan American-Grace Airways]] which was known as [[Pan American-Grace Airways|Panagra]]). Through the 1990s, American Airlines expanded its network in Latin America to become the dominant U.S. carrier in the region.

On October 15, 1998, American Airlines became the first airline to offer electronic ticketing in the 44 countries it serves.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 1999, American Airlines, [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Canadian Airlines]], and [[Qantas]] founded the global airline alliance [[Oneworld]].

Robert Crandall left in 1998 and was replaced by [[Donald J. Carty]], who negotiated the purchase of the near bankrupt [[Trans World Airlines]] (it would file for its third bankruptcy as part of the purchase agreement)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/29/business/twa-cleared-for-2d-bankruptcy-filing.html |work=The New York Times |title=T.W.A.

[[File:Boeing 747-123(SF), American Airlines Freighter AN0082839.jpg|thumbnail|American Boeing 747-100 Freighter.]]
American Airlines began losing money in the economic downturn that followed the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which destroyed two of its planes. Carty negotiated wage and benefit agreements with the unions but resigned after union leaders discovered he was planning to award [[executive compensation]] packages at the same time. This undermined AA's attempts to increase trust with its workforce and to increase its productivity.<ref name="Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009"/> The St. Louis hub was downsized, AA rolled back its "More Room Throughout Coach" program (which eliminated several rows of seats on certain aircraft), ended three-class service on many international flights, and standardized its fleet at each hub. However, the airline also expanded into new markets, including Ireland, India, and [[mainland China]]. On July 20, 2005, American announced a quarterly profit for the first time in 17 quarters; the airline earned $58&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2005.

AA was a strong backer of the [[Wright Amendment]], which regulated commercial airline operations at [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in Dallas.

[[File:American Airlines logo.svg|thumb|American Airlines' fourth logo, used from 1967 until 2013]]
In 1931, Goodrich Murphy, an American employee, designed the AA logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/2015/05/tales-era-airlines-knew-good-design/|title=Tales From an Era When Airlines Knew Good Design |publisher=WIRED.com |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}</ref>  The logo was redesigned by [[Massimo Vignelli]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vignelli.com/home/identity/aa.html |title=Vignelli Associates About the AA Logo |publisher=Vignelli.com |accessdate= December 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logosdesigners.com/#massimo-vignelli|title=iconic logo designers|work=logosdesigners.com|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> Thirty years later, in 1997, American Airlines was able to make its logo Internet-compatible by buying the domain AA.com. ''AA'' is also American's two-letter [[IATA]] [[airline codes|airline designator]].

On January 16, 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign with FutureBrand dubbed, "A New American". This included a new logo replacing the logo used since 1967. American Airlines calls the new logo the "Flight Symbol", incorporating the eagle, star, and "A" of the classic logo.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com/newamerican?anchorLocation=HomePageHero1&reportedTitle=Becoming%20a%20new%20American&reportedPosition=0&url=undefined&_locale=en_US&repositoryName=undefined&repositoryId=undefined |title=Becoming a new American |publisher=aa.com |date= |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

===Livery===
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2016}}
American's early [[aircraft livery|liveries]] varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an [[eagle]] painted on the fuselage. The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of [[Envoy Air|American Eagle Airlines]]. Propeller aircraft featured an [[international orange]] lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

[[File:American Airlines Astrojet N951AA.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737 in the Astrojet livery]]

In the late 1960s, American commissioned designer [[Massimo Vignelli]] to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple "AA" logo, without an eagle, on the tail; instead, Vignelli created a highly stylized eagle, which remained the company's logo until 2013. In 1999, American painted a new [[Boeing 757]] (N679AN) in its 1959 international orange livery. One [[Boeing 777]] and one Boeing 757 were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail, in support of [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]]. One Boeing 757 is painted with a yellow ribbon on the tailfin on the aircraft and on the side of the body says "Flagship Independence". American Eagle, the airline's regional airline has the same special livery on ERJ-145 aircraft.

[[File:AA Flagship Freedom.JPG|thumb|left|AA "Flagship Freedom" [[Boeing 757-200]], labeled with a "[[Yellow ribbon|yellow awareness ribbon]]" symbol, representing support of the [[United States Armed Forces]] overseas operations.]]

This was because C. R. Smith hated painted aircraft, and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert "Bob" Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://industry.bnet.com/travel/1000148/paint-vs-bare-metal-on-airplanes/ |title=Delta, Air Canada Among Carriers Weighing Benefit of Paint Stripping |publisher=Industry.bnet.com |date=8 October 2008 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref>

The airline calls the new livery and branding "a clean and modern update".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The current design features an abstract American flag on the tail, along with a silver-painted fuselage, as a throw-back to the old livery.

On an internal website for employees, American posted two options, one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery. All of the [[American Airlines Group]] employees (including US Airways and other affiliates) were able to vote. American ultimately decided to keep the new look. Parker announced that American would keep a US Airways heritage aircraft in the fleet, with plans to add a heritage TWA aircraft and a heritage American plane with the old livery.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

American operated interchange flight services in conjunction with Alaska Airlines during the 1970s between Texas and Alaska during the construction of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. This interchange agreement allowed for single, no change of aircraft service between Houston, Texas and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Anchorage, Alaska and Fairbanks, Alaska. The round trip routing of this interchange flight was Houston-Dallas/Fort Worth-Seattle-Anchorage-Fairbanks with Seattle, Washington serving as the interchange point where flight and cabin crews were changed from one airline to the other. Boeing 727-200 jetliners provided by both American and Alaska Airlines were utilized to provide this interchange service.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

It will also be retrofitted to all other widebody aircraft within the next three years, excluding 767s due to their upcoming retirement. The seats will be wider than standard Main Cabin seats and will offer 38" of pitch, 2" more than Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as a footrest. Premium Economy customers will also get two free checked bags, priority boarding, and enhanced food and drink service including free alcohol.

The Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing promotion shortly after he was made an honorary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]. Inspired by the [[Kentucky colonel]]s and other [[Title of honor|honorary]] organizations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers "admirals" of the "Flagship fleet" (AA called its aircraft "Flagships" at the time).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Li|first1=Lucy|title=Ultimate Guide to Admirals Club|url=http://www.loungebuddy.com/admirals-club-ultimate-guide/|website=LoungeBuddy|publisher=LoungeBuddy, Inc|accessdate=20 July 2015|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6aAbZqFo0|archivedate=20 July 2015}}</ref> The list of Admirals included many celebrities, politicians, and other VIPs, as well as more "ordinary" customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.

There was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the "Admirals Club" in 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their own liquor at the airport.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination,<ref name="timeac">{{cite news|title=Toward Equality for VIPs|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|work=TIME|date=July 15, 1966|accessdate=January 26, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114112519/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere| archivedate= January 14, 2014 | deadurl= no}}</ref> the Club (and most other airline lounges) switched to a paid membership program.

===Flagship Lounge===
Though affiliated with the Admirals Club and staffed by many of the same employees, the Flagship Lounge is a separate lounge specifically designed for customers flying in First Class on transcontinental domestic flights and international flights, as well as AAdvantage Executive Platinum and Oneworld Emerald frequent flyers.<ref>"Flagship Lounge | American Airlines" https://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/airportAmenities/AAFlagshipLounges.jsp</ref>  Flagship Lounges are now available at four airports: Chicago-O'Hare, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles, and New York-JFK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flagship Lounge(R)|url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/airportAmenities/AAFlagshipLounges.jsp|publisher=American Airlines |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}</ref> American also previously offered a Flagship Lounge in Miami from 2000 to 2002, and again from 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/aa-lounge-opens-at-miami-international |title=AA lounge opens at Miami International |publisher=Business Traveller |date=February 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref> It plans to open again in 2017.
