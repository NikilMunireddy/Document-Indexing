'''Augusta–Richmond County''' {{IPAc-en|US|ə|.|'|ɡ|ʌ|s|.|t|ə}} is a [[consolidated city-county]] on the central eastern border of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and located at the [[fall line]] of the [[Savannah River]], at the head of its navigable portion. It is in the [[piedmont]] section of the state.

The city was named after [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] (1719-1772). 

According to 2012 US Census estimates, the Augusta-[[Richmond County, Georgia|Richmond County]] population was 197,872, <!--Augusta-Richmond County balance--> not counting the unconsolidated cities of [[Hephzibah, Georgia|Hephzibah]] and [[Blythe, Georgia|Blythe]].

Augusta is the principal city of the [[Augusta metropolitan area|Augusta-Richmond County Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which as of 2012 had an estimated population of 580,270, making it the third-largest city and the second-largest metro area in the state after [[Atlanta]]. It is the [[List of United States cities by population|116th-largest city in the United States]]. Internationally, Augusta is best known for hosting [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] golf tournament each spring.

==History==
{{Main|History of Augusta, Georgia}}
The area along the river was long inhabited by varying cultures of [[Southeastern tribes|indigenous peoples]], who relied on the river for fish, water and transportation.  The site of Augusta was used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as a place to cross the Savannah River, because of its location on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]].

In 1735, two years after [[James Oglethorpe]] founded [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], he sent a detachment of troops to explore the upper Savannah River. He gave them an order to build at the head of the navigable part of the river. The expedition was led by [[Noble Jones]], who created the settlement to provide a first line of [[defense (military)|defense]] for coastal areas against potential [[Spain|Spanish]] or [[France|French]] invasion from the interior. Oglethorpe named the town Augusta, in honor of Princess Augusta, wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales (she was the mother of King George III of the United Kingdom).  [[James Oglethorpe|Oglethorpe]] visited Augusta once, in September 1739.  He did so while returning to Savannah from a perilous visit to Coweta Town, where he had met with a convention of 7,000 Native American warriors and concluded peaceful relations with several Native American groups in what is today the northern and western part of Georgia.<ref>''Memorial History of Augusta, Georgia: from Its Settlement in 1735 to the Close of the Eighteenth Century'' by Charles Colcock Jones, Salem Dutcher (Augusta, GA: D. Mason, 1890) page 31</ref>  Augusta was the second state capital of Georgia from 1785 until 1795 (alternating for a period with Savannah, the first).

Augusta developed rapidly as a market town as the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]] in the Piedmont was developed for cotton cultivation. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of short-staple cotton profitable, and this type of cotton was well-suited to the upland areas. Cotton plantations were worked by slave labor, with hundreds of thousands of slaves shipped from the Upper South to the Deep South in the domestic [[slave trade]]. Many of the slaves were brought from the [[Lowcountry]], where their [[Gullah]] culture had developed on the large [[Sea Island Cotton|Sea Island]] cotton and rice plantations

As a major city in the area, Augusta was a center of activities during Reconstruction and after. In the mid-20th century, it was a site of civil rights demonstrations. In 1970 Charles Oatman, a mentally disabled teenager, was killed by his cellmates in an Augusta jail. A protest against his death broke out in a [[1970 Augusta riot|riot]] involving 500 people, after six black men were killed by police,<ref name=cr>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilrights.uga.edu/cities/augusta/godfather_of_soul.htm|title=Freedom On Film: Civil Rights In Georgia|publisher=}}</ref> each found to have been shot in the back.<ref>"Baltimore is Everywhere," ''[[New York Magazine]],'' May 18–31, 2015, p. 33.</ref> The noted singer and entertainer [[James Brown]] was called in to help quell lingering tensions, which he succeeded in doing.<ref name=cr/>

==Geography==
[[Image:Augsky2.JPG|thumb|left|The Augusta skyline, as seen from [[North Augusta, South Carolina]]]]
Augusta is located on the Georgia/[[South Carolina]] border, about {{convert|150|mi}} east of [[Atlanta]] and {{convert|70|mi}} west of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. The city is located at {{Coord|33|28|12|N|81|58|30|W|type:city}} (33.470, −81.975).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Augusta-Richmond County balance has a total area of {{convert|306.5|sqmi|1}}. {{convert|302.1|sqmi|1}} of it is land and {{convert|4.3|sqmi|1}} of it (1.42%) is water.

[[Image:Savannah River Augusta Canal Riverwatch Pkwy 2.jpg|thumb|[[Savannah River]] and the [[Augusta Canal]], with River Watch Parkway and residential areas in foreground]]
Augusta is located about halfway up the [[Savannah River]] on the [[fall line]], which creates a number of small falls on the river. The city marks the end of a navigable waterway for the river and the entry to the Georgia [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] area.

The [[J. Strom Thurmond Dam|Clarks Hill Dam]] is built on the fall line near Augusta, forming [[Clarks Hill Lake]]. Further downstream, near the border of [[Columbia County, Georgia|Columbia County]], is the Stevens Creek Dam, which generates [[hydroelectric power]].  Further downstream is the Augusta Diversion Dam, which marks the beginning of the [[Augusta Canal]] and channels Savannah River waters into the canal.<ref>[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2003/06/29/pav_379852.shtml "Officials consider relicensing Augusta Canal"], ''Augusta Chronicle'', 29 Jun 2003</ref>

===Climate===
As with the rest of the state, Augusta has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with short, mild winters, very hot, humid summers, and a wide [[diurnal temperature variation]] throughout much of the year. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|45.4|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|81.6|°F|1}} in July; there are 53 nights with the low reaching the freezing mark, 82 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs, and 5.5 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ annually. Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|−1|°F|0}} on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]] up to {{convert|108|°F|0}} on August 10, 2007 and August 21, 1983. Snowfall is not nearly as common as in Atlanta, due largely to Augusta's elevation, with downtown Augusta being about {{convert|900|ft|-1|abbr=on}} lower than downtown Atlanta. Freezing rain is also a threat in wintertime.
