'''Augsburg''' (lit. Augustborough) [{{IPA-de|ˈʔaʊ̯ksbʊʁk|-|Augsburg.ogg}}] ({{lang-bar|Augschburg}}) is a city  in [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Swabia]], [[Bavaria]], Germany. It was a [[Free Imperial City]] for over 500 years.

It is a [[College town|university town]] and home of the [[Regierungsbezirk]] [[Swabia (administrative region)|Schwaben]] and the [[Swabia (administrative region)|Bezirk Schwaben]]. Augsburg is an [[Urban districts of Germany|urban district]] and home to the institutions of the [[Augsburg (district)|Landkreis Augsburg]]. It is the third-largest city in Bavaria (after [[Munich]] and [[Nuremberg]]) with a population of 284,000 citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/augsburg/Und-wieder-5000-Menschen-mehr-Augsburg-waechst-und-waechst-id33099802.html |title=Und-wieder-5000-Menschen-mehr-Augsburg-waechst-und-waechst|publisher=www.augsburger-allgemeine.de |date=2015-02-17}}</ref> After [[Neuss]] and [[Trier]], Augsburg is Germany's third oldest city, being founded by the Romans as [[Augsburg#Early history|Augusta Vindelicorum]], named after the [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]].

Augsburg is the only German city with its own legal holiday, the ''[[:de:Augsburger Hohes Friedensfest|Augsburger Hohes Friedensfest]]'', celebrated on August 8 of every year. This gives Augsburg more legal holidays than any other region or city in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.augsburg.de/ |title=Stadt Augsburg - Home - Stadt Augsburg |publisher=.augsburg.de |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}</ref>

Augsburg was the home of two [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] families that rose to great prominence internationally, replacing the [[Medici]]s as Europe's leading bankers, the [[Fugger]] and the [[Welser]] families.

==Geography==
Augsburg lies at the convergence of the [[Alps|Alpine]] rivers [[Lech (river)|Lech]] and [[Wertach (river)|Wertach]] and on the [[Singold]]. The oldest part of the city and the southern quarters are on the northern foothills of a high terrace, which emerged between the steep rim of the hills of [[Friedberg (Bayern)|Friedberg]] in the east and the high hills of the west. In the south extends the Lechfeld, a [[Outwash plain]] of the post [[ice age]] between the rivers [[Lech (river)|Lech]] and [[Wertach]], where rare primeval landscapes were preserved. The Augsburg city forest and the Lech valley heaths today rank among the most species-rich middle European habitats.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

On Augsburg borders the [[nature park]] [[Augsburg Western Woods Nature Park|Augsburg Western Woods]] - a large forestland. The city itself is also heavily greened. As a result, in 1997 Augsburg was the first German city to win the Europe-wide contest [[Entente Florale]] for Europe's greenest and most livable city.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Augsburg is surrounded by the counties [[Augsburg (district)|Landkreis Augsburg]] in the west and [[Aichach-Friedberg]] in the east.

The neighboring towns and cities are [[Friedberg (Bayern)|Friedberg]], [[Königsbrunn]], [[Stadtbergen]], [[Neusäß]], [[Gersthofen]], [[Rehling]], [[Affing]], [[Kissing]], [[Mering]], [[Merching]], [[Bobingen]], [[Gessertshausen]] und [[Diedorf (Schwaben)|Diedorf]].

==Climate==
Augsburg has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]).

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Augsburg}}
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}

===Early History===
The city was founded in 15 BC by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]] as '''''Augusta Vindelicorum''''' ({{IPA-la|awˈɡuːsta wɪndɛlɪˈkoːrʊ̃}} <small>[[Traditional English pronunciation of Latin|English pronunciation of Latin]]:</small> {{IPAc-en|aʊ|ˈ|ɡ|uː|s|t|ə|_|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ɪ|ˌ|k|əʊ|r|ə|m|}}<ref name="Collins3">{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/augsburg?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Augsburg |accessdate=26 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}</ref>), on the orders of their stepfather [[Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. The name means "''Augusta of the [[Vindelicia|Vindelici]]''". This garrison camp soon became the capital of the Roman province of [[Raetia]].

Early development was due to a 400-year affiliation with the [[Roman Empire]], especially because of its excellent military, economic and geographic position at the convergence of the [[Alps|Alpine]] rivers [[Lech (river)|Lech]] and [[Wertach (river)|Wertach]], and with direct access to most important Alpine passes. Thus, Augsburg was the intersection of many important European east-west and north-south connections, which later evolved as major trade routes of the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.augsburg.de/index.php?id=12356 |title=Stadt Augsburg - Home - Stadt Augsburg |publisher=.augsburg.de |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}</ref>
[[File:Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg.jpg|thumb|left|Territories of the Free Imperial City and the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg]]

Around 120 AD Augsburg became the capital of the Roman province [[Raetia]]. Augsburg was sacked by the [[Hun]]s in the 5th century AD, by [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century, and by [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria|Welf of Bavaria]] in the 11th century, but arose each time to greater prosperity.

Historical spellings of the name of the city include "Ausburch" and "Ausbourch."

Augsburg was granted the status of a [[Free Imperial City]] on March 9, 1276 and from then until 1803, it was independent of its former overlord, the [[Prince-Bishopric|Prince-Bishop of Augsburg]]. Frictions between the city-state and the prince-bishops were to remain frequent however, particularly after Augsburg became Protestant and curtailed the rights and freedoms of Catholics.

With a strategic location as intersection of trade routes to Italy, the Free Imperial City became a major trading center. Augsburg produced large quantities of woven goods, cloth and textiles. Augsburg became the base of two banking families that rose to great prominence, the [[Fugger]]s and the [[Welser]]s. The Fugger family donated the [[Fuggerei]] part of the city devoted to housing for needy citizens in 1516, which remains in use today.
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Augusta vendilicorum.png|thumb|left|Panorama of Augsburg, 1493]]
[[File:Augsburg1550.jpg|thumb|left|Perlach market place in 1550.]]
In 1530, the [[Augsburg Confession]] was presented to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Diet of Augsburg]]. Following the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555, after which the rights of religious minorities in imperial cities were to be legally protected, a mixed Catholic–Protestant city council presided over a majority Protestant population; ''see [[:de:Paritätische Reichsstadt|Paritätische Reichsstadt]]''.

===Thirty Years' War===
Religious peace in the city was largely maintained despite increasing Confessional tensions until the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648). In 1629, Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] issued the [[Edict of Restitution]], which restored the legal situation. of 1552 which again curtailed the rights of the Protestant citizens. The inequality of the [[Edict of Restitution]] was rescinded when in April 1632, the Swedish army under [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] captured Augsburg without resistance.

In 1634, the Swedish army was routed at nearby [[Nördlingen]]. By October 1634, Catholic troops had surrounded Augsburg. The Swedish garrison refused to surrender and a siege ensued through the winter of 1634/35 and thousands died from hunger and disease. According to J. N. Hays, "In the period of the Swedish occupation and the Imperial siege the population of the city was reduced from about 70,000 to about 16,000, with [[typhus]] and [[Black Death|plague]] playing major roles."<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&pg=PA98&dq=&lr=&hl=en&cd=23#v=onepage&q=false Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history]''". J. N. Hays (2005). p.98. ISBN 1-85109-658-2</ref>

===Nine Years' War===
In 1686, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] formed the ''League of Augsburg'', termed by the English as the "Grand Alliance" after England joined in 1689: a [[Europe]]an [[coalition]], consisting (at various times) of [[Austria]], [[Bavaria]], [[Brandenburg]], England, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]] of the Rhine, [[Portugal]], [[Savoy]], [[Saxony]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. It was formed to defend the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]] from France. This organization fought against France in the [[Nine Years War]].

Augsburg's peak boom years occurred during the 15th and 16th centuries thanks to the bank and metal businesses of the merchant families Fugger and Welser, who held a local near total monopoly on their respective industries. Augsburg's wealth attracted artists seeking patrons and rapidly became a creative centre for famous painters, sculptors and musicians notably birthplace of : the [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] painter family.  In later centuries the city was the birthplace of the composer [[Leopold Mozart]]<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/leopold-mozart-mn0001498289/biography</ref> and the playwright [[Berthold Brecht]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zwmvd2p/revision</ref> [[Rococo]] became so prevalent that it became known as “Augsburg style” throughout Germany.

===End of Free Imperial City status and Industrial Revolution revival===
[[File:Stockdale 1800 - Augsburg.jpeg|thumb|right|A map of Augsburg in 1800.]]
In 1806, when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved, Augsburg lost its independence and was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]. In 1817, the city became an administrative capital of the ''Oberdonaukreis'', then administrative capital in 1837 for the district [[Swabia (administrative region)|Swabia and Neuburg]].

During the end of the 19th century, [[Augsburg textile and industry museum|Augsburg's textile industry]] again rose to prominence followed by the connected machine manufacturing industry.

===Military===
Augsburg was historically a militarily important city due to its strategic location.
During the German re-armament before [[World War II|the Second World War]], the Wehrmacht enlarged Augsburg's one original Kaserne (barracks) to three: Somme Kaserne (housing Wehrmacht Artillerie-Regiment 27); Arras Kaserne (housing Wehrmacht Infanterie Regiment 27) and Panzerjäger Kaserne (housing Panzerabwehr-Abteilung 27 (later Panzerjäger-Abteilung 27)). Wehrmacht Panzerjäger-Abteilung 27 was later moved to [[Füssen]].

During [[World War II]], one subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located outside Augsburg, supplying approximately 1,300 forced labourers to local military-related industry, most especially the [[Messerschmitt]] AG military aircraft firm headquartered in Augsburg.<ref>Wolfgang Sofsky, William Templer, ''The Order of Terror: The Concentration Camp'': Princeton University Press: 1999, ISBN 0-691-00685-7, page 183</ref><ref>Edward Victor. ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'' http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm</ref>

In 1941, [[Rudolf Hess]] without [[Adolf Hitler]]'s permission secretly took off from a local airport and flew to [[Scotland]] to meet the Duke of [[Duchy of Hamilton|Hamilton]], and crashed in [[Eaglesham]] in an attempt to mediate the end of the European front of [[World War II]] and join sides for the upcoming Russian Campaign.

The Reichswehr Infanterie Regiment 19 was stationed in Augsburg and became the base unit for the Wehrmacht Infanterie Regiment 40, a subsection of the Wehrmacht Infanterie Division 27 (which later became the Wehrmacht Panzerdivision 17). Elements of Wehrmacht II Battalion of Gebirgs-Jäger-Regiment 99 (especially Wehrmacht Panzerjäger Kompanie 14) was composed of parts of the Wehrmacht Infanterie Division 27. The Infanterie Regiment 40 remained in Augsburg until the end of the war, finally surrendering to the United States when in 28 April 1945, the [[U.S. Army]] occupied the [[Bombing of Augsburg in World War II|heavily bombed and damaged city]].

Following the war, the three Kaserne would change hands confusingly between the [[United States|American]] and Germans, finally ending up in US hands for the duration of the [[Cold War]]. The former Wehrmacht Kaserne became the three main US barracks in Augsburg: Reese;, Sheridan and FLAK. US Base FLAK had been an anti-aircraft barracks since 1936 and US Base Sheridan "united" the former infantry barracks with a smaller Kaserne for former [[Luftwaffe]] communications units.

The American military presence in the city started with the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]], followed by the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]], U.S. Army [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] artillery, [[701st Military Intelligence Brigade|USASA Field Station Augsburg]] and finally the [[66th Military Intelligence Brigade (United States)|66th Military Intelligence Brigade]], which returned the former Kaserne to German hands in 1998. Originally the Heeresverpflegungshauptamt Südbayern and an Officers' caisson existed on or near the location of Reese-Kaserne, but was demolished by the occupying Americans.

==Politics==

===Municipality===
{{main|List of mayors of Augsburg}}
From 1266 until 1548, the terms ''Stadtpfleger'' (head of town council) and ''[[Mayor]]'' were used interchangeably, or occasionally, simultaneously.
In 1548 the title was finally fixed to ''Stadtpfleger'', who officiated for several years and was then awarded the title for life (though no longer governing), thus resulting confusingly, in records of two or more simultaneous ''Stadtpfleger''.

After the transfer to [[Bavaria]] in 1806, Augsburg was ruled by a [[Magistrate]] with two mayors, supported by an additional council of "Community Commissioners": the ''Gemeindebevollmächtige''.

As of 1907, the Mayor was entitled [[Lord Mayor|Oberbürgermeister]], as Augsburg had reached a population of 100,000, as per the Bavarian [[Gemeindeordnung]].

==Transport==

===Roads===
The main road link is [[autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 8|A 8]] between [[Munich]] and [[Stuttgart]].

====Public transport====
Public transport is very well catered for. It is controlled by the [[Augsburger Verkehrsverbund]] (Augsburg transport union, AVV) extended over central Swabia. There are seven rail [[Regionalbahn]] lines, five [[tram]] lines, 27 city bus lines and six night bus lines, as well as, several taxi companies.

The [[Trams in Augsburg|Augsburg tramway network]] is now 35.5&nbsp;km-long after the opening of new lines to the [[University of Augsburg|university]] in 1996, the northern city boundary in 2001 and to the Klinikum Augsburg (Augsburg hospital) in 2002. Tram line 6, which runs 5.2&nbsp;km from Friedberg West to Rotes Tor, opened in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/urban-rail-news-in-brief-10.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Railway Gazette: Urban rail news in brief}}</ref>

====Rail services====
[[File:Bahnhofsgebäude Augsburg.JPG|thumb|The front of the station]]
Augsburg has seven stations, the [[Augsburg Central Station|Central Station]] (''Hauptbahnhof''), [[Augsburg-Hochzoll station|Hochzoll]], [[Augsburg-Oberhausen station|Oberhausen]], [[Augsburg Haunstetterstraße station|Haunstetterstraße]], [[Augsburg Morellstraße station|Morellstraße]], [[Augsburg Messe station|Messe]] and [[Augsburg-Inningen station|Inningen]]. The Central Station, built from 1843 to 1846, is Germany’s oldest main station in a large city still providing services in the original building. It is currently being modernized and an underground tram station is built underneath it. [[Augsburg Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]] is on the [[Munich–Augsburg railway|Munich–Augsburg]] and [[Ulm–Augsburg railway|Ulm–Augsburg lines]] and is connected by [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] and [[InterCity|IC]] services to [[Munich]], [[Berlin]], [[Dortmund]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Stuttgart]]. As of December 2007, the French [[TGV]] connected Augsburg with a direct High Speed Connection to [[Paris]]. In addition [[EuroCity|EC]] and night train services connect to [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]] and connections will be substantially improved by the creation of the planned [[Magistrale for Europe]].

The AVV operates seven [[Regionalbahn]] lines from the main station to:
* [[Mammendorf]]
* [[Schmiechen]] (direction to [[Ammersee]])
* [[Aichach]]/[[Kühbach|Radersdorf]]
* [[Meitingen]]/[[Donauwörth]]
* [[Dinkelscherben]]
* [[Schwabmünchen]]
* [[Klosterlechfeld]]
Starting in 2008, the regional services are planned to be altered to [[S-Bahn]] frequencies and developed long term as integrated into the [[Augsburg S-Bahn]].

===Air transport===
Until 2005 Augsburg was served by nearby [[Augsburg Airport]] (AGB). In that year all air passenger transport was relocated to [[Munich Airport]]. Since then the Airport has only served for [[General aviation]] and [[Commercial aviation|business aviation]].

==Sports==
[[File:Borussia dortmund augsburg.jpg|right|thumb|[[FC Augsburg]] against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] at the [[SGL arena]]]]
[[FC Augsburg]] is a football team based in Augsburg and plays in the [[WWK ARENA]]. FC Augsburg was promoted to [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] in 2011. The new stadium (opened in July 2009) also hosted games of the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]].

The city is home to a [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]] (first-division) ice hockey team, the [[Augsburger Panther]]. The original club, AEV, was formed in 1878, the oldest German ice sport club and regularly draws around 4000 spectators, quite reasonable for German ice hockey. Home games are played at the [[Curt Frenzel Stadion]]: a recently rebuilt (2012-2013) indoor rink and modern stadium. Also Augsburg is home to one of the most traditional German Baseball clubs, the Augsburg Gators.

For the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]], a [[Lech River]] dam protective diversionary canal for river ice was converted into the world's first [[artificial whitewater]] slalom course: the [[Eiskanal]] and remains a world-class venue for whitewater competition and served as prototype for two dozen similar foreign courses.

==Local city nicknames==
While commonly called ''Fuggerstadt'' (Fuggers' city) due to the [[Fuggers]] residing there, within Swabia it is also often referred to as ''Datschiburg'': which originated sometime in the 19th century refers to Augsburg's favorite sweet: the ''Datschi'' made from fruit, preferably prunes, and thin cake dough.<ref>[http://www.stadtlexikon-augsburg.de/index.php?id=114&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3518&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=123&cHash=8ef071d563 Augsburger Stadtlexikon – ''Datschiburg''] {{de icon}} accessed: 18 November 2008</ref> The ''Datschiburger Kickers'' charity football team (founded in 1965) reflects this in its choice of team name.<ref>[http://www.datschiburger-kickers.de/aktuelles/aktuelles_index.html ''Datschiburger Kickers'' website] accessed: 18 November 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.stadtlexikon-augsburg.de/index.php?id=115&no_cache=1 Augsburger Stadtlexikon – ''Datschiburger Kickers''] {{de icon}} accessed: 18 November 2008</ref>

Among younger people, the city is commonly called "Aux" for short. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
