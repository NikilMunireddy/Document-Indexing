== Signs and symptoms ==
{{Main|Signs and symptoms of HIV/AIDS}}
There are three main stages of HIV infection: acute infection, clinical latency and AIDS.<ref name=AIDS2010GOV/>

=== Acute infection ===
[[File:Symptoms of acute HIV infection.svg|thumb|alt=A diagram of a human torso labelled with the most common symptoms of an acute HIV infection|275px|Main symptoms of acute HIV infection]]
The initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome.<ref name=M121/><ref name=WHOCase2007/> Many individuals develop an [[influenza-like illness]] or a [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis-like illness]] 2–4 weeks post exposure while others have no significant symptoms.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diseases and disorders.|year=2008|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=Tarrytown, NY|isbn=978-0-7614-7771-6|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HRJOElZch8C&pg=PA25}}</ref><ref name=M118/> Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include [[fever]], [[lymphadenopathy|large tender lymph nodes]], [[pharyngitis|throat inflammation]], a [[rash]], headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals.<ref name=WHOCase2007/><ref name=M118/> The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is [[maculopapular]], classically.<ref name=Deut2010/> Some people also develop [[opportunistic infections]] at this stage.<ref name=WHOCase2007/> Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or [[diarrhea]] may occur, as may neurological symptoms of [[peripheral neuropathy]] or [[Guillain-Barre syndrome]].<ref name=M118/> The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.<ref name=M118/>

Due to their [[Nonspecific symptoms#Types|nonspecific]] character, these symptoms are not often [[Medical diagnosis#Pattern recognition|recognized]] as signs of HIV infection.<!--<ref name=M118/> --> Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common [[infectious disease]]s with overlapping symptoms.<!--<ref name=M118/> --> Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.<ref name=M118>Mandell, Bennett, and Dolan (2010). Chapter 118.</ref>

=== Clinical latency ===
The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV.<ref name=AIDS2010GOV/> Without treatment, this second stage of the [[Natural history of disease|natural history]] of HIV infection can last from about three years<ref>{{cite book|last=Evian|first=Clive|title=Primary HIV/AIDS care: a practical guide for primary health care personnel in a clinical and supportive setting|year=2006|publisher=Jacana|location=Houghton [South Africa]|isbn=978-1-77009-198-6|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WauaC7M0yGcC&pg=PA29|edition=Updated 4th}}</ref> to over 20&nbsp;years<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles B.

Although most [[HIV-1]] infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells ([[T helper cell]]s) without [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral therapy]] for more than 5 years.<ref name=M118/><ref name=LT2010/> These individuals are classified as HIV controllers or [[long-term nonprogressors]] (LTNP).<ref name=LT2010>{{cite journal|last=Blankson|first=JN|title=Control of HIV-1 replication in elite suppressors|journal=Discovery medicine|date=March 2010|volume=9|issue=46|pages=261–6|pmid=20350494}}</ref> Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment, known as "elite controllers" or "elite suppressors".<!--<ref name=Walker2007/> --> They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.<ref name=Walker2007>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=BD|title=Elite control of HIV Infection: implications for vaccines and treatment|journal=Topics in HIV medicine : a publication of the International AIDS Society, USA|date=Aug–Sep 2007|volume=15|issue=4|pages=134–6|pmid=17720999}}</ref>

=== Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome===
[[File:Symptoms of AIDS.svg|thumb|275px|alt=A diagram of a human torso labelled with the most common symptoms of AIDS|Main symptoms of AIDS.]]

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined in terms of either a CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection.<ref name=M118/> In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years.<ref name=M118/> The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are [[pneumocystis pneumonia]] (40%), [[cachexia]] in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and [[esophageal candidiasis]].<ref name=M118/> Other common signs include recurring [[respiratory tract infection]]s.<ref name=M118/>

<!--AIDS related cancers -->
People with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], [[primary central nervous system lymphoma]], and [[cervical cancer]].<ref name=Deut2010/> Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV.<ref name=M169>Mandell, Bennett, and Dolan (2010).

== Transmission ==
{{Risk of acquiring HIV}}
HIV is transmitted by three main routes: [[human sexual activity|sexual contact]], significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as [[vertical transmission]]).<ref name=TransmissionM2007/> There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to [[feces]], nasal secretions, saliva, [[sputum]], sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.<ref name=AFP2007k>{{cite journal|last=Kripke|first=C|title=Antiretroviral prophylaxis for occupational exposure to HIV|journal=American family physician|date=August 1, 2007|volume=76|issue=3|pages=375–6|pmid=17708137}}</ref> It is possible to be [[Coinfection|co-infected]] by more than one strain of HIV—a condition known as [[HIV superinfection]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=van der Kuyl|first=AC|author2=Cornelissen, M|title=Identifying HIV-1 dual infections|journal=Retrovirology |date=September 24, 2007|volume=4|page=67|pmid=17892568|doi=10.1186/1742-4690-4-67|pmc=2045676}}</ref>

=== Sexual ===
<!--Overview -->
The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person.<ref name=TransmissionM2007/> The majority of all transmissions worldwide occur through [[heterosexual]] contacts (i.e. sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex);<ref name=TransmissionM2007/> however, the pattern of transmission varies significantly among countries. In the United States, as of 2010, most transmission occurred in [[men who had sex with men]], with this population accounting for 63% of all new cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gay and Bisexual Men HIV by Group|url=http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.html|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref>

<!--Per act risk -->
With regard to [[unprotected sex|unprotected]] heterosexual contacts, estimates of the risk of HIV transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.<ref name=Boily2009/> In low-income countries, the risk of female-to-male transmission is estimated as 0.38% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.30% per act; the equivalent estimates for high-income countries are 0.04% per act for female-to-male transmission, and 0.08% per act for male-to-female transmission.<ref name=Boily2009/> The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high, estimated as 1.4{{ndash}}1.7% per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts.<ref name=Boily2009/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Beyrer|first=C|author2=Baral, SD|author3=van Griensven, F|author4=Goodreau, SM|author5=Chariyalertsak, S|author6=Wirtz, AL|author7=Brookmeyer, R|title=Global epidemiology of HIV infection in men who have sex with men|journal=Lancet|date=Jul 28, 2012|volume=380|issue=9839|pages=367–77|pmid=22819660|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60821-6}}</ref> While the risk of transmission from [[oral sex]] is relatively low, it is still present.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=M|author2=Vajdy, M|title=Mucosal HIV transmission and vaccination strategies through oral compared with vaginal and rectal routes|journal=Expert opinion on biological therapy|date=August 2010|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1181–95|pmid=20624114|doi=10.1517/14712598.2010.496776|pmc=2904634}}</ref> The risk from receiving oral sex has been described as "nearly nil";<ref>{{cite book|last=Stürchler|first=Dieter A.|title=Exposure a guide to sources of infections|year=2006|publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-55581-376-5|page=544|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWa5or3Xa9EC&pg=PA544}}</ref> however, a few cases have been reported.<ref>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by Richard Pattman|title=Oxford handbook of genitourinary medicine, HIV, and sexual health|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-957166-6|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jm1H4EeULmYC&pg=PA95|edition=2nd}}</ref> The per-act risk is estimated at 0{{ndash}}0.04% for receptive oral intercourse.<ref name=Dosekun2010>{{cite journal|last=Dosekun|first=O|author2=Fox, J|title=An overview of the relative risks of different sexual behaviours on HIV transmission|journal=Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS|date=July 2010|volume=5|issue=4|pages=291–7|pmid=20543603|doi=10.1097/COH.0b013e32833a88a3}}</ref> In settings involving [[prostitution]] in low income countries, risk of female-to-male transmission has been estimated as 2.4% per act and male-to-female transmission as 0.05% per act.<ref name=Boily2009>{{cite journal|vauthors=Boily MC, Baggaley RF, Wang L, Masse B, White RG, Hayes RJ, Alary M |title=Heterosexual risk of HIV-1 infection per sexual act: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=9 |issue=2|pages=118–129|date=February 2009|pmid=19179227|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70021-0}}</ref>

=== HIV testing ===
Most people infected with HIV develop specific [[antibodies]] (i.e. [[seroconversion|seroconvert]]) within three to twelve weeks of the initial infection.<ref name=M118/> Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV-[[RNA]] or [[P24 antigen#Antigen tests|p24 antigen]].<ref name=M118/> Positive results obtained by antibody or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>

===Classifications===
Two main clinical staging systems are used to classify HIV and HIV-related disease for [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] purposes: the [[WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease]],<ref name=WHOCase2007/> and the [[CDC classification system for HIV infection]].<ref name=CDCCase2008/> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes.<ref name=M121/><ref name=WHOCase2007/><ref name=CDCCase2008/>

The World Health Organization first proposed a definition for AIDS in 1986.<ref name=WHOCase2007/> Since then, the WHO classification has been updated and expanded several times, with the most recent version being published in 2007.<ref name=WHOCase2007>{{cite book|title=WHO case definitions of HIV for surveillance and revised clinical staging and immunological classification of HIV-related disease in adults and children.|pages=6–16|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/HIVstaging150307.pdf|format=PDF|year=2007|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-159562-9}}</ref> The WHO system uses the following categories:
* Primary HIV infection: May be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>
* Stage I: HIV infection is [[asymptomatic]] with a CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood.<ref name=WHOCase2007/> May include generalized lymph node enlargement.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>
* Stage II: Mild symptoms which may include minor [[Mucous membrane|mucocutaneous]] manifestations and recurrent [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s. A CD4 count of less than 500/µl.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>
* Stage III: Advanced symptoms which may include unexplained [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[diarrhea]] for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung, and a CD4 count of less than 350/µl.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>
* Stage IV or AIDS: severe symptoms which include [[toxoplasmosis]] of the brain, [[candidiasis]] of the [[esophagus]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[bronchus|bronchi]] or [[lung]]s and [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. A CD4 count of less than 200/µl.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>

*Stage 0: the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test followed less than 180 days by a positive test
*Stage 1: CD4 count ≥ 500&nbsp;cells/µl and no AIDS defining conditions
*Stage 2: CD4 count 200 to 500&nbsp;cells/µl and no AIDS defining conditions
*Stage 3: CD4 count ≤ 200&nbsp;cells/µl or AIDS defining conditions
*Unknown: if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications

For surveillance purposes, the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured.<ref name="M121"/>

* ''Symbolic AIDS stigma''—the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease.<ref name="Herek1999" />

Returning to work after beginning treatment for HIV/AIDS is difficult, and affected people often work less than the average worker. [[Unemployment]] in people with HIV/AIDS also is associated with [[suicidal ideation]], memory problems, and social isolation; employment increases [[self-esteem]], sense of dignity, confidence, and [[quality of life]]. A 2015 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence that antiretroviral treatment helps people with HIV/AIDS work more, and increases the chance that a person with HIV/AIDS will be employed.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Interventions for improving employment outcomes for workers with HIV|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2015|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 26022149|pages = CD010090|volume = 5|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010090.pub2|first = Rachel|last = Robinson|first2 = Emmanuel|last2 = Okpo|first3 = Nomusa|last3 = Mngoma}}</ref>

By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for [[government spending|public expenditure]]s such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.<ref name=Greener />

At the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] showed that households having a person with HIV/AIDS spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.<ref name="WBank">

=== Religion and AIDS ===
{{Main|Religion and HIV/AIDS}}
The topic of religion and AIDS has become highly controversial in the past twenty years, primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/AIDS-Stigma.aspx |title=AIDS Stigma |work=News-medical.net |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Thirty years after AIDS discovery, appreciation growing for Catholic approach">{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/thirty-years-after-aids-discovery-appreciation-growing-for-catholic-approach/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+catholicnewsagency%2Fdailynews+%28CNA+Daily+News%29 |title=Thirty years after AIDS discovery, appreciation growing for Catholic approach |work=Catholicnewsagency.com |date=June 5, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref> The religious approach to prevent the spread of AIDS according to a report by American health expert Matthew Hanley titled ''The Catholic Church and the Global AIDS Crisis'' argues that cultural changes are needed including a re-emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it.<ref name="Thirty years after AIDS discovery, appreciation growing for Catholic approach"/>

Some religious organisations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. In 2011, the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS, and the [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to a number of deaths.<ref name=BBC18102011>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|title=Church HIV prayer cure claims 'cause three deaths'|date=October 18, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2011|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The [[Synagogue Church Of All Nations]] advertise an "anointing water" to promote God's healing, although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication.<ref name=BBC18102011 />

One of the first high-profile cases of AIDS was the American [[Rock Hudson]], a gay actor who had been married and divorced earlier in life, who died on October 2, 1985 having announced that he was suffering from the virus on July 25 that year.

Therese Frare's photograph of gay activist [[David Kirby (activist)|David Kirby]], as he lay dying from AIDS while surrounded by family, was taken in April 1990. ''[[LIFE magazine]]'' said the photo became the one image "most powerfully identified with the HIV/AIDS epidemic."

=== Criminal transmission ===
{{Main|Criminal transmission of HIV}}
Criminal transmission of HIV is the [[intention (criminal law)|intentional]] or [[recklessness (law)|reckless]] infection of a person with the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the United States, have laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure.<ref>{{cite web|title=HIV-Specific Criminal Laws|url=http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=November 22, 2014|date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> Others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the HIV pandemic.

Several discredited [[conspiracy theories]] have held that HIV was created by scientists, either inadvertently or deliberately. [[Operation INFEKTION]] was a worldwide Soviet [[active measures]] operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV/AIDS.

== Research ==
{{Main|HIV/AIDS research}}
HIV/AIDS research includes all [[medical research]] which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS along with fundamental research about the nature of [[HIV]] as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.

Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral [[health interventions]] such as [[sex education]], and [[drug development]], such as research into [[microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]], [[HIV vaccines]], and [[antiretroviral drugs]]. Other medical research areas include the topics of [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]], [[post-exposure prophylaxis]], and [[circumcision and HIV]].
