'''Abilene''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|b|ə|l|iː|n}} {{respell|AB|ə-leen}}) is a city in [[Taylor County, Texas|Taylor]] and [[Jones County, Texas|Jones]] counties in west central [[Texas]], [[United States]]. The population was 117,063 according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] making it the [[List of cities in Texas by population|twenty-seventh most populous]] city in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Texas]]. It is the principal city of the [[Abilene metropolitan area|Abilene Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which had a 2011 estimated population of 166,416.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2011/ |title=Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas |work=2011 Population Estimates |publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref> It is the [[county seat]] of Taylor County.<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> [[Dyess Air Force Base]] is located on the west side of the city.

Abilene is located off [[Interstate 20 in Texas|Interstate 20]], between exits 279 on its western edge and 292 on the east. Abilene is {{convert|150|mi|km}} west of [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The city is looped by I-20 to the north, US 83/84 on the west, and Loop 322 to the east. A railroad divides the city down the center into north and south.  The historic downtown area is on the north side of the railroad.

The fastest-growing sections of the city are growing to the southwest, along Southwest Drive, the Winters Freeway, and the Buffalo Gap Road corridor; the southeast, along Loop 322, Oldham Lane, Industrial Drive, and Maple Street; and in the northeast near the intersection of SH 351 and I-20. Many [[Developments in Abilene, Texas|developments]] have begun in these three areas within the last few years. There are three lakes in the city, Lytle Lake on the western edge of [[Abilene Regional Airport]], [[Kirby Lake]] on the southeast corner of the US 83/84 & Loop 322 interchange, and [[Fort Phantom Hill|Lake Fort Phantom Hill]] in Jones County in northern Abilene.

Established by cattlemen as a stock shipping point on the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] in 1881, the city was named after [[Abilene, Kansas]],<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Abilene|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=32–33}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|year=1905|page=22|author=Gannett, Henry|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BqwPAAAAIAAJ|isbn=0-7884-0579-9}}</ref> the original endpoint for the [[Chisholm Trail]]. The T&P had bypassed the town of [[Buffalo Gap, Texas|Buffalo Gap]], the county seat at the time. Eventually, a landowner north of Buffalo Gap, Clabe Merchant, known as the father of Abilene, chose the name for the new town. According to a Dallas newspaper, about eight hundred people had already begun camping at the townsite, before the lots were sold. The town was laid out by Colonel J. Stoddard Johnson, and the auction of lots began early on March 15, 1881. By the end of the first day, 139 lots were sold for a total of $23,810, and another 178 lots were sold the next day for $27,550.

Abilene was incorporated soon after being founded in 1881,<ref name=EB/> and Abilenians began to set their sights on bringing the county seat to Abilene and, in a three-to-one vote, won the election. In 1888, the Progressive Committee was formed to attract businesses to the area, which later became the Board of Trade in 1890. By 1900, 3,411 people lived in Abilene, and in that decade, the Board of Trade changed its name to the 25,000 Club in the hope of reaching 25,000 people by the next census. However this committee failed when the population only hit 9,204 in 1910. Replacing it was the Young Men's Booster Club, which became the Abilene Chamber of Commerce in 1914.

The cornerstone was laid for the first of three future universities in Abilene, called Simmons College, in 1891,<ref name=EB/> which later became [[Hardin-Simmons University]]. Childers Classical Institute followed in 1906,<ref name=EB/> currently [[Abilene Christian University]], Abilene's largest of the three. In 1923, McMurry College was founded and later became [[McMurry University]].<ref name=EB/> Much more recently, Abilene succeeded in bringing Cisco Junior College and Texas State Technical College branches to Abilene, with the Cisco Junior College headquarters being located in Abilene.

In 1940, Abilene raised the money to purchase land for a U.S. Army base, southwest of town, named [[Camp Barkeley]], which was at the time, twice the size of Abilene with 60,000 men. When the base closed, many worried that Abilene could become a ghost town, but in the post-World War II boom, many servicemen returned to start businesses in Abilene. In the early-1950s, residents raised $893,261 to purchase {{convert|3400|acre|km2}} of land for an Air Force base. Today, [[Dyess Air Force Base]] is the city's largest employer, with 6,076 employees.<ref>[http://myabilene.com/living_here/content.cfm?content_id=599]  {{wayback|url=http://myabilene.com/living_here/content.cfm?content_id=599 |date=20071011060149 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://myabilene.com/history/content.cfm?content_id=595 |title=History of Abilene "From railroad tracks to vapor trails" |publisher=myabilene.com |accessdate=2 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071009220118/http://myabilene.com/history/content.cfm?content_id=595 |archivedate=October 9, 2007 }}</ref> By 1960, Abilene's population nearly doubled in 10 years from 45,570 in 1950 to 90,638. In the same year, a second high school was added, [[Cooper High School (Abilene, Texas)|Cooper High School]]. In 1966, the Abilene Zoo was created near Abilene Regional Airport. The following year, one of the most important bond elections in the city's history passed for the funding of the construction of the Abilene Civic Center and the Taylor County Coliseum, as well as major improvements to Abilene Regional Airport. In 1969, the Woodson elementary and high school for black students closed as the schools are integrated.

In 1982, Abilene became the first city in Texas to create a downtown reinvestment zone. [[Texas State Technical College]] opened an Abilene branch three years later. The 2,250-bed French Robertson Prison Unit was built in 1989. A half-cent [[sales tax]] earmarked for economic development was created after the decline in the [[petroleum]] business in the 1980s. A branch of [[Cisco Junior College]] was located in the city in 1990.

[[The Grace Museum]] and [[Paramount Theatre (Abilene, Texas)|Paramount Theatre]] revitalizations, along with Artwalk in 1992 sparked a decade of downtown restoration. In 2004, [[Frontier Texas!]], a multi-media museum highlighting the history of the area from 1780 to 1880 was constructed, and a new $8 million, {{convert|38|acre|m2|adj=on}} Cisco Junior College campus was built at Loop 322 and Industrial Boulevard. Simultaneously, subdivisions and businesses started locating along the freeway, on the same side as the CJC campus, showing a slow but progressive trend for Abilene growth on the Loop. Abilene has become the commercial, retail, medical, and transportation hub of a 19-county area more commonly known as "The Big Country," but also known as the "Texas Midwest", and is part of the [[Central Great Plains (ecoregion)|Central Great Plains]] ecology region.  By the end of 2005, commercial and residential development had reached record levels in and around the city.<ref>[http://myabilene.com/history/content.cfm?content_id=601] {{wayback|url=http://myabilene.com/history/content.cfm?content_id=601 |date=20071009220138 }}</ref>

Abilene has two school districts within the city limits, the [[Abilene Independent School District]] (AISD) and [[Wylie Independent School District (Taylor County, Texas)|Wylie Independent School District]] (WISD). The local high schools are [[Abilene High School (Abilene, Texas)|Abilene High School]] and [[Cooper High School (Abilene, Texas)|Cooper High School]] of AISD and [[Wylie High School (Abilene, Texas)|Wylie High School]] of WISD. A new building on the [[Hardin-Simmons University]] campus serves AISD high school students as a magnet school, called [[Holland Medical High School]], as well as HSU students as the Holland School of Sciences and Mathematics. The Holland Medical High School is affiliated with Hendrick Medical Center, which is across Ambler Avenue from the university campus. Abilene also has a new high school that opened in the fall of 2009, the [[Academy of Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Science]] (A.T.E.M.S.). It is a [[STEM fields#In the United States|STEM]] school, which focuses on computer science, engineering science, and mathematics. The school only accepts about 100 students each year, provides each student with their own laptop computer, and is located inside the Abilene campus of [[Texas State Technical College System|Texas State Technical College]].

{{update| this section|date=September 2012}}
AISD has begun taking steps towards creating magnet schools for the school district. The district is considering locating a specialized math and science classroom at [[McMurry University]], taught by both a university professor and AISD teacher, on the campus. A plan for the future calls for the creation of a magnet school system specializing in four areas: math, science, technology, and fine arts. The four areas will be divided among each of the four middle schools in the district. Regular curriculum will still be taught, but extra emphasis and equipment would be given based on the specific field of the school, such as extra labs for a science school, and an instrument lab for a fine arts school.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/2008/mar/27/attracting-magnet-schools/ |title=Attracting magnet schools |publisher=Reporter News |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref> Also, Bond Proposition 2 for the 2008 AISD bond election proposed a new Professional and Technology magnet school to be located at Lincoln Middle School,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/2008/apr/12/no-headline---remodel_vs_new/|title=Lincoln a Magnet School?|date=April 12, 2008|publisher=reporternews.com}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> one of the oldest schools in the city, after a major renovation project.

==Notable buildings==

The many historical buildings in Abilene include the following:

*Marshal Tom Hill House in [[Buffalo Gap Historic Village]] south of Abilene echoes a moving human interest story. When Hill died in an accidental shooting at thirty-two years of age in 1886, his wife, Mollie, and daughter, Belle, were left to provide for themselves in difficult times over six decades. 
*The Dodd-Harkrider House at 2026 North Third Street is a two-story Four-Square dwelling provides a glimpse into the Americana of 1915.
*Wooten Hotel (1930) at 302 Cypress Street downtown, built by grocery entrepreneur H. O. Wooten, sixteen stories tall, is designed after the Drake Hotel in [[Chicago]]. It was restored in 2004 as apartments for the upwardly mobile.
*First Baptist Church (1954) at 1442 North Second Street has a spire 140 feet from the ground. Pastor Dr. Jesse Northcutt oversaw the planning of this building of 325 tons of steel. 
*The Church of the Heavenly Rest, Episcopal, at 602 Meander Street, reflects surprising Gothic architecture on the West Texas Plains. Its plaque reads: "No man entering a house ignores him who dwells in it. This is the house of God and He is here."
*The Moreland-Shaheen House, 1120 Elmwood Drive, is a 1946  Art Moderne dwelling, shaded by six fruit trees, is also referred to as the "Sugar House" because Henry Moreland operated the Abilene [[Dr Pepper]] and [[7-Up]] bottling companies.

An Abilene dwelling has an indirect link to Hollywood actress Joan Crawford: her father, Thomas LeSeur, was a construction laborer on the George R. Davis House at 718 Victoria Street, built in 1930 in [[Prairie School]] architecture.
 
*The 20-story Enterprise Building at 500 Chestnut Street, the highest structure in Abilene, soars to 283 feet above the Plains.
*The Taylor County Courthouse at 300 Oak Street, with its international architectural style of concrete and pink granite, resembles few other courthouses.
*[[Paramount Theatre (Abilene, Texas)|Paramount Theatre]] at 352 Cypress Street opened in 1930 and restored in 1986 had an original marquee 90 feet tall, with 1,400 lights.
*Abilene Courts at 633 South Eleventh Street, a defunct [[motel]] built in 1930 alongside The Bankhead Highway (the precursor to U.S. Highway 80 and Interstate 20) reflects the Abilene of yesteryear.<ref>Donald S.
