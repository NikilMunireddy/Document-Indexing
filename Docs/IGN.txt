'''IGN''' (formerly '''Imagine Games Network''') is a [[San Francisco]]-based games and entertainment media company operated by IGN Entertainment Inc., a subsidiary of [[j2 Global]] and wholly owned by [[Ziff Davis]]. and headed up by its former editor-in-chief, [[Peer Schneider]]. The website was the brainchild of media entrepreneur [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] and launched on September 29, 1996. It focuses on [[video game]]s, [[film]]s, [[television]], [[comic]]s, [[technology]], and other media. The company is located in [[San Francisco]]'s SOMA district in [[California]], [[United States]]. Originally a network of desktop websites, IGN is now distributed on mobile platforms, console programs on the [[Xbox]] and [[PlayStation]], [[FireTV]], [[Roku]], and via [[YouTube]], [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]], [[Hulu]], and [[Snapchat]].

Originally, IGN was the flagship property of parent company IGN Entertainment, which owned and operated several other websites oriented towards players' interests, games, and entertainment, such as [[Rotten Tomatoes]], [[GameSpy]], ''[[GameStats]]'', ''[[VE3D]]'', [[TeamXbox]], [[Vault Network]], FilePlanet, and [[AskMen]], among others. IGN was sold to publishing company [[Ziff Davis]] in February 2013 and now operates as a [[J2 Global]] subsidiary.

== History ==
[[File:Ignentertainmenthq.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Nondescript eight-story beige building with black windows striped across|IGN Entertainment's former headquarters in [[Brisbane, California|Brisbane]], [[California]]]]
Created in September 1996 as the ''Imagine Games Network'', the IGN content network was founded by publishing executive Jonathan Simpson-Bint and began as five individual websites within [[Future US|Imagine Media]]: N64.com (later renamed ign64.com), PSXPower, Saturnworld, Next-Generation.com and Ultra Game Players Online. Imagine expanded on its owned-and-operated websites by creating an affiliate network that included a number of independent fansites such as PSX Nation.com, Sega-Saturn.com, Game Sages, and GameFAQs. In 1998, the network launched a new homepage that consolidated the individual sites as system ''channels'' under the IGN brand. The homepage exposed content from more than 30 different channels. Next-Generation and Ultra Game Players Online were not part of this consolidation; U.G.P.O. dissolved with the cancellation of the magazine, and Next-Generation was put "on hold" when Imagine decided to concentrate on launching the short-lived [[Daily Radar]] brand.

In February 1999, Imagine Media incorporated a spin-off that included IGN and its affiliate channels as Affiliation Networks, while Simpson-Bint remained at the former company. In September, the newly spun-out standalone internet media company, changed its name to Snowball.com. At the same time, small entertainment website The Den merged into IGN and added non-gaming content to the growing network. Snowball held an IPO in 2000, but shed most of its other properties during the [[dot-com bubble]]. IGN prevailed with growing audience numbers and a newly established subscription service called IGN Insider (now: IGN Prime), which led to the shedding of the name "Snowball" and adoption of IGN Entertainment on May 10, 2002.

In June 2005, IGN reported having 24,000,000 unique visitors per month, with 4.8 million registered users through all departments of the site. IGN is ranked among the top 200 most-visited websites according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Doe |first=Johnny |url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ign.com |title=ign.com&nbsp;— Site Information from Alexa |publisher=Alexa |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> In September 2005, IGN was acquired by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s multi-media business empire, [[News Corporation]], for [[United States dollar|$]]650 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/sep2005/id20050911_550700.htm|title=News Corp.

=== Acquisition of UGO, sale to Ziff Davis ===
In 2011, IGN Entertainment acquired its rival [[UGO Entertainment]] (owners of [[1UP.com]]) from [[Hearst Corporation]]. Ultimately, News Corp. planned to spin off IGN Entertainment as a publicly traded company, continuing a string of divestitures for digital properties it had previously acquired (including [[MySpace]] and [[Photobucket]]).<ref name=atd-spinoff>{{cite web|title=News Corp.'s IGN Buys Hearst's UGO In Preparation For Game Site Spin-Off|url=http://allthingsd.com/20110501/news-corp-s-ign-buys-hearsts-ugo-in-preparation-for-game-site-spin-off/|publisher=All Things Digital|accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref>

On February 4, 2013 after a failed attempt to spin off IGN as a separate company, News Corp. announced that it had sold IGN Entertainment to the publishing company [[Ziff Davis]], which was recently acquired by [[J2 Global]]. Financial details regarding the purchase were not revealed. Prior to its acquisition by UGO, 1UP.com had previously been owned by Ziff Davis.<ref name=athingsd-ziff>{{cite web|title=News Corp.’s IGN Poised to Sell to J2’s Ziff Davis|url=http://allthingsd.com/20130201/exclusive-news-corp-s-ign-poised-to-sell-to-j2s-ziff-davis/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=ds-ziff>{{cite web|title=IGN Entertainment sold by News Corp to publisher Ziff Davis|url=http://www.digitalspy.ca/media/news/a456178/ign-entertainment-sold-by-news-corp-to-publisher-ziff-davis.html|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref> Soon after the acquisition, IGN announced that it would be laying off staff and closing GameSpy, 1UP.com, and UGO in order to focus on its flagship brands, IGN.com and AskMen.<ref name=joystiq-layoffs>{{cite web|title=IGN hit with layoffs; 1UP, Gamespy and UGO shutting down|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/21/ign-layoffs/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=21 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Scoring systems ===

==== Original scale ====
A member of the IGN staff writes a review for a game and gives it a score between 0.1 and 10.0, which is assigned by increments of 0.1 and determines how much the game is recommended. The score is given according to the "individual aspects of a game, like presentation, graphics, sound, gameplay and lasting appeal." Each game is given a score in each of these categories, but the overall score for the game is an independent evaluation, not an average of the scores in each category.<ref name="Policy">{{cite web | title=IGN Ratings and Reviews Policy | url=http://games.ign.com/ratings.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420090706/http://games.ign.com/ratings.html |archive-date=2009-04-20 | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>

==== 20-point scale ====
On August 3, 2010, IGN announced that the site would be changing to a new scoring scale. Instead of a 100-point scale, where games are scored in increments of 0.1, all future reviews will use a 20-point scale where games are scored in increments of 0.5. Under both systems, the maximum possible score a game can receive is 10.0. The scoring change is not retroactive: all scores on reviews written before the change will remain the same. This change also does not affect the scoring system for reader reviews.

==== 100-point scale ====
On September 13, 2012, IGN revealed that as part of their new review format all future reviews would now follow a 100-point scale again, but this time without using decimals, meaning a score of 8.5 would now be an 85. Unlike the previous conversion to the 20-point scale, this latest scoring system change will be retroactive and all previous IGN review scores will be updated to follow the new system. However, despite the announcement, the article included a short addition, post release. It stated that after much discussion, they have decided to retain the decimal point in all upcoming scores.<ref>{{cite web|author=j bendickson |url=http://www.ign.com/blogs/kamicasey/2012/09/13/ign-reviews-20-the-future-of-reviews-starts-now/ |title=Reviews 2.0 - The Future of Reviews Starts Now &nbsp;— Blog by kami casey |publisher=IGN |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>

==== Re-review policy ====
In early 2014, IGN introduced a new policy, in which a game's review score can be re-reviewed and improved, provided that continuous updates form a significant change in the game compared to how it was at launch. Examples of games in which they were re-reviewed were ''[[League of Legends]]'' and the pocket edition of ''[[Minecraft]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Other sections ==
In 2000, Snowball.com purchased an [[Fantasy wrestling|E-federation]] called the Internet Wrestling Organization (IWO).<ref name="IWO">{{cite web|url=http://www.iwo-online.com/fed_history.shtml|title=Internet Wrestling Organization|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000519215622/http://www.iwo-online.com/fed_history.shtml|archivedate=2000-05-19}}</ref> Since Snowball owned both IWO and IGN, IWO would go on to become IGN's first official E-Fed, even doing a column on the website. The ''IGN For Men'' section officially closed down on October 2, 2001 and is no longer updated. IGN has sites such as ''IGN Stars'' and ''AskMen.com'' that fulfill much of the function of the old ''IGN For Men'' site. IGN Wrestling met its end in early 2002, when many of the staff departed. Interviews with [[professional wrestling]] personalities and coverage of wrestling games has been folded into IGN Sports, currently headed by Jon Robinson. IGN Sci-Fi: Largely dead since 2002, this section of the site included movie news, comic book reviews, anime coverage and other associated items. It has since been discontinued. The site, ''SciFI.ign.com'', now redirects to the recently created SciFiBrain.ign.com, which covers some of the content of the old Sci-Fi site.

In 2002, IGN launched a dedicated videogame FAQs site specifically designed to host user-submitted guides.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/364/364331p1.html|title=Get the FAQs|publisher=IGN|date=2002-07-09}}</ref> This was launched following the cancellation of affiliation with [[GameFAQs]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In 2004, IGN launched ''[[GameStats]]'', which serves as a more unbiased rating network, as it takes in scores from every corporately owned game rating site and averages them all into one score to give a general idea of the quality of a game. IGN also launched ''[[Direct2Drive|Direct2Drive.com]]'' in 2004. Its primary focus is selling digital downloads of full PC and Mac video games, as well as anime, comics and game guides. In 2005, IGN launched its comics site, which is devoted to not just the staple Marvel and DC titles, but also manga, graphic novels, statues and toys.

In 2006, IGN launched its television site. It provides interviews with various television celebrities, in addition to a TV schedule, TV trivia and TV news. Akin to IGN FilmForce, IGN's TV section has a variety of exclusive clips from upcoming television shows.

On May 30, 2006, ''IGN Dreamcast'' was restarted; however, none of the Dreamcast updates were posted on the main IGN webpage.

In 2007, IGN launched its [[anime]] site. It provided features on anime and manga, including trailers and free episodes. It also included reviews of manga and anime from other sections of IGN, such as ''IGN Comics'' and ''IGN DVD''. The anime channel was dropped after IGN redesigned the site. In 2008, the ''IGN Retro'' channel was launched to mark IGN's 10th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.games.ign.com/articles/845/845125p1.html |title=IGN: Playing With the Past: IGN Retro |publisher=Uk.games.ign.com |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> To coincide with the release of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', IGN created the ''Super Smash Bros. World'' site. On the site, people can submit their user created stages from the game and download ones made by other people. IGN subsequently launched a similar website called ''GTA 'Hood'' on April 29, 2008, for ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''.

Along with their popular website content, IGN also publishes many different podcasts on both their website and on [[iTunes]]. Some of their podcasts include "Podcast Beyond" which is their PlayStation podcast with hosts, [[Greg Miller (Internet personality)|Marty Sliva]] and Max Scoville. Their Xbox oriented podcast is "Podcast Unlocked" with Ryan McCaffrey, Mitch Dyer, Destin Legarie, and Marty Sliva as the hosts. ''Nintendo Voice Chat'' is IGN's Nintendo podcast, hosted by Jose Otero, accompanied by Peer Schneider and Brian Altano. ''Game Scoop!'' is another popular podcast where they discuss news and topics surrounding the video game industry with host Daemon Hatfield and a panel of IGN employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles?tags=podcast|title=IGN Podcasts|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>

== Regional websites ==
Since 2006, IGN Entertainment began launching regional versions of the website for various countries and pan-regions. Initially, IGN began opening new offices outside the United States in order to support those regional websites, but later IGN began franchising its brand as a more cost-effective means of globalization, wherein it licensed various media publishers in many countries to use the IGN brand and manage regional websites on their own. When visiting <code>www.ign.com</code> from an IGN-supported region, the site automatically redirects visitors to their localized version using [[geolocation software]], based on their countries' IP addresses. Each version of the site has a modified logo with their country's/region's respective flags near the IGN logo. However, it is still possible to access the original American website using a navigation bar on top or below (depending on regional website) the page's master template.

IGN opened its first offices in the UK and Australia in 2006, which both share the same information as the American site but with added content authored from editors within each respective region. Other licensed regional publishers work on their own servers, albeit can link to IGN's HQ database, where they can import and/or translate articles, and use videos uploaded on IGN's servers that use IGN's own hosted video player.

On May 16, 2012, in collaboration with the [[United Arab Emirates|Emirati]]-based company t-break<!-- Official spelling --> Media, IGN Middle East was announced for the [[MENA]] gaming community. The site replaces t-break Media's own ME Gamers website, which was formerly one of the largest Middle Eastern-based gaming media outlets that was originally launched in 2006. ME Gamers' entire staff converted their duties to IGN Middle East, importing and/or translating many of IGN's English articles, whilst writing up their own articles, especially for Middle Eastern-specific events. IGN Middle East is available in both English and Arabic languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/news/879/IGN-Entertainment-and-T-Break-Media-launch-IGN-Middle-East |title=IGN Entertainment and T-Break Media launch IGN Middle East |first=Abbas |last=Jaffar Ali |publisher=IGN Middle East |date=2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref> Whilst the site was initially launched to cover only video games, t-break Media announced in September 2012 that they started posting movie-related articles under the IGN brand as IGN Movies Middle East, merging most of the duties from their own ME Movies website, which was originally established in 2009, under a similar manner to their video game content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/news/3718/ME-Movies-has-merged-with-IGN-Movies- |title=ME-Movies Has Now Merged With IGN Middle East Movies |first=Faisal |last=Hashmi |publisher=IGN Middle East |date=2012-09-02 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref> Unlike video games, however, most movie-related content will be in English only.

In September 2012 the Italian edition of IGN launched, managed by a local team, providing both original and translated contents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://it.ign.com |title=Videogiochi, trucchi, recensioni, notizie, anteprime, video e trailer da IGN |publisher=It.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>

On October 9, 2012, in collaboration with the Spanish-based media company [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]], IGN Spain was announced. The site effectively replaces Marca's own Marca Player gaming news website. Marca Player's editors converted their duties to IGN Spain, translating many of IGN's English articles, whilst writing up their own Spanish articles as well, covering various topics including video games, movies, TV series and comics.<ref name="IGNSpain" /> Marca also plans in the long run to eventually release another Spanish IGN website specifically for the pan-regional, Spanish-speaking gaming community in [[Latin America]].<ref name="IGNSpain">{{cite web|url=http://es.ign.com/static/122/Bienvenidos-a-IGN-Espa-a|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212171158/http://es.ign.com/static/122/Bienvenidos-a-IGN-Espa-a|archivedate=2013-12-12 |title=Bienvenidos a IGN España |language=Spanish |first=David |last=Sanz |publisher=IGN Spain |date=2012-10-09 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref>
