'''Hamilton Academical Football Club''', often known as '''Hamilton Accies''', or '''The Accies''', are a Scottish [[association football|football]] club from [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]] in [[South Lanarkshire]] who currently compete in the [[Scottish Premiership]], having been promoted from the [[2013–14 Scottish Championship]]. They were established in 1874 from the school football team at [[Hamilton Academy]] and remain the only professional club in British football to have originated from a school team. Hamilton have won the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] twice and have finished runners-up in the [[Scottish Cup]] twice. The club currently play their home games at [[New Douglas Park]].

==Club history==
Hamilton Academical F.C. was formed in late 1874 by the Rector and pupils of the [[Hamilton Grammar School|local school]]. The club soon became members of the [[Scottish Football Association]] and initially began competing in the [[Scottish Cup]] and [[Scottish Qualifying Cup|Qualifying Cup]], before joining the [[Scottish Football League]] in November 1897 following the resignation of [[Renton F.C.|Renton]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.acciesfc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1779:accies-news&catid=44:news&Itemid=140 | title=Accies News | publisher=Hamilton Academical F.C. | date=26 February 2012 | accessdate=27 February 2012}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Hamilton briefly resigned from the league due to mounting debts.<ref name = "WSC">{{cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/wsc-daily/1176-april-2014/11370-hamilton-academical-prospering-with-frugal-ethos|title=Hamilton Academical prospering with frugal ethos|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 April 2014|author=Alex Anderson|publisher=When Saturday Comes}}</ref> In 1994 the club sold its home ground, [[Douglas Park|Douglas Park stadium]], to [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket, and subsequently ground-shared in Coatbridge and Glasgow for seven years.<ref name = "WSC"/> During this period the club went through financial hardships and unpaid players went on strike.<ref name = "WSC"/> As a result, Hamilton was unable to fulfil its fixtures during the 1999–2000 season and was docked 15 points, the eventual result of which was relegation to the Third Division.<ref name = "WSC"/> The club moved into its [[New Douglas Park]] stadium in 2001.<ref name = "WSC"/>

In 2008, for the first time in 20 years, Accies gained promotion to the top division of Scottish football, the [[Scottish Premier League]].  In the [[2009–10 Scottish Premier League|2009–10 season]], a 3–0 victory against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] on 17 April 2010 secured a third straight season in Scotland's top flight, with four games remaining.<ref>http://www.acciesfc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=523&Itemid=173</ref>

The Accies' stay in the SPL ended in the [[2010–11 Scottish Premier League|2010–11 season]], when they were relegated after a 1–0 defeat away to [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9480347.stm | work=BBC News | first=Paul | last=Bradley | title=St Johnstone 1–0 Hamilton | date=10 May 2011}}</ref>  Despite their relegation, Hamilton's time in the top flight was most notable for their emphasis on youth including midfielders [[James McCarthy (footballer)|James McCarthy]] and [[James McArthur]], both of whom went on to play for [[Wigan Athletic F.C.]] in the [[English Premier League]] before gaining international recognition.

===Return to the Premiership===

After a hard-fought campaign during the [[2013–14 Scottish Championship|2013–14 Scottish Championship season]], Accies finished in second position on the final day of the season following a 10–2 home victory over [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]]. Despite the disappointment of missing out on automatic promotion to [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], they went on to defeat [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] 2–1 on aggregate in the first stage of their [[Scottish Premiership|Premiership]] play-off to face top-flight [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] over two legs for a place in the [[2014–15 Scottish Premiership]]. Hamilton lost the first leg 2–0 at New Douglas Park, but two away goals in the return leg at [[Easter Road]], including an injury time strike, forced the tie to extra time and penalty-kicks. Hamilton converted all of their spot-kicks and gained promotion back to the top flight.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Clive|title=Hamilton Academical ended their three-year absence from Scotland's top flight after a dramatic penalty shootout that consigned Hibernian to relegation.|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27464444|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Neil left the club in January 2015, to take up a position at English club Norwich.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30744801</ref><ref>http://acciesfc.co.uk/index.php/news/328-update-on-managerial-position</ref>

==Stadium==
{{main|New Douglas Park}}

The club play their fixtures at [[New Douglas Park]], which was opened in 2001.  The pitch is an artificial surface, one of two in the [[Scottish Premiership]] alongside [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]].  The stadium has an overall capacity of 6,018 and is composed of two permanent and one temporary stand.[[File:New Douglas Park - 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[New Douglas Park]], home of Hamilton Academical]]

The ground replaced [[Douglas Park]], which was the home of Hamilton from 1888 to 1994. The ground was eventually sold to supermarket chain [[Sainsbury's]] in 1994, with the proceeds going towards the construction of the new stadium, which lies adjacent to the site of Douglas Park.

Between 1994 and 2001 the club had no home. They ground-shared at [[Cliftonhill]] and [[Firhill Stadium]].
