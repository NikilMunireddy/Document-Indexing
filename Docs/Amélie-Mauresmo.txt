==Biography==

===Early life===
Mauresmo was born in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], slightly northwest of [[Paris]]. She began playing tennis at the age of four, after being inspired by [[Yannick Noah]]'s win in the [[1983 French Open]] on television. It was after his win that Mauresmo's parents bought her her first tennis racket. Later on in 1998 Yannick Noah picked her on the [[France Fed Cup team|French team]] for the [[Fed Cup]]. Her mother Françoise is a housewife and her father Francis, who died in March 2004, was an engineer. She has a brother, Fabien, who is an engineer.

In 1996, Mauresmo captured both the junior [[1996 French Open|French Open]] and [[1996 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] women's singles titles. She was named 1996 Junior World Champion by the [[International Tennis Federation]].

==Player career==
The unseeded Mauresmo reached the [[1999 Australian Open|Australian Open]] final in 1999 with wins over three seeded players, including world no. 1 [[Lindsay Davenport]], before falling to world no. 2 [[Martina Hingis]]. Mauresmo was only the second Frenchwoman ever to reach the Australian Open final; ([[Mary Pierce]] was the first, winning the championship in 1995). She was only the third Frenchwoman to reach any [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] final during the [[Tennis Open Era|Open Era]].

Mauresmo defeated Hingis later in the year, en route to the final of the [[Open Gaz de France|Paris indoor]] event.

After the defeat of Davenport at the Australian Open, Mauresmo, 19 at the time, [[coming out|came out]] as [[gay]] to the international press.<ref name=cobio>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070703045634/http://www.gaysports.com/page.cfm?Sectionid=31&typeofsite=storydetail&ID=642&storyset=yes Lesbian Tennis Star Amelie Mauresmo Named World's Top Player]</ref> She "attributed her success on the court to coming to terms with her sexuality and finding love."<ref name=cobio/> She also endured [[homophobic]] taunts from fellow competitors, whom she later went on to defeat.<ref name=cobio/>

===2004: Olympic silver, world No.1===
Mauresmo reached the semifinals at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], where she lost to [[Serena Williams]] in three sets after winning the first set and up a break in the second set. She reached the quarterfinals of the three other [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments and won three [[Tier I]] titles in [[Rome Masters|Rome]], [[Qatar Telecom German Open|Berlin]], and [[Canada Masters|Montreal]].

Mauresmo won a silver medal in singles at the [[2004 Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in Athens, where she was defeated by Belgian [[Justine Henin]] in the final.

On 13 September 2004, Mauresmo became the first French tennis player to become world no. 1 since the computer rankings began in the 1970s. She held that ranking for five weeks and was the second woman, after [[Kim Clijsters]], to have attained the top spot without having won a Grand Slam title.

===2005===
Mauresmo reached the quarter-finals of the [[2005 Australian Open|Australian Open]], but was defeated there by eventual champion [[Serena Williams]].

At the [[2005 French Open|French Open]], seeded third, Mauresmo was upset in the third round by the then little-known 17-year-old [[Ana Ivanovic]] of [[Serbia and Montenegro|Serbia]] in three sets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4590387.stm |title=Serbian starlet shocks Mauresmo |publisher=BBC News |date=28 May 2005 |accessdate=2012-09-15}}</ref> Mauresmo had, at the Australian Open earlier in the year, become the first player to defeat the Serb in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, winning in straight sets also in the third round.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-01-21/mauresmo-through-after-second-set-tussle/623340 Mauresmo through after second set tussle], ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)</ref>

At the [[2005 U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]], Mauresmo lost in the quarter-finals to [[Mary Pierce]] in straight sets. That followed a semi-final loss to [[Lindsay Davenport]] at [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]].
[[File:Amelie Mauresmo Australian Open 2005.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mauresmo at the [[2005 Australian Open]]]]

Mauresmo claimed her first singles title at the [[2005 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Tour Championships]]. She defeated Pierce in the final after losing to Pierce in a round-robin match at that tournament, in three sets.

===2006: Two Grand Slam titles===
At the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Mauresmo captured her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles title, defeating Belgian former world no. 1 players [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Justine Henin]] en route. Both opponents retired from their respective matches, Clijsters with a right ankle sprain in the third set of their semifinal and Henin from [[gastroenteritis]] in the final. Mauresmo was leading in both matches at the time of the retirements, by 6–1, 2–0 against Henin.

Mauresmo then won her next two tournaments, the [[Open Gaz de France]] tournament in Paris (defeating [[Mary Pierce]] in the final) and the [[Proximus Diamond Games]] in Antwerp (defeating Clijsters in the final).

At the [[Qatar Total Open]] in [[Doha]], Mauresmo defeated [[Martina Hingis]] in a semifinal, 6–2, 6–2, but lost to [[Nadia Petrova]] in the final. Had she won the final, she would have immediately regained the world no. 1 ranking from Clijsters. Nonetheless, the outcome was sufficient to ensure Mauresmo's return to the world no. 1 ranking on 20 March 2006.

Mauresmo then reached the semifinals of the [[Sony Ericsson Open]] in [[Key Biscayne, Florida]], where she lost to the eventual champion [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]].

Mauresmo lost in the fourth round of the [[2006 French Open|French Open]] to [[Czechs|Czech]] teenager [[Nicole Vaidišová]], 6–7(5–7), 6–1, 6–2. Mauresmo next suffered a first-round loss at the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] [[The Hastings Direct International Championships|warm-up tournament in Eastbourne]]. However, Mauresmo and Kuznetsova won the doubles title there, their first as a team and Mauresmo's second overall.

Mauresmo was the top seed at [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]. She defeated [[Anastasia Myskina]] in a quarterfinal and [[Maria Sharapova]] in a semifinal, and then came back from one set down to defeat Henin in the final 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. The victory was Mauresmo's second Grand Slam singles title and the first on grass. She was also the first Frenchwoman since [[Suzanne Lenglen]] to win Wimbledon.The two finalists played an amazing serve and volley style of play in the final coming to the net many times.The [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] final was notable because it was the first and the only time in the decade neither Williams sister's qualified for the Final.

She then pulled out of the [[Fed Cup]] World Group I playoff tie against the [[Czech Republic Fed Cup team|Czech Republic]] due to a groin injury sustained during Wimbledon. She also withdrew from the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] in Montreal.

Her next tournament was the [[Pilot Pen Tennis]] tournament in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], where she lost in the quarterfinals to [[Lindsay Davenport]], 4–6, 5–7.

At the [[2006 U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]], Mauresmo lost to Sharapova in the semifinals 0–6, 6–4, 0–6. This was the first time in the open era that a female had lost two sets at love in a US Open semifinal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/open/2006-09-08-day-12_x.htm?POE=SPOISVA |title=Sharapova stops No. 1 Mauresmo, will meet Henin-Hardenne in U.S. Open final |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=8 September 2006 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>

Mauresmo then reached the final of the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]], losing to Kuznetsova. During the tournament, Mauresmo won 137 ranking points to help preserve her world no. 1 ranking and ended a nine-match losing streak to Davenport stretching back to January 2000 in Sydney.

On 9 May 2016, Mauresmo announced that she had stepped down as coach.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matias |last=Grez |title=Andy Murray and coach Amelie Mauresmo 'mutually agree' to end partnership |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/09/tennis/andy-murray-splits-coach-amelie-mauresmo/ |website=CNN |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref>

==Performance at Grand Slam tournaments==
Although Mauresmo had been one of the top singles players for several years, she did not have success in winning [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments until 2006. Her talents were never questioned,{{fact|date=May 2016}} but Mauresmo was criticized for her mental strength after succumbing to nerves in those events. In consecutive [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] semifinals, she lost to [[Serena Williams]] and [[Lindsay Davenport]] after leading comfortably. Before her [[2006 Australian Open]] title, Mauresmo was often touted as "the greatest women's player never to win a Grand Slam."<ref>{{cite news|last=Robson |first=Douglas |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/open/2006-08-27-mauresmo_x.htm |title=Mauresmo's stock can rise, fall in NYC |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=27 August 2006 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> After winning the [[2006 Wimbledon]] title, Mauresmo openly joked, "I don’t want anyone to talk about my nerves any more."

Mauresmo is one of the few tennis players, male or female, to have reached the top ranking without first winning a Grand Slam singles title. Other players who had done so were Belgian [[Kim Clijsters]], who ascended to the top spot in 2003, two years before winning her first Grand Slam singles title at the [[2005 U.S. Open (tennis)|2005 U.S. Open]]; [[Ivan Lendl]], who first reached world no. 1 in 1983, before winning any of his eight Grand Slam singles titles; [[Marcelo Ríos]] of [[Chile]], who reached world no. 1 in 1998 but never won a Grand Slam singles title; [[Jelena Janković]] of [[Serbia]] who reached world no. 1 in 2008; [[Dinara Safina]], who reached World No. 1 in 2009 without winning a Grand Slam singles title; and [[Caroline Wozniacki]], who reached world no. 1 in 2010.

==Personal life==
In April 2015, Mauresmo announced via Twitter that she is pregnant and is expecting the baby in August.<ref name="pregnancy">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-3032760/Andy-Murray-s-coach-Amelie-Mauresmo-announces-pregnancy-Twitter-Baby-August.html |title=Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo announces pregnancy on Twitter: 'Baby will be here in August' |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=9 April 2015 |first=Harriet |last=Crawford |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> On 16 August 2015, it was announced that she had given birth to a baby boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/17/tennis/tennis-djokovic-murray-bencic-duplicate-2/ |title=Andy Murray: Scot dedicates win to new Mum Amelie Mauresmo |publisher=CNN |date=17 August 2015 |accessdate=17 August 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/08/amelie-mauresmo-gives-birth-first-child/55948/#.VdKCvvlViko |title=Mauresmo gives birth to first child, a boy |publisher=Tennis.com |date=17 August 2015 |accessdate=17 August 2015 }}</ref>
