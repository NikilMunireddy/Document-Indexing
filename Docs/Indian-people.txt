'''Indian people''' or '''Indians''' are citizens of [[India]], the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|second most populous nation]] containing 17.50%<ref>{{citation | title = Official population clock | url = http://www.indiastat.com/default.aspx}}</ref> of the world's population. "Indian" refers to nationality, not ethnicity or language. The Indian nationality consists of many [[Languages of India|regional ethno-linguistic groups]], reflecting the rich and complex [[history of India]]. India hosts all major [[ethnic]] groups found in [[Indian Subcontinent]]. The [[diaspora]] populations with Indian [[ancestry]], as a result of [[emigration]], are somewhat widespread most notably in the [[UAE]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[Southern Europe]]. Population estimates vary from a conservative 12 million to 20 million diaspora.<ref name="books.google.co.uk"/><ref name="India in a globalized world"/>

==Ethnonym==
The name ''Bhārata'' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]:भारत) has been used as a self-ascribed name by people of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Republic of India]].<ref>Article 1 of the English version of the [[Constitution of India]]: "India that is Bharat shall be a Union of States."</ref> The designation ''Bhārata'' appears in the official Sanskrit name of the country, ''Bhārata Gaṇarājya''. The name is derived from the ancient [[Vedic]] and [[Puranas]], which refer to the land that comprises India as ''Bhārata varṣam'' and uses this term to distinguish it from other ''varṣa''s or continents.<ref name="pargiter">{{Citation|title=Ancient Indian Historical Tradition|last=Pargiter|first=F. F.|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|place=Delhi|year=1922|page=131}}</ref> The [[Bhāratas]] were a vedic tribe mentioned in the [[Rigveda]], notably participating in the [[Battle of the Ten Kings]].<ref name="schmidt1980">Schmidt, H.P.

In early [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature, the term ''[[Āryāvarta]]'' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: आर्यावर्त) was in popular use before ''Bhārata''. The [[Manusmṛti]] (2.22) gives the name ''Āryāvarta'' to "the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern (Bay of Bengal) to the Western Sea (Arabian Sea)".<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 70|editor=K.S.

While the word Indian and India is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἰνδία}} (''Indía''), via Latin ''India''.

The Indian people established during ancient, medieval to early eighteenth century some of the greatest empires and dynasties in South Asian history like the [[Maurya Empire]], [[Satavahana dynasty]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], [[Chalukya Empire]], [[Chola Empire]], [[Karkota Empire]], [[Pala Empire]], [[Vijayanagara Empire]], [[Maratha Empire]] and [[Sikh Empire]].The first great Empire of the Indian people was the [[Maurya Empire]] having [[Patliputra]](currently [[Patna]], [[Bihar]]) as its capital, conquered the major part of [[South Asia]] in the 4th and 3rd century BC during the reign of the Indian Emperors [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and [[Ashoka]] alongside their senior advisor, [[Chanakya|Acharya Chanakya]], the pioneer of the field of political science and economics in the World. The next great ancient Empire of the Indian people was the [[Gupta Empire]]. This period, witnessing a [[Hindu]] religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or "[[Golden Age of India]]". During this period, aspects of Indian civilization, administration, culture, and [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] spread to much of [[Asia]], while [[Chola Empire]] in the south had flourishing maritime trade links with the Roman Empire during this period. The ancient Indian mathematicians [[Aryabhata]], [[Bhāskara I]] and [[Brahmagupta]] invented the concept of zero and the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Hindu]] [[decimal|decimal system]] during this period.<ref>The Earth and Its Peoples by Richard Bulliet,Pamela Crossley,Daniel Headrick,Steven Hirsch,Lyman Johnson p.192</ref> During this period Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of [[Southeast Asia]] which led to the establishment of [[Greater India|Indianized kingdoms]] in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia: From early times to c. 1800, Band 1 by Nicholas Tarling p.281</ref>

During the early medieval period the great [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] dominated the major part of the Indian subcontinent.
from the 8th to 10th century and the Indian Emperor [[Amoghavarsha]] of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty was described by the Arab traveller Sulaiman as one of the four great kings of the world.<ref>The Shaping of Modern Gujarat: Plurality, Hindutva, and Beyond; Acyuta Yājñika, Suchitra Sheth, Penguins Books, (2005), p.42, ISBN 978-0-14400-038-8</ref> The medieval south Indian mathematician [[Mahāvīra (mathematician)]] lived in the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] and was the first Indian mathematician who separated astrology from mathematics and who wrote the earliest Indian text entirely devoted to mathematics.<ref>The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones by Clifford A. Pickover: page 88</ref> The greatest maritime Empire of the medieval Indians was the [[Chola dynasty]]. Under the great Indian Emperors [[Rajaraja Chola I]] and his successor [[Rajendra Chola I]] the Chola dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in [[South Asia]] and [[South-East Asia]].<ref name=kulke115>Kulke and Rothermund, p 115</ref><ref name=keay215>Keay, p 215</ref> The power of the [[Chola empire]] was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the [[Ganges]] which [[Rajendra Chola I]] undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of [[Srivijaya]] in [[Southeast Asia]], as well as by the repeated embassies to China.<ref name="sastri158">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 158</ref>

During the late medieval period the great [[Vijayanagara Empire]] dominated the major part of southern India from the 14th to 16th century and reached its peak during the reign of the south Indian Emperor [[Sri Krishnadevaraya]]<ref>Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture by John Stewart Bowman p.270</ref> The medieval [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] flourished during this period under such well known south Indian mathematicians as [[Madhava of Sangamagrama|Madhava]] (c. 1340-1425) who made important contributions to Trigonometery and Calculus, and [[Nilakantha Somayaji|Nilakhanta]] (c. 1444-1545) who postulated on the orbitals of planets.<ref name="planet">"History of Science and Philosophy of Science: A Historical Perspective of the Evolution of Ideas in Science", editor: Pradip Kumar Sengupta, author: Subhash Kak, 2010, p91, vol XIII, part 6, Publisher: Pearson Longman, ISBN 978-81-317-1930-5</ref>

The patriarch's wife generally exerts control over the household, minor religious practices and often wields considerable influence in domestic matters. A patrilineal joint family consists of an older man and his wife, his sons and unmarried daughters, his sons’ wives and children. Family income flows into a common pool, from which resources are drawn to meet the needs of all members, which are regulated by the heads of the family.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Hindu Joint Family: The Norms and the Numbers |author1=Henry Orenstein |author2=Michael Micklin |journal=Pacific Affairs |volume=39 |issue=3/4 |quote=Autumn, 1966 |jstor=2754275 |pages=314–325 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/2754275}}</ref> However, with modernization and economic development, India has witnessed a break up of traditional joint family into more [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] and the traditional joint family in India accounted for a small percent of Indian households.<ref name=rs1>{{cite book |title=Dynamics of Change in the Modern Hindu Family |year=1993 |publisher=South Asia Books |author=Raghuvir Sinha |isbn=978-81-7022-448-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Indian Families|url=http://www.factsaboutindia.org/indian-families.html|publisher=Facts About India|accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>
