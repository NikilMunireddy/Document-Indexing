'''Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈaːjɑks}}), also '''AFC Ajax''' or '''Ajax Amsterdam''', is a Dutch professional [[Association football|football]] [[Football team|club]] based in [[Amsterdam]]. Historically, Ajax (named after the [[Ajax (mythology)|legendary Greek hero]]) is the most successful club in the [[Netherlands]], with 33 [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie titles]] and 18 [[KNVB Cup]]s. It has continuously played in the [[Eredivisie]], the Dutch football top division, since its inception in 1956 and, along with [[Feyenoord]] and [[PSV Eindhoven]], it is one of the country's "[[Big Three (Netherlands)|big three]]" clubs that have dominated that competition.

Ajax is historically one of the most successful clubs in the world; according to the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics|IFFHS]], Ajax were the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news | title = Europe's Club of the Century | publisher = International Federation of Football History & Statistics | date = 11 September 2009 | url = http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d | accessdate = 12 September 2009}}</ref> The club is one of the five teams that has [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|earned the right]] to keep the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and to wear a multiple-winner badge; they won consecutively in 1971–1973.

== History ==
{{main|History of AFC Ajax}}
Ajax was founded in Amsterdam on 18 March 1900. The club achieved promotion to the highest level of Dutch football in 1911 and had its first major success in 1917, winning the [[KNVB Beker]], the Netherlands' national cup. The [[1917–18 Netherlands Football League Championship|following season]], Ajax became [[List of Dutch football champions|national champion]] for the first time. The club defended its title in [[1918–19 Netherlands Football League Championship|1918–19]], becoming the only team to achieve an unbeaten season in the Netherlands Football League Championship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/unbeaten.html|title=Unbeaten during a League Season|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=RSSSF}}</ref>

Throughout the 1920s, Ajax was a strong regional power, winning the Eerste Klasse West division in 1921, 1927 and 1928, but could not maintain its success at national level. This changed in the 1930s, with the club winning five national championships ([[1930–31 Netherlands Football League Championship|1931]], [[1931–32 Netherlands Football League Championship|1932]], [[1933–34 Netherlands Football League Championship|1934]], [[1936–37 Netherlands Football League Championship|1937]], [[1938–39 Netherlands Football League Championship|1939]]), making it the most successful Dutch team of the decade. Ajax won its second KNVB Cup in 1942–43, and an eighth Dutch title in [[1946–47 Netherlands Football League Championship|1946–47]], the last season the club was managed by Englishman [[Jack Reynolds (footballer born 1881)|Jack Reynolds]], who, up to this point, had overseen all of its national championship successes as well as its 1917 KNVB Cup win.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/334848|title=Ajax: the early years and the birth of Total Football|date=5 May 2012|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=World Soccer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-12464632|title=Ajax remembers Bury football hero Jack Reynolds|date=15 February 2011|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=BBC}}</ref>

In 1956, the [[1956–57 Eredivisie|first season]] of the Netherlands' new professional league, the [[Eredivisie]], was played with Ajax participating as a founding member. The Amsterdam club became the first national champions under the new format and made its debut in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]] the [[1957–58 European Cup|following year]], losing to Hungarian champions [[Vasas SC]] 6–2 on aggregate at the quarter-final stage. The team were again Eredivisie champions in [[1959–60 Eredivisie|1960]] and won a third KNVB Cup in 1961.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1441/Ajax/article/detail/3642832/2014/04/27/Ajax-weer-kampioen-zonder-topscorer.dhtml|title=Ajax weer kampioen zonder topscorer|date=14 April 2014|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=AD.nl}}</ref>

[[File:Cruijff afscheidswedstrijd bij Ajax.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johan Cruijff]] played at Ajax from 1959 to 1973, and from 1981 to 1983, winning 3 European Cups; his No. 14 is the only squad number Ajax has ever retired. Cruyff came back to manage the club from 1985 to 1988.]]
[[File:1971 Champions League Final Ajax - Panathinaikos.jpg|thumb|Against Panathinaikos in the [[1971 European Cup Final]]]]

In 1965, [[Rinus Michels]], who had played for the club between 1946 and 1958, was appointed manager of Ajax, implementing his philosophy of [[Total Football]] which was to become synonymous with both Ajax and the [[Netherlands national football team]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8338289.stm|title=Cruyff will coach Catalonia team|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/ajax’s-youth-policy-still-its-prime-asset|title=Ajax’s youth policy still its prime asset|date=18 March 2010|accessdate=3 March 2013|work=Radio Netherlands Worldwide}}</ref> A year earlier, [[Johan Cruijff]], who would go on to become the greatest Dutch footballer of all time, made his debut.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/players/a/Cruyffrrofile.htm|title=Legends: Johan Cruyff|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=About.com}}</ref> Between them, Michels and Cruijff led Ajax through the most successful period in its history, winning seven Eredivisie titles, four KNVB Cups and three European Cups.

Ajax won the Dutch championship in [[1965–66 Eredivisie|1966]], [[1966–67 Eredivisie|1967]], and [[1967–68 Eredivisie|1968]], and reached the [[1969 European Cup Final]], losing to [[A.C. Milan]]. During the 1966–67 season, Ajax scored a record 122 goals in an Eredivisie season and also won the KNVB Cup to achieve its first league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]]. In [[1969–70 Eredivisie|1969–70]], Ajax won a fourth Dutch league championship and second league and cup double in five seasons, winning 27 out of 34 league games and scoring 100 goals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voetbalcentra.nl/index_files/Eredivisierecords.htm|title= Eredivisierecords |accessdate=30 December 2014|work=Voetbal Centra}}</ref>

The [[1970–71 Eredivisie|1970–71]] season saw Ajax retain the [[1970–71 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] and reach the [[1971 European Cup Final]], where they beat [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] 2–0 with goals from [[Dick van Dijk]] and [[Arie Haan]] to become continental champions for the first time, with Cruijff being named [[Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|European Footballer of the Year]]. After this success, Michels departed to become manager of [[FC Barcelona]] and was replaced by the Romanian [[Ștefan Kovács]]. In Kovács' first season, Ajax completed a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of the [[1971–72 European Cup|European Cup]], the [[1971–72 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] and a third consecutive [[1971–72 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]]. The following season, the team beat Argentine club [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] to win the [[1972 Intercontinental Cup]] and retained their [[1972–73 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] and [[1972–73 European Cup|European Cup]] titles, becoming the first club to win three consecutive European Cups since [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the 1950s.

In 1973, Michels' Barcelona broke the [[World football transfer record|world transfer record]] to bring Cruijff to [[Catalonia]]. Kovács also departed to become manager of the [[France national football team]] signalling the end of this period of international success.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/picturegalleries/10211043/World-record-football-transfers.html|title=Johann Cruyff - World record football transfers |accessdate=30 December 2014|work=Telegraph}}</ref>

In [[1976–77 Eredivisie|1976–77]], Ajax won its first domestic championship in four seasons and recorded a double of the [[1977–78 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] and [[1977–78 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] two years later.

The early 1980s saw the return of Johan Cruijff to the club, as well as the emergence of young players [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]]. The team won back-to-back Eredivisie titles in [[1981–82 Eredivisie|1982]] and [[1982–83 Eredivisie|1983]], with all three playing a significant role in the latter. After Cruijff's sale to rivals [[Feyenoord]] in 1983, Van Basten became Ajax's key player, top scoring in the Eredivisie for four seasons between [[1983–84 Eredivisie|1983–84]] and [[1986–87 Eredivisie|1986–87]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=41373/|title=Van Basten, a Dutch goal machine|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=FIFA}}</ref>

In 1985, Cruijff returned to Ajax as manager and the team ended [[1985–86 Eredivisie|his first season in charge]] with 120 goals from 34 matches. However, Ajax still finished as runner up to [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] by eight points. The following season, Ajax again lost out on the [[1986–87 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] title to PSV, but won the [[1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], its first continental trophy in fourteen years. After this, Cruijff left the club to become manager of Barcelona and Rijkaard and Van Basten were sold to [[Sporting CP]] and [[A.C. Milan]] respectively. Despite these losses, Ajax reached a second consecutive Cup Winners' Cup final in [[1988 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1988]], where they lost to Belgian club [[KV Mechelen]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nos.nl/video/617897-1988-mechelen-klopt-ajax-in-finale-ec-ii.html|title=1988: Mechelen klopt Ajax in finale EC II|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=NOS.nl}}</ref>

The [[1988–89 Eredivisie|1988–89]] season saw [[Dennis Bergkamp]], a young forward who had first appeared under Cruijff in 1986, establish himself as a regular goalscorer for Ajax. Bergkamp helped Ajax to the [[1989–90 Eredivisie]] title and was the top scorer in the division in [[1990–91 Eredivisie|1990–91]], [[1991–92 Eredivisie|1991–92]] and [[1992–93 Eredivisie|1992–93]]. Under the management of [[Louis van Gaal]], Ajax won the [[UEFA Cup]] in [[1991–92 UEFA Cup|1992]] to become the second club, after [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], to have won all three [[List of UEFA club competition winners|major European club competitions]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/video/videoid=2121239.html|title=Watch Ajax complete European sweep|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=UEFA}}</ref>

After the sale of Bergkamp to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] in 1993, Van Gaal re-signed the experienced Frank Rijkaard to complement his young Ajax team featuring academy graduates [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] and [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Michael Reiziger]], and [[Winston Bogarde]], as well as mercurial foreign talents [[Finidi George]], [[Nwankwo Kanu]] and [[Jari Litmanen]], and veteran captain [[Danny Blind]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espnfc.com/columns/story?id=827853&cc=3436|title=Ajax's adolescents master men of Milan|date=30 September 2010|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=ESPN}}</ref> The team regained the Dutch championship in [[1993–94 Eredivisie|1993–94]], and won it again in [[1994–95 Eredivisie|1994–95]] and [[1995–96 Eredivisie|1995–96]] to become the first Ajax side to win three back-to-back championships since 1968. The height of Van Gaal's success came in 1994–95, where Ajax became the first, and to date only, team to complete an entire Eredivisie season unbeaten.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dutch-football.com/football/eredivisie/records.shtml|title=Eredivisie - Records|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=Dutch Football}}</ref> The team also won its first European Cup since its glorious 1970s era, beating Milan in the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final]] 1–0, with the winning goal scored by 18-year-old [[Patrick Kluivert]]. Ajax again reached [[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]] a year later but were defeated on penalties by Juventus.

Ajax's return as a European force was short lived as Van Gaal and several members of the squad soon departed to some of the continent's biggest clubs. The 2000s was a lean decade for the club with only two Eredivisie championships won. However, Ajax's academy continued to produce star players such as [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Rafael van der Vaart]].

In 2010, Frank de Boer was appointed manager of Ajax and led the club to its first league title in seven years, and record 30th title overall, in the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11]] season. This was followed by back-to-back wins in [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12]] and [[2012–13 Eredivisie|2012–13]] to match his three consecutive titles as a player in the 1990s. In [[2013–14 Eredivisie|2013–14]], Ajax were again Eredivisie champions, winning four consecutive league titles for the first time in the club's history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=2097233.html|title=Ajax secure fourth consecutive Dutch title|date=27 April 2014|accessdate=29 April 2014|work=UEFA}}</ref> After finishing as runner-up to PSV in both [[2014–15 Eredivisie|2014–15]] and [[2015–16 Eredivisie|2015–16]], De Boer stepped down as Ajax head coach in May 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36273607|title=Frank de Boer: Ajax boss leaves his role after six years|date=12 May 2016|work=BBC}}</ref>

==Youth program==
{{main|Ajax Youth Academy|Ajax Hellas Youth Academy}}
The club is also particularly famous for its renowned youth program that has produced many Dutch talents over the years – [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Dennis Bergkamp]], former national team top scorer [[Patrick Kluivert]], and former national team coach [[Marco van Basten]]. Dutch national first-team players [[Rafael van der Vaart]], [[Ryan Babel]], [[Wesley Sneijder]], [[Maarten Stekelenburg]], [[Eljero Elia]], [[André Ooijer]], [[John Heitinga]] and [[Nigel de Jong]] had also came through the ranks at Ajax and all are now playing for top-flight clubs. Ajax also regularly supplies the Dutch national youth teams with local talent.<ref>{{cite news|title= Ajax wants a foothold in the U.S.|publisher= ESPN|date=|url= http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6609795/soccer-ajax-method-catch-us|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> First team regulars [[Siem de Jong]], [[Urby Emanuelson]] and [[Gregory van der Wiel]] are former youth internationals who made the successful step up to the senior side.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hamilton |first=Chloe |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/lessons-of-the-dutch-school-1578912.html |title=Lessons of the Dutch school – Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=22 October 1995 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=627320.html |title=Grooming talent the Ajax way |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= How a Soccer Star Is Made|work=The New York Times|date=|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06Soccer-t.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>

Due to mutual agreements with foreign clubs, the youth academy has also signed foreign players as teenagers before making first team debuts, such as Belgian defensive trio [[Jan Vertonghen]], [[Toby Alderweireld]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]] along with winger [[Tom de Mul]], all of whom are full internationals as well as Dutch international [[Vurnon Anita]] as well as [[Javier Martina]] from [[Curaçao]].

Ajax has also expanded its talent searching program to South Africa with [[Ajax Cape Town FC|Ajax Cape Town]]. Ajax Cape Town was set up with the help of [[Rob Moore (South African Entrepreneur)|Rob Moore]]. Ajax has also had a satellite club in the United States under the name [[Ajax Orlando Prospects|Ajax America]], until it filed for bankruptcy. There are some youth players from Ajax Cape Town that have been drafted into the Eredivisie squad, such as South African internationals [[Steven Pienaar]], [[Thulani Serero]] and Cameroonian international [[Eyong Enoh]].

In 1995, the year Ajax won the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] was almost entirely composed of Ajax players, with [[Edwin van der Sar]] in goal; players such as [[Michael Reiziger]], [[Frank de Boer]], and [[Danny Blind]] in defense; [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]], and [[Clarence Seedorf]] in midfield; and [[Patrick Kluivert]] and [[Marc Overmars]] in attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/grassroots/features/video/videoid=1562470.html |title=Inside the Ajax academy on |publisher=Uefa.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>

In 2011 AFC Ajax opened its first youth academies outside the Netherlands, when the club partnered up with George Kazianis and All Star Consultancy in Greece to open the [[Ajax Hellas Youth Academy]]. The offices are based in [[Nea Smyrni]], [[Attica (region)|Attica]], with the main training facility located on the island of [[Corfu]], hosting a total of 15 football youth academies throughout Greece and [[Cyprus]]. Eddie van Schaik heads the organization as coach and consultant, introducing the Ajax football philosophy at the various Greek football training camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajaxhellas.gr/youth_academy/en/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=1&Itemid=2 |title=The Academy |publisher=AjaxHellas.gr|date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.care24.gr/diatrofologos-ajax-hellas/ |title=Η νέα Κλινική Διαιτολόγος – Διατροφολόγος του Ajax Hellas |publisher=Care24.gr|date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref>

==Stadiums==
{{main|Stadiums of AFC Ajax}}
Ajax' first stadium was built in 1911 out of wood and was called "[[Het Houten Stadion]]" (The Wooden Stadium). Ajax later played in the stadium built for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] hosted in Amsterdam. This stadium, designed by [[Jan Wils]], is known as the Olympic Stadium. In 1934, Ajax moved to [[De Meer Stadion]] in east Amsterdam, designed by architect and Ajax-member [[Jordanus Roodenburgh|Daan Roodenburgh]], who had also designed the club's first stadium. It could accommodate 29,500 spectators and Ajax continued to play there until 1996. For big European and national fixtures the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, which could accommodate about twice the number of spectators.
[[File:Amsterdam Arena Aerial.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the [[Amsterdam ArenA]]]]
In 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the [[Amsterdam ArenA]] This was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 52,000 people. The average attendance in 2006/07 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The ArenA has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the ArenA has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008–2009 season ground staff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.

The much-loved De Meer stadium was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The only thing left of the old stadium are the letters AJAX, nowadays in place on the façade of the youth training grounds [[Sportpark De Toekomst|De Toekomst]], near the [[Amsterdam Arena]].

==Crest and colours==

===Crest===
In 1900, when the club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just a picture of an Ajax player. The crest was slightly altered following the club's promotion to the top division in 1911 to match the club's new outfits. In 1928, the club logo was introduced with the head of the [[Greeks|Greek]] hero [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]]. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one. The new logo still sports the portrait of Ajax, but drawn with just 11 lines, symbolizing the 11 players of a football team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~michielh/hetlogo.html |title=History of the Ajax logo |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date=20 September 1928 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref>

===Colors===
Ajax originally played in an all-black uniform with a red sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the [[flag of Amsterdam]]. However, when, under manager [[Jack Kirwan]], the club got promoted to the top flight of Dutch football for the first time in 1911 (then the ''Eerste Klasse'' or 'First Class', later named the [[Eredivisie]]), Ajax were forced to change their colours because [[Sparta Rotterdam]] already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit.

===AFC Ajax N.V.===
{{Main|AFC Ajax N.V.}}
AFC Ajax are the only Dutch club with an [[Initial public offering]] (IPO). The club is registered as a [[Naamloze vennootschap]] (N.V.) listed on the stock exchange [[Euronext]] Amsterdam, since 17 May 1998. With a launch price of ƒ25,- (Guilders) the club managed to a bring their total revenue up to €54 million euros (converted) in their first year on the market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/sport/ajax/article1882997.ece |title=God van de handel liet Ajax in de steek |publisher=NRC.nl|accessdate=18 February 2008}}</ref> After short lived success however the rate dropped, at one point as low as €3,50. Criticism was brought forth that the legal grid for a naamloze vennootschap would not be suitable for a Football club, and that the sports related ambitions would suffer from the new commercial interests of the now listed Ajax. Shares of the company in the year 2008 were valued at approximately €5,90 per share.<ref>[http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AJAX.AS#chart2:symbol=ajax.as;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined AFC Ajax chart], Yahoo.com</ref>

In 2008 a Commission under guidance of honorary member Uri Coronel concluded, that the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] was of no value to the club, and that measures should be taken to exit the stock exchange by purchasing back all public shares.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110823131227/http://www.depers.nl/sport/218320/Ajax-beslist-snel-over-beursnotering.html Ajax beslist nog dit jaar over beursnotering], De Pers, 1 juli 2008</ref> Ajax remain on the stock exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.AFC_Ajax_NV.46101384cd08980e.html |title=AFC Ajax NV Company Information |publisher=Hoovers|date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>

===Reserves team===
{{Main|Jong Ajax}}
[[Jong Ajax]] (''formerly more commonly known as Ajax 2'') is the reserve team of AFC Ajax. The team is composed mostly of professional footballers, who are often recent graduates from the highest youth level (Ajax A1) serving their first professional contract as a reserve, or players who are otherwise unable to play in the first team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/10788/Eredivisie/article/detail/3334299/2012/10/19/De-Boer-laat-herstelde-Sulejmani-bij-Jong-Ajax.dhtml |title=De Boer laat 'herstelde' Sulejmani bij Jong Ajax |publisher=Volkskrant|date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>

Since 1992 Jong Ajax have competed in the [[Beloften Eredivisie]], competing against other reserve teams such as [[Jong PSV]], [[FC Groningen|Jong FC Groningen]] or [[AZ (football club)|Jong AZ]]. They have won the Beloften Eredivisie title a record eight times, as well as the [[KNVB Reserve Cup]] three times, making them the most successful reserve squad in the Netherlands. By winning the [[Beloften Eredivisie]] title, Jong Ajax were able to qualify for the actual [[KNVB Cup]], even advancing to the semi-finals on three occasions. Their best result in the Dutch Cup was under manager [[Jan Olde Riekerink]] in 2001-02, when a semi-final loss to [[FC Utrecht]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|Penalty shoot-out]] after extra time, which saw Utrecht advance, and thus preventing an Ajax vs. Jong Ajax Dutch Cup final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=575358&sec=europe&root=europe&cc=5739 |title=Dutch KNVB Cup - ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=24 September 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>

Their home matches are played at [[Sportpark De Toekomst]], except for the occasional match in the [[Amsterdam Arena]]. Now regarded a semi-professional team in their own respect, the only period in which players are able to move between squads are during the transfer windows, unless the player has made less than 15 appearances for the first team, then he is still eligible to appear in both first team and second team matches during the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/sport/3492234/jong-psv-vervangt-katwijk-in-eerste-divisie.html |title=Jong PSV vervangt Katwijk in eerste divisie |publisher=NU.nl |accessdate=4 July 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, the team is not eligible for promotion to the [[Eredivisie]] or to participate in the [[KNVB Cup]].

==Rivalries==
''As one of the traditional [[Big Three (Netherlands)|big three clubs]] in the [[Netherlands]], Ajax have amassed a number of intense rivalries over the years. Listed below are the most significant of the rivalries involving Ajax Amsterdam.''

===Rivalry with Feyenoord===
{{Main|De Klassieker}}
[[Feyenoord]] from [[Rotterdam]] are Ajax's arch rivals. Every year both clubs play the "[[De Klassieker]]" ("The Classic"), a match between the teams from the two largest cities of the Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/dossier/alles-over-de-klassieker-ajax-dompelt-feyenoord-in-rouw.htm |title=Alles over De Klassieker: Ajax dompelt Feyenoord in rouw |publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>  During the seventies, Ajax and Feyenoord were the only two clubs in the Netherlands who were able to clinch national titles, as well as achieve continental and even global success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elenganche.es/2013/08/de-klassieker-ajax-feyenoord-y-el-orgullo-%E2%80%98oranje%E2%80%99.html |title=De Klassieker: Ajax-Feyenoord y el orgullo ‘oranje’ |publisher=El Enganche|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>  A meeting between the two clubs became the measure for who was truly the best club in the Netherlands. The Klassieker is the most famous of all the rivalries in the Netherlands and the matches are always sold out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpdetijd.nl/2013-08-19/ajax-feyenoord-klassiekste-niet-klassieker-in-lange-reeks-klassiekers/ |title=Ajax – Feyenoord ‘klassiekste niet-Klassieker in lange reeks Klassiekers’ |publisher=HP.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>  The fixture is seen in the public eye as "''The graceful and elegant football of Ajax, against the indomitable fighting spirit of Feyenoord''". The confidence of the Capital versus the Blue collar mentality of [[Rotterdam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/sport/772781-1308/feyenoord-en-ajax-is-haat |title='Feyenoord en Ajax is haat' |publisher=BNR.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> Matches are known for their tension and violence, both on and off the pitch. Over the years several violent incidents have taken place involving rival supporters, leading to the current prohibition of away-supporters in both stadiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/7135955/Feyenoords-latest-clash-with-Ajax-peaceful-thanks-to-absent-friends.html |title=Feyenoord's latest clash with Ajax peaceful thanks to absent 'friends' |publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> The lowest point was reached on 23 March 1997, when supporters of both clubs meet on a field near [[Beverwijk]], where Ajax-supporter Carlo Picornie was fatally injured, the incident is commonly referred to as the "[[Battle of Beverwijk]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5619/Feyenoord/article/detail/2118764/2008/03/20/Stervend-in-de-modder.dhtml |title=Stervend in de modder |publisher=AD.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>

===Rivalry with PSV===
{{Main|AFC Ajax–PSV Eindhoven rivalry}}
[[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] are also a rival of Ajax, but in terms of tension and rivalry, these matches are not as loaded as the duels with Feyenoord. The rivalry has existed for some time with PSV and stems from various causes, such as the different interpretations of whether current national and international successes of both clubs correlates and the supposed opposition between the [[Randstad]] and the province. The matches between these two teams is commonly referred to as "De Topper" ("The Topper"), and involves the two most trophy-laden sides in Dutch football and is essentially a clash of two competing schools of thought in Dutch football. Historically PSV compete with a workmanlike ethic, preferring a more robust 4-3-1-2 or 4-2-3-1, typically shunning the seductive 4-3-3 approach favoured in Amsterdam. While [[Rinus Michels]] and [[Johan Cruijff]] helped to innovate [[Total Football]] in the sixties and seventies, a different philosophy was honed in [[Eindhoven]] by [[Kees Rijvers]] and [[Guus Hiddink]] in the late seventies and eighties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/ajax-psv-philosophical-rivalry-dominates-dutch-mindset#2rZB5iOBKmfBu5ym.99 |title=Ajax-PSV: a philosophical rivalry that dominates the Dutch mindset |publisher=Fourfourtwo.com |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> This in turn has created one of the more philosophical rivalries in football, an ideological battleground, which is gradually becoming as heated and intense as the matches Ajax and Feyenoord partake in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/alles-over-de-topper-in-de-eredivisie-tussen-ajax-en-psv.htm |title=Alles over de topper in de Eredivisie tussen Ajax en PSV |publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>

===Rivalries with other clubs===
{{main|Amsterdam derby}}
Aside from Feyenoord and PSV, Ajax have several other rivalries, although in most cases the sentiment is mostly felt by the opposition and is more directed towards Ajax, with one of them being [[FC Utrecht]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voetbalcentraal.nl/nieuws/56261/rivaliteit-tussen-fans-ajax-en-fc-utrecht-opvallend |title=Rivaliteit tussen fans Ajax en FC Utrecht opvallend |publisher=Voetbalzone.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> Although the rivalry is more felt on the [[Utrecht]] side then with Ajax, matchups between the two sides are often quite intense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/sport/988786-1209/zo-n-rivaliteit-moeilijk-te-begrijpen |title=Zulke rivaliteit moeilijk te begrijpen |publisher=BNR.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> Both teams have fanatic supporters, and clashes off the pitch are more often the rule than the exception. The same goes for [[ADO Den Haag]], with both supporter-groups often getting in conflicts, when ADO-Hooligans set fire to the Supporters home of Ajax, and Ajax-Hooligans subsequently broke into the Supporters home of ADO tensions between the two clubs rose. In 2006 Supporters from both clubs were banned from attending away matches for five years, due to frequent violent outbreaks and clashes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/820449/2006/04/25/Poging-brandstichting-supportershome-Ajax.dhtml |title=Poging brandstichting supportershome Ajax |publisher=Volkskrant|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>

Further teams who share a rivalry with Ajax include [[FC Twente]], [[FC Groningen]] and [[AZ (football club)|AZ]]. Although the latter are often regarded by Ajax-supporters as the club's little brother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=193936 |title=Ajax is de buurman, rivaliteit is groot, het betekent iets voor de mensen |publisher=Voetbalzone.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> Being from nearby [[Alkmaar]], and with both clubs sharing the same [[Province]], match-ups between the two sides are commonly known as the "De Noord-Hollandse Derby" ("North Holland Derby") and are often very competitive, intense and loaded fixtures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/nl/match/46410/afc-ajax-vs-az/report |title=Noord-Hollandse derby makkelijke prooi Ajax |publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>

Past rivalries include local [[Amsterdam derby|Amsterdam derbies]] between Ajax and clubs such as [[Blauw-Wit Amsterdam|Blauw-Wit]], [[Door Wilskracht Sterk|DWS]] and [[De Volewijckers]] (who later merged to become [[FC Amsterdam]] in 1972).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/424276/1996/03/30/Blauw-Wit-de-club-van-het-Stadion-kwam-zag-en-verdween.dhtml |title=Blauw Wit, de club van het Stadion, kwam, zag en verdween |publisher=Volkskrant|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> The tension between the local sides lessened however, as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the Amsterdam clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/webshop/product/sporen-van-ajax.htm |title=Sporen van Ajax |publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> The last Amsterdam derby to take place in an official league match was when Ajax defeated FC Amsterdam 5-1, on 19 March 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/923-Europe/6986-dutch-derby-days |title=Dutch derby days |publisher=When Saturday Comes|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>

Ajax are known for having fanatic core supporter-groups, of which [[F-side|F-Side]] and [[VAK410]] are the most famous. F-Side were founded on 3 October 1976, and are situated right behind the goal In the [[Amsterdam ArenA]], on the southern end of the stadium in rows 125–129.

==Jewish connection==
[[File:Ajaxingalgenwaard.JPG|thumb|Supporters with [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flags]] in 2008]]

Historically, Ajax was popularly seen as having "Jewish roots". Although not an official Jewish club like the city's [[WV-HEDW]], Ajax has had a Jewish image since the 1930s when the home stadium was located next to a Jewish neighbourhood of [[Amsterdam-Oost]] and opponents saw many supporters walking through the Nieuwmarkt/Waterloopleinbuurt (de Jodenhoek—the "Jews' corner") to get to the stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2006/12/09/ajax-en-de-joden.aspx |title=de alternatieve bron voor sportnieuws |publisher=Sportgeschiedenis.nl |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The city of Amsterdam was historically referred to as a [[Mokum]] city, Mokum (מקום) being the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] word for "place" or "safe haven",<ref>[http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/dictionary/m Yiddish Dictionary Online]</ref> and as [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] chants and name calling developed and intensified at the old [[De Meer Stadion]] from frustrated supporters of opposing clubs, Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish<ref name="nyt">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DB153FF93BA15750C0A9639C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 Amsterdam Journal; A Dutch Soccer Riddle: Jewish Regalia Without Jews] – New York Times, 28 March 2005</ref>) responded by embracing Ajax's "Jewish" identity: calling themselves "super Jews", chanting "Jews, Jews" ("Joden, Joden") at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the [[Star of David]] and the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]].<ref name="nyt" /><ref name="understanding">[https://books.google.com/books?id=i21W_KN_iUMC&lpg=PA197&dq=ajax%20jews&client=safari&pg=PA196 Understanding football hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Clubs] by Ramon Spaaij, published 2006</ref>

This Jewish imagery eventually became a central part of Ajax fans' culture.<ref name="understanding" /> At one point ringtones of "[[Hava Nagila]]", a [[Hebrew]] [[folk song]], could be downloaded from the club's official website.<ref name="nyt" /> Beginning in the 1980s, fans of Ajax's rivals escalated their [[antisemitic]] rhetoric, chanting slogans like "[[Hamas]], Hamas/Jews to the [[gas chamber|gas]]" ("Hamas, hamas, joden aan het gas"), hissing to imitate the flow of gas, giving [[Nazi salute]]s, etc.<ref name="nyt" /><ref>{{cite web|title = Ajax and the Jewish Issue | url = http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html | publisher = ajax-usa.com | accessdate =20 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113235308/http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html |archivedate=16 February 2005}}</ref> The eventual result was that many (genuinely) Jewish Ajax fans stopped going to games.<ref name="nyt" />
