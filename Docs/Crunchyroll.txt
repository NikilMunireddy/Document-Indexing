==History==
Crunchyroll started in 2006 as a for-profit video upload and streaming site that specialized in hosting East Asian video content. Some of the content hosted on Crunchyroll, such as [[fansub]]bed versions of East Asian shows.

In 2008, Crunchyroll secured a capital investment of $4.05 million from the [[venture capital]] firm [[Venrock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-03-11/video-site-with-unauthorized-anime-gets-us$4m-venture|title=Video Site with Unauthorized Anime Gets US$4M Capital|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2008-03-11|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref> The investment drew criticism from anime distributors and licensors [[Bandai Entertainment]] and [[Funimation]] as the site continued to allow users to upload illegal copies of licensed titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-03-12/funimation-responds-to-crunchyroll-us$4m-funding|title=Funimation, Bandai Entertainment Respond on Crunchyroll|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2008-03-12|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>

However, Crunchyroll eventually began securing legal distribution agreements with companies, including [[Gonzo (company)|Gonzo]], for an increasing number of titles. On January 8, 2009, after announcing a deal with TV Tokyo to host episodes of ''[[Naruto Shippuden]]'', Crunchyroll stated that it was committed to removing all copyright-infringing material from its site and to hosting only content to which it had legitimate distribution rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-11-17/tv-tokyo-to-also-stream-naruto-through-crunchyroll|title=TV Tokyo to Stream Naruto via Crunchyroll Worldwide|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2008-11-17|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>

In 2010, Crunchyroll announced its acquisition of the [[North America]]n DVD rights to ''[[5 Centimeters Per Second]]''. This was the first DVD release licensed by Crunchyroll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-08-13/crunchyroll-adds-shinkai-5-centimeters-per-second-dvd|title=Crunchyroll Adds Shinkai's 5 Centimeters per Second DVD|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2010-08-13|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

On October 30, 2013, Crunchyroll began digitally distributing 12 different manga titles from Kodansha – series such as ''[[Attack on Titan]]'' and ''[[Fairy Tail]]'' were part of the manga that were available initially – through [[Crunchyroll Manga]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marcias|first1=Patrick|title=It's Here!

On December 2, 2013, The Chernin Group, former [[News Corporation|News Corp.]] president [[Peter Chernin]]'s holding company, announced that it has acquired a [[controlling interest]] in Crunchyroll.
