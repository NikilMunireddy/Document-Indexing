Defender (association football)

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2014}}

In the [[sport]] of [[association football]], a '''defender''' is an [[outfield player]] whose primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring goals.

There are four types of defenders: centre-back, sweeper, full-back, and wing-back. The centre-back and full-back positions are essential in most modern formations. The sweeper and wing-back roles are more specialised for certain formations.

==Centre-back==

A centre-back (also known as a central defender or centre-half) defends in the area directly in front of the goal, and tries to prevent opposing players, particularly [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forwards]], from scoring. Centre-backs accomplish this by blocking [[Shooting (association football)|shots]], [[Tackle (football move)#Association football|tackling]], intercepting [[Passing (association football)|passes]], contesting headers and [[Marking (association football)|marking]] forwards to discourage the opposing team from passing to them.

With the ball, centre-backs are generally expected to make long and pinpoint passes to their teammates, or to kick unaimed [[long ball]]s down the field. For example, a [[Glossary of association football terms#C|clearance]] is a long unaimed kick intended to move the ball as far as possible from the defender's goal.

During normal play, centre-backs are unlikely to score goals. However, when their team takes a [[corner kick]] or other [[Glossary of association football terms#S|set pieces]] centre-backs may move forward to the opponents' [[penalty area]]: if the ball is passed in the air towards a crowd of players near the goal then the heading ability of a centre-back is useful when trying to score. In this case other defenders or [[midfielder]]s will temporarily move into the centre-back positions.

In the modern game, most teams employ two or three centre-backs in front of the [[goalkeeper]]. The [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.932.E2.80.933.E2.80.931|4–2–3–1]], [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.933.E2.80.933|4–3–3]], and [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932|4–4–2]] formations all use two centre-backs.

There are two main defensive strategies used by centre-backs: the zonal defence, where each centre-back covers a specific area of the pitch; and man-to-man marking, where each centre-back has the job of covering a particular opposition player.

==Sweeper (libero)==

[[File:Association football 5-3-2 sweeper formation.svg|160px|thumb|right|<center>The 5-3-2 formation with a sweeper]]
The sweeper (or libero) is a more versatile centre-back who "sweeps up" the ball if an opponent manages to breach the defensive line. This position is rather more fluid than that of other defenders who man-mark their designated opponents. Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as ''libero'' ({{IPA-it|ˈlibero|}}), which originated from the Italian name for this position ''libero da impegni di marcatura'' (i.e. "free from man-marking tasks"). Though sweepers may be expected to build counter-attacking moves, and as such require better ball control and passing ability than typical centre-backs, their talents are often confined to the defensive realm. For example, the [[catenaccio]] system of play, used in Italian football in the 1960s, employed a purely defensive sweeper who only "roamed" around the back line. The more modern libero possesses the defensive qualities of the typical libero whilst being able to expose the opposition during counterattacks. The Fundell-libero has become more popular in recent time with the sweeper transitioning to the most advanced forward in an attack. This variation on the position requires great pace and fitness. Whilst rarely seen in professional football the position has been extensively used in lower leagues. Modern libero sits behind centre-backs as a sweeper before charging through the team to join in the attack.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197172.stm |title=Positions guide: Sweeper |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 June 2008 |date=1 September 2005}}</ref>

Some sweepers move forward and distribute the ball up-field, while others intercept passes and get the ball off the opposition without needing to hurl themselves into tackles. If the sweeper does move up the field to distribute the ball, they will need to make a speedy recovery and run back into their position. In modern football, its usage has been fairly restricted, with few clubs in the biggest leagues using the position.

The position is most commonly associated to have been pioneered by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Elias Figueroa]], and later by [[Miodrag Belodedici]], [[Gaetano Scirea]], [[Franco Baresi]] and [[Matthias Sammer]] in the 1990s era, although they were not the first players to play this position, with earlier proponents such as [[Alexandru Apolzan]], [[Ivano Blason]], [[Velibor Vasović]] and [[Ján Popluhár]].<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/may/02/the-question-great-teams-end Rotting fruit, dying flowers] ''The Guardian''</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/en/news/755/europe/2011/03/07/2383228/czechoslovakia-world-cup-hero-jan-popluhar-dies-aged-75 Czechoslovakia World Cup Hero Jan Popluhar Dies Aged 75] Goal.com</ref><ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/dream-teams-ajax-1641667.html?action=gallery&ino=3 VELIBOR VASOVIC] ''The Independent''</ref><ref>[http://outsideoftheboot.com/2012/08/29/evolution-of-the-sweeper/# Evolution of the Sweeper]</ref> Though it is rarely used in modern football, it remains a highly respected and demanding position.

A recent and successful use of the sweeper was made by [[Otto Rehhagel]], [[Greece national football team|Greece's]] manager, in the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004 European Championship]]. Rehhagel utilized [[Traianos Dellas]] as Greece's sweeper to great success, as Greece surprisingly became European champions.

==Full-back==

The full-backs take up the holding wide positions and traditionally stayed in defence at all times, until a set-piece. Modern full-backs take a more attacking role, overlapping with wingers down the flank. There is one full-back on each side of the field except in defences with fewer than four players, where there may be no full-backs and instead only centre-backs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://accurapid.com/journal/44soccer.htm |title=Football is Coming Home to Die-Hard Translators |work=Article on the Translation Journal |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2008}}</ref>

In the modern game, full-backs have taken on a more attacking role than is the case traditionally.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fleet-of-foot full-backs carry key to effective attacking |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/jun/06/sport.comment1 |accessdate=11 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Pleat |date=6 June 2007 }} David Pleat explains in a Guardian article how full-backs aid football teams when attacking.</ref> Wingerless formations, such as the diamond [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] formation, demand the full-back to cover considerable ground up and down the flank. Some of the responsibilities of modern full-backs include:

* Provide a '''physical obstruction''' to opposition attacking players by shepherding them towards an area where they exert less influence. They may manoeuvre in a fashion that causes the opponent to cut in towards the centre-back or defensive midfielder with his weaker foot, where he is likely to be dispossessed. Otherwise, jockeying and smart positioning may simply pin back a winger in an area where he is less likely to exert influence.
* Making '''off-the-ball runs''' into spaces down the channels and supplying crosses into the opposing penalty box.
* '''Throw-ins''' are often assigned to full-backs.
* '''Marking''' wingers and other attacking players. Full-backs generally do not commit into challenges in their opponents' half. However, they aim to quickly dispossess attacking players who have already breached the defensive line with a sliding tackle from the side. Markers must however avoid keeping too tight on opponents or risk disrupting the defensive organisation.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Gunners can avoid being pulled apart by Brazilian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/feb/18/arsenal |accessdate=11 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Pleat |date=18 February 2008 }} David Pleat explains the team effort in marking an attacking player stationed in the outside-wing position.</ref>
* Maintaining tactical discipline by ensuring other team-mates do not overrun the defensive line and inadvertently play an opponent onside.
* Providing a '''passing option''' down the flank; for instance, by creating opportunities for sequences like one-two passing moves.
* In wingerless formations, full-backs need to cover the roles of both wingers and full-backs, although defensive work may be shared with one of the central midfielders.
* Additionally, attacking full-backs help to pin both opposition full-backs and wingers deeper in their own half with aggressive attacking intent. Their presence in attack also forces the opposition to withdraw players from central midfield, which the team can seize to its advantage.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Larsson swung the tie |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/may/18/championsleague200506.championsleague |accessdate=11 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Pleat |date=18 May 2006 }} David Pleat explains how the introductions of Barcelona full-back [[Juliano Belletti]] and striker [[Henrik Larsson]] in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]] improved Barcelona's presence in wide areas. Belletti eventually scored the winning goal for the final.</ref>

Due to the physical and technical demands of their playing position, successful full-backs need a wide range of attributes, which make them suited for adaptation to other roles on the pitch. Many of the game's utility players, who can play in multiple positions on the pitch, are natural full-backs. A rather prominent example is the [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] full-back [[Sergio Ramos]], who has played on the flanks as a full-back and in central defence throughout his career. In the modern game, full-backs often chip in a fair share of assists with their runs down the flank when the team is on a counter-attack. The more common attributes of full-backs, however, include:

* '''Pace and stamina''' to handle the demands of covering large distances up and down the flank.
* A healthy '''work rate''' and team responsibility.
* '''Marking and tackling''' abilities and a sense of anticipation.
* Good '''off-the-ball''' ability to create attacking opportunities for his team by running into empty channels.
* '''Dribbling''' ability. Many of the game's eminent attacking full-backs are excellent dribblers in their own right and occasionally deputise as attacking wingers.
* '''Player intelligence'''. As is common for defenders, full-backs need to decide during the flow of play whether to stick close to a winger or maintain a suitable distance. Full-backs that stay too close to attacking players are vulnerable to being pulled out of position and leaving a gap in the defence. A quick passing movement like a pair of one-two passes will leave the channel behind the defending full-back open. This vulnerability is a reason why wingers considered to be dangerous are double-marked by both the full-back and the winger. This allows the full-back to focus on holding his defensive line.<ref>{{cite news |title=City countered by visitors' Petrov defence |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/dec/31/newsstory.liverpool |accessdate=11 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Pleat |date=31 December 2007 }} David Pleat discusses the tactical implications of full-backs and other defenders marking wingers in a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' match analysis.</ref>

==Wing-back==
The wing-back is a modern variation on the full-back with heavier emphasis on attack. This type of  defender focuses more heavily on attack than defence, yet they must have the ability, when needed, to fall back and mark opposing players to lessen the threat of conceding a goal-scoring opportunity. Some formations have wing back players that mainly focus on defending, and some that focus more on attack.

In the evolution of the modern game, wing-backs are the combination of [[Midfielder#Winger|wingers]] and full-backs. As such, it is one of the most physically demanding positions in modern football. Wing-backs are often more adventurous than full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and defend effectively against opponents' attacks down the flanks. A defensive midfielder is usually fielded to cover the advances of wing-backs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197076.stm |title=Positions guide: Wingback |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 June 2008 |date=1 September 2005 |location=London }}</ref>  It can also be occupied by wingers and side midfielders in a 3-centre-back formation.
