Knopf, Sr.|Alfred A. Knopf Sr.]] in 1915. The publisher had a reputation for a pursuit of perfection and elegant taste.<ref name="Random House">{{cite book|last1=Korda|first1=Michael|title=Another life : a memoir of other people|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0679456597|edition=1st}}</ref> It was acquired by [[Random House]] in 1960 and is now part of the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00301p1 |title=Alfred A.

==History==
Knopf was founded in 1915 by Alfred A. Knopf, Sr with a $5,000 advance from his father.<ref name=PWCentury /> The first office was located in New York's [[Candler Building (New York City)|Candler Building]]. The publishing house was officially incorporated in 1918, with Alfred Knopf as president, Blanche Knopf as vice-president, and Samuel Knopf as treasurer. Blanche and Alfred traveled abroad regularly and were known for publishing European, Asian, and Latin American writers in addition to leading American literary trends. Samuel Knopf died in 1932. William A. Koshland joined the company in 1934, and worked with the firm for more than fifty years, rising to take the positions of President and Chairman of the Board. Blanche became President in 1957 when Alfred became Chairman of the Board, and worked steadily for the firm until her death in 1966. Alfred Knopf retired in 1972, becoming chairman emeritus of the firm until his death in 1984.  Alfred Knopf also had a summer home in [[Purchase, New York]].

Beginning in 1920, Knopf also produced a [[chapbook]], for the purpose of promoting new books. [[iarchive:beingsborzoi192000alfrrich|The Borzoi]] was published periodically over the years, the first being a hardback called the Borzoi and sometimes quarterly as the Borzoi Quarterly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/about/about.html|title=Borzoi Reader {{!}} Index|website=www.randomhouse.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref> In 1923 Knopf also started publishing periodicals, beginning with ''[[The American Mercury]]'', founded by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan, which it published through 1934. 

Following the [[Good Neighbor policy]], Blanche Knopf visited South America in 1942, so the firm could start producing texts from there. She was one of the first publishers to visit Europe after World War II. Her trips, and those of other editors, brought in new writers from Europe, South America, and Asia. Alfred traveled to Brazil in 1961, which spurred a corresponding interest on his part in South America. Their son, Alfred "Pat" Jr., was hired on as secretary and trade books manager after the war.

In a 1957 advertisement in the [[Atlantic Monthly]], Alfred A. Knopf published the Borzoi Credo. The credo includes a list of what Knopf's beliefs for publishing including the statement that he never published an unworthy book. Among a list of beliefs listed is the final one--"I believe that magazines, movies, television, and radio will never replace good books."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knopf|first1=Alfred A.|title=The Borzoi Credo|url=http://aaknopf.tumblr.com/Motto|website=Alfred A. Knopf Tumblr|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>

In 1960 Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf.<ref name="PWCentury" /> It is believed that the decision to sell was prompted by [[Alfred A. Knopf, Jr.]], leaving Knopf to found his own book company, [[Atheneum Books]] in 1959.<ref name="Random House"/>

While there have been many notable editors at Knopf there have only been three editors-in-chief-- [[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.]], [[Robert Gottlieb]] and [[Sonny Mehta]].<ref name=PWCentury>{{cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Clare|title=A Century of Alfred A.

Knopf also employed literary scouts to good advantage.<ref>''Knopf, Alfred A.: Portrait of a Publisher, 1915-1965''. 2 vols. New York: Typophiles, 1965.</ref>

A publisher of hardcover fiction and nonfiction, Knopf's list of authors includes [[Albert Camus]], [[John Banville]], [[Carl Bernstein]], [[Robert Caro]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Julia Child]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[Joan Didion]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[James Ellroy]], [[Martin Gardner]], [[Lee H. Hamilton]], [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], [[John Keegan]], [[Anne Rice]], [[Nella Larsen]], [[Jack London]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], [[Toni Morrison]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Christopher Paolini]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Susan Swan]], [[Anne Tyler]], [[Andrew Vachss]], [[James D. Watson]], and [[Elinor Wylie]]. At least 17 [[Nobel Prize for literature|Nobel Prize]] and 47 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning authors have been published by Knopf, though they have also passed at times on subsequently notable books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/books/review/Oshinsky-t.html |title=No Thanks, Mr. Nabokov |last=Oshinsky |first=David |date=2007-09-09 |accessdate=2009-07-04 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Since its founding, Knopf has paid close attention to design and [[typography]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aigany.org/events/details/10KF/ |title=Knopf: Then and Now |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-04-06 |publisher=AIGA/NY}}</ref> employing notable designers and typographers including [[William Addison Dwiggins]], Harry Ford, [[Steven Heller (graphic design)|Steven Heller]], [[Chip Kidd]], [[Lorraine Louie]], [[Bruce Rogers (typographer)|Bruce Rogers]], [[Rudolph Ruzicka|Rudolf Ruzicka]], and [[Beatrice Warde]]. Knopf books conclude with an unnumbered page titled "A Note on the Type", which describes the history of the [[typeface]] used for the book. In addition, Knopf books date the year of the book's current printing on the title page.

Knopf published textbooks until 1988, when Random House's schools and colleges division was sold to [[McGraw-Hill]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/29/business/the-media-business-mcgraw-hill-is-buying-2-random-house-units.html McGraw-Hill Is Buying 2 Random House Units]</ref>

In 1991, Knopf revived the "[[Everyman's Library]]" series, originally published in England in the early 20th century. This series consists of classics of world literature in affordable hardcover editions. The series has grown over the years to include lines of ''Children's Classics'' and ''Pocket Poets''.

Random House was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998.<ref name="PWCentury" /> In late 2008 and early 2009, the Knopf Publishing Group merged with [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081203/FREE/812039987/1084/toc |title=Shakeups hit Random House, other publishers |last=Flamm |first=Matthew |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2010-04-06 |publisher=Crain's New York Business.com}}</ref> Random House has been owned since its 2013 merger of [[Penguin Group]] by [[Penguin Random House]], a [[joint venture]] between [[Bertelsmann]] (53%) and [[Pearson PLC]] (47%).

Many of Knopf's hardcover books are published later as [[Vintage Books|Vintage paperbacks]]. Vintage Books is a sister imprint of Random House.

In 2015, Knopf celebrated its 100th Anniversary by publishing a commemorative book--Alfred A. Knopf, 1915-2015: A Century of Publishing.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://new.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/66661-a-century-of-knopf.html|title=A Century of Alfred A.
