'''''Babylon 5''''' is an American [[science fiction]] television series created by writer and producer [[J. Michael Straczynski]], under the Babylonian Productions label, in association with Straczynski's Synthetic Worlds Ltd. and [[Warner Bros. Television|Warner Bros. Domestic Television]]. After the successful airing of a [[test pilot movie]] on February 22, 1993, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering]]'', in May 1993 Warner Brothers commissioned the series for production as part of its [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] (PTEN).<ref>{{cite web |title=Prime Time Entertainment Network announces expansion plans and programming slate for January 1994|author=Cynthia Lieberman|date=May 27, 1993 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PRIME+TIME+ENTERTAINMENT+NETWORK+ANNOUNCES+EXPANSION+PLANS+AND...-a013164529|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref>

The first season premiered in the US on January 26, 1994, and the series ultimately ran for the intended five seasons. Describing it as having "always been conceived as, fundamentally, a five-year story, a novel for television", Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes, and served as executive producer, along with [[Douglas Netter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Archived reply held on JMSNews.com|author=[[Straczynski, J.

==Setting==
Set between the years 2257 and 2262, it depicts a future where Earth has sovereign states, and a unifying [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)#Early development|Earth government]]. Colonies within the solar system, and beyond, make up the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]], and contact has been made with other [[Spacefaring#Spacefaring in popular culture|spacefaring]] species. The [[ensemble cast]] portray alien ambassadorial staff and humans assigned to the {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}}-long [[Babylon 5 (space station)|''Babylon 5'' space station]], a center for trade and diplomacy. Described as "one of the most complex programs on television", the various [[story arc]]s drew upon the prophesies, religious zealotry, racial tensions, social pressures, and political rivalries which existed within each of their cultures, to create a contextual framework for the motivations and consequences of the protagonists' actions.<ref>{{cite web |title=`Babylon 5' Plans Explosive 4th Season|author=Ian Spelling |date=November 21, 1996 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-11-21/features/9611210323_1_straczynski-earth-minbari-war-space-station-babylon|work=[[Chicago Tribune]] ''(reprinted from ''[[The New York Times]]'')''|accessdate=2011-01-14}}</ref> With a strong emphasis on [[Characterization#Character development|character development]] set against a backdrop of conflicting ideologies on multiple levels, Straczynski wanted "to take an adult approach to [[Science fiction|SF]], and attempt to do for television SF what ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''<!--Although the original quote is all caps, it is not appropriate in the lead section of an article.

=== Backstory ===
{{See also|Civilizations in Babylon 5}}
At the beginning of the series, five dominant civilizations (the [[Human (Babylon 5)|Humans]], [[Minbari]], [[Narn]], [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]], and the [[Vorlon]]s) are presented. "The [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]]" and their various allies are malevolent species who appear later in the series. Several dozen less powerful species from the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] appear, including the [[Drazi]], [[Brakiri]], [[Vree]], [[Civilizations in Babylon 5#Markab|Markab]], and [[pak'ma'ra]]. The station's first three predecessors (the original ''Babylon'' station, ''Babylon 2'' and ''Babylon 3'') were sabotaged or accidentally destroyed before their completion. The fourth station, ''[[Babylon 4]]'', vanished without a trace twenty-four hours after it became fully operational.<ref name="january">{{cite web |title=Since it is now January 1st, time... |author=Straczynski, J.

The five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258–2262. Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season's plot. As the series starts, the ''Babylon 5'' station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the much more powerful [[Minbari]], who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race during the [[Battle of the Line]].

=== Season 1 – Year 2258 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 1: Signs and Portents}}
During 2258, [[Jeffrey Sinclair|Commander Jeffrey Sinclair]] is in charge of the station. Much of the story revolves around his gradual discovery that it was his capture by the Minbari at the Battle of the Line which ended the war against Earth. Upon capturing Sinclair, the Minbari came to believe that [[List of Babylon 5 characters#V|Valen]], a great Minbari leader and hero of the last Minbari-Shadow war, had been reincarnated as the Commander. Concluding that others of their species had been, and were continuing to be reborn as humans, and in obedience to the edict that Minbari do not kill one another, lest they harm the soul, they stopped the war just as [[Earth (Babylon 5)|Earth's]] final defenses were on the verge of collapse.

Meanwhile, tensions between the Centauri Republic, which is an empire in decline, and the Narn Regime, a former dominion which rebelled and gained freedom, are increasing. Ambassador G'Kar of the Narn wishes for his people to strike back at the Centauri for what they did, and Ambassador Londo Mollari of the Centauri wishes for his people to become again the great empire they once were. As part of these struggles, Mollari makes a deal with a mysterious ally to strike back at the Narn, further heightening tensions.

It is gradually revealed that [[Delenn|Ambassador Delenn]] is a member of the mysterious and powerful [[Grey Council]], the ruling body of the Minbari. Towards the end of 2258, she begins the transformation into a Minbari-human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the death of [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] president Luis Santiago. The death is officially ruled an accident, but some members of the military, including the staff of ''Babylon 5'', believe it to be an assassination.

=== Season 2 – Year 2259 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 2: The Coming of Shadows}}
At the beginning of 2259, [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|Captain John Sheridan]] replaces Sinclair as the military governor of the station after Sinclair is reassigned as ambassador to Minbar. He and the command staff gradually learn that the assassination of President Santiago was arranged by his then-Vice President, Morgan Clark, who has now become president. Conflict develops between the ''Babylon 5'' command staff and the [[Psi Corps]], an increasingly [[autocratic]] organization which oversees and controls the lives of human [[telepathy|telepaths]].

The Shadows, an ancient and extremely powerful race who have recently emerged from hibernation, are revealed to be the cause of a variety of mysterious and disturbing events, including the attack on the Narn outpost at the end of 2258. Centauri Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]] unknowingly enlists their aid through his association with their mysterious human representative [[Morden (Babylon 5)|Mr. Morden]] in the ongoing conflict with the Narn. The elderly and ailing Centauri emperor, long an advocate of reconciliation with the Narn, unfortunately has insufficient control to prevent others from instigating war against the Narn Regime. When the emperor dies suddenly during a peace mission to ''Babylon 5'', a number of conspirators, including Ambassador Londo Mollari and Lord Refa, take control of the Centauri government by assassinating their opponents and placing the late emperor's unstable nephew on the throne. Their first act is to start open aggression against the Narn. After a full-scale war breaks out, the Centauri with the help of the Shadows through Londo eventually conquer Narn in a brutal attack involving [[List of electromagnetic projectile devices in fiction|mass driver]]s, outlawed [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Towards the end of the year, the Clark administration begins to show increasingly totalitarian characteristics, clamping down on dissent and restricting [[freedom of speech]]. The [[Vorlon]]s are revealed to be the basis of legends about [[angel]]s on various worlds, including Earth, and are the ancient enemies of the Shadows. They enlist the aid of Sheridan and the ''Babylon 5'' command staff in the struggle against the Shadows.

=== Season 3 – Year 2260 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 3: Point of No Return}}
The Psi Corps and President Clark, whose government has discovered Shadow vessels buried in Earth's solar system, begin to harness the vessels' advanced technology. The Clark administration continues to become increasingly [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and totalitarian, and gradually develops an [[Orwellian]] government style, including an organization called Night Watch which targets citizens who hold views contrary to those of Clark's regime.

Sheridan and Delenn's "conspiracy of light" works to uncover clues about how to defeat the Shadows. During a mission near [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], one of the moons of Jupiter, their ship is seen by the Earth Alliance destroyer ''Agamemnon'', but not recognized. Though they escape and no shots were fired in the encounter, President Clark uses it as an excuse to declare martial law. This triggers a war of independence on [[Mars]], which had long had a strained political relationship with Earth. ''Babylon 5'' attempts to avoid conflict with Earth, but in response to civilian bombings on Mars, concerns with Night Watch, and illegal orders meant to oppress their populations, they choose to declare independence from Earth, along with several other outlying Earth Alliance colonies including Orion VII and Proxima III. In response, the Earth Alliance attempts to retake ''Babylon 5'' by force, but with the aid of the Minbari, who have allied with the station against the growing Shadow threat, the attack is repelled at great cost.

Becoming concerned over the Shadows' growing influence among his people, Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari attempts to sever ties with them. [[Morden (Babylon 5)|Mr. Morden]], the Shadows' human representative, tricks him into restoring the partnership by engineering the murder of Mollari's mistress while putting the blame on a rival Centauri House. Open warfare breaks out between the Shadows and the alliance led by ''Babylon 5'' and the Minbari. It is learned that genetic manipulation by the Vorlons is the source of telepathy in humans and other races, as it is later discovered that Shadow ships are vulnerable to telepathic attacks. Displeased at the Vorlons' lack of direct action against the Shadows, Captain John Sheridan browbeats Vorlon ambassador [[Kosh Naranek]] into launching an attack against their mutual enemy. Kosh's deeds lead to his subsequent assassination by the Shadows.

Former station commander Jeffrey Sinclair returns to ''Babylon 5'' to enlist the aid of Captain Sheridan, Delenn, Ivanova and Marcus in stealing the ''[[Babylon 4]]'' space station and sending it 1,000 years back in time to use it as a base of operations against the Shadows in the previous Minbari-Shadow war. Having undergone a similar transformation to the one Delenn had at the end of Season 1, Sinclair transforms into a Minbari and is subsequently revealed to be the actual Valen of Minbari legend, rather than simply a reincarnation. Meanwhile, as a result of the unstable time travel, Sheridan sees a vision of the downfall of Centauri Prime when it is attacked by Shadow allies after the Shadow war, and he becomes determined to prevent that future.

Sheridan and Delenn begin a romantic relationship, but their lives and the war are interrupted by the sudden reappearance of Sheridan's wife, who was presumed dead after taking part in an archaeological expedition to Z'ha'dum years prior. She tells Sheridan that the Shadows are not evil, hoping to bring him back with her and recruit him to their cause. He soon realizes that her mind has been tampered with and corrupted by the Shadows, but accepts her offer to visit Z'ha'dum because he hopes it will save the galaxy sooner and prevent the downfall of Centauri Prime. He takes with him a pair of nuclear warheads, which he uses to destroy their largest city, and is last seen jumping into a miles-deep pit to escape the explosion.

Shadow vessels appear at the station, but disappear after Sheridan's attack. However, after they leave, station personnel realize that Garibaldi, who left in a fighter to defend against the vessels, never returned.

=== Season 4 – Year 2261 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat}}
In 2261, the Vorlons join the Shadow War, but their tactics become a concern for the alliance when the Vorlons begin destroying entire planets which they deem to have been "influenced" by the Shadows. Disturbed by this turn of events, Babylon 5 recruits several other powerful and ancient races (the [[First Ones]]) to their cause, against both the Shadows and the Vorlons. Captain John Sheridan returns to the station after escaping from Z'ha'dum and reunites the galaxy against the Shadows, but at a price: barring illness or injury, he has only 20 years left to live. He is accompanied by a mysterious alien named Lorien who claims to be the first sentient being in the galaxy, and who breathed life into Sheridan at Z'ha'dum. Once Sheridan returns, he and Delenn formalize their relationship and begin planning to marry, although most of their plans are put on hold due to the ongoing war.

Hours before Sheridan's return, Garibaldi is rescued and returned to the station, in rather dubious circumstances. Over the course of the next several months, he becomes markedly more paranoid and suspicious of other alien races and of Sheridan than he was before, causing worry among his friends and colleagues.

Centauri Emperor [[Cartagia]] forges a relationship with the Shadows. With the reluctant help of his enemy G'Kar, Londo Mollari engineers the assassination of Cartagia and repudiates his agreement with the Shadows. In exchange for G'Kar's help, Londo frees the Narn from Centauri occupation. Londo afterwards kills Mr. Morden and destroys the Shadow vessels based on the [[Centauri Prime|Centauri homeworld]], in an attempt to save his planet from destruction by the Vorlons. (Centauri Prime was not destroyed.) Aided by the other ancient races, and several younger ones, Sheridan lures both the Vorlons and the Shadows into an immense battle, during which the [[Vorlon]]s and Shadows reveal that they have been left as guardians of the younger races, but due to philosophical differences, ended up using them as pawns in their endless [[proxy war]]s throughout the ages. The younger races reject their continued interference, and the Vorlons and Shadows, along with the remaining First Ones, agree to depart the galaxy in order to allow the younger races to find their own way.

After the Shadows are defeated, Garibaldi leaves his post as security chief and works on his own as a "provider of information". He begins working for one William Edgars, a Mars tycoon, who is married to Garibaldi's former love. While he works ever closer with Edgars, he becomes increasingly aggressive toward Sheridan and eventually leaves ''Babylon 5''.

[[Minbar (planet)|Minbar]] is gripped by a brief civil war between the Warrior and Religious castes. Delenn secretly meets with Neroon of the Warrior caste and convinces him that neither side can be allowed to win. She tells him that she will undergo a ritual wherein she will be willing to sacrifice herself, but will stop the ritual before she actually dies. When Neroon sees that she actually intends to go through the entire ritual, he rescues her and sacrifices himself instead, declaring that, although he was born Warrior caste, in his heart he is Religious caste.

As part of the ongoing conflict between Earth and Babylon 5, Garibaldi eventually betrays Sheridan and arranges his capture in order to gain Edgars' trust and learn his plans. Garibaldi later learns that Edgars had created a virus that is dangerous only to telepaths. It is then revealed that after Garibaldi was captured the previous year, he was taken to the Psi Corps and re-programmed by Bester to provide information to him at the right time. Bester releases Garibaldi of his programming, and allows him to remember everything he had done since being kidnapped. Edgars is killed by Psi Corps operatives. His wife disappears but is reunited with Garibaldi after the end of the war.

Sheridan is tortured and interrogated by those who hope to break him and turn him into a propaganda tool for Earth's totalitarian government. Fortunately, Garibaldi is able to help free Sheridan and return him to the campaign to free Earth. An alliance led by Babylon 5 frees Earth from totalitarian rule by president Clark in a short but bloody war. This culminates in Clark's suicide and the restoration of democratic government in the Earth Alliance. Mars is granted full independence, and Sheridan agrees to resign his commission. The [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] is dissolved and reformed into the [[Interstellar Alliance (Babylon 5)|Interstellar Alliance]], with Sheridan elected as its first president and continuing his command of the [[Anla'shok|Rangers]], who are to act as a galactic equivalent of [[United Nations peacekeepers]]. Londo and G'Kar enter an uneasy alliance to help both their races as well as Sheridan in forming the Interstellar Alliance. During the final battle to liberate Earth from Clark's regime, Ivanova is critically injured, promised only a few days to live. Marcus, who had fallen in love with Ivanova, finds the same alien healing device used to revive Garibaldi at the beginning of the second season, and uses it to transfer almost all of his life energy into Ivanova, causing her to live. This causes her immense emotional anguish, and she chooses to leave Babylon 5 for another posting in EarthForce. Marcus is placed into indefinite cryonic suspension at her request, pending resuscitation technology.

Sheridan and Delenn complete their marriage ceremony while en route to Babylon 5, where they will head the Interstellar Alliance until the completion of Alliance's permanent headquarters.

In the season finale, the events of 100, 500, 1000, and one million years into the future are shown, depicting Babylon 5's lasting influence throughout history. Among the events shown are the political aftermath of the 2261 civil war, a subsequent nuclear war on Earth involving a new totalitarian government in 2762, the resulting fall of Earth into a [[pre-industrial society]], the loss and restoration of humanity's knowledge of space travel, and the final evolution of mankind into energy beings similar to the Vorlons, after which Earth's sun goes [[nova]].

=== Season 5 – Year 2262 and beyond ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 5: The Wheel of Fire}}
In 2262, Earthforce Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] is appointed to command ''Babylon 5'', which is now also the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance. The station grows in its role as a sanctuary for rogue telepaths running from the [[Psi Corps]], resulting in conflict. [[G'Kar]], former Narn ambassador to ''Babylon 5'', becomes unwillingly a spiritual icon after a book that he wrote while incarcerated during the Narn-Centauri War is published without his knowledge. The [[Drakh]], former allies of the Shadows who remained in the galaxy, take control of [[Regent]] [[Virini]] on Centauri Prime through a parasitic creature called a Keeper, then incite a war between the Centauri and the Interstellar Alliance, in order to isolate the Centauri from the Alliance and gain a malleable homeworld for themselves.

Centauri Prime is devastated by [[Narn]] and [[Drazi]] warships and Londo Mollari becomes emperor, then ends the war. However, the Drakh blackmail him into accepting a Drakh Keeper, under threat of the complete nuclear destruction of the planet. [[Vir Cotto]], Mollari's loyal and more moral aide, becomes ambassador to ''Babylon 5'' in his stead. G'Kar also leaves ''Babylon 5'' to escape his unwanted fame and explore the rim. Sheridan and Delenn move to a city on Minbar, where the new headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance are located, while celebrating their first year of marriage and the upcoming birth of their son, and mourning the loss of dear friendships. Garibaldi marries and settles down on Mars, where he and his wife share ownership of a prominent pharmaceutical company. Most other main characters, including Stephen Franklin and Lyta Alexander, leave ''Babylon 5'' as well.

As shown in flash-forwards earlier in the series, the next several years include the reign of Londo Mollari as Centauri Emperor. Sixteen years later, Londo sacrifices his life to rescue Sheridan and Delenn from the Drakh, in the hope that they in turn can save Centauri Prime. To prevent the Drakh from discovering his ruse, he asks G'Kar, now an old friend, to kill him, but Londo's Keeper wakes up and forces him to kill G'Kar in return. They die at each other's throats, in accordance with Londo's vision many decades earlier, and Vir Cotto succeeds him as emperor, free of Drakh influence.

Three years after Londo's death, Sheridan himself is on the verge of death and takes one last opportunity to gather his old friends together. Shortly after his farewell party, Sheridan says goodbye to Delenn, though in Minbari fashion they use the word "goodnight" to signify their hope of an eventual reunion. Sheridan then takes a final trip to the obsolete ''Babylon 5'' station before its decommissioning. He returns to the site of the final battle between the Vorlons and the Shadows and apparently dies, but is instead claimed by The First One, who invites him to join the other First Ones on a journey beyond the rim of the galaxy. ''Babylon 5'' station is destroyed in a demolition shortly after Sheridan's departure, its existence no longer necessary as the Alliance has taken over its diplomatic purposes and other trading routes have been established. This final episode features a cameo by Straczynski as the technician who switches off the lights before ''Babylon 5'' is demolished.

== Themes ==
Throughout its run, ''Babylon 5'' found ways to portray [[theme (literature)|themes]] relevant to modern and historical social issues. It marked several firsts in television science fiction, such as the exploration of the political and social landscapes of the first human colonies, their interactions with Earth, and the underlying tensions.<ref name="mars"/> ''Babylon 5'' was also one of the first television science fiction shows to [[wikt:denotative|denotatively]] refer to a [[same-sex relationship]].<ref name="dyke1">{{cite web<!-- The article date was taken from the Internet Archive copy "Page info."

=== Order vs. chaos; authoritarianism vs. free will ===

The clash between order and chaos, and the people caught in between, plays an important role in ''Babylon 5''. The conflict between two unimaginably powerful older races, the [[Vorlon]]s and the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]], is represented as a battle between two competing ideologies, each seeking to turn the humans and the other younger races to their beliefs. The Vorlons represent an [[authoritarian]] philosophy: you will do what we tell you to, because we tell you to do it. The Vorlon question, "Who are you?" focuses on identity as a catalyst for shaping personal goals;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-6531 |title=ZHD – Thoughts |date=May 11, 1996 |accessdate=2006-09-02 |author=Straczynski, J.

=== War and peace ===
{{Quote box |quote=What interests me, what I wanted to do with making this show, was in large measure to examine the issues and emotions and events that precede a war, precipitate a war, the effects of the war itself, the end of the war and the aftermath of the war.

The story begins in the aftermath of a war which brought the human race to the brink of extinction, caused by a misunderstanding during a [[first contact (science fiction)|first contact]] situation.<ref name="january"/> The Babylon 5 station is subsequently built in order to foster peace through diplomacy, described as the "last, best hope for peace" in the opening credits monologue during its first three seasons. Wars between separate alien civilizations are featured. The conflict between the [[Narn]] and the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] is followed from its beginnings as a minor territorial dispute amplified by historical animosity, through to its end, in which [[weapons of mass destruction]] are employed to subjugate and enslave an entire planet. The war is an attempt to portray a more sobering kind of conflict than usually seen on science fiction television. Informed by the events of the first [[Gulf War]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Prague Spring#Invasion|invasion of Prague]], the intent was to recreate these moments when "the world held its breath" and the emotional core of the conflict was the disbelief that the situation could have occurred at all, and the desperation to find a way to bring it to an end.<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=Coming of Shadows |author=Straczynski, J.

The [[Shadow War]] also features prominently in the show, during which an advanced alien species attempts to sow the seeds of conflict in order to promote technological and cultural advancement. The gradual discovery of the scheme and the rebellion against it, serve as the backdrop to the first three seasons,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-3813 |title=Voices |author=Straczynski, J.

The post-war landscape has its roots in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The attempt to resolve the [[issues of the American Civil War]] after the conflict had ended, and this struggle for survival in a changed world was also informed by works such as ''[[Alas, Babylon]]'', a novel dealing with the after-effects of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] on a small American town.<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=Comparison to "Lucifer's Hammer" |author=Straczynski, J.

=== Addiction ===
Substance abuse and its impact on human personalities also plays a significant role in the ''Babylon 5'' storyline. The station's security chief, [[Michael Garibaldi]], is a textbook relapsing-remitting alcoholic of the [[binge drinking]] type; he practices complete [[abstinence]] from alcohol throughout most of the series (with [[Survivors (Babylon 5)|one notable exception]]) until the [[Phoenix Rising (Babylon 5)|middle of season five]]. He only recovers physically and socially and breaks the cycle at the end of the season. His eventual replacement as Chief of Security, [[Zack Allan]], was given a second chance by Garibaldi after overcoming his own addiction to an unspecified drug. Dr. [[Stephen Franklin (Babylon 5)|Stephen Franklin]] develops an (initially unrecognized) addiction to injectable [[stimulant]] drugs while trying to cope with the chronic stress and work overload in Medlab, and wanders off to the homeless and deprived in Brown Sector, where he suffers through a severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] syndrome. Executive Officer [[Susan Ivanova]] mentions that her father became an alcoholic after her mother had committed suicide after having been drugged by the authorities over a number of years. Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] tells Garibaldi that her father was an alcoholic and that she is a recovering alcoholic herself.<ref>Season 5, Episode 19: "The Wheel of Fire"</ref>

== Production ==

=== Origin ===
Having worked on a number of television science fiction shows which had regularly gone over budget, creator J. Michael Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralized location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of "[going] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week", a fixed space station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], ''[[Childhood's End]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]], Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become ''Babylon 5''.<ref name="GEnie-1992">{{cite web<!-- Archive URL date taken from page metadata, main URL date taken is the one used for the entire document --> |first = J.

Instead, acting as a center of political intrigue and conflict, the station becomes the [[linchpin]] of a massive [[interstellar war]]. This is reflected in the opening monologue of each episode, which describes it as the "last, best hope for peace" in season one, then the "last, best hope for victory" in season three.

The series consists of a coherent five-year [[story arc]] taking place over five seasons of 22 episodes each.

Though conceived as a whole, it was necessary to adjust the plotline to accommodate external influences. Each of the characters in the series was written with a "trap door" into their background so that, in the event of an actor's unexpected departure from the series, the character could be written out with minimal impact on the storyline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/misc/cc-leave.html |title=JMS on Claudia Christian's departure |accessdate=2006-11-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061019022537/http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/misc/cc-leave.html| archivedate= October 19, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In the words of Straczynski, "As a writer, doing a long-term story, it'd be dangerous and short-sighted for me to construct the story without trap doors for every single character. ...

Ratings for ''Babylon 5'' continued to rise during the show's third season, but going into the fourth season, the impending demise of network [[Prime Time Entertainment Network|PTEN]] left a fifth year in doubt. Unable to get word one way or the other from parent company [[Warner Bros.]], and unwilling to short-change the story and the fans, Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season in order to allow for both eventualities. Straczynski identified three primary [[narrative thread]]s which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth's slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network commissioned two ''Babylon 5'' television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the [[Earth–Minbari War]], and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, ''Crusade''. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into ''Crusade'', or the fifth season, were it to be given the [[greenlight]].<ref name="writing"/> The intended series finale, "[[Sleeping in Light]]", was filmed during season four as a precaution against cancellation. When word came that TNT had picked up ''Babylon 5'', this was moved to the end of season five and replaced with a newly filmed season four finale, "[[The Deconstruction of Falling Stars]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=How will this play out |author=Straczynski, J.

Michael Straczinski to get a sense of the historical perspective of the major alien races, "so I knew if they were a peaceful people or a warring people, cold climate etc. and then I would interpret what kind of sensibility that called for."<ref name="Bruice1"/> Collaborating with other departments to establish co-ordinated visual themes for each race, a broad palette of colors was developed with Iacovelli, which he referred to as "spicy brights".<ref name="Iacovelli1"/> These warm shades of grey and secondary colors, such as certain blues for the [[Minbari]], would often be included when designing both the costumes and relevant sets. As the main characters evolved, Bruice referred back to Straczynski and producer John Copeland who she viewed as "surprisingly more accessible to me as advisors than other producers and directors", so the costumes could reflect these changes. Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]]'s purple coat became dark blue and more tailored while his waistcoats became less patterned and brightly colored as Bruice felt "Londo has evolved in my mind from a buffoonish character to one who has become more serious and darker."<ref name="Bruice2"/>

Normally there were three changes of costume for the primary actors; one for on set, one for the stunt double and one on standby in case of "coffee spills". For human civilians, garments were generally purchased [[Ready-to-wear|off-the-rack]] and altered in various ways, such as removing lapels from jackets and shirts while rearranging [[Hook-and-eye closure|closures]], to suggest future fashions. For some of the main female characters a more [[Haute couture|couture]] approach was taken, as in the suits worn by [[Talia Winters]] which Bruice described as being designed and fitted to within "an inch of their life". Costumes for the destitute residents of downbelow would be distressed through a combination of bleaching, sanding, dipping in dye baths and having stage blood added.<ref name="Bruice1"/>

Like many of the crew on the show, members of the costume department made onscreen [[Cameo appearance|cameos]]. During the season 4 episode "[[Atonement (Babylon 5)|Atonement]]", the tailors and costume supervisor appeared as the Minbari women fitting [[Zack Allan]] for his new uniform as the recently promoted head of security. His complaints, and the subsequent stabbing of him with a needle by costume supervisor Kim Holly, was a light hearted reference to the previous security uniforms, a design carried over from the pilot movie which were difficult to work with and wear due to the combination of leather and wool.<ref name="Kim1"/>

=== Prosthetic makeup and animatronics ===
While the original pilot film featured some [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] which were puppets and [[animatronics]], the decision was made early on in the show's production to portray most alien species as [[humanoid]] in appearance. Barring isolated appearances, fully [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] aliens were discounted as an idea due to the "massive [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] power"<ref name="JMSemotion" /> required. Long-term use of puppets and animatronics was also discounted due to the technological limitations in providing convincing interaction with the human actors ("...if you want any real ''emotion'' from the character, you're going to have to have an actor inside" [sic]).<ref name="JMSemotion">{{cite newsgroup |title=Alien looking aliens |author=Straczynski, J.

[[Foundation Imaging]] provided the special effects for the pilot film (for which it won an Emmy) and the first three seasons of the show, led by Ron Thornton. After the show's co-executive producer (Douglas Netter) and producer (John Copeland) approached Straczynski with the idea of producing the effects in-house, Straczynski agreed to replace Foundation, for season 4 and 5, once a new team had been established by [[Netter Digital]], and an equal level of quality was assured,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.babylonpodcast.com/tag/jms/ |title=Babylon Podcast #161: Interview with JMS, Part 1 |author=Straczynski, J.

[[Christopher Franke]] [[Musical composition|composed]] and [[Sheet music|scored]] the musical soundtrack for all 5 years of the show when [[Stewart Copeland]], who worked on the original telefilm, was unable to return for the first season due to recording and touring commitments.<ref>{{cite web |title=Music change from Gathering|author=Straczynski, J.

With his recording studio in the same building as his home located in the [[Hollywood Hills]], Franke would attend creative meetings before scoring the on average 25 minutes of music for each episode.<ref name="ChrisFranke1"/> Utilising [[Steinberg Cubase|Cubase]] software through an [[electronic keyboard]], or for more complex pieces a [[light pen]] and [[graphics tablet]], he would begin by developing the [[Melody|melodic]] content round which the [[Ambient music|ambient]] components and [[Transition (music)|transitions]] were added. Using playbacks with digital [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of the appropriate instruments, such as a group of violins, he would decide which tracks to produce electronically or record [[Acoustic music|acoustically]].<ref name="ChrisFranke1"/><ref name="ChrisFranke2">{{cite web |title=Babylon 5: Messages From Earth – The Interview |author=Franke, Christopher| date=April 23, 1995 |url=http://christopherfranke.com/interview.html|publisher=Rudy Koppl (interviewer)|accessdate=2012-01-03}}</ref>

Utilizing the "acoustic dirt produced by live instruments and the ability to play so well between two semitones" and the "frequency range, dynamics and control" provided by synthesizers, he described his approach "as experimental friendly as possible without leaving the happy marriage between the orchestral and electronic sounds".<ref name="ChrisFranke2"/> While highlighting ''Babylon 5'' was produced on a "veritable shoestring", and as such would have been unable to afford a full orchestral score every week, at least one reviewer felt that the soundtrack would have benefitted from a greater use of the Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra, which Franke established in 1991.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

{{quotation|And while Franke's handling of the electronic textures is adept, I think he could have made a little better use of the German orchestra that's credited in every episode. In particularly, the driving, fanfare-like title themes would gain a lot of distinction from the kind of guts that an acoustic sound would bring to them.<ref>{{cite web |title=More Babylon 5 CDs Than You Will Ever Need |author=Bond, Jeff|date=March 3, 1998 |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm?articleID=2383|publisher=[[Film Score Monthly]]|accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>}}

Scores for the acoustic tracks were emailed to his Berlin scoring stage, and would require from four musicians to the full orchestra, with a maximum of 24 present at any one time. One of three conductors would also be required for any score that involved more than 6 musicians. Franke would direct recording sessions via six fibre optic digital telephone lines to transmit and receive video, music and the [[SMPTE timecode]]. The final edit and mixing of the tracks would take place in his Los Angeles studio. Initially concerned composing for an episodic television show could become "annoying because of the repetition", Franke found the evolving characters and story of ''Babylon 5'' afforded him the opportunity to continually "push the envelope".<ref name="ChrisFranke1"/><ref name="ChrisFranke2"/>

{{quotation|Assembling music written for the series' final episode, Sleeping in Light succinctly encapsulates just how far Franke's sensibilities evolved over the course of Babylon 5's five-year production run – the synthesizer textures and martial percussion so long a fixture of the series' musical palette are now enhanced by strings and guitars that emphasize the deeply human emotional dimensions of the interstellar drama. Indeed, for all the series' obvious emphasis on fantasy and otherworldly sounds, Franke never lost track of its earthbound soul. Epic in scope and scale, Sleeping in Light boasts a power few TV soundtracks achieve.<ref name="AllMusic1"/>}}

A total of 24 episode and three television film soundtracks were released under Franke's record label, Sonic Images Records, between 1995 and 2001. These contain the musical scores in the same chronological order as they played in the corresponding episodes, or television films. Three compilation albums were also produced, containing extensively re-orchestrated and remixed musical passages taken from throughout the series to create more elaborate suites. In 2007 his soundtrack for [[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales|The Lost Tales]] was released under the [[Varèse Sarabande]] record label.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' controversy ==
The pilot episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (''DS9'') aired just weeks before ''Babylon 5'' debuted. ''Babylon 5'' creator J. Michael Straczynski indicated that [[Paramount Television]] was aware of his concept as early as 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-14441 |title=J. Michael Straczynski post |publisher=Jmsnews.com |date=1994-12-07 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> when he attempted to sell the show to the studio, and provided them with the series [[Bible (writing)|bible]], pilot script, artwork, lengthy character background histories, and plot synopses for 22 "or so planned episodes taken from the overall course of the planned series".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-7864 |title=J.

Paramount declined to produce ''Babylon 5'', but later announced ''Deep Space Nine'' was in development, two months after Warner Bros. announced its plans for ''Babylon 5''. Straczynski has stated on numerous occasions that, even though he is confident that ''Deep Space Nine'' producer/creators [[Rick Berman]] and [[Michael Piller]] did not see this material, he thinks Paramount may have used his bible and scripts to steer development of ''Deep Space Nine''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-7652 |title=J.

If there are no more major similarities that crop up in the next few weeks or months, with luck we can continue that way." -->
 	
''Babylon 5'''s first-run syndicated ratings averaged between 3 and 4% of US households from 1995 to 1997, whereas ''DS9'' ranged from 4 to 5% during the same time span.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Babylon 5 media franchise ==
{{Main|Babylon 5 media franchise}}
In November 1994, [[DC Comics|DC]] began publishing monthly ''Babylon 5'' comics. A number of short stories and novels were also produced between 1995 and 2001. Additional books were published by the gaming companies Chameleon Eclectic and [[Mongoose Publishing]], to support their desk-top strategy and [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] games.

Three telefilms were released by [[TNT (TV channel)|Turner Network Television]] (TNT) in 1998, after funding a fifth season of ''Babylon 5'', following the demise of the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] the previous year. In addition to ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|In the Beginning]]'', ''[[Babylon 5: Thirdspace|Thirdspace]]'', and ''[[Babylon 5: The River of Souls|The River of Souls]]'', they released a re-edited special edition of the original 1993 telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering|The Gathering]]''. In 1999, a fifth telefilm was also produced, ''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms|A Call to Arms]]'', which acted as a pilot movie for the spin-off series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', which TNT cancelled after 13 episodes had been filmed.

[[Dell Publishing]] started publication of a series of ''Babylon 5'' novels in 1995, which were ostensibly considered canon within the TV series' continuity, nominally supervised by creator J. Michael Straczynski, with later novels in the line being more directly based upon Straczynski's own notes and story outlines. In 1997, [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] obtained the publication license from Warner Bros., and proceeded to release a number of original trilogies directly scenarized by Straczynski, as well as novelizations of three of the TNT telefilms (''In the Beginning, Thirdspace'', and ''A Call to Arms''). All of the Del Rey novels are considered completely canonical within the filmic ''Babylon 5'' universe.

In 2000, the [[Syfy Universal|Sci-Fi Channel]] purchased the rights to rerun the ''Babylon 5'' series, and premiered a new telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers|The Legend of the Rangers]]'' in 2002, which failed to be picked up as a series. In 2007, the first in a planned anthology of straight-to-DVD short stories entitled, ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales|The Lost Tales]]'', was released by [[Warner Home Video]], but no others were produced, due to funding issues.<ref>{{cite web |title=from jms: update|author=Straczynski, J.

At the 2014 [[San Diego Comic Con]], Straczynski announced that a Babylon 5 movie is planned to go into production in 2016. It is to be a reboot of the story, but potentially one using old cast members in different roles. [[Studio JMS]] would produce it on a budget of $80–100 million if [[Warner Bros.]] do not take up the offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2014/08/babylon-5-movie-eyes-2016-production-start/|title=J.

== Home video releases ==
In July 1995, [[Warner Home Video]] began distributing ''Babylon 5'' VHS video tapes under its Beyond Vision label in the UK. Beginning with the original telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering|The Gathering]]'', these were [[PAL]] tapes, showing video in the same [[Aspect ratio (image)#Current video standards|4:3 aspect ratio]] as the initial television broadcasts. By the release of Season 2, tapes included [[closed captioning]] of dialogue and [[Dolby Surround]] sound. [[Columbia House]] began distributing [[NTSC]] tapes, via mail order in 1997, followed by repackaged collector's editions and three-tape [[box sets|boxed sets]] in 1999, by which time the original pilot telefilm had been replaced by the re-edited TNT special edition. Additional movie and complete season boxed-sets were also released by Warner Bros. until 2000.

[[Image Entertainment]] released ''Babylon 5'' [[laserdiscs]] between December 1998 and September 1999. Produced on double-sided 12-inch [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] discs, each contained two episodes displayed in the 4:3 broadcast aspect-ratio, with Dolby Surround audio and closed captioning for the dialogue. Starting with two TNT telefilms, ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|In the Beginning]]'' and the re-edited special edition of ''The Gathering'', Seasons 1 and 5 were released simultaneously over a six-month period. Seasons 2 and 4 followed, but with the decision to halt production due to a drop in sales, precipitated by rumors of a pending DVD release, only the first twelve episodes of Season 2 and the first six episodes of Season 4 were ultimately released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Babylon 5: The Gathering / In The Beginning |author=Germano, Derek M|year=2001|url=http://www.thecinemalaser.com/dvd2/reviews/babylon-5-tgitb-dvd.htm|publisher=thecinemalaser.com|accessdate=2011-01-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101230075959/http://thecinemalaser.com/dvd2/reviews/babylon-5-tgitb-dvd.htm| archivedate= December 30, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In November 2001, Warner Home Video began distributing ''Babylon 5'' DVDs with a two-movie set containing the re-edited TNT special edition of ''The Gathering'' and ''In The Beginning''. The telefilms were later individually released in [[region 2]] in April 2002, though some markets received the original version of ''The Gathering'' in identical packaging.

DVD boxed sets of the individual seasons, each containing six discs, began being released in October 2002. Each included a printed booklet containing episode summaries, with each disc containing audio options for German, French, and English, plus [[wikt:Special:Search/subtitle|subtitles]] in a wider range of languages, including Arabic and Dutch. Video was displayed in [[anamorphic widescreen]] with [[Dolby Digital]] [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] sound. Disc 1 of each set contained an introduction to the season by [[J. Michael Straczynski]], while disc 6 included [[featurettes]] containing interviews with various production staff, as well as information on the [[fictional universe]], and a [[gag reel]]. Three episodes in each season also contained commentary from either Straczynski, members of the main cast, and/or the episode director.

Since its initial release, a number of repackaged DVD boxed sets have been produced for various [[DVD region code|regional markets]]. With slightly altered [[cover art]], they included no additional content, but the discs were more securely stored in slimline cases, rather than the early "book" format, with hard plastic pages used during the original release of the first three seasons.

=== Other releases ===
Seasons 1 and 2, and parts of Season 3, of ''Babylon 5'' have been released as advertisement-supported downloads through the [[In2TV]] and [[Hulu]] download services. Additionally, every episode from Seasons 1 to 5, as well as the pilot film ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering]]'', are available for purchase on the Xbox Live Marketplace in the United States. All five seasons, and five of the movies (''In The Beginning'', ''Thirdspace'', ''River of Souls'', ''A Call To Arms'', ''Legend of the Rangers'') are currently available through [[iTunes]].

=== Mastering problems ===
While the series was in pre-production, studios were looking at ways for their existing shows to make the transition from the then-standard [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3 aspect ratio]] to the [[widescreen]] formats that would accompany the next generation of televisions. After visiting [[Warner Bros.]], who were stretching the [[Horizontal blanking interval|horizontal interval]] for an episode of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]]'', producer John Copeland convinced them to allow ''Babylon 5'' to be shot on [[Super 35|Super 35mm film stock]]. "The idea being that we would [[telecine]] to 4:3 for the original broadcast of the series. But what it also gave us was a negative that had been shot for the new 16×9 widescreen-format televisions that we knew were on the horizon."<ref name="Copeland74">{{cite web |title=Interview with John Copeland: page 4|author=Copeland, John|date=June 4, 2008|url=http://www.themadgoner.com/B5/B5Scrolls/B5Scrolls.htm#Screen1_07_4|publisher=B5Scrolls|accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quote=The widescreen conversion thing was executive short sightedness at its finest!!! We offered to do ALL of ''Babylon 5'' in widescreen mode if Warner Bros would buy us a reference monitor so we could check our output. (only $5000 at the time) Ken Parkes (the "Business affairs" guy) and Netter (penny wise, but pound foolish) said no! So we did everything so it could be CROPPED to be widescreen! Each blamed the other by the way. Doug Netter said, "Ken Parkes said no". Ken Parkes said, "Doug Netter said no". SHEESH!!! So for $75 an episode they could have had AWESOME near Hi-Def. |source=— Ron Thornton, 2008<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Ron Thornton: page 4|author=Thornton, Ron|date=February 10, 2008|url=http://www.themadgoner.com/B5/B5Scrolls/B5Scrolls.htm#Screen1_01_4|publisher=B5Scrolls|accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref> |align=right |width=40% |salign=right}}Though the CGI scenes, and those containing live action combined with digital elements, could have been created in a suitable widescreen format, a cost-saving decision was taken to produce them in the 4:3 aspect ratio. The intention was to then [[Cropping (image)|crop]] the top and bottom of the images, and [[Video scaler|upscale]] the resolution for any future widescreen release or broadcast. In 2000, when the show was transferred to widescreen for airing on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] prior to its eventual DVD release, the plan was not followed, as John Copeland recalls: "They did another video hack, and simply used a digital post production device like a DVE (Digital Video Effects) to blow the material up. They essentially stretched it approximately 1/3 to fill the larger aspect ratio."<ref name="Copeland74"/>

The scenes containing live action ready to be [[Digital compositing|composited]] with [[matte paintings]], [[Computer animation|CGI animation]], etc., were delivered on tape already telecined to the 4:3 aspect-ratio, and contained a high level of [[Film grain|grain]], which resulted in further [[image noise]] being present when enlarged and stretched for widescreen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Ron Thornton: page 5|author=Thornton, Ron|date=February 10, 2008|url=http://www.themadgoner.com/B5/B5Scrolls/B5Scrolls.htm#Screen1_01_5|publisher=B5Scrolls|accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref> For the purely live-action scenes, rather than using the film negatives, "Warners had even forgotten that they had those. They used [[PAL]] versions and converted them to [[NTSC]] for the US market. They actually didn't go back and retransfer the shows."<ref name="Copeland75">{{cite web |title=Interview with John Copeland: page 5|author=Copeland, John|date=June 4, 2008|url=http://www.themadgoner.com/B5/B5Scrolls/B5Scrolls.htm#Screen1_07_5|publisher=B5Scrolls|accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>

With the resulting [[aliasing]], and the [[progressive scan]] transfer of the video to DVD, this has created a number of visual flaws throughout the widescreen release. In particular, quality has been noted to drop significantly in composite shots.<ref>{{cite web |title=Babylon 5 – The Complete First Season|author=Ordway, Holly E.|date=November 5, 2002|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/4929/babylon-5-the-complete-first-season/|publisher=DVDTalk.com|accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season|author=Non, Sergio |date=February 11, 2004|url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/491/491629p1.html|publisher=IGN.com|accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>
