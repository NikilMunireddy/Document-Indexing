==Champions==

===Men's===
{{main|List of Hockey East Men's Ice Hockey Tournament champions}}

The Hockey East Championship Game has been held in [[Boston]] since 1987, first at the [[Boston Garden]] and now the [[TD Garden]],<ref>[http://www.hockeyjournal.com/news/2010/03/06_hockey.php New England Hockey Journal: Hockey East playoff bracket set]</ref> since 1996.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/colleges/mens_hockey/articles/2010/03/21/eagles_bear_down_in_ot_win_hockey_east_title/ Eagles bear down in OT, win Hockey East title – The Boston Globe]</ref> The first two were held in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] at the Providence Civic Center (now the [[Dunkin' Donuts Center]]).

The final game and the semifinal games are held on consecutive nights in mid-March at the Garden. The quarterfinal round takes place the previous weekend. The top eight teams in the league advance to the quarterfinal round: the quarterfinal round series are 2-out-of-3 series with all games played at the higher seed's rink. There have been two cases where the #8 seed won on the #1 team's ice.<ref>[http://www.uscho.com/m/he/?data=tournament He Could Go All the Way :: USCHO.com :: U.S. College Hockey Online]</ref>

===Women's===
{{main|List of Hockey East Women's Ice Hockey Tournament champions}}
The Hockey East Championship was held in [[Boston]] from its inception in 2003 until 2007. The event was held at Northeastern's [[Matthews Arena]] in 2003 and 2004 before moving to BU's [[Walter Brown Arena]] in 2005. The tournament returned to Matthews Arena in 2006, was held at UNH's [[Whittemore Center]] in 2007, and at UConn's [[Mark Edward Freitas Ice Forum]] in 2008. The tournament went back to UNH in 2009, Providence in 2010, and the last campus to host was Boston University in 2011. The tournament moved to Hyannis, Massachusetts in 2012 and has been held there ever since.<ref>[http://www.uscho.com/w/he/?data=tournament He Could Go All the Way :: USCHO.com :: U.S. College Hockey Online]</ref>

==Rivalries==
Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern all take part in the annual [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] tournament with [[Harvard Crimson|Harvard]] of [[ECAC Hockey]].

The previously existing fierce rivalry between Boston College and Notre Dame, the [[Holy War on Ice]], became a conference matchup with Notre Dame's arrival in Hockey East. The two are rivals in other sports as well, as both are members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] for most sports (though [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame's football team]] remains [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]], they play BC in that sport on a regular basis). Maine also has a major rivalry with New Hampshire, often called "The Border War". Providence and UConn also have a great rivalry which spills over from the basketball court.

==Awards (Men's)==
At the conclusion of each regular season schedule the coaches of each Hockey East team vote which players they choose to be on the three All-Conference Teams:<ref>{{cite news|title=UMaine’s Abbott named Hockey East Player of the Year, Hobey Baker finalist|url=http://mainecampus.com/2012/03/15/umaines-abbott-named-hockey-east-player-of-the-year-hobey-baker-finalist/|publisher=The Maine Campus|date=2012-03-15|accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref> first team, second team and rookie team (except for [[1985–86 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|1985–86]] when no rookie team was selected). Additionally they vote to award up to 6 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time. Hockey East also awards a Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player and names a tournament all-star team, which are voted on at the conclusion of the conference tournament. Four of these awards have been bestowed every year that Hockey East has been in operation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hockey East Awards|url=http://www.augenblick.org/chha/hea_awd.html|publisher=College hockey Historical Archive|accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref> In addition, the Scoring Champion and Goaltending Champions are named based solely on statistics the players made during the season.
