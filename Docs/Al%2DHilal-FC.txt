==History==
[[File:Roberto Rivelino from left and right Najeeb Al Imam in 1979 in Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roberto Rivelino]] (left) and [[Najeeb]] (right) playing for Al-Hilal in 1979]]

Al-Hilal Club was originally known as the Olympic Club during its founding by Abdul Rahman Bin Saad Bin Saeed on 15 October 1957 in [[Riyadh]]. The club's name lasted for only one year before it was changed to its current name on 3 December 1958 by [[King Saud|King Saud Bin Abdul-Aziz]].  He changed the name after he attended a tournament that was contested between the Olympic Club, [[Al Shabab FC (Riyadh)|Al-Shabab]], Al-Riyadh and El-Kawkab clubs. As soon as the club's establishment, Al-Hilal enjoyed not only grassroots support but also [[House of Saud|royal]] attention.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.alhilal.com/en/page15.html |title = The story of Al Hilal Foundation}}</ref>

After spending their formative years building a squad, the club made their first mark by lifting the [[Crown Prince Cup|King's Cup]] trophy in 1961. That began a period in which the club won 50 official competitions. Al-Hilal recaptured the King's Cup in 1964, with a penalty shootout victory over two-time Asian champions [[Ittihad FC|Al-Ittihad]].

[[File:Al-Hilal champion 2010.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Al-Hilal players celebrating their [[Saudi Premier League]] championship in [[2009–10 Saudi Professional League|2010]]]]
The club were the inaugural winners when the [[Saudi Premier League]] came into existence in the [[1976–77 Saudi Premier League|1976–77 season]]. Al-Hilal won the title another 12 times and finished runners-up on 12 occasions in the space of 32 years. Al-Hilal also have seven King's Cup, twelve [[Crown Prince Cup]] and eight [[Saudi Federation Cup]] titles.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=44286/ |title= Al Hilal, by royal approval}}</ref>

With the success, a number of players and coaches from outside Saudi Arabia joined the club in the 1970s, including Brazilians [[Mario Zagallo]] and [[Roberto Rivelino]].

In [[1991 Asian Club Championship|1991]], they won the first Asian title, [[Asian Club Championship]]. They won it again in [[1999–2000 Asian Club Championship|1999–2000]]. In [[Asian Cup Winners Cup 1997|1997]] they captured the [[Asian Cup Winners Cup]] and the [[Asian Super Cup]] of that [[1997 Asian Super Cup|year]], which they lifted again in [[2002 Asian Super Cup|2002]]. The last time they got their hands on a continental trophy was in [[Asian Cup Winners Cup 2002|2002]], when they won the Asian Cup Winners' Cup.

Al Hilal is the only Asian team which achieves six Asian titles.

Al Hilal reached the final of the [[2014 AFC Champions League|AFC Champions League]] in [[2014 AFC Champions League Final|2014]], where they faced [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC|Western Sydney Wanderers]]. The Australian club won 1–0 on aggregate.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/02/western-sydney-wanderers-win-asian-champions-league-title|title = Western Sydney Wanderers win Asian Champions League title|date = 2014-11-02|accessdate = 2014-11-02|website = theguardian.com|publisher = theguardian.com|last = Cohen|first = Kate}}</ref>

==Stadiums==

Al-Hilal plays their home games at [[King Fahd International Stadium]] in Riyadh. The stadium was constructed in 1987 with a capacity of 67,000 people. The club's reserve team stadium, [[Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium]], was used in [[2011–12 Saudi Professional League|2011–12]] when King Fahd Stadium was under renovation.

==Rivalries==
{{Main|Saudi El Clasico}}
Al-Hilal has a long-standing rivalry with [[Ittihad FC|Al-Ittihad]]. From the start of national competition the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival cities: [[Riyadh]] and [[Jeddah]]. Matches between the two are often called 'El Clasico's. After the success of Al Hilal in Asia when they won two [[AFC Champions League|Asian Club Championship]] in years 1991 and 1999–2000, Al Ittihad has  won [[AFC Champions League]] two times in a row, in 2004 and 2005. Al-Hilal won the clasico 62 times, while Al-Ittihad has won it 50 times and two sides have drawn 35 times. The biggest win was when Al-Hilal defeated Al-Ittihad 5–0 in [[2009–10 Saudi Professional League|2009–10 season]].

Another rivalry is with their neighbors [[Al-Nassr FC|Al-Nassr]], which is called Riyadh's Derby. They have met 148 times, Al-Hilal has won 59 times, and lost 48 times, while 41 ties have ended in a  draw.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.alarabiya.net/ar/sport/2014/01/31/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%AD-%D9%83%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A8%D9%80-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-.html|title =التاريخ يرجح كفة الهلال.. والنصر يتفوق بـ"النهائيات"|date =29 January 2014|accessdate =17 May 2015|website =alarabiya.net|publisher =Alarabiya}}</ref> The biggest win is for Al-Hilal when they defeated Al-Nassr 5–3 in [[2010 King Cup of Champions]]. The rivalry with Al-Nassr is violent between them more than the rivalry with Al-Ittihad. As an example, when Al-Hilal reached the 2014 AFC Champions League Final, in 2nd leg Al-Nassr fans awaited Western Sydney Wanderers arrival at the airport to spur them on against Al-Hilal and tried to sabotage Al-Hilal's ticket plan.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/western-sydney-wanderers/western-sydney-wanderers-facing-football-in-the-kingdom-20141031-11enh7.html|title =Western Sydney Wanderers facing football in the kingdom|date = 31 October 2014|accessdate =17 May 2015|website =smh.com.au|publisher =The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

===Sponsorship===

[[Mobily]] is the main sponsor of Al-Hilal, and as part of the sponsorship deal, their logo is displayed on the front of the club's shirts and a plethora of other merchandise. The Mobily deal was announced by the club's President [[Abdulrahman bin Musa'ad]] on 14 October 2008, and is worth a Saudi record [[Saudi riyal|SAR]] 517 million, to be paid over six years (SAR 69.1 million per year).

If the team wins any trophy, they will get SAR 3 million for each one (USD 800,000). Al-Hilal will get 60% of any other sponsor that want to sponsor the team, with Mobily's agreement, 20% of football match tickets sold, 50% of Mobily Al-Hilal txt message service profit. Al-Hilal will get SAR 10 million if the number of subscribers in Mobily's Al-Hilal service reaches 200,000 and another 10 million if they reach 400,000 subscribers. Al-Hilal will get 10% of each mobile package sold under the Al-Hilal name (such as blue wave package) and 40% of the club membership fees. The minimum net income from Mobily deal is SAR 75 million per year (USD 20 million/year). Also, President [[Abdulrahman bin Musa'ad]] made a contract with "Omar Al-Mady", CEO of Volkswagen Group in Saudi Arabia. He was the one who represented the Volkswagen Group Global in Saudi Arabia on 9/18/2014. The period of the contract is 6 years. This means it will expire in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alyaum.com/article/4015313|title=Signing a lease between Al-Hilal and Volkswagen|last=|first=|date=18 September 2014|website=alyaum.com|publisher=|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref>

===Membership===

Like most professional teams all over the world, Al-Hilal and Mobily have introduced a [[membership card]] (Hilali) for fans to connect with their club. Fans are now able to join the Hilal membership scheme for the clubs starting [[2012–13 Saudi Professional League|2012–13 season]] onwards. Hilali membership benefits includes VIP tickets to all Al-Hilal home and away matches, using the club facilities, meeting with players monthly and discounts at Al-Hilal Mobily stores.

===Al-Hilal stores===
[[File:شارع التحلية (الرياض 2012) معرض نادي الهلال.JPG|thumb|Al-Hilal store in Tahlieh street, [[Riyadh]]]]
Al-Hilal has a chain of luxury retail stores that sell the club's products. The first branch opened on 1 February 2011 on the most expensive commercial street in [[Riyadh]] at a cost of [[Saudi riyal|SAR]] 15 million (USD 4 million). It was the first store from any Saudi club, and the biggest club store in the Middle East. In the first week of opening, sales surpassed SAR 1 million (USD 266,000). Mobily plans to cover the kingdom's main cities with seven branches by the end of 2012. [[Khobar]]'s branch has opened on 5 January 2012, which [[Jeddah]] branch opened on 5 April 2012. The stores offer thousands of high quality products including clothes, accessories, children toys and many other products.

The stores' profits currently go to [[Mobily]] only. After the investment cost is covered they will share the profit with the club.

===Television match broadcasting rights===

Al-Hilal receives SR 4.5 million per year (USD 1.2 million/year) from the [[Saudi Arabia Football Federation]] as the federation sell the complete matches' right in one package and all the clubs in the [[Saudi Professional League]] share the revenue equally.
The income may increase dramatically in near future as clubs will have the rights to sell their own matches' broadcasting rights.

===Other income sources===

The club's president and other board members pay any extra money required to run the club as the total expenses of the club in recent seasons surpassed SR 140 million (USD 38 million). This increase in expenses is due to the high level foreign and national players the club signed with such as [[Thiago Neves]], [[Mirel Rădoi]], [[Christian Wilhelmsson]], [[Osama Hawsawi]], [[Youssef El-Arabi]] and others.

==Charity and philanthropy==

Special seats have been allocated for the disabled to watch the training. Twenty-five percent of the income of tickets sold goes to charities. Players and board members arrange and attend social activities for charities during [[Muslim holidays|Eid]] and other holidays.

==Club facilities==

In 2009, the club opened a new camp in [[Riyadh]]. It contains 25 rooms, meeting rooms, smart room for lectures, library, eating room, living rooms, a big salon and a medical clinic. It also has entertainment corners for video games, table tennis, billiards, table football and many others. There are two training fields for the senior team.
