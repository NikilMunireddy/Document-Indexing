[[File:Castillo de Loarre 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Loarre Castle|Loarre]], one of the most important Romanesque castles in Europe]]

'''Aragon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ær|ə|ɡ|ɒ|n|}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ær|ə|ɡ|ən|}}, Spanish and {{lang-an|Aragón}} {{IPA-es|aɾaˈɣon|}}, {{lang-ca|Aragó}} {{IPA-ca|əɾəˈɣo|}} or {{IPA-ca|aɾaˈɣo|}}) is an [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] in [[Spain]], coextensive with the medieval [[Kingdom of Aragon]].  Located in northeastern Spain, the Aragonese autonomous community comprises three [[provinces of Spain|provinces]] (from north to south): [[Province of Huesca|Huesca]], [[Province of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]], and [[Province of Teruel|Teruel]].  Its capital is [[Zaragoza]] (also called ''Saragossa'' in English). The current [[Statute of Autonomy]] declares Aragon a ''[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]'' of Spain.

Aragon's northern province of Huesca borders France and is positioned in the middle of the [[Pyrenees]]. Within Spain, the community is flanked by [[Catalonia]] to the east, [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and [[Castile–La Mancha]] to the south, and [[Castile and León]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], and [[Navarre]] to the west.

Covering an area of {{convert|47719|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the region's terrain ranges diversely from permanent glaciers to verdant valleys, rich pasture lands and orchards, through to the arid steppe plains of the central lowlands.  Aragon is home to many rivers—most notably, the river [[Ebro]], Spain's largest river in volume, which runs west-east across the entire region through the province of Zaragoza.  It is also home to the [[Aneto]], the highest mountain in the [[Pyrenees]].

{{As of|2015}}, the population of Aragon was 1,317,847, with slightly more than half of it living in [[Zaragoza]], its capital city.  The economy of Aragon generates ({{As of|2014|lc=y}}) a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of €33,162 million which represents 3.13% of Spain's national GDP, and is currently 6th in per capita production behind Madrid, [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Navarre, Catalonia and La Rioja.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.datosmacro.com/pib/espana-comunidades-autonomas | title=PIB de las Comunidades Autónomas | access-date=30 December 2015 | website = datosmacro.com | language=Spanish | trans-title=GDP of the Autonomous Communities}}</ref>

In addition to its three provinces, Aragon is subdivided into 33 [[Comarcas of Aragon|comarcas]] or counties; all with a rich [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] and cultural history from its [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|pre-Roman]], [[Celtiberians|Celtic]] and [[Hispania|Roman]] days; and from the four centuries of Islamic period as ''Marca Superior'' of [[Al-Andalus]] or kingdom (or [[taifa]]) of [[Taifa of Zaragoza|Saraqustah]], and as lands that once belonged to the Frankish [[Marca Hispanica]]; and counties that later formed the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and eventually the empire or [[Crown of Aragon]].

==Demographics==

===Population===
{{As of|2015}}, half of Aragon's population, 50.45%, live in the capital city of [[Zaragoza]]. [[Huesca]] is the only other city in the region with a population greater than 50,000.

The majority of Aragonese citizens, 71.8%, live in the province of Zaragoza; 17.1% in Huesca and 11.1% in Teruel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.es/pob06/pob06menu.htm |title=Cifras completas |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203100553/http://www.ine.es/pob06/pob06menu.htm |archivedate=2007-02-03}}</ref> The population density of the region is the second lowest in Spain: only 26,8/km<sup>2</sup>; after [[Castilla La Mancha]]. The most densely populated areas are around the valley of the river [[Ebro]], particularly around Zaragoza, and in the Pyrenean foothills, while the areas with the fewest inhabitants tend to be those that are higher up in the Pyrenean mountains, and in most of the southern province of Teruеl.

Only four cities have more than 20,000 inhabitants: Zaragoza 700,000; Huesca 50,000; [[Teruel]] 35,000 and [[Calatayud]] 20,000.

===Language===
[[File:Aragon languages-en.png|thumb|left|Language distribution in Aragon. Spanish is spoken in all of Aragon, and is the only official language.]]

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the native language in most of Aragon, and it is the only official language, understood and spoken by virtually everyone in the region. In addition to it, the [[Aragonese language]] continues to be spoken in several local varieties in the mountainous northern counties of the [[Pyrenees]], particularly in western [[Ribagorza]], [[Sobrarbe]], [[Jacetania]] and [[Somontano de Barbastro|Somontano]]; it is enjoying a resurgence of popularity as a tool for regional identity. In the easternmost areas of Aragon, along the border with [[Catalonia]], varieties of the [[Catalan language]] are spoken, including the comarcas of eastern [[Ribagorza]], [[La Litera]], [[Bajo Cinca]], [[Bajo Aragón-Caspe]], [[Bajo Aragón]] and [[Matarraña]]. The strip-shaped Catalan-speaking area in Aragon is often called ''[[La Franja]]''.

==Geography==
[[File:Pirineos 081.jpg|thumb|View from Ordesa valley in the Aragonese Pyrenees]]
[[File:Circo de Soaso.jpg|thumb|Circo de Soaso in [[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]]]]

With such a low population density large areas of Aragon remain wild and relatively untouched. It is a land of extreme natural contrasts, both in climate and geologically, from the green valleys and snow-capped peaks of the Pyrenees to the dry plains and lonely hilly areas of the south.

===Orography===
{{Main|Mountains of Aragon}}
Aragon's [[Pyrenees]] include splendid and varied mountain landscapes with soaring peaks, deep canyons, dense forests and spectacular waterfalls. Its rugged peaks include the [[Aneto]]  (3,404 m), the highest in the range, the misty [[Monte Perdido]] (3,355 m), Perdiguero (3,221 m), Cotiella (2,912 m) and many others.

[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]], near the border with France, boasts some of the most spectacular scenery in Europe with its canyons, frozen lake caverns, numerous waterfalls and varied wildlife many species of which are endemic to the Pyrenees. The park is also one of the last sanctuaries of birds of prey in the range. Many beautiful mountain butterflies and flowers can be seen in the summer, while during winter the region is a paradise for skiers.

The principal valleys in the mountains include those of [[Hecho]], [[Canfranc]], [[Tena Valley|Tena]], [[Benasque]] and others. The green valleys hide pretty villages with nice [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches and typical Pyrenean houses with flowers on the balconies. The oldest Romanesque cathedral in Spain is located in the medieval town of [[Jaca]] in the very northern part of Huesca Province.

[[File:Vista Moncayo desde Alcala.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The [[Moncayo Massif]] seen from [[Alcalá de Moncayo]].]]
In the Pyrenean foothills, or pre-Pyrenees, the [[Mallos de Riglos]] are a famous natural rock formation. Ancient castles nestle on lonely hills, the most famous being the magnificent [[Loarre Castle]].

Further south, the Ebro valley, irrigated by the river Ebro, is a rich and fertile agricultural area covered with vast fields of wheat, barley and other fruit and vegetable crops. Many beautiful and little-known settlements, castles and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins dot the landscape here. Some of the most notable towns here include [[Calatayud]], [[Daroca]], [[Sos del Rey Catolico]], [[Caspe]] and others.

South of Zaragoza and the Ebro valley, the elevation rises again into the [[Sistema Ibérico]], a complex system of mountain ranges that separates the Ebro valley from the [[Meseta Central]] and plains of [[Castile–La Mancha]]. The highest massif in this range is the [[Moncayo Massif|Moncayo]] (2,313 m) and, despite getting less snow than in the Pyrenees, it has several ski resorts.

===Climate===
[[File:Formigal 2007.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Formigal]] (Huesca) winter]]

Aragon's climate can be defined as continental moderate. Temperatures are determined mainly by [[altitude]], ranging from cold or very cold in winter and cool in summer in the mountains to the north ([[Pyrenees]]) and to the south and west ([[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian range]]), to mild in winter and hot in summer in the central lowlands. Rainfall is also very variable, with very low mean values in the central areas and increasingly higher values in mountain areas, especially in the high Pyrenees.

In the middle of Aragon, which is only {{convert|200|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], the annual average temperature is around {{convert|14|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. To the north and south of the Ebro valley, where the elevation rises to {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], the temperature drops by two degrees. In the mountains, between {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} observed temperatures are between {{convert|11|and|12|C|F}}.

The [[cierzo]] wind is very common in the central area of Aragon, around the Ebro valley, during the autumn and winter.

===Territorial division===
Aragon is divided into three provinces from north to south, named after their capitals: [[Huesca (province)|Huesca]], [[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]] and [[Province of Teruel|Teruel]]. The provinces are further divided into 33 [[Comarcas of Aragon|comarcas]], three of which are in more than one province. There are a total of 732 [[Municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] in the region.

==History==
[[File:Imperi de la Corona d'Aragó.png|thumb|[[Crown of Aragon]] in the 15th century.]]
{{See also|Kingdom of Aragon|Crown of Aragon}}
Aragon is named after the [[Aragón river]], a tributary of the [[Ebro]].

=== Formation of the kingdom ===
Before Aragon came into being as a self-proclaimed [[Kingdom of Aragon|kingdom]] in 1035, the northern counties of [[Jaca]], [[Sobrarbe]] and [[Ribagorza]] were all counties and [[appanage]]s suzerain to the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. [[Sancho III of Navarre|King Sancho]] set out on his will the primacy of [[Pamplona]] over all appanages (domains for the personal management of his offspring) including Castile, but his younger children set off on separate paths instead, establishing their own kingdoms. [[Ramiro I of Aragon|Ramiro I]] was for the first time named king of Aragon in 1035. Later, after his brother Gonzalo's death, he was also named king of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza in 1044. The new kingdom grew quickly, conquering territories from the [[Al-Andalus|Moorish kingdoms]] to the south.

[[Huesca]] was taken in 1096 and [[Zaragoza]] in 1118. According to [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|Aragonese law]], the monarch had to swear allegiance to the Kingdom's laws before being accepted as king. Like other Pyrenean and Basque realms (and unlike Castile), the Aragonese justice and decision making system was based on Pyrenean [[Custom (law)|consuetudinary law]], the King was considered ''[[primus inter pares]]'' ('first among equals') within the nobility. A nobleman with the title "Justicia" <ref name="English Web of Justia de Aragon">{{cite web|url=http://www.eljusticiadearagon.com/index.php?cambia_idioma=3&zona=que_es |title=El Justicia de Aragón |publisher=Eljusticiadearagon.com |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> acted as ombudsman and was responsible for ensuring that the King obeyed the Aragonese laws. An old saying goes, "en Aragón antes de Rey hubo Ley" ("in Aragon Law came before King"), similar to the saying in Navarre, "antes fueron Leyes que Reyes", with much the same meaning.

=== Union with the County of Barcelona and its dominions in the Langue d'Oc ===
[[File:Gobierno Político de Aragón.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Emblematic allegorical woodcut (c. 1820) made during the [[Trienio Liberal]].  The political constitution illuminates the Aragonian shield that had been enclosed by the royal crown.]]
The dynastic union in 1137 between [[Petronila of Aragon|Petronila, Queen of Aragon]], and [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer IV]], Count of Barcelona, produced a son, [[Alfonso II of Aragon]] who inherited all their respective territories creating the [[Crown of Aragon]] which included all lands and people, titles and states previously outside of the [[Kingdom of Aragon]]. The Crown of Aragon was effectively abolished after the dynastic union with Castile (1469, see below) but the title continued to be used until 1714. The dynasty of the Kings of Aragon (called by some present-day historians "Kings of Aragon and Counts of Barcelona") ruled the present administrative region of Aragon, [[Catalonia]], and later the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], [[Sicily]], [[Naples]] and [[Sardinia]] (see [[Aragonese Empire]]).

The monarch was known as King of Aragon and also held the titles of [[King of Valencia]], [[King of Majorca]] (for a time), [[Count of Barcelona]], Lord of [[Montpellier]], and (temporarily) [[Duchy of Athens|Duke of Athens and Neopatria]]. Each of these titles gave him sovereignty over the specific region, and the titles changed as territories were lost and won.
[[File:Suchodolski Assault on Saragossa.jpg|thumb|The unsuccessful French assault of [[Zaragoza]] in 1808]]

=== Union with Castile ===
Despite the [[Crown of Aragon#Union with Castile|dynastic union with Castile]] following the marriage of [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] at the end of the 15th century following which most former kingdoms in Spain were progressively consolidated during the 16th and 17th centuries, Aragon lasted as a separate kingdom with its own laws and institutions until 1707 when Philip V, the first Bourbon king of Spain, invaded Aragon with his army and forced the signature of the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], making Spain into a more centralized state and forcing the use of Castilian language.

=== Under the Bourbon dynasty ===
During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] the advancing army of German, British and Dutch troops defeated the Spanish Army in the [[battle of Saragossa]] in 1710. As a result of the battle [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] was forced to abandon [[Madrid]], retreating to [[Valladolid]].

During the [[Peninsular War]], the Aragonese capital was the site of two fierce sieges. During the [[Siege of Saragossa (1808)|siege in 1808]], the Spanish under [[José de Palafox y Melzi, Duke of Saragossa|General Palafox]] defeated a superior French force. In 1809, during a particularly bloody [[Siege of Saragossa (1809)|siege]], the Spaniards were overwhelmed by superior enemy forces. Almost 30,000 of the garrison and citizens of Zaragoza (from a total of 32,000) perished rather than surrender the city. Two weeks after they breached the walls, the French were still forced to fight for each house, square, church and convent.

=== Modern history ===
During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Aragon saw the establishment of [[Anarchist Aragon|various anarchist communes]]. The particularly harsh winter of 1937 to 1938 saw the [[Battle of Teruel]], one of the most bloody of the war, which ended in a [[Nationalists (Spain)|Nationalist]] victory.<ref>[http://spanish-civil-war.org/teruel.shtml Major Battles of the Spanish Civil War<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1982 Aragon became an autonomous community within the new Spanish democratic state. In Summer 2008, the international exposition of [[Expo 2008]] was held in [[Zaragoza]].

==Symbols==
[[File:Plaza de Aragón en Zaragoza el día de San Jorge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The floral display of the [[Flag of Aragon]] in the [[Plaza de Aragón]], [[Zaragoza]], is an annual tradition on [[Aragon Day]] (23 April).]]
The current [[Coat of arms of Aragon]] was first documented in 1499. Its fourth quarter, the [[Coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon]], features on the [[Coat of Arms of Spain]], as well as the flags and heraldry of several territories in Spain and abroad which were ruled by the Crown of Aragon, such as [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Languedoc-Roussillon]]. The flag of modern Aragon, adopted in 1983, has the arms over the Crown arms.

The official Aragonese anthem is the ''[[Himno de Aragón]]'', with music composed by the Aragonese [[Antón García Abril]] and lyrics by various poets of the region. It is sung in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] with no official translation into [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] or [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

[[Aragon Day]] ({{lang-es|Día de Aragón}}, {{lang-an|Día Nacional d'Aragón}}, {{lang-ca|Diada Nacional d'Aragó}}) is celebrated on 23 April, [[St George's Day]], the patron of Aragon since the 15th century. The flag is made in flowers in the [[Plaza de Aragón]] in the capital, [[Zaragoza]].

==Culture==
{{See also|Music of Aragon}}
[[File:Jota aragonesa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jota (music)|Jota]] musicians and dancers.]]
Some medieval monuments of Teruel and Zaragoza are protected by [[UNESCO]] as part of the [[World Heritage Site]]s ''[[Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon]]''.

The traditional dance of Aragon is known as [[Jota (music)|jota]] and is one of the faster Spanish dances. It is also the most widespread in Aragon and the exact style and music depend on the area.

There are other less popular dances named "paloteaos" similar to the sword/stick dances of other regions.

The music to one local dance, "The Dance of Majordomos" of [[Benasque]], was so enjoyed by [[Rafael del Riego]] on a visit to the town that he ordered it to be copied resulting in the "Hymn of Riego" .

Typical Aragonese instruments include the stringed drum or "Chicotén", bagpipes such as the "gaita de boto", oboes such as the "Dulzaina", and small flutes like the "Chiflo". Some instruments have been lost, such as the "trompa de Ribagorza", although there have been efforts to reconstruct them. In contrast to other Pyrenean regions, the "Chicotén" and "Chiflo" never have stopped being played.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alberto Turón Lanuza |url=http://www.arafolk.net/instrumentos.php |title=El Web de la Música Tradicional Aragonesa |publisher=Arafolk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>

The Carnival of Bielsa<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnavaldebielsa.com/ |title=Carnabal de la Balle de Bielsa |publisher=Carnaval de Bielsa |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> ([[Huesca]]) has ancient origins and includes a group of men carrying long sticks, wearing skirts, cowbells and boucard/goat-like horns and skins with black-painted faces called "Trangas" symbolising "virility" who surround another man wearing skins playing the part of a bear called "l'onso". In Aragonese mythology the bear carried souls between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Trangas dance with young females named "madamas" symbolising "purity" and wearing colourful dresses. Other traditional figures include a horse rider named "Caballé".

=== Cuisine ===
{{main|Aragonese cuisine}}
[[File:Trenza (La Rosita).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Trenza de Almudevar]].]]
With its lush Pyrenean pastures, lamb, beef, and dairy products are, not surprisingly, predominant in [[Aragonese cuisine]]. Also of note is its ham from [[Teruel]]; olive oil from [[Empeltre]] and [[Arbequina]]; [[longaniza]] from [[Graus]]; rainbow trout and salmon, boar, [[truffle]]s and wild mushrooms from the upper river valleys of the [[Jacetania]], [[Gállego (river)|Gallego]], [[Sobrarbe]], and [[Ribagorza]] regions; and wines from [[Cariñena (DO)|Cariñena]], [[Somontano]], [[Calatayud (DO)|Calatayud]], and [[Campo de Borja (DO)|Campo de Borja]]; and fruit, especially peaches, from its fertile lower valleys. The region also features a unique local [[haggis]], known as [[chireta]], several interesting seafood dishes, including various crab pastes, which developed from an old superstition that crabs help prevent illness, and sweets such as "Adoquines del Pilar" and "Frutas de Aragón". There are also other sweets like "Tortas de alma" from [[Teruel]] and "[[Trenza de Almudevar]]" or "Castañas de Huesca" from [[Huesca]].

==Economy==
[[File:Torre del agua.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Water Tower (Zaragoza)|Torre de Agua]] was constructed for [[Expo 2008]] in Zaragoza, an event which boosted the local economy.]]
Aragon is among the richest autonomous regions in Spain, with GDP per capita above the nation's average. The traditional agriculture-based economy from the mid-20th century has been greatly transformed in the past several decades and now service and industrial sectors are the backbone of the economy in the region.

===Historic===
{{main|List of Aragonese monarchs|List of Aragonese consorts|List of viceroys of Aragon}}

Aragon in the Middle Ages was the hub of the wider [[Crown of Aragon]]. The Crown was represented in the region from 1517 by a [[viceroy]].

In 1479, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] married [[Isabella I of Castile]], a kingdom covering much of the rest of modern Spain. However, until the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] of 1707, Aragon maintained its own separate laws and institutions.

==Media==
Aragon has media set-ups in television, radio and numerous newspapers.

===Television===
On April 21, 2006, regional television broadcasts in Aragon officially began with the launch of [[Aragón TV]]. The law which established the CARTV (Aragon Corporation Radio and Television) dated from 1987, but various political disputes delayed the project for several legislatures.

During the years that Aragon had no public television, several media groups sought to supplement their absence. For one TVE-Aragon, taking the Territorial Centre in Zaragoza, produced several programs and educational activities with the Aragonese town. As for private groups, there were several projects. The most widely accepted for many years had been Antena Aragón, which came to be regarded as regional television. This channel was created in 1998 and disappeared in 2005 shortly after having to leave the Media Production Center (CPA),  as this was built by the DGA for future public television host Aragon. With the push for the creation of public television, Antena Aragón merged with RTVA (Radio Television Aragonesa) belonging to the Herald Group. Merging RTVA Antena Aragón and led to channel ZTV (Zaragoza Television). Moreover, Antena 3 Televisión aired for several years, and off to Aragon, a news report fully Aragonese, having a central issue in the Pinares de Venecia in Zaragoza, within the premises of the Theme Park of Zaragoza .

Aragón TV was launched in 2006 after spending a season broadcasting a letter and a loop with images of Aragonese villages and audio of regional radio programs.

===Radio===
Aragon Radio, began broadcasting  on 18 August 2005 at 5PM with the sound of drums and drums of Calanda and a group song Zaragoza "The Fish". Estimates of its audience range from 20,000 listeners, according to the latest EMG, to 70,000, according to private findings. The channel has regional news bulletins every hour from 7AM to midnight and coverage of sports.
