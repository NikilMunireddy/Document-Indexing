[[Image:American Hockey League alternate logo.svg|right|200px|thumb|The alternate logo of the AHL.]]
The '''American Hockey League''' ('''AHL''') is a 30-team [[professional]] [[ice hockey]] league based in the United States and Canada that serves as the primary [[Minor league#Ice hockey|developmental league]] for the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).<ref>{{Cite book|first=Jon C.|last=Scott|title=Hockey Night in Dixie: Minor Pro Hockey in the American South|year=2006|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company Ltd.|page=xvii|isbn=1-894974-21-2}}</ref> Since the [[2010–11 AHL season|2010–11 season]], every team in the league has an affiliation agreement with an NHL team; before then, one or two NHL teams would not have an AHL affiliate and so assigned players to AHL teams affiliated with other NHL teams. Twenty-seven AHL teams are located in the United States and the remaining three are in Canada. The league offices are located in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and its current president is [[David Andrews (ice hockey)|David Andrews]].

The annual playoff champion is awarded the [[Calder Cup]], named for [[Frank Calder]], the first President (1917–1943) of the NHL. The reigning champions are the [[Manchester Monarchs (AHL)|Manchester Monarchs]].

==History==

===Predecessor leagues===
The AHL traces its origins directly to two predecessor professional leagues: the [[Canadian-American Hockey League]] (the "Can-Am" League), founded in 1926, and the first [[International Hockey League (1929–36)|International Hockey League]], established in 1929. Although the Can-Am League never operated with more than six teams, the departure of the [[Boston Tigers (CAHL)|Boston Bruin Cubs]] after the 1935–36 season reduced it down to just four member clubs – [[Springfield Indians]], [[Philadelphia Ramblers]], [[Providence Reds]], and [[New Haven Eagles]] – for the first time in its history. At the same time, the then-rival IHL lost half of its eight members after the 1935–36 season, also leaving it with just four member teams: [[Buffalo Bisons (IHL)|Buffalo Bisons]], [[Syracuse Stars]], [[Pittsburgh Hornets]] and [[Cleveland Falcons]].

===1936–38===
With both leagues down to the bare minimum in membership, the governors of each recognized the need for action to assure their member clubs' long-term survival. Their solution was to play an interlocking schedule.  While the Can-Am was based in the Northeast and the IHL in the Great Lakes and Midwest, their footprints were close enough for this to be a viable option. The two older leagues' eight surviving clubs began joint play in November 1936 as a new two-division "circuit of mutual convenience" known as the '''International-American Hockey League'''.  The four Can-Am teams became the I-AHL East Division, with the IHL quartet playing as the West Division. The IHL also contributed its former championship trophy, the [[F. G. "Teddy" Oke Trophy]], which would go to the regular-season winners of the merged league's West Division until 1952. The Oke Trophy is now awarded to the regular-season winners of the AHL's Northeast Division.

A little more than a month into that first season, the balance and symmetry of the new combined circuit suffered a setback when its membership unexpectedly fell to seven teams. The West's Buffalo Bisons were forced to cease operations on December 6, 1936, after playing just 11 games, because of what proved to be insurmountable financial problems and lack of access to a suitable arena; the Bisons' original arena, [[Peace Bridge Arena]], had collapsed the previous season. (A new [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] would return in 1940 after [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium|a new arena]] was constructed for them.) The makeshift new I-AHL played out the rest of its first season (as well as all of the next) with just seven teams.

At the end of the 1936–37 season, a modified three-round playoff format was devised and a new championship trophy, the [[Calder Cup]], was established. The Syracuse Stars defeated the Philadelphia Ramblers in the final, three-games-to-one, to win the first-ever Calder Cup championship. The Calder Cup continues on today as the AHL's playoff championship trophy.

===Formal consolidation of the I-AHL===
[[File:"Hershey in Hockey League" (from The Philadelphia Record, 6-29-1938).jpg|thumb|left]]After two seasons of interlocking play, the governors of the two leagues' seven active teams met in New York City on June 28, 1938, and agreed that it was time to formally consolidate. [[Maurice Podoloff]] of New Haven, the former head of the Can-Am League, was elected the I-AHL's first president. The former IHL president, John Chick of [[Windsor, Ontario]], became vice-president in charge of officials.

The new I-AHL also added an eighth franchise at the 1938 meeting to fill the void in its membership left by the loss of Buffalo two years earlier with the admission of the then two-time defending [[Eastern Hockey League|Eastern Amateur Hockey League]] (EAHL) champion [[Hershey Bears]].<ref>[http://hockeyscoop.net/hpa/#clip "Hershey In Hockey League: Admitted to Circuit as American-International Loops Unite"] The Philadelphia ''Record'', June 29, 1938</ref> The Bears remain the only one of these eight original I-AHL/AHL franchises to have been represented in the league without interruption since the 1938–39 season. The newly merged circuit also increased its regular-season schedule for each team by six games from 48 to 54.

===Contraction, resurrection, and expansion===
After the 1939–40 season the I-AHL renamed itself the '''American Hockey League'''. It generally enjoyed both consistent success on the ice and relative financial stability over its first three decades of operation. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, the cost of doing business in professional ice hockey began to rise sharply with NHL expansion and relocation (a process which involved the placing of teams in Pittsburgh and Buffalo, forcing two long-time AHL clubs, the Pittsburgh Hornets and Buffalo Bisons, to fold) and especially the 1972 formation of the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA), which forced the relocation and subsequent folding of the [[Cleveland Barons (1937–73)|Cleveland Barons]], [[Baltimore Clippers]] and [[Quebec Aces]]. The number of major-league teams competing for players rose from six to thirty in just seven years. Player salaries at all levels shot up dramatically with the increased demand and competition for their services.

This did not seem to affect the AHL at first, as it expanded to 12 teams by 1970.  However, to help compensate for the rise in player salaries, many NHL clubs cut back on the number of players they kept under contract for development, and players under AHL contracts could now also demand much higher paychecks to remain with their clubs. As a result, half of the AHL's teams folded from 1974 to 1977. The league bottomed out in the summer of 1977 with news that the Rhode Island (formerly Providence) Reds – the last remaining uninterrupted franchise from the 1936–37 season, and the oldest continuously operating minor league franchise in North America – had decided to cease operations after 51 years in Rhode Island.

The AHL appeared in serious danger of folding altogether if this downward trend was not reversed. However, two events in the fall of 1977 helped reverse the trend. The first of these was the decision of the NHL's [[Philadelphia Flyers]] to return to the league as a team owner, and the second was the unexpected collapse of the [[North American Hockey League (1973–1977)|North American Hockey League]] just weeks before the start of the 1977–78 season.

The Flyers' new AHL franchise became the immediately successful [[Maine Mariners]], which brought the new AHL city of [[Portland, Maine]] both the regular-season and Calder Cup playoff titles in each of that club's first two seasons of operation. The folding of the NAHL, meanwhile, suddenly left two of its stronger teams, the  [[Philadelphia Firebirds (ice hockey)|Philadelphia Firebirds]] and [[Binghamton, New York]]-based [[Broome Dusters]], without a league to play in.  The owners of the Dusters solved their problem by buying the Reds franchise and moving it to Binghamton as the [[Binghamton Dusters]], while the Firebirds crossed over to the AHL from the NAHL. The Dusters and Firebirds, together with the [[Hampton Gulls]] (who had joined the league from the [[Southern Hockey League (1973–77)|Southern Hockey League]]), boosted the AHL to nine member clubs as the 1977–78 season opened. Hampton folded on February 10, 1978, but was replaced the next year by the [[New Brunswick Hawks]].  With franchise stability improving after the demise of the WHA in 1979, the league continued to grow steadily over the years, reaching 20 clubs by the 2000–01 season.

===Absorption of the IHL===
In 2001–02, the AHL's membership jumped dramatically to 27 teams, mostly by the absorption of six teams – [[Milwaukee Admirals|Milwaukee]], [[Chicago Wolves|Chicago]], [[Houston Aeros (1994–2013)|Houston]], [[Utah Grizzlies (1995–2005)|Utah]], [[Manitoba Moose|Manitoba]], and [[Grand Rapids Griffins|Grand Rapids]] – from the [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]].  The IHL had established itself as the second top-level minor league circuit in North America, but folded in 2001 due to financial problems. One oddity caused by the AHL's 2001 expansion was that the league had two teams with the same nickname: the Milwaukee Admirals and the [[Norfolk Admirals]]. The latter team transferred to the league from the mid-level [[ECHL]] in 2000. This situation lasted until the end of the 2014–15 season when the Norfolk team moved to San Diego and was replaced by another ECHL team with the same name.

The Utah Grizzlies suspended operations after the 2004–05 season (the franchise was sold in 2006 and returned to the ice in Cleveland in [[2007–08 AHL season|2007]] as the [[Lake Erie Monsters]]). The Chicago Wolves ([[2002 Calder Cup playoffs|2002]], [[2008 Calder Cup playoffs|2008]]), Houston Aeros ([[2003 Calder Cup playoffs|2003]]), Milwaukee Admirals ([[2004 Calder Cup playoffs|2004]]), and Grand Rapids Griffins ([[2013 Calder Cup playoffs|2013]]) have all won Calder Cup titles since joining the AHL from the IHL. Chicago and Milwaukee have also made multiple trips to the Calder Cup Finals, and Houston made their second Finals appearance in 2011.

The Manitoba Moose moved to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 2011 and were renamed the [[St. John's IceCaps]] after the NHL's [[Atlanta Thrashers]] moved to Winnipeg as the second incarnation of the [[Winnipeg Jets]]. In 2013, Houston moved to Des Moines, Iowa to become the [[Iowa Wild]]. This left Chicago, Grand Rapids and Milwaukee as the only ex-IHL teams still in their original cities until the 2015 relocations when the IceCaps moved back to Winnipeg as the Manitoba Moose.

===2015 relocations===
[[File:American Hockey League 2014-15 map zoomed.svg|right|thumb|400px|AHL team locations prior to 2015 realignment]]
Seven franchises moved for the [[2015–16 AHL season|2015–16 season]], representing nearly a quarter of the 30-team league, in an effort by NHL teams to make call-ups from the AHL more equitable by having closer affiliates.

In January 2015, the AHL announced the relocation of five existing AHL franchises to California as the basis for a new "Pacific Division".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=AHL |date=January 29, 2015 |title=AHL approves formation of Pacific Division |url=http://theahl.com/ahl-approves-formation-of-pacific-division-p196033}}</ref> The teams were all affiliated and owned by teams in the NHL's [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]].

* The [[Adirondack Flames]], affiliate of the [[Calgary Flames]], relocated to [[Stockton, California]] to become the [[Stockton Heat]]. The [[ECHL]] [[Stockton Thunder]] were purchased by [[Calgary Sports and Entertainment]] and relocated to [[Glens Falls, New York]], to become the ECHL [[Adirondack Thunder]].
* The [[Manchester Monarchs (AHL)|Manchester Monarchs]], affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Kings]], relocated to [[Ontario, California]], to become the AHL [[Ontario Reign (AHL)|Ontario Reign]]. The ECHL [[Ontario Reign (ECHL)|Ontario Reign]] relocated to [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], to become the ECHL [[Manchester Monarchs (ECHL)|Manchester Monarchs]]. The Monarchs won the Calder Cup in their final year in Manchester. 
* The [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]], affiliate of the [[Anaheim Ducks]], were purchased by the [[Henry Samueli|Ducks ownership]] and relocated to [[San Diego, California]] to become the [[San Diego Gulls]].
* The [[Oklahoma City Barons]], affiliate of the [[Edmonton Oilers]], relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] to become the AHL [[Bakersfield Condors (AHL)|Bakersfield Condors]], after the Oilers and Barons agreed to cease operations in Oklahoma City after the season. The ECHL [[Bakersfield Condors (1998–2015)|Bakersfield Condors]] relocated to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], to become the ECHL [[Norfolk Admirals (ECHL)|Norfolk Admirals]].
* The [[Worcester Sharks]], affiliate of the [[San Jose Sharks]], relocated to [[San Jose, California]] to become the [[San Jose Barracuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjbarracuda.com/news/detail/san-jose-sharks-unveil-american-hockey-league-franchise-as-san-jose-barracuda|title=Sharks, Barracuda Networks Agree to Revolutionary Multi-Year Presenting Partnership|publisher=San Jose Barracuda|date=April 2, 2015}}</ref>

In March 2015, the AHL announced two more relocations involving Canadian teams.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=AHL |date=March 12, 2015 |title=AHL announces franchise transactions |url=http://theahl.com/ahl-announces-franchise-transactions-p196769}}</ref>

* The original [[St. John's IceCaps]] franchise, affiliate of the [[Winnipeg Jets]], relocated to [[Winnipeg]] and resumed use of its former name, the [[Manitoba Moose]]. They had previously played in Winnipeg from 1996 to 2011 until being displaced by the Jets.
* The [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]], affiliate of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], were repurchased by [[Molson family|Canadiens' ownership]] and relocated to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], to become a new iteration of the IceCaps, to fulfill the IceCaps arena contract in St. John's.

==All-Star Game==
The American Hockey League first held an All-Star Game in the 1941–42 season. The event was not played again until the 1954–55 season, and was then held annually until the 1959–60 season. In the 1994–95 season, the AHL revived the events again, and has been played every season since. The skills competition was first introduced for the 1995–96 season. From 1996 to 2010, the game took place between a team of players born outside of Canada and a team of players born within Canada. The All-Star Game was replaced by an all-star challenge between the league's divisions from the 2015-16 season onward. The challenge consists of six nine-minute round-robin games between the league's divisions; the top two divisions in the challenge's round-robin phase advance to a six-minute championship game. The winning division of the championship game is declared the winner of the all-star challenge.

{{main|AHL Outdoor Classic}}
Since the 2009–10 season, at least one team in the AHL has hosted an [[list of outdoor ice hockey games|outdoor ice hockey game]] each year. The Syracuse Crunch was the first organization to put on an outdoor game in the AHL on February 20, 2010, building a rink at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse, New York, and packing a record 21,508 fans in for the [[Mirabito Outdoor Classic]] against the Binghamton Senators. The contest, which was also televised to an international audience on [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]], was won by the Crunch, 2–1.

The Connecticut Whale hosted the [[Whale Bowl]]—the AHL's second outdoor game—on February 19, 2011, as part of a 10-day Whalers Hockey Fest at [[Rentschler Field (stadium)|Rentschler Field]] in East Hartford, Conn. Attendance for Connecticut's game against the Providence Bruins was announced at 21,673, the largest in AHL history to that point. Providence won, 5–4, in a shootout.

On January 6, 2012, the largest crowd in AHL history saw the Adirondack Phantoms defeat the Hershey Bears, 4–3, in overtime before 45,653 fans at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the final event of the week-long activities associated with the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic]], which also included a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the [[New York Rangers]] on Jan 2 and an alumni game between retired players (including eight honored members of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]) of those two clubs on December 31, 2011. The contest was the third outdoor game in AHL history and it more than doubled the league's previous single-game attendance mark.

On January 21, 2012, the Steeltown Showdown between Ontario rivals the [[Toronto Marlies]] and [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]] was held at [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]] in Hamilton, Ont., with the Marlies winning 7–2 in front of 20,565 fans, the largest crowd ever for an AHL game in Canada. The AHL game was preceded the previous night by a game between [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]] alumni.

Two outdoor games were announced for the 2012–13 AHL season, but a meeting between the Grand Rapids Griffins and Toronto Marlies at [[Comerica Park]] in Detroit as part of the festivities surrounding the [[2013 NHL Winter Classic|NHL Winter Classic]] was not held because of the cancellation of the NHL Winter Classic. On January 20, 2013, the Hershey Bears and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins met outdoors at [[Hersheypark Stadium]] in Hershey, Pa. The Penguins earned a 2–1 overtime victory in front of 17,311 fans.

The [[Rochester Americans]] hosted an outdoor game in 2013–14, the [[Frozen Frontier]], which was held at [[Frontier Field]] in Rochester on December 13, 2013. The Americans took a 5–4 decision in a shootout against the Lake Erie Monsters before a standing-room crowd of 11,015 fans. A year after their originally scheduled date, the Griffins and Marlies played at Comerica Park on December 30, 2013, and Toronto prevailed in a shootout, 4–3, becoming the first AHL team ever with two outdoor wins. Attendance in Detroit was 20,337.

On December 18, 2015, the [[Stockton Heat]] hosted the [[Bakersfield Condors (AHL)|Bakersfield Condors]] in an outdoor game called the Golden State Hockey Rush at [[Raley Field]] in [[West Sacramento, California]]. Stockton defeated Bakersfield 3–2 in front of 9,357 fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stocktonheat.com/news/grant-kylington-and-shore-lead-heat-to-3-2-win-at-raley-field/ |title=Grant, Kylington and Shore Lead Heat to 3-2 Win at Raley Field |publisher=Stockton Heat |date=December 19, 2015 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}</ref>
