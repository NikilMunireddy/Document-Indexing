The '''Hungaroring''' is a motor-racing circuit in [[Mogyoród]], [[Hungary]] where the [[Formula One]] [[Hungarian Grand Prix]] is held. In 1986,<ref name="CNN">{{cite news|title=Hungarian Grand Prix|work=[[CNN]]|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2007/formula1/circuits/#Hungarian|accessdate=24 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224173330/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2007/formula1/circuits/#Hungarian <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 24 December 2007}}</ref> it became the location of the first Formula One [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. [[Bernie Ecclestone]] wanted a race in the [[USSR]], but a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] friend recommended [[Budapest]].

According to a survey put together by the national tourism office of Hungary, Mogyoród ranks third among Hungarian destinations visited by tourists, behind the [[Danube Bend]] area and [[Lake Balaton]], but ahead of Budapest.<ref name="AmCham">{{cite news|title=Formula one races draw in fewer fans in Europe|work=American Chamber of Commerce in Hungary|url=http://www.amcham.hu/BusinessHungary/17-08/articles/17-08_42.asp|accessdate=2 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302015731/http://www.amcham.hu/businesshungary/17-08/articles/17-08_42.asp |archivedate=2 March 2006 }}</ref> The circuit has [[FIA]] Grade 1 license.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/tableaulicencescircuit.pdf|title=LIST OF FIA LICENSED CIRCUITS|date=6 February 2015|publisher=[[FIA]]|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref>

==Description==
The Grand Prix is held in the middle of summer, which is usually very hot and dry in this region. Its first wet Grand Prix race was in 2006. The circuit is normally dusty due to underuse throughout the rest of the year and its sandy soil. As the circuit is in a valley about 80 percent of it can be seen from any point.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome|work=Hungaroring Sport Plc.|url=http://hungaroring.hu/|accessdate=25 February 2008}}</ref>

Normally, an underused circuit becomes faster over the weekend as the track surface gathers more rubber residue; however, with the Hungaroring this generally does not happen, because the track can get dusty so quickly. The track frequently becomes faster during a qualifying session, which leads competitors to try for their best lap as late as possible.

The twisty and bumpy nature of the circuit<ref>{{cite news|title=Formula One: Think it's a joyride? Try some laps on Hungary's course|work=[[International Herald Tribune]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/08/17/prix_ed3_.php|date=17 August 2002|accessdate=27 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604235359/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/17/sports/17iht-prix_ed3_.html |archivedate=27 February 2008}}</ref> makes overtaking very difficult in dry conditions. Nonetheless, the Hungaroring has been the scene of several memorable races such as the duels of [[Nelson Piquet]] and [[Ayrton Senna]], [[Nigel Mansell]]'s lost wheel in 1987, Mansell's win from 12th on the grid after a dramatic pass on [[Ayrton Senna]] in 1989, [[Damon Hill]]'s almost victory with [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] in 1997, [[Michael Schumacher]]'s change in strategy to beat the McLarens of Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard in 1998 and maiden wins for Hill in 1993, [[Fernando Alonso]] in 2003, [[Jenson Button]] in 2006 in the track's first ever wet Grand Prix,<ref>{{cite web|title=A history of the Hungarian Grand Prix|work=ESPN F1|publisher=ESPN EMEA Ltd.|url=http://en.espnf1.com/hungary/motorsport/page/2607.html|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> [[Heikki Kovalainen]] in 2008, and the second win for [[Daniel Ricciardo]] in 2014, overtaking the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] of [[Lewis Hamilton]] and [[Fernando Alonso|Alonso]]'s [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] using very degraded soft tyres in the penultimate lap, grabbing an amazing win.

==Drivers==
Hungaroring has crowned two drivers in its 20-year history: both [[Nigel Mansell]] in 1992 and [[Michael Schumacher]] in 2001 were able to win the World Championship title. Moreover, the [[WilliamsF1]] Team and [[Scuderia Ferrari]] also secured the Constructors' Championship at the Hungaroring, respectively in 1996 and 2004.

Both [[Hungary]]'s [[Zsolt Baumgartner]] and [[Poland]]'s [[Robert Kubica]] made their debut on this track as the first F1 drivers of their countries.

The [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix]] was the first wet grand prix at the Hungaroring. This saw the retirement of many drivers including championship rivals [[Fernando Alonso]] and Michael Schumacher and gave [[Jenson Button]] and the reborn [[Honda F1]] team their first win. Fernando Alonso also earned his first Grand Prix victory at this in 2003, declaring it his favourite track as a result.

According to statements and interviews, drivers have different opinions on the track. While many, like [[Ayrton Senna]], Nigel Mansell, Michael Schumacher, [[Lewis Hamilton]], and Fernando Alonso claimed to love it, many others consider the track too slow, hot and demanding{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.
The technical driving center of the Hungaroring held former racer [[Gerhard Berger]]'s name from 1998 until 2005 but later it was changed to [[Allianz]].

The track also has named curves: Turn 4 is named after [[Nigel Mansell]], due to him losing a wheel there during the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix. Turn 11 is named after [[Jean Alesi]] following his massive crash there during qualifying for the 1995 Hungarian Grand Prix.

On Saturday, 25 July 2009, in the second qualifying round for the Hungarian Grand Prix at Hungaroring, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Felipe Massa]]'s head was injured, though protected by his driver's helmet, he was struck by a suspension spring that had fallen from [[Rubens Barrichello]]'s Brawn GP car while driving at high-speed. He was knocked unconscious, and subsequently crashed head-on into a tyre barrier. Massa was thereafter airlifted to the ÁEK hospital in Budapest, where he underwent surgery in the area surrounding his left eye. His condition was initially described as "life-threatening but stable", but improved rapidly. Massa was discharged from hospital the following week and returned to Brazil. After further tests it was decided that Massa needed a titanium plate inserted into his skull to strengthen it for racing in Formula One again.

==Fans==
While most of the foreign fans are from [[Germany]]<ref name="AmCham"/> and [[Austria]], the Hungaroring has traditionally seen a large influx of [[Finland|Finnish]] fans as well. With the loss of the [[Austrian Grand Prix]] in 2003, this became the closest [[Formula One]] event for fans from other [[Central Europe]]an countries. However, the Austrian Grand Prix returned again in 2014. The 2006 race saw many spectators from [[Poland]] due to the debut of their first Formula One driver, [[Robert Kubica]].

Some say that the Hungaroring is similar in style to [[Circuit de Monaco]], due to its tight and twisty corners. The first change in the track's layout was carried out in 1989, when the chicane after the actual turn three (a temporary measure put in during construction due to the discovery of a spring where the direct route was due to run) was removed by culverting the stream. In 2003, the main straight (turn one, see diagram) was lengthened by roughly {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the hairpin at the end of the straight was also tightened in an attempt to facilitate more overtaking opportunities, as well as a tightening of what was turn 13.

The contract was prolonged until 2021,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/UK_MOTORSPORT/idUKL310055920080803|title=Motor racing-Hungarian GP gets extension to 2016|last=Ledsom |first=Mark|author2=Ken Ferris|date=3 August 2008|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref> although tobacco advertising has been banned since 2007.

The Hungaroring is the home of Hungarian [[motorsport]]. Besides Formula One, it has also hosted the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] and [[FIA GT Championship]] races. In 2011, it hosted the inaugural [[FIA WTCC Race of Hungary]]. A public drag race event takes place every month.
