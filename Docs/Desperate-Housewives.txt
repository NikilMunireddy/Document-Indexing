'''''Desperate Housewives''''' is an [[United States|American]] television [[comedy-drama]] and [[mystery fiction|mystery]] series created by [[Marc Cherry]] and produced by [[ABC Studios]] and [[Marc Cherry|Cherry Productions]]. It originally aired for eight seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from October 3, 2004 to May 13, 2012. [[Executive producer]] Cherry served as [[showrunner]]. Other executive producers since the fourth season included [[Bob Daily]], [[George W. Perkins (television producer)|George W. Perkins]], [[John Pardee]], [[Joey Murphy]], [[David Grossman (director)|David Grossman]], and [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]].

Set on [[Wisteria Lane]], a street in the fictional town of Fairview in the fictional Eagle State, ''Desperate Housewives'' followed the lives of a group of women as seen through the eyes of their late friend and neighbor who committed suicide in the pilot episode. The storyline covers thirteen years of the women's lives over eight seasons, set between the years 2004–2008, and later 2013–2017 (the story arc included a 5-year passage of time, as well as flashbacks ranging from the 1980s to the 2020s). They worked through domestic struggles and family life, while facing the secrets, crimes and mysteries hidden behind the doors of their — at the surface — beautiful and seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood.

The series featured an [[ensemble cast]], headed by [[Teri Hatcher]] as [[Susan Mayer]], [[Felicity Huffman]] as [[Lynette Scavo]], [[Marcia Cross]] as [[Bree Van de Kamp]], and [[Eva Longoria]] as [[Gabrielle Solis]]. [[Brenda Strong]] narrated the series as the late [[Mary Alice Young]], appearing sporadically in flashbacks or dream sequences.<ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/desperate-housewives/cast/ |title=Desperate Housewives Cast & Crew |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref>

''Desperate Housewives'' was well received by viewers and critics alike. It won multiple [[Primetime Emmy Award|Primetime Emmy]], [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s. From the [[2004–2005 United States network television schedule|2004–05]] through the [[2008–2009 United States network television schedule|2008–09]] television seasons, its first five seasons were rated amongst the top ten most watched series.<ref>http://www.spottedratings.com/2010/07/war-of-18-49-desperate-housewives.html</ref> In 2007, it was reported to be the most popular show in its demographic worldwide, with an audience of approximately 120 million<ref>{{cite news|title=Desperate Housewives On SABC3 Confirmed|url=http://www.tvsa.co.za/default.asp?blogname=news&articleID=4566|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=TVSA|date=April 3, 2007}}</ref> and was also reported that the series is the third most watched television series in a study of ratings in 20 countries.<ref>{{cite news|title=CSI show 'most popular in world'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5231334.stm|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=July 31, 2006}}</ref> In 2012, it remained as the most-watched comedy series internationally based on data from Eurodata TV Worldwide, which measured ratings across five continents;<ref>{{cite news|title=Most-Watched TV Show In The World Is 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/14/most-watched-tv-show-in-the-world-csi_n_1597968.html|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=June 14, 2012}}</ref> it has held this position since 2006.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000446/2006 Monte-Carlo TV Festival (2006)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Moreover, it was the third-highest revenue earning series for 2010, with US$2.74 million per half hour.<ref>{{cite news|title="American Idol" king of TV advertising revenue|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/17/us-moneymakers-idUSTRE72G9FB20110317|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=March 17, 2011}}</ref> The show placed #56 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} "New TV Classics" list.<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Classics: TV|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=26 October 2013|date=June 17, 2008}}</ref>

By the end of the series, it had surpassed ''[[Charmed]]'' as the [[List of longest-running TV shows by category|longest running hour-long television series featuring all female leads]] by two episodes. 

==Production==
The idea for the series was conceived as [[Marc Cherry]] and his mother were watching a news report on [[Andrea Yates]].<ref name="Bill Carter 2006, p. 161-162">Bill Carter, ''Desperate Networks''. New York: Doubleday, 2006. p. 161-162</ref> Prior to ''Desperate Housewives'', Cherry was best known for producing and writing episodes of [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]]'s hit comedy series ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and its successor, ''[[The Golden Palace]]''. In addition, he had created or co-created three sitcoms: ''[[The 5 Mrs. Buchanans]]'', ''[[The Crew (TV series)|The Crew]]'' and ''[[Some of My Best Friends]]'', none of which lasted longer than a year. Cherry had difficulty in getting any [[television network]] interested in his new series; [[HBO]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], and [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] all turned the show down.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDougall|first=Charles|title=Desperately seeking a ratings hit|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3634415/Desperately-seeking-a-ratings-hit.html|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=January 5, 2005}}</ref> Finally, two new executives at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Lloyd Braun]] and Susan Lyne, chose to greenlight it,<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC exec helps 'Desperate' network find its footing|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2006/02/22/tel_58689.shtml|accessdate=October 26, 2013|newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|date=February 22, 2006|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> reportedly after ''[[The O.C.]]'' on Fox premiered in 2003 and showed that a soap opera could succeed in prime time.<ref name="gopalan20130805">{{cite web|last=Gopalan|first=Nisha|title=Josh Schwartz on The O.C., Casting George Lucas, and the Onslaught of Emo|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/josh-schwartz-the-oc-anniversary-interview.html|work=Vulture|accessdate=September 20, 2013|date=August 5, 2013}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Disney had both Braun and Lyne fired, following their approval of another new drama series: ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Craig|first=Olga|title=The man who discovered 'Lost' – and found himself out of a job|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1496199/The-man-who-discovered-Lost-and-found-himself-out-of-a-job.html|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=August 14, 2005}}</ref>

The ABC executives were not initially satisfied with the name of the new show, suggesting ''Wisteria Lane'' and ''The Secret Lives of Housewives'' instead.<ref>"Desperate Housewives – The Complete First Season" DVD</ref><ref name="Bill Carter 2006, p. 203">Bill Carter, ''Desperate Networks''. New York: Doubleday, 2006. p. 203</ref>  However, on October 23, 2003, ''Desperate Housewives'' was announced by ABC, presented as a prime time soap opera created by [[Charles Pratt, Jr.]] of ''[[Melrose Place]]'' fame, and Marc Cherry, who declared the new show to be a mix of ''[[Knots Landing]]'' and ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' with a little bit of ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Development Update: October 23|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=6211|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=The Futon Critic|date=October 23, 2003}}</ref> While Cherry continued his work on the show, Pratt was credited as executive producer for the pilot episode only, remaining linked to the show as a consulting producer during the first two seasons.

On May 18, 2004, ABC announced the 2004–2005 lineup, with ''Desperate Housewives'' in the Sunday at 9:00–10:00&nbsp;p.m. ET slot,<ref name="thefutoncritic.com">{{cite news|title=2004 Broadcast Upfront Presentations: Abc, Part 1|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=6591|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=The Futon Critic|date=May 18, 2004}}</ref> which it held all through the run of the show. After only three episodes, on October 20, 2004, ABC announced that ''Desperate Housewives'', along with ''Lost'', had been picked up for a full season.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC Orders Back Nine of Two Top-10 Series; 'Desperate Housewives' and 'Lost' Get Full Season Pick-Ups|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20041020abc03|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=The Futon Critic|date=October 20, 2004}}</ref> A couple of weeks later after Housewives premiered the owners of NBC called to see who had passed on the series due to its ratings success.

''Desperate Housewives'' was produced by creator Marc Cherry (Cherry Productions), Austin Bagley and, since 2007, ABC Studios. From 2004 to 2007, ''Desperate Housewives'' was produced in association with Touchstone Television.

===Production crew===
Cherry, [[Tom Spezialy]] and [[Michael Edelstein]] served as [[executive producer]]s for the first two seasons on the show. Spezialy, who also served as a staff writer, left his previous position as writer and executive producer for ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' to join the crew on ''Desperate Housewives''. He had also worked as writer and co-executive producer on several shows, among them ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'', ''[[Jack & Jill (TV series)|Jack and Jill]]'', and ''[[Parker Lewis Can't Lose]]'', while Edelstein had been the executive producer of ''[[Threat Matrix]]'' and ''[[Hope & Faith]]''.

Second season conflicts arose among the executive producers. Subsequent to this, Edelstein left the show mid-season, and by the season's end, so did Spezialy.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Keck|first=William|title=Wisteria Lane's new landscape|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-05-18-housewives-main_x.htm|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=May 19, 2006}}</ref> For the third year, Cherry was joined by award-winning writer and producer [[Joe Keenan (writer)|Joe Keenan]]—of ''[[Frasier]]'' fame—and [[television film|television movie]] producer [[George W. Perkins (television producer)|George W. Perkins]], who had been a crew member of ''Desperate Housewives'' since the show's conception. Although receiving praise for his work on the show, Keenan chose to leave ''Desperate Housewives'' after one season to pursue other projects.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Michael|last2=Adalian|first2=Josef|title=Keenan not 'Desperate' any more|url=http://variety.com/2007/scene/news/keenan-not-desperate-any-more-1117962170/|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 29, 2007}}</ref> Replacing him as executive producer for the fourth season of the show was [[Bob Daily]], who had joined the crew as a writer and co-executive producer during the third season. Daily's previous work include writing for the [[animated]] series ''[[Rugrats]]'', as for ''Frasier''. Also joining Cherry, Perkins and Daily for the fourth season were [[John Pardee]] and [[Joey Murphy]], who had been with the series since the beginning.<ref>{{cite news|title=Development Update: Week of June 11–15|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7408|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=The Futon Critic|date=June 15, 2007}}</ref> Both had also worked on Cherry's previous show ''The Crew'' in 1995, as well as on the sitcom ''[[Cybill]]''.

In the first four seasons, [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]] and [[David Grossman (director)|David Grossman]] have been the most prolific directors, together directing more than half of the episodes.

===Filming===

''Desperate Housewives'' was filmed on [[Panavision]] [[35 mm film|35 mm]] cameras (except for the final season, which was shot digitally on the [[Arri Alexa]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Alexa meets Desperate Housewives|url=http://www.arri.com/news.html?article=901&cHash=1d726ec56efa76d0fee65c097ccc2a7e|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=Arri Group}}</ref> It was broadcast in [[SDTV|standard]] and [[widescreen television|16:9 widescreen]] [[high-definition television|high definition]], though it was framed for the [[4:3]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]<ref name="asc">{{cite journal|last=Feld|first=Rob|author2=Oppenheimer, Jean |author3=Stasukevich, Ian |date=March 2008|title=Tantalizing Television|url=http://www.theasc.com/ac_magazine/March2008/Television/page2.php|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=89|issue=3|format=}}</ref> until the final season.

The set for [[Wisteria Lane]], consisting mainly of facades but also of some proper houses, was located on the [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] back lot. It was referred to by film crews as ''[[Colonial Street]]'', and has been used for several motion pictures and television shows since the mid-1940s.<ref name="StreetHistory">{{cite web|title=Colonial Street – History|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/street_colonial_history.shtml|work=The studiotour.com|publisher=Universal Studios Hollywood|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Notable productions that were filmed here include: ''[[So Goes My Love]]'', ''[[Leave It to Beaver (film)|Leave it to Beaver]]'', ''[[The 'Burbs]]'', ''[[Providence (TV series)|Providence]]'', ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'', ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'', ''[[Gremlins]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.<ref name="StreetHistory"/> For the second season of ''Desperate Housewives'', the street went through some heavy changes. Among the most noticeable of these changes was the removal of a church facade and a mansion in order to make room for Edie's house and a park.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colonial Street – Church|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/colonialstreet_church.php|work=The studiotour.com|publisher=Universal Studios Hollywood|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Colonial Street – Colonial Mansion|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/colonialstreet_mansion.php|work=The studiotour.com|publisher=Universal Studios Hollywood|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>

Interior sets were built on sound stages at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], some of which were duplicated in some form on the Wisteria Lane back lot for filming when conditions required it.<ref name="Wolf2013">{{cite book|author=R.

Filming for the series ended April 26, 2012.

===Opening sequence===
The initial idea for the show opening sequence was Cherry's. After asking sixteen companies to come up with suggestions for how best to realize it, the producers finally hired [[Hollywood]]-based yU+co to provide the final version.<ref>{{cite news|title=yU + co Opens ABCs Desperate Housewives|url=http://www.digitalproducer.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=29118|accessdate=October 10, 2013|newspaper=Digital Producer|date=November 12, 2004}}</ref> According to the yU+co's official website, the idea behind the sequence is, "to evoke the show's quirky spirit and playful flouting of women's traditional role in society."<ref>{{cite web|title=Desperate Houswives|url=http://www.yuco.com/projects/desperate-housewives|work=yU+co|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref> The images featured are taken from eight pieces of art, portraying domesticity and male-female relations through the ages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phelan|first=Joseph|title=Missing the Picture: Desperate Housewives Do Art History|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/feature-2005-05.html|work=[[ArtCyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 20, 2013|date=May 2005}}</ref>

The music for the opening is composed by [[Danny Elfman]], and has been awarded both a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI TV Music Award]].<ref>{{cite news|title=BMI Film & Television Awards Tout Composers of Year's Top Film, Television, & Cable Music|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/bmi_film_television_awards_tout_composers_of_years_top_film_television_cabl|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=BMI|date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> In 2005 it was included on the album ''[[Music from and Inspired by Desperate Housewives]]''. When an episode runs long, only the first sequence (the falling apple) is kept. From the episode "[[Now You Know (Desperate Housewives)|Now You Know]]" onwards, only the main chorus of the theme is heard, which is the falling apple scene, and the photograph of the four lead actresses, crediting [[Marc Cherry]] as creator.

===Music===
In addition to the theme composed by Danny Elfman, the series underscore music, composed by [[Steve Jablonsky]] since the second episode of the first season, defines the overall sound of the show by creating a musical counterpoint to the writing style. The score is electronic-based, but every [[sound recording and reproduction|scoring session]] incorporates a live string ensemble. Jablonsky incorporates recurring themes for events and characters into the score.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0558699/ "Desperate Housewives" Ah, But Underneath (2004)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Hollywood Records]] produced the first soundtrack album, ''Music from and Inspired by Desperate Housewives'' distributed by [[Universal Records]]. Several of those songs have been used in subsequent seasons.

''Housewives''{{'}}s unique style combined with the heavy dialogue and a quick-fire writing style limits the amount of [[popular music]] used within the series. The series' [[music supervisor]], [[David Sibley (music supervisor)|David Sibley]], works closely with the producers to integrate these musical needs into the show. In addition to featured performances by central characters such as Susan Mayer singing along with [[Rose Royce]]'s "[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]" and Lynette's rendition of "[[Boogie Shoes]]", several characters have been accomplished musicians, such as Betty Applewhite (a concert [[pianist]]) and Dylan Mayfair (a [[child prodigy|prodigy]] [[cellist]]).

===Later seasons===
In August 2009, Marc Cherry said that ''Desperate Housewives'' would be on television for a few more years, stating that the series still "has a lot of life left in it." He told ''The Wrap'': {{quotation|Steve McPherson (ABC Entertainment president) and I agree that we shouldn't keep the show going for more than a couple [of] years past my seven-year initial contract. We don't want it to just fade away. We've been in negotiations. I expect to sign my new deal soon to set up a future scenario for the show. Someone else will run the show after season seven and I will serve as executive producer from a distance.}} He went on to explain that he felt the program had been revitalized by the five-year leap forward for season five, saying: "Yes, I think it worked well. It was a way to start fresh and let everyone start from scratch in a way".<ref name=years>{{cite news|last=Parks|first=Tim|title=Cherry: 'Housewives could be on for years'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/ustv/s21/desperate-housewives/news/a173530/cherry-housewives-could-be-on-for-years.html|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=August 25, 2009}}</ref>

The [[Desperate Housewives (season 2)|second season]] premiered on September 25, 2005 and its central mystery is that of new neighbor [[Betty Applewhite]] ([[Alfre Woodard]]), who moved onto Wisteria Lane in the middle of the night. Throughout the season, Bree tries to cope with being a widow, unknowingly begins dating the man who poisoned her husband, fights alcoholism, and is unable to prevent the gap between her and her son [[Andrew Van de Kamp]] ([[Shawn Pyfrom]]) from growing to extremes. Susan's love life becomes even more complicated as her ex-husband [[Karl Mayer]] ([[Richard Burgi]]) is engaged to Edie and is also started to incline towards Susan. Lynette goes back to her career in advertising while her husband [[Tom Scavo]] ([[Doug Savant]]) becomes a stay-at-home father, and Gabrielle decides to be faithful to Carlos, and begins preparations to have a child.

The [[Desperate Housewives (season 3)|third season]] premiered on September 24, 2006. In the third season, Bree marries [[Orson Hodge]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), whose past and involvement with a recently discovered dead body becomes the main mystery of the season. Meanwhile, Lynette has to adjust to the arrival of Tom's previously unknown daughter to the home. The Scavos also experience tension as Tom wants to start a pizzeria. Gabrielle goes through a rough divorce, but finally finds new love in Fairview's new mayor. After being run over by Orson in the [[Remember (Desperate Housewives)|previous season finale]], Mike falls into coma and suffers from amnesia when he wakes up. Edie sees her chance to make her move on Mike, and her family relations are explored throughout the season. Susan loses hope that Mike's memory will return and in the process moves on to a handsome Englishman whose wife is also in a coma, while her daughter [[Julie Mayer (Desperate Housewives)|Julie Mayer]] ([[Andrea Bowen]]) starts dating Edie's nephew. Elderly neighbor [[Karen McCluskey]] ([[Kathryn Joosten]]) hides something in her freezer. A shooting at the local grocery store leaves two characters dead and changes everyone's lives forever.

A gay couple from Chicago – [[Lee McDermott]] ([[Kevin Rahm]]) and [[Bob Hunter (Desperate Housewives)|Bob Hunter]] ([[Tuc Watkins]]) – become residents of Wisteria Lane. A tornado threatens to destroy everything, and everyone, that the housewives hold dear. In the closing minute the characters and their story have flashed forward by five years.

The [[Desperate Housewives (season 8)|eighth and final season]] premiered on Sunday, September 25, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nededog|first=Jethro|title='Desperate Housewives' Season 8 Premiere: The Ladies Keep a Killer Secret|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/desperate-housewives-season-8-premiere-240019|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> The main mystery of the season is the death of Gabrielle's perverted stepfather [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Alejandro Perez|Alejandro Perez]] ([[Tony Plana]]) at Carlos' hands, and its cover-up by the four housewives, which occurred in the [[Come on Over for Dinner|previous season finale]]. After the murder, Bree receives a blackmail letter from an unknown person similar to the one Mary Alice had received in the 1st season. Due to her relationship with detective [[Chuck Vance]] ([[Jonathan Cake]]), Bree becomes the main character affected by the cover-up of Alejandro's murder, and is eventually accused of killing Alejandro herself. A new neighbor, [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Ben Faulkner|Ben Faulkner]] ([[Charles Mesure]]), moves into the lane, attracting Renee along the way. Ben is going through severe financial problems, and resorts to a dangerous and unruly loan shark to bail him out. Mike meddles in the business of Ben's loan shark in an attempt to protect Renee, but he pays the ultimate price. During the first half of the season, Susan struggles with the guilt of her involvement in the Alejandro case, and during the second half, she tries to deal with both Julie's unexpected pregnancy and Mike's death. Following the cover-up of Alejandro's murder, Carlos develops an alcohol problem, but Gabrielle persuades him to recover in rehab, which eventually results in Gabrielle and Carlos switching house roles. Tom moves out of the family home, and Lynette struggles to come to terms with how quickly Tom seems to have moved on, until she accepts that she is still in love with him, and decides she will try to win him back. Mrs. McCluskey receives worrying news about her health and decides to end it all, but Bree manages to convince her otherwise.

The two-hour series finale, which aired on Sunday, May 13, 2012, featured the conclusion of Bree's court case. To bring the series to a conclusion, there was a wedding, a birth, and a death, and the future of the four main housewives was revealed.

===Main cast===
{{See also|List of Desperate Housewives cast members|List of Desperate Housewives characters}}
During its premiere season the show featured thirteen starring actors, all credited in the [[Title sequence|opening sequence]]. For the show's second year, several actors, mainly [[child actor|child]] and teenage ones, who had guest starred during the first season, were promoted to series regulars without having their names included in the opening sequence. Instead they were billed as "also starring" during the first minutes of each episode, together with episode guest stars. This practice continued for season three, four and five.

===Premiere year===
The show was the biggest success of the 2004–2005 television season, being well received by both critics and viewers. The pilot episode had 21.3 million viewers making it the best new drama for the year, the highest rated show of the week, and the best performance by a pilot for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], since ''[[Spin City]]'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jaffer|first=Murtz|title='Housewives' Premiere Cleans Up for ABC|url=http://insidepulse.com/2004/10/04/21768/|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=Inside Pulse|date=October 4, 2004}}</ref>

Along with ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''Desperate Housewives'' was credited to have turned around ABC's declining fortunes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bianco|first=Robert|title=A good season, with reason|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-04-26-tv-lookback_x.htm|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 26, 2005}}</ref> Many critics agreed with Cherry's initial comparison to the popular [[black comedy]] film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Danger|first=Nick|title=TV Review: "Desperate Housewives"|url=http://blogcritics.org/tv-review-desperate-housewives/|work=[[Blogcritics]]|accessdate=October 10, 2013|date=October 4, 2004}}</ref> while its themes and appeal to female viewers were compared to those of the award winning TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland|first=Melanie|title=Timely 'Desperate Housewives' is life after 'Sex and the City'|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/Timely-Desperate-Housewives-is-life-after-Sex-1155516.php|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=September 20, 2013|date=September 30, 2004}}</ref> and its mysteries were said to resemble those of [[David Lynch]]'s classic TV series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schmeiser|first=Lisa|title=Fall '04: "Desperate Housewives"|url=http://www.teevee.org/2004/10/fall-04-desperate-housewives.html|work=TeeVee.org|accessdate=September 20, 2013|date=October 5, 2004}}</ref> In its first review, ''[[USA Today]]'' proclaimed the show to be "refreshingly original, bracingly adult and thoroughly delightful" and naming it to be "sort of ''Knots Landing'' meets ''The Golden Girls'' by way of ''Twin Peaks''".<ref>{{cite news|last=Bianco|first=Robert|title='Housewives' has the recipe for a bubbly evening soap|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2004-09-30-desperate-housewives_x.htm|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 30, 2004}}</ref>

Following the initial success of the show, the term "desperate housewives" became a cultural phenomenon. This warranted "real-life desperate housewives" features in TV shows, including ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|The Dr. Phil Show]]'',<ref>[http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/425 Dr. Phil – The Real Lives of Desperate Housewives], Retrieved August 5, 2007</ref> and in magazines.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Real Desperate Housewives|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-real-desperate-housewives-1069770|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|date=July 1, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Blackwell|first=Elizabeth|title=Confessions of Real-Life Desperate Housewives|url=http://www.lhj.com/relationships/divorce/communication/confessions-of-real-life-desperate-housewives/|work=[[Ladies' Home Journal]]|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref> Among the more prominent names to declare themselves fans of the show were [[Oprah Winfrey]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Brioux|first=Bill|title=Oprah pays a visit to 'Housewives'|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/D/Desperate_Housewives/2005/02/02/917437.html|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=[[Canoe.ca]]|date=February 2, 2005}}</ref> who also dedicated an episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to her visit at the film set; and the former [[First Lady of the United States]], [[Laura Bush]], who, in a comedic speech during a dinner with [[White House Correspondents' Association]] on April 30, 2005, stated, "Ladies and gentlemen, I am a desperate housewife", referring to the show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laura Bush: First lady of comedy?|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-05-01-laura-bush-comments_x.htm|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 1, 2005}}</ref>

===Later years===
For its second year, the show still maintained its ratings – with 22.2 million viewers, it reclaimed its position as the number four most watched show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002576393 |publisher=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' |date=May 26, 2006 |title=2005–06 primetime wrap |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060529003429/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com:80/thr/television/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002576393 |archivedate=May 29, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=Mob Boss Takes Hit; Housewife Implicated|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/arts/television/15sopr.html?_r=0|accessdate=October 26, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 15, 2006}}</ref> The second season's premiere was watched by 28.4 million viewers.<ref name="premiereratings">[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20050927abc02 Primetime Ratings for the Week of September 19-25, 2005], ''The Futon Critic'', September 27, 2005, Retrieved November 13, 2009</ref> The episode drew in the second largest audience for the series in its history.

He now stated that he was back full-time, claiming that both he and the writing staff had learned from their mistakes.<ref>Martin, Ed: [http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2007/01/25/jmer-01-25-07/#continue Exclusive Interview!

The critics generally agreed on the improved quality for the third year,<ref>{{cite news|title=Report: ABC's 'Desperate Housewives' back on track for third season|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-abc-desperate-housewives-back-on-track-for-third-season-1009802.php|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=Reality TV World|date=September 12, 2006}}</ref><ref>Martin, Ed: [http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2006/09/14/jmer-09-14-06/ Sizzling Preview of Desperate Housewives], ''Jack Myers Media Village'', September 14, 2006 {{wayback|url=http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2006/09/14/jmer-09-14-06/ |date=20061019005810 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Taroli|first=Justin|title=The Third Time Isn't Always the Charm for TV Hits|url=http://departments.kings.edu/crown/articles/071116/tvshows.html|work=The Crown Online|publisher=King's College|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref> but the overall ratings fell notably from previous seasons. Due to complications from her pregnancy Marcia Cross was put on bed rest. After filming one episode from her own personal bedroom she was forced to take maternity leave with eight episodes of season three still remaining. It was predicted that the ratings would be down by over 25% since the premiere year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Joal|title=Housewives' Most Desperate Hour|url=http://au.eonline.com/news/54858/housewives-most-desperate-hour|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=E! Online|date=April 10, 2007}}</ref> However, for the last three episodes of the season, the rating turned somewhat, and the season ended up with 17.5 million viewers, falling from number four to number ten on the list of most watched shows.<ref>{{cite news|title=2006-07 primetime wrap|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2006-07-primetime-wrap-137223|accessdate=October 26, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 25, 2007}}</ref> While Cross' departure allowed for the much-underused Edie to have more story, fans noticed a decline in the stories during Cross' departure. Stories such as Lynette's emotional affair with restaurant manager Rick, proved unpopular. Furthermore, Susan's contrived triangle with Ian and Mike seemed tiresome to many viewers, particularly in an episode where Susan is lost in the woods. Notable, however, was that the show's rating among viewers age 18–24 increased from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vasquez|first=Diego|title=Fact: College kids now watch more TV|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/fact-college-kids-now-watch-more-tv/|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=Media Life Magazine|date=July 23, 2007}}</ref>

For its fourth season, the series proved to have staying power.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stack|first=Tim|title=TV Review: Desperate Housewives|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20156391,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=October 26, 2013|date=November 7, 2007}}</ref> The series averaged 18.2 million viewers. Ratings peaked in Episode 9 where 20.6 million viewers tuned in to see the heavily marketed tornado episode. The show once again moved back into the top 5 highest rated programs in the 2007–2008 season, being the #1 ABC drama and beating popular medical drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' after falling behind it for the first time in the third season. It also became for the first time the #1 scripted show, beating ''CSI''. Although ratings were down for the fifth season, along with every scripted series on television, ''Desperate Housewives'' was still the most watched scripted series on ABC, consistently beating the other ABC flagship shows, ''Lost'' and ''Grey's Anatomy,'' although the latter is still number one in the 18–49 demographic, followed by ''Housewives''.

Similar to the fifth season, ratings were down for the sixth season because of heavy competition in many airings, but the show still managed to remain the second most watched scripted show on ABC and the eleventh most watched scripted show of all broadcast television. The series continued to hit lower ratings, because of competition like the [[67th Golden Globe Awards]], [[2010 Grammy Awards]], [[2010 Winter Olympics]], and the new [[CBS]] reality series ''[[Undercover Boss]]''. Nevertheless, the sixth season managed to finish in the top twenty overall, both in total viewers and 18-49 demographic audiences. Among scripted shows, it still ranked in the top 10, in both categories.<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/06/16/final-2009-10-broadcast-primetime-show-average-viewership/54336 Final 2009–10 Broadcast Primetime Show Average Viewership], ''TV By the Numbers'', June 16, 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=052710_13|title= ABC's 2010 May Sweep and 2009–10 TV Season highlights|publisher=ABC Medianet|date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quotenmeter.de/cms/?p1=n&p2=43034&p3=|title=Die Season ist vorbei: Amerikas heißeste Liste|publisher=quotenmeter.de |date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=September 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/06/16/final-2009-10-broadcast-primetime-show-18-49-ratings/54330 Final 2009–10 Broadcast Primetime Show 18-49 Ratings], ''TV By the Numbers'', June 16, 2010</ref><ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/06/18/final-2009-10-broadcast-primetime-show-live7-dvr-ratings/54601 Final 2009–10 Broadcast Primetime Show Live+7 DVR Ratings], ''TV By the Numbers'', June 16, 2010</ref>

The seventh season premiered on September 26, 2010 and averaged 11.85 million viewers. The season saw new lows for the series reaching for the first time below 10 million viewers, and saw lows of 2.7 in the 18-49 demographic. For the first half of the season, ratings started strong averaging 12.3 million viewers and 3.9 in the 18-49 demographic which is similar to the second half of the sixth season. However, ratings declined in the second half of the season, after two contiguous episodes had to compete against the [[68th Golden Globe Awards]] and then the [[2011 Grammy Awards]]. The show failed to recover to viewer levels hit in the first half of the season, and continued to receive 9 - 10 million viewers and 2.7 - 3.1 in the 18-49 demographic. This was the first time in its history that ''Desperate Housewives'' would not place in the 20 most watched shows of the season, although it would place in the 20 most watched scripted shows.

Season 8 continued to see declines in the show's ratings. The season premiered to 9.93 million viewers and a 3.2 in the demo making it the least watched season premiere in the show's history. The season began with ratings similar to those of the latter half of season 7, averaging 8–9 million viewers, and between a 2.8 to 3.0 in the 18-49 demographic. However, after the mid-season finale the ratings returned lower, hitting the 7 million viewer mark and a 2.2-2.5 in the demo. Season 8 also saw the lowest ratings in the show's eight-year run. Opposite the [[2012 Grammy Awards]], which featured a tribute to the recently deceased [[Whitney Houston]], and the mid season premiere of ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], the show fell to a 1.8 rating in adults 18-49 and 6.4 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=TV Ratings Sunday: Whitney Houston Memories Rocket 'Grammy Awards' Ratings, Pushes Competition To Lows|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/13/tv-ratings-sunday-whitney-houston-memories-rocket-grammy-awards-ratings/119540/|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=TV by the Numbers|date=February 13, 2012}}</ref> However unlike season 7, the show's ratings slightly recovered after the series low and leveled around the 8 million viewer mark and a 2.6 in the demo. Despite the series lows, the season finale was able to go out on a season high in the ratings and the highest rated episode in over a year and a half, since March 2011 with "[[Searching (Desperate Housewives)|Searching]]". The series finale titled "[[Finishing the Hat (Desperate Housewives)|Finishing the Hat]]" aired May 13, 2012 was viewed by 11.12 million viewers and a 3.2 in the demo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/05/15/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-family-guy-survivor-adjusted-up-survivor-reunion-dateline-adjusted-down/134077/|title=Sunday Final Ratings: 'Once Upon A Time', 'Family Guy', 'Survivor' Adjusted Up; 'Survivor: Reunion', 'Dateline' Adjusted Down|publisher=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> Despite the lows in the ratings the show managed to remain in the Top 25 watched shows in the 18-49 demographic, placing at 25th.

In 2006, the American cable network [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] launched their [[reality television|reality series]], ''[[The Real Housewives of...]]'', in the footsteps of the "real life desperate housewives" phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Richard|title=TV: "The Real Housewives of Orange County"|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/-118440--.html|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|accessdate=26 October 2013|date=March 12, 2006}}</ref> That program has taken place in areas such as [[Orange County, California]], [[Atlanta]], and two series within the New York-[[Tri-State Region]], within the City itself and the [[New Jersey]] suburbs. According to a survey of twenty countries conducted in 2006 by ''Informa Telecoms and Media'', ''Desperate Housewives'' was the third most viewed TV show in the world, after fellow American series ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5231334.stm|date=July 31, 2006|title=CSI show 'most popular in world'|publisher=BBC}}</ref> During a fund raising auction for the British child charity [[ChildLine]] in December 2006, a walk-on part in ''Desperate Housewives'' had the highest bid, £17,000, beating [[Daniel Craig]]'s [[James Bond]] tuxedo from ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=James Bond tuxedo raises £12,000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6168389.stm|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=December 11, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=James Bond, 'Desperate Housewives' Raise Money for UK Charity|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/12/11/james_bond_desperate_housewives_raise_mo|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=Starpulse.com|date=December 11, 2006}}</ref>

===Awards and nominations===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Desperate Housewives}}

[[Image:Desperate Housewives at 2008 GLAAD Awards.jpg|[[Dana Delany]], [[Teri Hatcher]], [[Brenda Strong]] and [[Andrea Bowen]] at the 2009 GLAAD Media Awards|thumb|right]]
For its premiere season, the show was awarded six [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, two [[Golden Globe Award]]s and two [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s. The nominations of all of the leading actresses except [[Eva Longoria]] for both the Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award received some media interest. While Longoria seemingly wasn't bothered, stating for the press that ''"I'm new. I just arrived. I didn't expect at all to be in the minds of the Academy"'', Marc Cherry regarded them being left out as a ''"horrendous error"''.<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/longoria%20i%20never%20expected%20an%20emmy Longoria: "I Never Expected an Emmy"], ''ContactMusic.com'', July 24, 2005</ref> In the end, the Primetime Emmy Award went to [[Felicity Huffman]], while [[Teri Hatcher]] received the Golden Globe Award, as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award.

The show's second Golden Globe Award for its first year was for Best TV Series – Musical or Comedy, while the other Primetime Emmy Awards went to [[Kathryn Joosten]] for her guest role as Karen McCluskey (beating, among others, fellow cast member [[Lupe Ontiveros]]), [[Charles McDougall]] for his direction of the pilot episode, [[Danny Elfman]]'s theme music, the picture editing of the pilot, and the casting of the series. The entire cast was awarded the Screen Actors Guild Award, and [[Nicollette Sheridan]] was nominated the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film.

In 2006, the show continued to receive several nominations. It was awarded with yet another Golden Globe Award for Best TV Series – Musical or Comedy, and all the four leading women received Golden Globe Award nominations, although none of them won. The cast ensemble was awarded with another Screen Actors Guild Award, as was Felicity Huffman. Primetime Emmy Award nominations included, among others, guest actress [[Shirley Knight]] and supporting actress [[Alfre Woodard]], although none of the resulted in an actual award. It was nominated for the Pioneer Award at the BAFTAs but lost to ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which at the time was recently revamped.

The show did continue to be nominated in 2007 – Felicity Huffman was granted an Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the second time, and guest actresses [[Laurie Metcalf]] and [[Dixie Carter]] also received Primetime Emmy Award nominations. The show, along with actresses [[Marcia Cross]] and Felicity Huffman, received Golden Globe Award nominations, and Huffman and the cast ensemble were also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild. None of the Primetime Emmy Award, Golden Globe Award, or Screen Actors Guild Award nominations resulted in any actual awards.

2008 yielded the least nominations with none at the Golden Globe Awards and only the cast being nominated at the Screen Actors Guild Award. The show was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards, including acting nods towards [[Polly Bergen]] and [[Kathryn Joosten]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]]. Joosten won the show's seventh Primetime Emmy Award and first since its debut year.

Nominations continued to decline in later years. Notable nominations included nods towards [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Kathryn Joosten]] in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, [[Brenda Strong]] received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 2011, a notable feat for a category usually dominated by animated series. Also in 2011, Vanessa L. Williams won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series and a Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television. Strong and Joosten received Primetime Emmy Award nominations again in 2012 and Williams won an NAACP Image Award as Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the show's eight and final season.

Other notable awards include the 2005 [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite New Television Drama, the Future Classic Award at the 2005 [[TV Land Awards]], the 2006 TP de Oro for Best Foreign Series, and the Golden Nymph at the 2007 Monte-Carlo TV Festival, among others.<ref>[http://imdb.com/title/tt0410975/awards The IMDb.com list of awards for Desperate Housewives], Retrieved August 3, 2007</ref>

On February 26, 2007, [[The Walt Disney Company]] announced that four South American versions of the show were about to begin production: one for Argentina, one for [[Colombia]], one for Brazil and one for [[Ecuador]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Housewives' going global|url=http://variety.com/2006/scene/vpage/housewives-going-global-1117939263/|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=March 5, 2006}}</ref> Later on, the Colombian and Ecuadorean productions merged, leaving three [[Latin America]]n shows:

The Argentine version, called ''[[Amas de Casa Desesperadas (Argentine TV series)|Amas de Casa Desesperadas]]'', began being broadcast in 2006.

===Games===
In 2005, UK company Re:creation published ''Desperate Housewives Dirty Laundry Game'', a [[board game]] based on season three of ''Desperate Housewives''.<ref>[http://www.recreationplc.com/Tradecat_2006/Trade%20Catalogue.pdf Re:Creation 2007 Product Catalogue, page 15] {{wayback|url=http://www.recreationplc.com/Tradecat_2006/Trade%20Catalogue.pdf |date=20070928002637 }}, Retrieved August 3, 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://www.recreationplc.com/Tradecat_2006/Trade+Catalogue.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | date=20070205074933 }}</ref> Players attempt to guess their opponents' secrets by answering [[trivia]] questions, while keeping clues to their own secrets concealed.

2006 saw the release of two [[video game]]s: [[Buena Vista Games]] released the [[life simulation game|sim computer game]] ''[[Desperate Housewives: The Game]]'', featuring an original storyline spanning 12 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Desperate Housewives - The Game|url=http://buenavistagames.go.com/desperatehousewives/|work=Beuna Vista Games|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref> The game is set on Wisteria Lane, but the player does not play as any of the housewives, although they frequently appear.

A couple of months later, [[Gameloft]] released a [[mobile game]] based on the series.<ref>[http://www.gameloft.com/product.php?product=187&product_name=Desperate+Housewives%99 Desperate Housewives Mobile Game Official Website]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}, Retrieved August 3, 2007</ref> "The inspiration for Gameloft's take on Desperate Housewives comes from the most unlikely place, too – the original [[Mario Party]] on the Nintendo 64."<ref>{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Levi|title=Desperate Housewives Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2007/01/29/desperate-housewives-review|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=September 20, 2013|date=January 29, 2007}}</ref>

===Soundtrack and literature===
[[File:Ms. magazine Cover - Spring 2005.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Ms. magazine]]'''s ''Desperate Housewives'' issue, published in 2005]]
In September 2005, [[Hollywood Records]] released a CD (distributed by [[Universal Music]]), [[Music from and Inspired by Desperate Housewives]], featuring music inspired by the series, as well as sound clips taken from the first season of the show.

===''Another Desperate Housewife'' commercials===
In conjunction with season six, Marc Cherry was commissioned to write eight "mini-episodes" entitled ''Another Desperate Housewife''. The episodes were written after the previous season's extensive product placement proved unpopular with the fans. The mini-episodes were written to advertise mobile phone company Sprint and involve just three characters.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parpis|first=Eleftheria|title=The New Mini-Series|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/new-mini-series-100645|accessdate=October 26, 2013|newspaper=[[Adweek]]|date=October 19, 2009}}</ref> The two main characters are Stephanie (played by [[Rebecca Staab]]) and Lance (played by [[David Chisum]]) who have moved into the former house of Edie Britt after her death. The third character, Elsa, was Stephanie's friend. It is eventually revealed that Lance and Elsa have been having an affair. Stephanie finds out and tells Lance to break it off. Elsa suggests killing Stephanie, but Lance gets a text message indicating he's seeing another woman and a furious Elsa shoots him. In truth, Stephanie had sent the message herself. The final mini-episode has Elsa being arrested and Stephanie attracted to a handsome policeman at the scene. Each episode ends with a Mary Alice-like narration saying things such as "This is suspicion on the Now Network" or "This is betrayal on the Now Network."<ref>{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ryan|last2=Yao|first2=Deborah|title=Dramatized ads weave plot lines around product|url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-technology/dramatized-ads-weave-plot-lines-around-product-20091001-gcwv.html|accessdate=October 26, 2013|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=October 1, 2009}}</ref>

===Ask Desperate Housewives===
For the sixth season of the series, ABC created "Ask Desperate Housewives" to promote their website abc.go.com. It was presented and sponsored by Sprint, and it was hosted by series creator, Marc Cherry. In each special, Marc Cherry and an actress/actor of the series would answer questions that fans submitted to abc.go.com.

===Social media===
Like many TV shows, Desperate Housewives is present on popular social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. It is the second most 'liked' ABC show on Facebook, with 12 million 'likes', which exceeds that of other popular ABC shows such as Modern Family, Once Upon A Time, Dancing with the Stars, and Lost. On Facebook, the show can be found under the title "Desperate Housewives" with a blue check mark to confirm that it is the official page. On Twitter, Desperate Housewives is listed as "desperateABC" and has more than 200,000 followers; again, a blue check mark is present as confirmation that it is official page. Desperate Housewives' official website is abc.go.com/desperatehousewives, but entering desperatehousewives.com will also locate the page. The website features character bios, quizzes, and episode descriptions. When Desperate Housewives was on the air the last five episodes would be available on the show's site or on the ABC Player App (now known as 'Watch ABC').
