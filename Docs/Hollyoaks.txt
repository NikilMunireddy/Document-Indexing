'''''Hollyoaks''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[soap opera]], first broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on 23 October 1995. It was originally devised by [[Phil Redmond]], who had previously conceived the [[Channel 4]] soap ''[[Brookside]]''. The programme is set in a fictional suburb of [[Chester]] called Hollyoaks, and features a large cast of characters primarily aged between 16 and 35. Beginning with a cast of just seven major characters in 1995, the serial now has approximately 50 main cast members. ''Hollyoaks'' has a high cast turnover in comparison with other British soaps; as of May 2014, just fifteen characters have spent five years or longer on the show. The programme, which is currently the UK's youngest television soap opera, has won 28 [[British Soap Awards]], 11 [[Inside Soap Awards]], one ''[[TRIC Award]]'' and one [[National Television Awards|National Television Award]]; at the 2014 British Soap Awards, ''Hollyoaks'' won Best British Soap for the first time, breaking the 15-year draw between rival soaps ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Coronation Street]]''. It is also popular around the world. The longest-serving cast member is [[Tony Hutchinson]], played by [[Nick Pickard]], as he has appeared since the first episode in 1995; all the other original actors left before 2000.

==Production team==
Since [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] left his role in 2009, a number of producers have worked on the show, resulting in a number of creative reinventions and changes in direction during this time. Kirkwood's successor [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] stepped down from her position in 2010 after twelve months;<ref name="allan quits">{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Kris |last2=Silverstein |first2=Adam |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a196734/hollyoaks-producer-allan-quits-soap.html |title='Hollyoaks' producer Allan quits soap|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> her replacement, [[Paul Marquess]], introduced a wide variety of new characters before leaving one year later, to be replaced by [[Gareth Philips]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' announces new producer|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a296375/hollyoaks-announces-new-producer.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> [[Emma Smithwick]] later replaced Philips in Autumn 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' producer Emma Smithwick talks show future: Interview|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a354364/hollyoaks-producer-emma-smithwick-talks-show-future-interview.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> In late September 2012, it was announced that Emma Smithwick would be replaced by Bryan Kirkwood.<ref>{{cite web|title= Exclusive: 'Hollyoaks' producer Emma Smithwick leaving soap|url=http://www..co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a409139/hollyoaks-producer-emma-smithwick-leaving-soap.html|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> The programme celebrates 20 years on [[Channel 4]] in October 2015.

By the 2000s, Hollyoaks had developed a substantial fan base and was seen as a vibrant, modern and young person's soap. In 2002, creator Phil Redmond considered withdrawing his programme from airing, after the network axed his other soap opera ''[[Brookside]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/nov/05/broadcasting.channel4|title=Redmond threatens Hollyoaks defection|work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group plc |location=UK |author=Gibson, Owen|date=5 November 2002|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> However, ''Hollyoaks'' continued to air on the channel, and by 2007 critics were noting that the serial had "undergone a curious rebirth", reflected in rising ratings and a higher quality of drama.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/may/21/mondaymediasection4 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stephen | last=Armstrong | title=Media | date=21 May 2007}}</ref> As of November 2014, the first-look airings on E4 typically draw around 900,000 viewers, with the following day's C4 airing attracting roughly over a million, for a combined audience of between 1.7–2.3 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a445890/coronation-street-fiz-tyrone-plot-seen-by-87m-on-monday.html|title='Coronation Street': Fiz, Tyrone plot seen by 8.7m on Monday|work=Digital Spy}}</ref>

The 'first-look' is reshown on timeshift channel E4 +1 at 20.00. The 'first-look' is occasionally omitted, primarily if the following day's C4 episode is a special or event edition, and on these occasions may be replaced with a related programme or special.

[[File:Lime Pictures.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Hollyoaks is filmed at Lime Pictures in Childwall, Liverpool.]]
In 2010, series producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] announced she was to step down from the series after only a year, being replaced by [[Paul Marquess]]. Speaking of her decision, Allan stated: "I am very proud to have been part of the ''Hollyoaks'' team. I've had a fantastic time working on this show but am now equally excited about what the future will hold."<ref name="allan quits"/> On his upcoming role of series producer, Marquess said: "Taking up this position at [[Lime Pictures]] feels like I'm going home, as I began my career working with both Carolyn [Reynolds] and Tony [Wood] at Granada and my first major project was ''Brookside'' at Mersey Television. I'm a huge soap fan so to be handed the reins of Channel 4's flagship teen drama is not only a huge challenge but also a massive honour."<ref name="allan quits"/> Lime Pictures creative director and ''Hollyoaks'' executive producer Tony Wood added: "I'd like to thank Lucy Allan for making such a contribution to ''Hollyoaks'' over the years and wish her well for the future. It's very exciting to be working with Paul Marquess again. He's one of the best showrunners in the business. This is a brilliant appointment for ''Hollyoaks''."<ref name="allan quits"/>

Only one day after being announced as the new producer, Marquess began work on the soap opera.<ref name="early start">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a196887/sunday-start-for-new-oaks-chief.html|title=Sunday start for new 'Oaks chief|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=16 January 2010|accessdate=18 January 2010}}</ref> A Channel 4 spokesperson stated: "It's all been a very quick turnaround at the top. There'll be a short handover period, but Paul officially takes the helm on Monday and he's really looking forward to the challenge."<ref name="early start"/>

In November 2010, a special scene was filmed for an episode airing on 19 November 2010 featuring [[Myra McQueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) reference to the [[Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton|engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton]].<ref name="royal">{{cite web|first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a288665/hollyoaks-features-royal-engagement-scene.html |title=Hollyoaks features Royal Engagement scene|work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref> A spokesperson for the show said, "''Hollyoaks'' has always strived to be a soap that is relevant to its audience and so bosses decided that it was only fitting to reflect this national talking point on screen."<ref name="royal"/>

It was announced in January 2011 that Marquess would leave his role as series producer and would be succeeded by ''Hollyoaks'' production team member [[Gareth Philips]].<ref name="phillips">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a296375/hollyoaks-announces-new-producer.html |title='Hollyoaks' announces new producer |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref> Discussing the news, Philips said: "I have really enjoyed working in the script team at ''Hollyoaks'' and it will be a huge honour to take the reins of Channel 4's flagship youth drama. I am very excited about taking the show even further this year with more compelling and brave stories."<ref name="phillips"/>

=== Characters ===
{{See also|List of Hollyoaks characters}}
Although ''Hollyoaks'' mainly focuses on students, there has always been families like other soap operas, such as the [[Cunningham family|Cunningham]], [[Osborne family|Osborne]], [[McQueen family|McQueen]], Roscoe, Lomax and Blake families.
Since the revamp in 2010, the Sharpe, Costello and O'Connor families were introduced by new executive producer Paul Marquess and in 2011 the Savage and Kane families were introduced after the Sharpe's were written out, the Costello's reduced, and [[Rob O'Connor|Rob]] and [[Finn O'Connor (Hollyoaks)|Finn O'Connor]] departing. Finn was reintroduced in 2013 by Bryan Kirkwood with a new actor portraying the character. Kirkwood also created and introduced the Roscoe and Lomax family in the same year as well as introducing the Campbell brothers and [[Kim Butterfield]], the sister of established character [[Lindsey Butterfield|Lindsey]] in 2014. After the departure of [[Carmel McQueen]] and the temporary departure of [[Mercedes McQueen]], three new members of the McQueen family were introduced, [[Porsche McQueen|Porsche]], [[Celine McQueen|Celine]] and [[Cleo McQueen]]. Their mother [[Reenie McQueen]], played by [[Zöe Lucker]], was introduced in April 2015. In February 2015, a new trio family, the Lovedays were introduced and in May 2015 [[Scott Drinkwell]] was introduced as [[Sinead O'Connor (Hollyoaks)|Sinead O'Connor]]'s cousin. In October, a new family called the Nightingales moved into the village, with dad Mac Nightingale taking over ownership of the Dog in the Pond.

''Hollyoaks'' has mainly been considered as a 'teen soap', as it was originally aimed, as the "fourth British soap-opera". In 2008, [[Gemma Merna]], who played Carmel, admitted she felt the show is underrated: "We are completely underrated as a show, which is so frustrating," Gemma told the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]''. "People just think we are gorgeous models who have nothing else to offer. But the truth is we have some seriously talented actors and we're fed up with being the little sister to ''Corrie'', ''EastEnders'' and ''Emmerdale''. We're fighters and we're so passionate about what we do. We have the balls and just go for it. And I think we should get credit for that!".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a88527/hollyoaks-star-claims-show-is-underrated.html|title=Hollyoaks star feels show is underrated|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|date=2 February 2008|accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/28399/Sexy-Gem-declares-phwoar-/ |title=Sexy Gem declares phwoar! |work=Daily Star |location=UK |date=2 February 2008 |publisher=([[Northern & Shell]])|accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref> [[Ricky Whittle]], who plays [[Calvin Valentine]], explained that the time and effort required to produce ''Hollyoaks'', often goes unnoticed. He also said: "There's an idea that we're the party soap, the happy soap, the soap that has loads of fun, but people don't realise how hard we work". He went on, "Everyone thinks it's all glamour, premieres and parties but they need to realise that we do put it in. We are working hard for a living as well and it's not as easy as it sounds. At the minute, especially with the late night stuff, we're doing 12-hour days, sometimes six or seven days a week."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a170527/oaks-star-unhappy-over-shows-image.html|title='Oaks star unhappy over show's image|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|date=10 August 2009|accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref><!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Maxsdeath.JPG|190px|right|thumb|One of the long featured characters [[Max Cunningham]], killed on-screen in 2008.]] -->

From late 2013, the show moved away from the student focus by changing the SU Bar and Student Halls to become the new 'Dee Valley Hospital'. This saw a number of the student characters depart as the show moved towards the Hospital focus, such as [[Rob Edwards (Hollyoaks)|Rob Edwards]], [[Annalise Appleton]], [[Texas Longford]], [[Barney Harper-McBride]], [[Doug Carter]], [[Ash Kane]] and [[Leanne Holiday]]. In 2014, producer Bryan Kirkwood introduced [[Dr. Charles S'avage]], the brother of Dirk and head of the hospital, [[Celine McQueen]], a nurse and [[Kim Butterfield]], the sister of [[Lindsey Butterfield|Lindsey]] and also a nurse. These characters work alongside Lindsey and student nurse, [[Tegan Lomax]] at the Hospital.

Hollyoaks has been groundbreaking in featuring several transgender characters, starting in 2010 with [[Jason Costello]], a young trans man played by actress [[Victoria Atkin]], in 2014, a trans woman called [[Blessing Chambers]], played by actress [[Modupe Adeyeye]], and most recently a trans woman, and the head teacher of Hollyoaks High, [[Sally St. Claire]], played by trans actress [[Annie Wallace]]; the first trans actress to be cast in a regular role in a British soap opera.

As of 2014, [[Nick Pickard]] who portrays Tony Hutchinson, is the only cast member to have appeared consecutively from the show's inception. Other long-term characters include [[Jimmy McKenna]] and [[Ashley Taylor Dawson]] who play [[Jack Osborne|Jack]] and [[Darren Osborne]] respectively and [[Frankie Osborne]] played by [[Helen Pearson]]. Helen replaces [[Sarah Jayne Dunn]] who played [[Mandy Richardson]] and [[Carley Stenson]] who played [[Steph Cunningham]] as the longest serving female cast member. Dunn played Mandy from 1996 to 2006, making a short visit in 2007, a six-month period in 2008 and returning full-time in 2010 before leaving again in 2011. Stenson joined the cast in 2000 and left in 2010. [[Cindy Cunningham]] portrayed by [[Stephanie Waring]] is another long-running character, who first appeared in 1996, however the actress made several exits before returning to the role on a permanent basis in 2008, she left on maternity leave in September 2010 but returned again in March 2011. [[Tom Cunningham]] is also a long-running characters, who has appeared since his birth in 1999. [[Jessica Fox (actress)|Jessica Fox]] and [[Kieron Richardson]] have also been on the show for many years. Fox has been playing [[Nancy Hayton]] since 2005 and Richardson has been playing [[Ste Hay]] since 2006.

===Opening titles and tune===
On 26 February 2007, the programme launched a revamped title sequence with a faster version of the theme tune. This new sequence regularly underwent minor changes, usually caused by characters leaving or joining the programme.

[[File:Hollyoaks Advert Title Card.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A 2007 commercial break ident featuring the characters of [[Sarah Barnes]], [[Amy Barnes]], [[Gilly Roach]], [[Hannah Ashworth]] and [[Nancy Hayton]] respectively.]]
The original style of this sequence has changed on many occasions. March 2008 saw an updated "style" to the titles, with a purple background and new character segments; 26 December 2008 saw the background changed from purple to black (similar to that of the ''[[Hollyoaks Later]]'' series one titles); and then a change on 1 June 2009 saw the pink and blue lettering changed to monochrome, and the characters shown in full colour before and after the advert segments.

It was announced on 19 June 2010 that new titles with a new theme tune, which was reportedly "slowed right down", would be used in new series producer Paul Marquess' first episode, which aired on 5 July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a230177/confirmed-new-credits-and-theme-for-oaks.html|title=Confirmed: New credits and theme for 'Oaks|work=Digital Spy|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|date=19 June 2010|accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> However, on 2 July, the titles were delayed for one week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a236979/new-hollyoaks-titles-delayed.html |title=New Hollyoaks titles delayed |work=Digital Spy |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green|date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The titles were then delayed for a second time due to "technical difficulties". On 10 September 2010, Channel 4 confirmed the new ''Hollyoaks'' titles and theme music would air from 13 September.<ref name="airdate">{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a275695/new-hollyoaks-titles-airdate-announced.html|title=New Hollyoaks titles: Airdate announced|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|date=10 September 2010|accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref> However, the titles were different from pictures of filming of the original credits, suggesting a reshoot was the reason for the delay. Marquess commented: "We're very excited about the new titles that the viewers will see on Channel 4 on Monday. They're glossy, contemporary and very ''Hollyoaks''." He then apologised for the delay, saying: "We're sorry to the fans who have been waiting to see them, but they've taken a while to perfect. I'm very happy with them and I hope that the fans like the new-look show."<ref name="airdate"/>

Following Marquess' change to the titles, they have remained like this with several changes every few months. When a characters departs the show, they are removed from the titles and regularly when a singular character arrives in space with others, they are added upon their arrival. However, on the occasion that more than one character is introduced at one time, they can be added in updated titles weeks after their arrival. In January 2013, the theme was revamped slightly with a more futuristic view on it. Hollyoaks celebrated its eighteenth birthday in October 2013 and to celebrate it had a disastrous week, entitled 'Hollyoaks Blast'. The logo at the end of the titles was changed to a black background with gold and white writing. It was made temporarily for the week, but show producers decided to make it a permanent change.

Hollyoaks launched a new storyline which saw multiple deaths from a murderer in the hospital in January 2015. The murderer, who is only seen wearing a pair of blue [[medical glove]]s is known by the public as the Gloved Hand Killer. To coincide with the storyline, the five suspects - [[Lindsey Butterfield]] (Sophie Austin), [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]), [[Dr. Charles S'avage]] (Andrew Greenough), [[Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) and [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis) - were highlighted red throughout the titles. When [[Rick Spencer]] (Victor Gardener) was killed, Lindsey & Kim's title card flashed red; following the death of [[Will Savage]] (James Atherton), Dr. S'avage and his brother [[Dirk Savage]]'s ([[Dirk Kennedy]]) title card flashed red; the killer attempted to kill [[Diane O'Connor]] ([[Alex Fletcher (actress)|Alex Fletcher]]) and Tegan's title card flashed red; as [[Mariam Andrews]] ([[Helen Lederer]]) was murdered, Celine's title card flashed red. On 1 June 2015, the red flash appeared on all four title cards. On 8 June, the cherry biting opening scene that had been in the titles since Marquess' arrival was removed and replaced with the recently returned [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) biting an apple. A group of the new cast were introduced in new title cards. Many of the cast already in the show were given new title cards, now sharing title cards or revamped title cards. As well as title cards, the logo background was changed from black to blue.

During the show's twentieth anniversary, the title changed from the writing 'Hollyoaks' to simply the number '20' in gold lettering and this reverted after the week had ended. The titles and tune were extended to forty-three seconds when a new family, the ''Nightingale{{'s}}'', were added to the titles. For the show's 2015 Christmas episode, the title background was changed to a red Christmas-themed background, this was also the case in the 2014 Christmas episode.

In April 2016, new characters had been added and departed characters had been removed. The 'Hollyoaks apple' that [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) bites at the beginning was given a more glossy and updated look.

=== Alternative closing theme ===
This is a piece of music which plays over the closing credits of an emotional episode. It was first heard on 1 February 2013. Over the years, Hollyoaks has been known for changing its normal upbeat closing credits for more downbeat episodes. Normally when a character is killed or left in jeopardy silent credits are used and on occasion music used in the final scene is sometimes left playing during the credits, recent times have seen a change, with the ' Piano Closing Theme ' being used more. Bryan Kirkwood confirmed in 2007 that he wanted a piece of music, similar to EastEnders: Julia's Theme to be used, However it wasn't created until his return in 2012.

The last Piano Closing Theme was used on 9 January 2014 and from then on a piece of sad music is used. The first instance it was used on was 5 August 2014. Like before, the songs were used when a character is killed or left in jeopardy. With the Gloved Hand Killer storyline airing throughout 2015, the music was played more regularly, due to the deaths of several characters.

=== Music ===
''Hollyoaks'' is the only British soap to make use of [[incidental music]], usually a variation of the show's theme music. It is used either as a transition between scenes or as part of a dream-like sequence. These have included bands such as [[Ocean Colour Scene]] with the song "Hundred Mile High City", [[The Pigeon Detectives]], [[Radiohead]], [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], [[U2]], [[Scissor Sisters]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[The Libertines]], [[The Kooks]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Morrissey]], [[The Fratellis]], [[Paramore]], [[Ben Howard (musician)|Ben Howard]], [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]] and the [[Maroon 5]] song "She Will Be Loved" was repeatedly played in early 2005. Current chart songs are not used in the international version of the show; instead library music and a selection of purposely-composed songs are used. The main theme was written and performed by Steve Wright, who has also produced music and themes for ''[[Brookside]]'', ''[[Grange Hill]]'' and other Mersey TV / [[Lime Pictures]] productions. The theme tune is based on a [[Bo Diddley]] riff.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Following the theme tune and titles, each episode begins with a sequence showing various characters in situations, with music played over top.

A new remixed version of the theme, along with brand new titles, was used from 3 September 2010. The new titles show different characters in the drama posing in various positions with bright colourful backdrops.

A "''Hollyoaks''" soundtrack CD was released in 2001, containing music used in the programme.

A number of real acts have performed during transmitted episodes of the series. The Alphites were the first band to do so. In 2003, [[Pop Idol]] runner up [[Darius Campbell]] appeared in an episode performing at a graduation ball. In 2008, the band [[Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly]] also featured in ''Hollyoaks'', performing as part of a [[Battle of the Bands]] contest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/daily-gossip/34194|title=Pete Doherty in Paris, Get Cape.

The local shop in Hollyoaks even has a stand filled with Riverside branded cards that can be seen in many episodes.

''Hollyoaks'' have produced several adverts to promote the show over various times. In 2007, a new trailer featuring the cast performing daily routines, for example learning scripts, was broadcast. The trailer featured New Zealand indie band [[The Brunettes]] song "B.A.B.Y". In 2008, several trailers were aired featuring [[McQueen family|the McQueens]] as [[Niall Rafferty]] forced [[Myra McQueen]] to choose which of her children live and die. Each trailer showed each of her children pleading with Myra to pick them to live. In October 2009, due to [[Barry Newton]]'s [[schizophrenic]] and attempted suicide storyline, Channel 4 broadcast another trailer featuring clips from upcoming episodes and [[Evanescence]] song "[[Sweet Sacrifice]]".

In December 2009, due to [[Ricky Whittle]]'s appearance as a contestant on ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', a new promotional video was released featuring Whittle's character [[Calvin Valentine]] dancing with [[Carmel McQueen]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) along with the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]] song "[[Heads Will Roll (song)|Heads Will Roll]]". It also featured several other characters dancing around the pair before [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) throws what appears to be blood on Calvin. [[Kris Fisher]] ([[Gerard McCarthy]]), [[Sasha Valentine]] ([[Nathalie Emmanuel]]) and [[Leo Valentine]] ([[Brian Bovell]]) then give Calvin scores on his dancing, all of which are [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9, 9 and 9]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a190320/video-strictly-themed-hollyoaks-trailer.html|title=Video:Srictly-themed Hollyoaks trailer|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=8 December 2009|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref> Although this trailer was originally thought to be about Whittle's ''Strictly Come Dancing'' appearance and the character of Calvin's affair with [[Mercedes Fisher]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), it also resembled ''Hollyoaks''' "flashforward" style episode which will see the second marriage of Calvin and Carmel.<ref name="flashforward">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a191387/hollyoaks-to-air-flashforward-episode.html|title=Hollyoaks to air flashforward episode|work=Digital Spy|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref> Another trailer was shown to advertise the flashforward episode and May 2010 after it was announced Calvin would be killed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a191702/video-preview-hollyoaks-flashforward.html|title=Video preview: Hollyoaks 'flashforward'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>

A new sequence was later released in July 2010, which featured regular characters, such as the McQueen family, Darren ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]), Steph ([[Carley Stenson]]), Gilly ([[Anthony Quinlan]]), Rhys ([[Andrew Moss]]), Tony ([[Nick Pickard]]) and Duncan ([[Dean Aspen]]). In the second half of the sequence, the new characters introduced by Paul Marquess are featured, such as the Costellos, Brendan Brady ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]), Taylor Sharpe (Shaun Blackstock), Bart McQueen ([[Jonny Clarke]]), and glamour model Mitzeee ([[Rachel Shenton]]) and stand face to face with the regular characters. A quote then follows saying "Check out the new talent" which appears out into what appears to be a group photograph being taken, with all the characters mixed together.

Another trailer was broadcast during October 2010 to advertise the show's "fire week",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.e4.com/video/tkDDeY3iksPDaEY8M3M0go/play.e4 |title=Hollyoaks Dead Hot |work=[[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] |publisher=[[Channel 4 Television Corporation]] |date=October 2010 |accessdate=4 November 2010}}</ref> which would feature different characters in each episode set around the events of [[Guy Fawkes Night]], in which an arsonist would set fire to Il Gnosh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/c5mcfot1actpoerowbsbd7/view.e4 |title=Hollyoaks Fire Week! |work=[[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] |publisher=[[Channel 4 Television Corporation]] |first=Abi |last=B |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=4 November 2010}}</ref>

=== Filming locations ===
[[File:Hollyoaks Filming 990916.jpg|thumb|Hollyoaks being filmed on location on The Groves in Chester 16 September 1999]]
{{Main|List of Hollyoaks locations}}
Despite being set in [[Chester]] the show is filmed at Lime Pictures' studios in [[Childwall]], [[Liverpool]] in what used to be an art college. The Village is a specially built outdoor set at the studios. The SU Bar was once used in [[Brookside]] as Bar Brookie, and the parade from [[Brookside]] is now the location of Esther's Magic Bean and the Dee Valley University Hospital. [[Brookside Close]] was also used in ''Hollyoaks'' before it was sold; Ron Dixon's home was used as the Burtons' home and Max Farnham's home was used as the Deans' home. The ''Hollyoaks'' set was also the location for the television series [[Grange Hill]] and the frontage, classrooms and corridors are now used as Hollyoaks High School. ''Hollyoaks'' rarely film in [[Chester]] due to their mass schedule. Nearly all scenes are filmed at the studios on Childwall Abbey Road, [[Liverpool]].

== Broadcast ==

=== UK ===
Repeats of each day's edition of Hollyoaks air on E4 the following weekday&nbsp;– this was previously at 14.35, though as of 2012 is at 12.30 (with E4 +1 at 13.30). [[4seven]], from its launch in July 2012, carried a repeat of the preceding day's [[Channel 4]] Hollyoaks at 11.30, but this has now moved to the early hours of the morning (towards the end of the channel's previous broadcast 'day').

All the week's Channel 4 episodes of Hollyoaks are also compiled into an [[Omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] edition, which was for many years transmitted, with in-vision [[sign language|signing]], on [[Sunday]] mornings on Channel 4 as part of the [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]] strand. Following the move of T4 on Sundays to [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] in 2012, the scheduling of the omnibus changed: the signed version of the omnibus now airs in the early hours of Monday morning on Channel 4, with the T4 broadcast of the omnibus remaining on Sunday morning but moving to E4. Following the launch of [[4seven]], the new channel now has the first showing of the omnibus, at 11&nbsp;am on a Saturday morning.

The [[Welsh language]] analogue fourth channel, [[S4C]], did not carry the weekday ''Hollyoaks'' episodes as these clashed with local content, and so broadcast the Sunday morning omnibus only. In digital, Channel 4 and S4C both exist as separate services in Wales, and so [[S4C Digidol]]&nbsp;– now the sole form of S4C following digital switchover in Wales&nbsp;– did and does not carry any ''Hollyoaks'' broadcasts.

[[Channel 4]] HD launched in December 2007, initially carrying ''Hollyoaks'' [[Video scaler|upscaled]] from the SD service; the soap aired its first episode in native [[high-definition television|high definition]] on 2 June 2008.

Episodes of ''Hollyoaks'', including the weekly omnibus, are now available for catch-up viewing online through the [[4oD]] platform, and the series would begin to officially broadcast on YouTube, after [[Google]] reached a three-year deal with [[Channel 4]] to carry programmes from the 4oD service.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|title=C4 deal with YouTube will let users watch full-length TV dramas online|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/15/channel4-youtube-deal|work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group plc|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=16 December 2011|location=London}}</ref>

The show initially aired weekly, on Mondays in 1995. In July 1996, Mersey TV opted to recommission the show and increase its output to twice a week, that autumn. A third episode was introduced in September 2001 and a fourth in 2001. In November 2003, the show increased its output with a fifth episode, which has remained to this date.

[[Trouble (TV channel)|Trouble]] launched in February 1997 and Hollyoaks was part of the schedule from Day 1 from 3 February 1997 and ''Hollyoaks'' continued on the channel til December 2001. it mostly repeated the 1990s series.

Episodes from September 2006 to August 2007 were also available on [[Joost]].

It had also aired for a number of months on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] in Ireland, but was discontinued due to lack of viewers.

== Storylines ==
Over the course of the show's history, ''Hollyoaks'' has dealt with a number of storylines based upon serious issues. Given the large and established proportion of young viewers, some feel that the soap is an ideal platform to show a variety of issues affecting young people. A telephone helpline number is often displayed after episodes that feature a particular emphasis on a story that may have affected viewers.

A 2007 episode which showed a number of the characters falling ill at a party due to carbon monoxide poisoning helped make a viewer realise that the symptoms of illness she had been feeling were caused by a potentially fatal carbon monoxide leak in her home. By being made aware of the effects from the episode, she was able to receive medical treatment that would save her life.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a78455/hollyoaks-story-saves-womans-life.html|title=Hollyoaks story saves woman's life|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|date=25 October 2007|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref>

Storylines that the soap has dealt with include: [[drug addiction]], [[murder]], [[arson]], [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]], [[abortion]], [[suicide]], [[homelessness]], [[adultery]], financial problems, [[interracial relationships]], [[racism]], [[religion]], [[bisexuality]], [[homosexuality]],

Commencing 14 September 2009, the special week saw storylines being played out in non-chronological order, something which has never been dealt with within the soap's history. Producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] stated in an interview with [[Digital Spy]], "It was an idea pitched by Richard Burke, one of our writers, at my first long-term story conference back in February. What's great about it is that it's a really great storyline, but with the way he pitched&nbsp;– in making it non-linear&nbsp;– it was even better. It's just like if something happened to one of your mates and you try and put the pieces of the puzzle together as to what happened, you don't find all the people who tell you what happened in chronological order. You get bits here and there and piece it together. It's exactly the sort of thing Hollyoaks should be doing, challenging its audience."<ref>{{cite news|last=Green|first=Kris|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a176194/lucy-allan-series-producer-hollyoaks.html |title=Lucy Allan (Series Producer, 'Hollyoaks') |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2009}}</ref>

In late 2009, it was announced that ''Hollyoaks'' would make another soap first by screening a [[flashforward]] episode.<ref name="flashforward"/> On 21 December 2009, the show's time-line moved forward six months into May 2010. The episode featured the second wedding of [[Calvin Valentine]] and [[Carmel McQueen]]. Series producer Lucy Allan stated: "We're really excited by this future episode&nbsp;– ''Hollyoaks'' is the only soap that can tamper with time and give our audience the opportunity to look at events that haven't yet taken place. A lot can happen in six months, so viewers should expect to be asking a lot of questions of some of their favourite characters' actions and behaviour. [[Ricky Whittle]], who plays Calvin, added: "Calvin's completely besotted with Carmel. She's the one he's always wanted&nbsp;– she's always been his true love since they first started seeing each other and everyone's always wanted them to get back together."<ref name="flashforward"/> In September 2010 it was revealed that Marquess had devised a storyline which would see [[Ste Hay]] embark on a homosexual relationship with Brendan Brady and that the soap was going to tackle domestic abuse within a homosexual relationship.<ref name="stebrendan">{{cite news|last=Sam-Daliri|first=Nadia|title='Oaks star Kieron: I'm gay|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/3139149/Oaks-star-Kieron-Im-gay.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=([[News International]])|accessdate=24 September 2010|date=15 September 2010|location=London}}</ref>

Later in September, it was announced that ''Hollyoaks'', teaming up with Channel 4 Education's ''Battlefront'', would explore an underage sex storyline involving 12-year-old characters [[Finn O'Connor (Hollyoaks)|Finn O'Connor]] and [[Amber Sharpe]], which would lead to Amber's pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/ps7mw8eytcw1zo76ezt1j1/view.e4 |title=Hollyoaks tackles issues surrounding underage sex |work=E4|first=Abi|last=B|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battlefront.co.uk/article/exciting-hollyoaks-exclusive/ |title=Exciting Hollyoaks exclusive |work=Battlefront |last=D|first=Big |date=29 September 2010 |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="underage">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a279385/hollyoaks-announces-underage-sex-plot.html |title=Hollyoaks announces underage sex plot| work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|first=Ryan|last=Love|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> Explaining the storyline, Paul Marquess said: "''Hollyoaks'' has long been credited for tackling difficult issues that affect young people in a sensitive and intelligent way. I am very proud that we are once again bringing to the forefront a subject for our young audience that many parents, politicians and schools struggle to address. The storyline very clearly communicates to the audience that Amber and Finn were not emotionally or physically ready to engage in any sexual activity. And make no mistake, there will be no fairytale ending for Amber; she is faced with the most difficult situation she could ever imagine."<ref name="underage"/>

Hollyoaks was the first British television programme to tackle the issue of homosexual domestic violence, with [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]) and [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) central to the storyline.

In November 2012, ''Hollyoaks'' aired [[Enjoy The Ride (Hollyoaks)|Enjoy The Ride]], in which four regular characters were killed: [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]), and three sixth form students, [[Maddie Morrison]] ([[Scarlett Bowman]]), [[Neil Cooper (Hollyoaks)|Neil Cooper]] ([[Tosin Cole]]) and [[Jono (Hollyoaks)|Jono]] (Dylan Llewellyn).

In October 2013, as part of the celebration of the soap turning 18, the show aired ''Hollyoaks&nbsp;— The Blast'' from October 15 until the end of the week. The storyline saw a cast massacre with five main characters being killed off through the week, and two also were killed off in the annual ''[[Hollyoaks Later]]''. Show regular [[Callum Kane]] and newcomer [[Jade Hedy]] were killed off in ''Hollyoaks Later'' and regulars [[Ash Kane]] and [[Doug Carter]] were seen killed by the explosion while [[Clare Devine]] was run over by [[Paul Browning]] after [[Mercedes McQueen]] pushed her in front of his car. Regular character [[Leanne Holiday]] (Jessica Forest) died in hospital the following week due to injuries sustained in the explosion, and Paul Browning was murdered by Mercedes, Cindy and [[Lindsey Butterfield]] (Sophe Austin) during the episodes.

In November 2013, Hollyoaks aired the version of Cain and Abel, which two half-brothers Will Savage (James Atherton) and Dodger Savage (Danny Mac) fight against each other. Will kidnapped his family, including Dodger's father and twin sister Sienna and also Ash's mother, and Maxine, and tells them how he was jealous at Dodger, because of the way he regularly appears to get everything, all the things he wants more than him, before his and Dodger's showdown, which leads to the event that sees him getting arrested for the murder of Texas and his mother Anna and kidnapping.

In November 2014, the show aired ''Hollyoaks&nbsp; - End of The Line'' from November 17 until November 21. The story line saw newcomers Porshe McQueen (Twinnie Lee Moore) and [[Lockie Campbell]] (Nick Rhys) celebrate their wedding reception on a party train, and [[Sienna Blake]] (Anna Passey)'s car become stuck on the tracks after a car chase with her father [[Patrick Blake]] (Jeremy Sheffield)), causing the train to smash into it and derail. Long running character [[Carmel McQueen]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) was killed when the wreckage exploded after saving her murderous cousin [[Theresa McQueen]] (Jorgie Porter) from "villainous" [[Sonny Valentine]] (Aaron Fontaine), who also died in the explosion, who wanted revenge on her for killing Calvin in 2010.

Long running character [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) also "died" in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel, in a plot which saw her brutally murdered in the McQueen house by Grace Black. As of December 2014, only two original McQueen family members remain on screen, [[Myra McQueen]] (Nicole Barbara Lane) and [[John Paul McQueen]] (James Sutton). Mercedes returned in February 2015. In June 2015, Phoebe dies after [[Lindsey Butterfield]] (Sophie Austin) injects her with potassium chloride. Cleo moves into the house in late January 2015.

As part of the show's 20th Anniversary in October 2015, a number of long-running storylines reached a climax point. In particular, it features the exposure of the affair between Ste Hay and [[Harry Thompson (Hollyoaks)|Harry Thompson]] (Parry Glasspool) to his father Tony and the other characters during a Hollyoaks Pride event. The underage sixth form student had begun questioning his sexuality following a kiss with John Paul McQueen, later developing strong feelings for Ste. The plot involving Diane O'Connor, Tony and [[Tegan Lomax]] regarding their children who had been switched at birth is also concluded. The week also features the departure of the Osborne family from the [[Dog in the Pond]] pub and they had moved to the Boarding House which was previously owned by ([[Dennis Savage]]). Perhaps the most significant storyline of the 20th Anniversary week is the reveal of the Gloved Hand Killer (the identity of whom has been a mystery to viewers since January). The killer has murdered five characters up to this point (Rick Spencer, Mariam Andrews, Will Savage, Phoebe McQueen and [[Dylan Jenkins]]), has had two failed attempts (Esther Bloom and Diane O'Connor) and killed another two during the week ([[Ashley Davidson]], Dr. S'avage) before Lindsey Butterfield is revealed as the serial killer when she murders another regular character ([[Freddie Roscoe]]) however he is later revealed to be alive.

== Criticism ==
In 2001, students at [[University of Chester|Chester College]] objected to a storyline which they say misrepresented students in the city. Students Union president Gordon Reay said, "Students at other universities think we are a bunch of radicals and militants because that's how the students are portrayed in ''Hollyoaks''. They assume that the college in the programme is Chester College, because ''Hollyoaks'' is set in the city."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/apr/26/education.highereducation|title=Students angered by militant image in TV series|work=The Guardian Guardian Media Group plc|location=UK |author=Carter, Helen|date=26 April 2001|accessdate=3 November 2009}}</ref> In March 2009, the [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]] identified ''Hollyoaks'' as one of a number of programmes&nbsp;– including ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]''&nbsp;– cited by its members in a survey to be a bad influence on students, manifesting itself in behaviour such as, "answering back, storming off, swearing, aggression and sexually inappropriate behaviour."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1165885/TVs-childrens-bedrooms-breaking-families-causing-bad-behaviour.html|title=TVs in children's bedrooms 'are breaking up families and causing bad behaviour'|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|The Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern & Shell]]|date=31 March 2009|accessdate=29 September 2010|location=London|first=Laura|last=Clark}}</ref>

In 2007, the soap was further criticised along with other soap operas for the amount of alcohol consumption featured on-screen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6434225.stm|title=Shows 'encourage teen drinking'|publisher=BBC News |date=10 March 2007|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> The Food Commission monitored that 18 percent of scenes feature consumption and warned that it was conditioning teenagers into thinking it is normal to consume so much alcohol.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1545082/Drink-sodden-soaps-set-a-bad-example.html|title=Drink-sodden soaps set a bad example |work=The Telegraph|date=10 March 2007|accessdate=24 November 2009|location=London}}</ref> A similar incident occurred in 1997 when the [[Independent Television Commission]] criticised the series for using an existing brand of alcohol, [[Caffrey’s]] in the soap claiming that it breached broadcasting rules and promoted the product.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/home/channel-4-slammed-by-itc-for-product-placement-gaffe/2030431.article|title=Channel 4 slammed by ITC for product placement gaffe|work=Marketing Week|date=20 November 1997|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref>

In October 2009, Channel 4 was criticised for broadcasting character [[Barry Newton]]'s attempted suicide, which showed similarities to an incident which happened the same week in [[Glasgow]] in which two teenagers committed suicide by jumping into the [[River Clyde]]. In its defence, a Channel 4 spokesperson stated, "Any similarities are entirely coincidental and we have carefully considered how best to proceed. We feel it is appropriate to continue with the transmission of these episodes as this is not a one-off programme but an established and long-running series. The audience will be familiar with the character of Newt and this plotline, which has been both trailed and promoted, has been developing over a number of weeks. ''Hollyoaks'' has a strong track record of dealing with sensitive issues, and the transmission will be followed by a programme support announcement directing viewers to a 24-hour helpline."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a181424/c4-criticised-over-oaks-plot-decision.html |title=Channel 4 criticised over Hollyoaks plot decision |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref>

In late November 2009, it was announced that character [[Loretta Jones]] would be revealed to have killed a child when she was twelve-years-old. A ''Hollyoaks'' spokesperson said, "The drama is about how Loretta reacts to Chrissy's arrival back in her life and how she copes with all the memories coming back."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a188540/hollyoaks-embarks-on-child-killer-plot.html|title=Hollyoaks embarks on child killer plot|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=25 November 2009|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> The storyline was criticised due to its similarities to real events, such as the [[Murder of James Bulger]]. The mother of James Bulger, Denise Fergus, stated her outrage of the storyline while speaking to ''Click Liverpool''. She said: "I'm shocked and disgusted at what Hollyoaks is doing. They have "clearly" based this story on what happened to James and it's "outrageous" that they should do this without consulting with me in any way. This is the third time this year that someone has written a so-called drama that treats my son's murderers as some kind of victims and celebrities. It's "wrong" and I find it very "hurtful" that a TV company is making a horrific murder that happened 
16 years ago into the subject for a soap opera. How dare they treat James as though he is public property. It is an "insult" to his memory and I am particularly shocked that a programme, based in Liverpool, has gone ahead and done this "knowing that it would be so controversial". "Turning James's death into a topic for entertainment is just wrong"." Appalled by the decision to produce the episodes, Fergus publicly called for a meeting with ''Hollyoaks''' Liverpool-based production house [[Lime Pictures]], so she could hear it justify its move.

She continued, "I'm demanding an urgent meeting with the producers of ''Hollyoaks'' over this. It seems they have already recorded these episodes so they think they have got away with it. But I want to look them in the eye and hear them explain how they can justify it. I want to know how they could stoop so low as to broadcast such a horrible insult to the memory of my beautiful son. The "only" reason Hollyoaks is doing this is their own self-interest&nbsp;– to get viewers. I watch HO but if they go ahead and broadcast this it will be the last time I will watch it and I will ask other people to support me and boycott the show too."<ref name="outrage">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a188587/bulger-mother-outraged-over-hollyoaks-plot.html|title=Bulger mother outraged over Hollyoaks plot|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=25 November 2009|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>

A spokesperson for Channel 4 added, "The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events. The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were responsible for the death of a 12-year-old girl in the past."<ref name="outrage"/> Subsequently, the storyline was pulled from the show on 14 December 2009. A Lime Pictures spokesperson said, "''Hollyoaks'' has a very good track record of tackling difficult subject matter for a younger audience and the producers take seriously their duty to deal with sensitive issues in an appropriate way. This particular storyline was NOT based on any real-life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a191300/hollyoaks-axes-child-killer-plot.html|title=Hollyoaks axes child killer plot|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=14 December 2009|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>

== Spin-offs ==
{{Further|List of Hollyoaks spin-offs}}
''Hollyoaks'' occasionally broadcasts late-night spin-off editions of the main show, usually due to them containing adult themes and controversial plots. Two video specials have also been released. In 2001, a new 16 part spin-off series was produced entitled ''[[Hollyoaks: Movin' On]]'', this was followed by two subsequent series, ''[[Hollyoaks: Let Loose]]'' and ''[[Hollyoaks: In the City]]'', the latter appearing as its own show rather to a spin-off. In 2008, a late night spin-off was produced by [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] named ''[[Hollyoaks Later]]''. This [[Hollyoaks Later (series 1)|first series]], although being broadcast late at night, was more of a spin-off than a special. A [[Hollyoaks Later (series 2)|second series]] was commissioned the following year and aired in September. A third series was announced in April 2010 before airing later that year. A [[Hollyoaks Later (series 4)|fourth series]] of Hollyoaks Later aired in September 2011 and saw the return of [[Michaela McQueen]]. A fifth series aired in September 2012, and a sixth in October 2013. It is currently on hiatus following a decision not to go ahead with a seventh series in 2014, but has not been cancelled outright.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hollyoaks Later not returning for new series in 2014|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a576821/hollyoaks-later-not-returning-for-new-series-in-2014/|website=Digital Spy}}</ref>

In October 2009, the "Hollyoaks Music Show" began with celebrity artists performing on the set of Hollyoaks, some of the acts the performed on the show included [[Cascada]], [[The Saturdays]], [[Olly Murs]], [[N-Dubz]], [[Mini Viva]], [[Pixie Lott]], [[Jason Derulo]], [[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Girls Can't Catch]], [[Paloma Faith]], [[Taio Cruz]] and many others. Some of the cast members were in the audience and the show was presented by [[Rick Edwards]]. The show originally ended in December 2009 but has since been renewed for another series.

Since 2001, the current cast of ''Hollyoaks'' has produced two annual calendars. One is entitled 'Hollyoaks Babes', which features the female cast, and the other 'Hollyoaks Hunks', which features the male cast. For the calendar shoot, actors and actresses usually set off to exotic holiday destinations, however in September 2009 it was revealed the [[2008 Credit crisis]] caused the production team to have to make cuts, and therefore could no longer go abroad for the shoot.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a175497/hollyoaks-scraps-calendar-holidays.html|title=Hollyoaks scraps calendar holidays|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=3 September 2009|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref>
