'''Harrisburg''' ([[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]]: ''Harrisbarig'') is the capital city of the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]]. With a population of 49,673, it is the tenth-largest city in the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]]. It lies on the east bank of the [[Susquehanna River]], {{convert|105|mi}} west-northwest of Philadelphia and {{convert|204|mi|km}} east of Pittsburgh.

The Harrisburg-[[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]] [[Harrisburg metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]], [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland]], and [[Perry County, Pennsylvania|Perry]] counties, had a population of 509,074 in 2000 and grew to 549,850 in 2010. A July 1, 2007 estimate placed the population at 528,892, making it the fifth largest Metropolitan Statistical Area in Pennsylvania after [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]−[[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]−[[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] (the [[Lehigh Valley]]), and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]−[[Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes Barre]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2007/CBSA-EST2007-01.csv | title = Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007 (CBSA-EST2007-01) | format = [[comma-separated values|CSV]] | work = 2007 Population Estimates | publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division | date = 2008-03-27 | accessdate = 2008-09-20}}</ref> The Harrisburg-Carlisle-[[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] [[Harrisburg metropolitan area#Combined Statistical Area|Combined Statistical Area]], including both the Harrisburg-Carlisle and Lebanon Metropolitan Statistical Areas, had an estimated population of 656,781 in 2007 and was the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the state.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2007/CBSA-EST2007-02.csv | title = Table 2.

Harrisburg played a notable role in American history during the [[Frontier|Westward Migration]], the [[American Civil War]], and the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During part of the 19th century, the building of the [[Pennsylvania Main Line of Public Works|Pennsylvania Canal]] and later the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] allowed Harrisburg to become one of the most industrialized cities in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ship [[USS Harrisburg|USS ''Harrisburg'']], which served from 1918 to 1919 at the end of World War I, was named in honor of the city.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, the city's economic fortunes fluctuated with its major industries consisting of government, [[Heavy industry|heavy manufacturing]] including the production of [[steel]], [[agriculture]] (the greater Harrisburg area is at the heart of the fertile [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]]), and food services (nearby [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] is home of the [[The Hershey Company|chocolate maker]], located just {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Harrisburg).

The [[Pennsylvania Farm Show]], the largest free indoor agriculture exposition in the United States, was first held in Harrisburg in 1917 and has been held there every early-to-mid January since then.<ref>[http://www.pabookstore.com/75fashhiofpe.html 75th Farm Show: A History of Pennsylvania's Annual Agricultural Exposition] Dan Cupper, Accessed January 29, 2010.</ref> Harrisburg also hosts an annual [[Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show|outdoor sports]] show, the largest of its kind in North America, as well as an [[Pennsylvania Auto Show|auto show]], which features a large static display of new as well as classic cars and is renowned nationwide. Harrisburg is also known for the [[Three Mile Island accident]], which occurred on March 28, 1979 near [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown]].

In 2010 ''[[Forbes]]'' rated Harrisburg as the second best place in the U.S. to raise a family.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/best-places-family-lifestyle-real-estate-cities-kids.html | title = America's Best Places to Raise a Family | publisher = Forbes.com | first=Francesca | last=Levy | date=June 7, 2010}}</ref> Despite the city's recent financial troubles, in 2010 [[The Daily Beast]] website ranked 20 metropolitan areas across the country as being recession-proof, and the Harrisburg region landed at No. 7.<ref name="beast">{{cite web|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/08/harrisburg_area_ranked_among_t.html| year=2010| title=Harrisburg area ranked among Top 10 recession-proof cities| publisher=[[The Patriot-News|Harrisburg Patriot News]]| accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> The financial stability of the region is in part due to the high concentration of [[Government of Pennsylvania|state]] and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government agencies.

==History==
{{Main|History of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania}}{{See also|Timeline of Harrisburg history}}

===Founding===
Harrisburg's site along the [[Susquehanna River]] is thought to have been inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as early as 3000 BC. Known to the Native Americans as "Peixtin", or "[[Paxtang, Pennsylvania|Paxtang]]", the area was an important resting place and crossroads for Native American traders, as the trails leading from the Delaware to the Ohio rivers, and from the Potomac to the Upper Susquehanna intersected there. The first European contact with Native Americans in Pennsylvania was made by the Englishman, [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]], who journeyed from [[Virginia]] up the Susquehanna River in 1608 and visited with the [[Susquehannock|Susquehanna]] tribe. In 1719, [[John Harris, Sr.]], an English trader, settled here and 14 years later secured grants of {{convert|800|acre|km2}} in this vicinity. In 1785, [[John Harris, Jr.]] made plans to lay out a town on his father's land, which he named Harrisburg. In the spring of 1785, the town was formally surveyed by [[William Maclay (politician)|William Maclay]], who was a son-in-law of John Harris, Sr. In 1791, Harrisburg became incorporated, and in October 1812 it was named the Pennsylvania state capital, which it has remained ever since.
The assembling here of the Harrisburg Convention in 1827 led to the passage of the high [[Tariff of 1828|protective-tariff bill]] of 1828. In 1839, [[William Henry Harrison|Harrison]] and [[John Tyler|Tyler]] were nominated for [[President of the United States]] at the first [[1839 Whig National Convention|national convention]] of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] of the United States, which was held in Harrisburg.

===Pre-industry 1800–1850===
Before Harrisburg gained its first industries, it was a scenic, pastoral town, typical of most of the day: compact and surrounded by farmland. In 1822, the impressive brick capitol was completed for $200,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Stephanie Patterson|url=http://www.old8thward.com/pdf/PattersonGilbertweb.pdf |title=Harrisburg’s Old Eight Ward: Constructing a Website for Student Research}}</ref>

It was Harrisburg’s strategic location which gave it an advantage over many other towns.  It was settled as a trading post in 1719 at a location important to Westward expansion.  The importance of the location was that it was at a pass in a mountain ridge.  The Susquehanna River flowed generally west to east at this location, providing a route for boat traffic from the east.  The head of navigation was a short distance northwest of the town, where the river flowed through the pass.  Persons arriving from the east by boat had to exit at Harrisburg and prepare for an overland journey westward through the mountain pass.  Harrisburg assumed importance as a provisioning stop at this point where westward bound pioneers transitioned from river travel to overland travel.  It was partly because of its strategic location that the state legislature selected the small town of Harrisburg to become the state capital in 1812.

The grandeur of the Colonial Revival capitol dominated the quaint town. The streets were dirt, but orderly and platted in grid pattern.  The Pennsylvania Canal was built in 1834 and coursed the length of the town. The residential houses were situated on only a few city blocks stretching southward from the capitol. They were mostly one story. No factories were present but there were blacksmith shops and other businesses.<ref name="Eggert, Gerald G. 1993. p58">Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p58</ref>

===American Civil War===
{{Main|Harrisburg in the American Civil War}}
During the [[American Civil War]], Harrisburg was a significant training center for the [[Union Army]], with tens of thousands of troops passing through [[Camp Curtin]]. It was also a major rail center for the Union and a vital link between the Atlantic coast and the Midwest, with several railroads running through the city and spanning the Susquehanna River. As a result of this importance, it was a target of [[General]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] during its two invasions. The first time during the 1862 [[Maryland Campaign]], when Lee planned to capture the city after taking [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], but was prevented from doing so by the [[Battle of Antietam]] and his subsequent retreat back into Virginia. The second attempt was made during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] in 1863 and was more substantial. A short skirmish took place in June 1863 at [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania|Sporting Hill]], just 2&nbsp;miles west of Harrisburg. This is considered by many to have been the northern-most battle of the Civil War.

During the first part of the 19th century, Harrisburg was a notable stopping place along the [[Underground Railroad]], as [[History of slavery in the United States|escaped slaves]] being transported across the Susquehanna River were often fed and supplied before heading north towards Canada.<ref>[http://alpha.dickinson.edu/departments/hist/NEHworkshops/NEH/resource/ugrrDocs.htm#harrisburg The Underground Railroad]</ref>

===Industrial rise 1850–1920===
[[File:Hb market street.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Postcard depicting Market Street in [[Downtown Harrisburg]] as it appeared in 1910. [[Tram|Trolley]] tracks are noticeable along the street.]]
Harrisburg’s importance in the latter half of the 19th century was in the steel industry.  It was an important railroad center as well. [[Iron and steel industry|Steel and iron]] became dominant industries. Steel and other industries continued to play a major role in the local economy throughout the latter part of the 19th century. The city was the center of enormous railroad traffic and its steel industry supported large furnaces, rolling mills, and machine shops. The Pennsylvania Steel Company plant, which opened in nearby [[Steelton, Pennsylvania|Steelton]] in 1866, was the first in the country; later operated by [[Bethlehem Steel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steeltonpa.com/history.asp|title=History of Steelton, PA}}</ref>

Its first large scale iron foundries were put into operation shortly after 1850.<ref name="Eggert, Gerald G. 1993. p58"/>
As industries nationwide entered a phase of great expansion and technological improvement, so did industries&nbsp;– and in particular the steel industry&nbsp;– in Harrisburg.  This can be attributed to a combination of factors that were typical of what existed in other successful industrial cities: rapid rail expansion; nearby markets for goods; and nearby sources for raw product.
With Harrisburg poised for growth in steel production, The borough of Steelton became the ideal location for this type of industry.  It was a wide swath of flat land located south of the city, with rail and canal access running its entire 4 mile length.  There was plenty of room for houses and its own downtown section. Steelton was a company town, opened in 1866 by the Pennsylvania Steel Company.  Highly innovative in its steel making process, it became the first mill in the United States to make steel railroad rails by contract.  In its heyday Steelton was home to more than 16,000 residents from 33 different ethnic groups.  All were employed in the steel industry, or had employment in services that supported it.  In the late 19th century, no less than five major steel mills and foundries were located in Steelton. Each contained a maze of buildings; conveyances for moving the products; large yards for laying down equipment; and facilities for loading their product on trains. Stacks from these factories constantly belched smoke. With housing and a small downtown area within walking distance, these were the sights and smells that most Steelton residents saw every day.

The rail yard was another area of Harrisburg that saw rapid and thorough change during the years of industrialization. This was a wide expanse of about two dozen railroad tracks that grew from the single track of the early 1850s.  By the late 19th century, this area was the width of about two city blocks and formed what amounted to a barrier along the eastern edge of the city: passable only by bridge.  Three large and ornately embellished passenger depots were built by as many rail lines.  Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest rail line in Harrisburg.  It built huge repair facilities and two large roundhouses in the 1860s and 1870s to handle its enormous freight and passenger traffic and to maintain its colossal infrastructure.  Its rails ran the length of Harrisburg, along its eastern border.   It had a succession of three passenger depots, each built on the site of the predecessor, and each of high style architecture, including a train shed to protect passengers from inclement weather.  At its peak in 1904, it made 100 passenger stops per day.  It extended westward to Pittsburgh; across the entire state.  It also went eastward to Philadelphia, serving Steelton en route. The vital anthracite coal mines in the Allegheny Mountains were reached by the Northern Central Railroad.  The Lebanon Valley Railroad extended eastward to Philadelphia with spurs to New York City.  Another rail line was the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad which provided service to Philadelphia and other points east.<ref>Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p40</ref>

===Industrial decline 1920–70===
The decades between 1920 and 1970 were characterized by [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] and population shift from the city to the suburbs. Like most other cities which faced a loss of their industrial base, Harrisburg shifted to a service-oriented base, with industries such as health care and convention centers playing a big role. Harrisburg’s greatest problem was a shrinking city population after 1950.  This loss in population followed a national trend and was a delayed result of the decline of Harrisburg’s steel industry. This decline began almost imperceptibly in the late 1880s, but did not become evident until the early 20th century.

After being held in place for about 5 years by WWII armament production, the population peaked shortly after the war, but then took a long-overdue dive as people fled from the city.  Hastening the flight to the suburbs were the cheap and available houses being built away from the crime and deteriorating situation of the city. The reduction in city population coincided with the rise in population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area. The trend continued until the 1990s.<ref>Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p339</ref>

===Beginning of Harrisburg's suburbs: 1880s===

The gradual loss of industry, especially after WWII, coupled with the proliferation of the street car and later the automobile, led to urban flight to the suburbs.  Allison Hill was Harrisburg’s first suburb. It was located east of the city on a prominent bluff, accessed by bridges across a wide swath of train tracks.  It was developed in the late 19th century and offered affluent Harrisburgers the opportunity to live in the suburbs only a few hundred yards from their jobs in the City.  Easy access was achieved via the State Street Bridge leading east from the Capitol complex and the Market Street Bridge leading from the City’s prominent business district.  In 1886 a single horse trolley line was established from the city to Allison Hill.  The most desirable section of Allison Hill was Mount Pleasant, which was characterized by large Colonial Revival style houses with yards for the very wealthy and smaller but still well-built row houses lining the main street for the moderately wealthy. State Street, leading from the Capitol directly toward Allison Hill, was planned to provide a grand view of the Capitol dome for those approaching the City from Allison Hill. This trend towards outlying residential areas began slowly in the late 19th century and was largely confined to the trolley line, but the growth of automobile ownership quickened the trend and spread out the population.

===Early to late 20th century===
[[File:Anti-nuke rally in Harrisburg USA.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Anti-nuclear]] protest at Harrisburg in 1979, following the [[Three Mile Island accident]].]]
In the early 20th century, the city of Harrisburg was in need of change. Without proper sanitation, diseases such as [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] began killing many citizens of Harrisburg. Seeing these necessary changes, several Harrisburg residents became involved in the [[City Beautiful movement]]. [http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-3C4 Mira Lloyd Dock] spearheaded the movement with an impressive speech before the city’s Board of Trade. Other prominent citizens of the city such as  [[J. Horace McFarland]] and [[Vance McCormick]] advocated urban improvements which were influenced by European urban planning design and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. [[Warren Manning]] was hired to help bring about these changes.  Specifically, their efforts greatly enlarged the Harrisburg park system, creating Riverfront Park, Reservoir Park, the Italian Lake and Wildwood Park.  In addition, schemes were undertaken for the burial of electric wires, the creation of a modern sanitary sewer system, and the beautification of an expanded [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex|Capitol complex]].

The [[Pennsylvania Farm Show]], the largest indoor agriculture exposition in the United States, was first held in 1917 and has been held every January since then. The present location of the Show is the [[Pennsylvania State Farm Show Arena]], located at the corner of Maclay and [[Cameron Street|Cameron]] streets.

In June 1972, Harrisburg was hit by a major flood from the remnants of hurricane [[Hurricane Agnes|Agnes]].

On March 28, 1979, the [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station|Three Mile Island]] nuclear plant, along the [[Susquehanna River]] located in Londonderry Township which is south of Harrisburg, suffered a partial meltdown. Although the meltdown was contained and radiation leakages were minimal, there were still worries that an evacuation would be necessary. Governor [[Dick Thornburgh]], on the advice of [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] Chairman [[Joseph Hendrie]], advised the evacuation "of pregnant women and pre-school age children ... within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility." Within days, 140,000 people had left the area.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tmi/stories/decade032889.htm A Decade Later, TMI's Legacy Is Mistrust] ''The Washington Post'', March 28, 1989, p. A01.</ref>

[[Stephen R. Reed]] was elected mayor in 1981 and served until 2009, making him the city's longest serving mayor. In an effort to end the city's long period of economic troubles, he initiated several projects to attract new business and tourism to the city. Several museums and hotels such as [[Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts]], the [[National Civil War Museum]] and the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton Harrisburg and Towers]] were built during his term, along with many office buildings and residential structures. Several semi-professional sports franchises, including the [[Harrisburg Senators]] of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]], the [[Harrisburg Heat (NPSL/MISL)|Harrisburg Heat]] indoor soccer club and the [[Harrisburg City Islanders]] of the [[USL Second Division]] began operations in the city during his tenure as mayor. While praised for the vast number of economic improvements, Reed has also been criticized for population loss and mounting debt. For example, during a budget crisis the city was forced to sell $8 million worth of Western and American-Indian artifacts collected by Mayor Reed for a never-realized museum celebrating the [[American West]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.pennlive.com/patriotnews/2007/05/160151-harrisburgs_western_artifacts.html|title=Harrisburg rounds up Western artifacts for auction&nbsp;– The Patriot News&nbsp;– Brief Article (May 2007)}}</ref>

Harrisburg's western boundary is formed by the west shore of the [[Susquehanna River]] (the Susquehanna runs within the city boundaries), which also serves as the boundary between [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]] and [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland]] counties. The city is divided into numerous neighborhoods and districts. Like many of Pennsylvania's cities and [[borough]]s that are at "build-out" stage, there are several townships outside of Harrisburg city limits that, although autonomous, use the name ''Harrisburg'' for postal and name-place designation. They include the townships of: [[Lower Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Paxton]], [[Middle Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Middle Paxton]], [[Susquehanna Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Susquehanna]], [[Swatara Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Swatara]] and [[West Hanover Township, Pennsylvania|West Hanover]] in Dauphin County. The borough of [[Penbrook, Pennsylvania|Penbrook]], located just east of [[Reservoir Park (Harrisburg)|Reservoir Park]], was previously known as East Harrisburg. Penbrook, along with the borough of [[Paxtang, Pennsylvania|Paxtang]], also located just outside the city limits, maintain Harrisburg zip codes as well. The [[United States Postal Service]] designates 26 zip codes for Harrisburg, including 13 for official use by federal and state government agencies.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_1_results.jsp| year=2007| title=Zip Code search for Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|first=| last=United States Postal Service| publisher=usps.gov/| accessdate = 2007-01-03}}</ref>

Since the 1950s, Harrisburg, along with other northeastern urban centers large and small, has experienced a declining population that is ultimately fueling the growth of its [[suburbs]], although the decline&nbsp;– which was very rapid in the 1960s and 1970s&nbsp;– has slowed considerably since the 1980s.<ref name="Eggert">"Harrisburg Industrializes, The coming of factories to an American community", Eggert, Gerald G.; The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993</ref> Unlike [[Sun Belt|Western and Southern states]], Pennsylvania maintains a complex system of municipalities and has very little legislation on either the annexation/expansion of cities or the consolidating of municipal entities.

Reversing fifty years of decline, 2004 Census Bureau estimates show that Harrisburg's population has actually grown. Between 2004 and 2006, Harrisburg gained 22 people. In 2006, the urban population of the Harrisburg area increased to 383,008 from 362,782 in 2000, a change of 20,226 people.<ref name="urbanpop">[http://proximityone.com/urbanpopulation.htm America's Urban Population: Patterns & Characteristics 2000-2009] Proximity, 2003 data, Retrieved January 21, 2004.</ref> In 2004 the Harrisburg area was listed with [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] and [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] as an urban agglomeration, or a contiguous area of continuously developed urban land,<ref name="urbanpop2">[http://proximityone.com/urbanagglomerations.htm America's Urban Agglomerations 2010] Proximity, Retrieved January 21, 2011.</ref> signifying a future merger of the York-[[Hanover, Pennsylvania|Hanover]] and [[Harrisburg metropolitan area]]s, which would create a metropolitan area of over 1 million.

===Culture===
[[File:Market Square in Harrisburg.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Harrisburg's [[Market Square, Harrisburg|Market Square]]. Formerly the site of a market in [[Downtown Harrisburg]], today it is a public transport hub and commercial center.]]
[[File:Kunkel Building Nov 10.JPG|thumb|right|170px|The Kunkel Building, built in 1913, was home to the [[Susquehanna Art Museum]] until December 2010.]]
Downtown Harrisburg has two major performance centers. The [[Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts]], which was completed in 1999, is the first center of its type in the United States where education, science and the [[performing arts]] take place under one roof. The Forum, a 1,763-seat concert and lecture hall built in 1930-31, is a state-owned and operated facility located within the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex|State Capitol Complex]]. Since 1931, The Forum has been home to the [[Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra]].

Beginning in 2001, downtown Harrisburg saw a surge of commercial nightlife development. This has been credited with reversing the city's financial decline, and has made downtown Harrisburg a destination for events from jazz festivals to Top-40 nightclubs.

Harrisburg is also the home of the annual [[Pennsylvania Farm Show]], the largest [[Agricultural show|agricultural exhibition]] of its kind in the nation. Farmers from all over Pennsylvania come to show their animals and participate in competitions. Livestock are on display for people to interact with and view. In 2004, Harrisburg hosted [[CowParade]], an international public [[art exhibit]] that has been featured in major cities all over the world. Fiberglass sculptures of cows are decorated by local artists, and distributed over the city center, in public places such as train stations and parks. They often feature artwork and designs specific to local culture, as well as city life and other relevant themes.

===Media===
The Harrisburg area has two daily newspapers. [[The Patriot-News]] is published in Harrisburg and has a tri weekly circulation of over 100,000. [[The Sentinel (Pennsylvania)|The Sentinel]], which is published in Carlisle, roughly 20&nbsp;miles west of Harrisburg, serves many of Harrisburg's western suburbs in [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland County]]. The [[Press and Journal (Pennsylvania)|Press and Journal]], published in Middletown, is one of many weekly, general information newspapers in the Harrisburg area. Harrisburg has several monthly community newspapers, including MODE Magazine (publishing since 1996), Urban Connection, and TheBurg. There are also numerous television and radio stations in the Harrisburg/[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]/[[York, Pennsylvania|York]] area, which makes up the 43rd largest media market in the nation.<ref name=tvjobs>{{cite web|title=Nielsen Media 2013-2014 Local Market Estimates|url=http://www.tvjobs.com/cgi-bin/markets/market2.cgi|publisher=Broadcast Employment Services|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref>  Only one non-municipal portal website exists for the city of Harrisburg, HarrisburgPA.com.

==Sports==
{{Main|Sports in South Central Pennsylvania}}
Harrisburg serves as the hub of professional sports in [[South Central Pennsylvania]]. A host of teams compete in the region including three professional baseball teams, the [[Harrisburg Senators]], the [[Lancaster Barnstormers]], and the [[York Revolution]].  The Senators are the oldest team of the three, with the current incarnation playing since 1987. The original Harrisburg Senators began playing in the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] in 1924.  Playing its home games at [[City Island (Pennsylvania)|Island Field]], the team won the league championship in the 1927, 1928, and 1931 seasons.  The Senators played a few more seasons before flood waters destroyed Island Field in 1936, effectively ending Eastern League participation for fifty-one years.  In 1940, Harrisburg gained an Interstate League team affiliated with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]; however, the team remained in the city only until 1943, when it moved to nearby [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and renamed the [[York Pirates]].  The current Harrisburg Senators, affiliated with the [[Washington Nationals]], have won the Eastern League championship in the 1987, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 seasons.

==Government==

===City of Harrisburg===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Pa state cap 2.gif|thumb|200px|right|State Capitol and adjacent government complex – from overhead.]] -->
{{Main|List of mayors of Harrisburg|Harrisburg City Council}}
Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]. City Government Center, the only city hall in the United States named for a [[Civil Rights Movement]] leader, serves as a central location for the administrative functions of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisburgpa.gov/visitors/centerCity/centralBusiness3.html|title=Central Business District overview}}</ref>
Harrisburg has been served since 1970 by the "[[Mayor-council government|strong mayor]]" form of municipal government, with separate executive and legislative branches. The Mayor serves a four-year term with no term limits. As the full-time chief executive, the Mayor oversees the operation of 34 agencies, run by department and office heads, some of whom comprise the Mayor's cabinet, including the Departments of Public Safety (police and fire bureaus), Public Works, Business Administration, Parks and Recreation, Incineration and Steam Generation, Building & Housing Development and Solicitor. The city has 721 employees (2003).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Harrisburg-Municipal-Government.html|title=Harrisburg:Municipal Government}}</ref> The current mayor of Harrisburg is [[Eric R. Papenfuse]] whose term expires January 2018.

There are seven [[Harrisburg City Council|city council]] members, all elected at large, who serve part-time for four-year terms. There are two other elected city posts, [[City Treasurer|city treasurer]] and [[Comptroller|city controller]], who separately head their own fiscally related offices.

The city government has been in financial distress for many years. It has operated under the state’s Act 47 provisions since 2011. The Act provides for municipalities that are in a state akin to bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCabe|title=Colwyn: Can this town be saved?|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150525_Colwyn__Can_this_town_be_saved_.html|accessdate=26 May 2015|publisher=Philadelphia Daily News|date=25 May 2015}}</ref>

====Property tax reform====
Harrisburg is also known nationally for its use of a two tiered [[Land value tax in the United States|land value taxation]]. Harrisburg has [[Land value tax|taxed land]] at a rate six times that on improvements since 1975, and this policy has been credited by its former mayor, [[Stephen R. Reed]], as well as by the city's former [[city manager]] during the 1980s with reducing the number of [[Abandoned property|vacant structures]] located in [[downtown Harrisburg]] from about 4,200 in 1982 to fewer than 500 in 1995.<ref name="earth">[http://www.earthrights.net/docs/success.html Pennsylvania's Success with Local Property Tax Reform: The Split Rate Tax] Earth Rights Institute. Hartzok, Alanna. 1995. Accessed February 12, 2010.</ref> During this same period of time between 1982 and 1995, nearly 4,700 more city residents became employed, the crime rate dropped 22.5% and the fire rate dropped 51%.<ref name="earth" />

Harrisburg, as well as nearly 20 other [[Pennsylvania]] cities, employs a ''two-rate'' or ''split-rate'' [[property tax]], which requires the taxing of the value of land at a higher rate and the value of the buildings and improvements at a lower one. This can be seen as a compromise between pure LVT and an ordinary property tax falling on real estate (land value plus improvement value).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/dl/1275_Hughes%20Final.pdf|author=Mark Alan Hughes|title=Why So Little Georgism in America: Using the Pennsylvania Case Files to Understand the Slow, Uneven Progress of Land Value Taxation|publisher=[[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]]|date=2006}}</ref> Alternatively, two-rate taxation may be seen as a form that allows gradual transformation of the traditional real estate property tax into a pure land value tax.

Nearly two dozen local Pennsylvania jurisdictions, such as Harrisburg,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcommonwealth.org/news/lvt-jurisdiction-rates |title= PA two-rate cities and rates as of Nov. 2009 |publisher=The Henry George Foundation of America|accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref> use two-rate property taxation in which the tax on land value is higher and the tax on improvement value is lower. In 2000, Florenz Plassmann and [[Nicolaus Tideman]] wrote<ref name="markovchain">"A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Effect of Two-Rate Property Taxes on Construction", Journal of Urban Economics, 2000, vol. 47, issue 2, p. 216-247</ref> that when comparing Pennsylvania cities using a higher tax rate on land value and a lower rate on improvements with similar sized Pennsylvania cities using the same rate on land and improvements, the higher land value taxation leads to increased construction within the jurisdiction.<ref>Oates, W. & Schwab, R. "The Impact of Urban Land Taxation: The Pittsburgh Experience." National Tax Journal L (March) 1-21. (1997)</ref><ref>Cord, S. "Taxing Land More Than Buildings: The Record In Pennsylvania." In C. Lowell Harriss, ed. 1983. The Property Tax and Local Finance. New York: The Academy of Political Science 172-179.</ref>

===Dauphin County===
[[File:Dauphin County Courthouse.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dauphin County Courthouse]] located along the [[Susquehanna River]] at Front and Market Streets in [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|downtown]] Harrisburg.]]

The [[trial court]] of general jurisdiction for Harrisburg rests with the [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Court of Dauphin County]] and is largely funded and operated by county resources and employees.

===Commonwealth of Pennsylvania===
{{Main|Government of Pennsylvania}}
{{See also|List of Pennsylvania state agencies}}
The [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex]] dominates the city's stature as a regional and national hub for government and politics. All administrative functions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are located within the complex and at various nearby locations.

The Commonwealth Judicial Center houses Pennsylvania's three [[appellate courts]], which are located in Harrisburg. The [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]], which is the court of last resort in the state, hears arguments in Harrisburg as well as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The [[Superior Court of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania]] are located here. Judges for these courts are elected at large.

===Federal government===
The [[Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse (Pennsylvania)|Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse]], located in downtown Harrisburg, serves as the regional administrative offices of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. A branch of the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]] is also located within the courthouse. Due to Harrisburg's prominence as the state capital, federal offices for nearly every agency are located within the city.

The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has a strong historic presence in the region. A large retired military population resides in [[South Central Pennsylvania]] and the region is home to a large [[United States National Cemetery|national cemetery]] at [[Indiantown Gap National Cemetery|Indiantown Gap]]. The federal government, including the military, is the top employer in the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].

Long-term plans for the region call for the commuter rail line to continue westward to [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland County]], ending at [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]]. In early 2005, the project hit a roadblock when the Cumberland County [[County commission|commissioners]] opposed the plan to extend commuter rail to the West Shore. Due to lack of support from the county commissioners, the Cumberland County portion, and the two new stations in Harrisburg have been removed from the project. In the future, with support from Cumberland County, the commuter rail project may extend to both shores of the [[Susquehanna River]], where the majority of the commuting base for the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area]] resides.<ref name="tcrpc">{{cite web| url=http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_05/corridorone.htm| year=2006| title=CorridorOne in the Harrisburg Region| publisher=Tri-County Regional Planning Commission| accessdate = 2007-01-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070101164656/http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_05/corridorone.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-01}}</ref>

In 2006, a second phase of the rail project designated CorridorTwo was announced to the general public. It will link [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|downtown]] Harrisburg with its eastern suburbs in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]] and [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] counties, including the areas of [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]], [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] and [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]], and the city of [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].<ref name="tcrpc"/> Future passenger rail corridors also include [[US Route 15|Route 15]] from the Harrisburg area towards [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], as well as the Susquehanna River communities north of Harrisburg, and the Northern [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna Valley]] region.<ref name="tcrpc"/>

===Intercity bus service===
The lower level of the Harrisburg Transport Center serves as the city's intercity [[Bus station|bus terminal]]. Daily bus services are provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], [[Trailways Transportation System|Bieber Tourways]], [[Trailways Transportation System|Capitol Trailways]], Fullington Trailways, and Susquehanna Trailways. They connect Harrisburg to other Pennsylvania cities such as [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]], and [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and nearby, out-of-state cities such as [[Baltimore]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], New York, [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and Washington, D.C., plus many other destinations via transfers.<ref name="hbg_trans">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_02/harrisburg_transport_center.htm |year=2007 |title=About the Harrisburg Transport Center |publisher=Tri-County Regional Planning Commission |accessdate=2007-02-01 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Curbside [[intercity bus service]] is also provided by [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] from the parking lot of the [[Harrisburg Mall]] in nearby [[Swatara Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Swatara Township]], with direct service to Philadelphia, [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], and Pittsburgh.

===Regional scheduled line bus service===
The public transit provider in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]], [[Rabbit Transit (York)|Rabbit Transit]], operates its RabbitEXPRESS bus service on weekdays between the city of York and both downtown Harrisburg and the main campus for [[Harrisburg Area Community College]]. The commuter-oriented service is designed to serve York County residents who work in Harrisburg, though [[reverse commute]]s are possible under the current schedule. Buses running this route make limited stops in the city of York and at two [[park and ride]]s along [[Interstate 83]] between York and Harrisburg before making various stops in Pennsylvania's capital city. As of May 2007, the RabbitEXPRESS operates three times in the morning and three times in the afternoon.

A charter/tour bus operator, R & J Transport, also provides weekday, scheduled route commuter service for people working in downtown Harrisburg. R & J, which is based in [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill County]], operates two lines, one between [[Frackville, Pennsylvania|Frackville]] and downtown Harrisburg and the other between [[Minersville, Pennsylvania|Minersville]], [[Pine Grove, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Pine Grove]], and downtown Harrisburg.

===Rail===
The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s main line from New York to Chicago passed through Harrisburg. The line was [[electrification|electrified]] in the 1930s, with the wires reaching Harrisburg in 1938. They went no further. Plans to electrify through to [[Pittsburgh]] and thence to Chicago never saw fruition; sufficient funding was never available. Thus, Harrisburg became where the PRR's crack expresses such as the [[Broadway Limited]] changed from electric traction to (originally) a [[steam locomotive]], and later a [[diesel locomotive]]. Harrisburg remained a freight rail hub for PRR's successor [[Conrail]], which was later sold off and divided between [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX]].

====Freight rail====

Norfolk Southern acquired all of Conrail's lines in the Harrisburg area and has continued the city's function as a freight rail hub. Norfolk Southern considers Harrisburg one of many primary hubs in its system, and operates 2 [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] (rail/truck transfer) yards in the immediate Harrisburg area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_7_201/ai_64337963|title=NS opens intermodal hub at Harrisburg – Norfolk Southern – Brief Article (July 2000) | work=Railway Age | date=July 1, 2000}}</ref> The [[Harrisburg Intermodal Yard]] (formerly called Lucknow Yard) is located in the north end of Harrisburg, approximately 3&nbsp;miles north of downtown Harrisburg and the Harrisburg Transport Center, while the [[Rutherford Intermodal Yard]] is located approximately 6&nbsp;miles east of downtown Harrisburg in [[Swatara Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Swatara Township, Dauphin County]]. Norfolk Southern also operates a significant [[classification yard]] in the Harrisburg area, the [[Enola Yard]], which is located across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg in [[East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania|East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County]].

====Intercity passenger rail====

[[Amtrak]] provides service to and from Harrisburg. The passenger rail operator runs its ''[[Keystone Service (Amtrak)|Keystone]]'' and ''[[Pennsylvanian (Amtrak)|Pennsylvanian]]'' services between New York, Philadelphia, and the [[Harrisburg Transportation Center]] daily. The ''Pennsylvanian'' route, which operates once daily, continues west to [[Pittsburgh]]. As of April 2007, Amtrak operates 14 weekday roundtrips and 8 weekend roundtrips daily between Harrisburg, [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], and [[Philadelphia 30th Street Station]]; most of these trains also travel to and from [[New York Penn Station]]. The [[Keystone Corridor]] between Harrisburg and Philadelphia was improved in the mid-first decade of the 21st century, with the primary improvements completed in late 2006. The improvements included upgrading the electrical catenary, installing continuously welded rail, and replacing existing wooden railroad ties with concrete ties. These improvements increased train speeds to 110&nbsp;mph along the corridor and reduced the travel time between Harrisburg and Philadelphia to as little as 95 minutes. It also eliminated the need to change locomotives at 30th Street Station (from diesel to electric and vice versa) for trains continuing to or coming from New York. As of Federal Fiscal Year 2008, the Harrisburg Transportation Center was the 2nd busiest Amtrak station in Pennsylvania and 21st busiest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/PENNSYLVANIA08.pdf| year=2008| title=Amtrak Passenger Station Factsheet| publisher=Amtrak| accessdate=2009-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Title_Image_Copy_Page&c=am2Copy&cid=1081442674300&ssid=542| year=2008|title=Amtrak National Facts| publisher=Amtrak| accessdate=2009-04-24}}</ref>

===Bridges===
[[Image:Walnut street br1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Western span of the [[Walnut Street Bridge (Harrisburg)|Walnut Street Bridge]] crossing the [[Susquehanna River]], after it collapsed during the 1996 [[North American blizzard of 1996|flood]].]]
{{See also|List of crossings of the Susquehanna River}}
Harrisburg is the location of over a dozen large bridges, many up to a mile long, that cross the Susquehanna River. Several other important structures span the [[Paxton Creek]] watershed and [[Cameron Street]], linking [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Center City]] with neighborhoods in [[East Harrisburg]]. These include the [[State Street Bridge (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania)|State Street Bridge]], also known as the Soldiers and Sailor's Memorial Bridge, and the [[Mulberry Street Bridge]]. Walnut Street Bridge, now used only by pedestrians and cyclists, links the downtown and [[Riverfront Park (Harrisburg)|Riverfront Park]] areas with [[City Island (Pennsylvania)|City Island]] but goes no further as spans are missing on its western side due to massive flooding resulting from the North American blizzard of 1996.

==Education==

===Public schools===
{{main|Harrisburg School District (Pennsylvania)}}
The City of Harrisburg is served by the [[Harrisburg School District (Pennsylvania)|Harrisburg School District]]. The [[school district]] provides education for the city's youth beginning with all-day [[kindergarten]] through twelfth grade. A multi-year restructuring plan is aimed at making the district a model for urban [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The district has been troubled for decades with management fiascos and low test scores. In the summer of 2007, more than 2,000 city students were enrolled in educational programs offered by the Harrisburg School District as remediation.<ref>Patton, Judith, "Summer schools draw 2,000 Harrisburg students", PennLive, July 24, 2007.</ref> The District has been among the lowest ranking districts for academics in the Commonwealth, ranking 492nd out of 496 district ranked by the [[Pittsburgh Business Times]], in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/print-edition/2014/04/11/school-guide-offers-vital-insights.html |title=School guide offers vital insights |author=Ethan Lott |publisher=Pittsburgh Business Times |date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, several of the Harrisburg School District's school have been listed on the lowest 15% achievement list each year since 2011. This designation means the students qualify for the State's Opportunity Scholarship program. Scholarships, funded by businesses, are available to attend another public school district or a private school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newpa.com/find-incentives-apply-for-funding/ostc-faq |title=Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program FAQ |author=Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development |date=April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/school_services_office/9153/p/1202312 |title=Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=April 21, 2014}}</ref> One school in the Harrisburg School District has had consistently adequate academic achievement, Math Science Academy serves pupils grades 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paschoolperformance.org/Profile/5658 |title=Math Science Academy |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=November 6, 2014}}</ref>

In 2003, [[SciTech High]], a regional math and science magnet school (affiliated with [[Harrisburg University of Science and Technology|Harrisburg University]]), opened its doors to local students.

;Public Charter Schools:
The city also has several public [[charter school]]s: [[Infinity Charter School]], [[Sylvan Heights Science Charter School]], [[Premier Arts and Science Charter School]] and [[Capital Area School for the Arts]].  A growing number of statewide, virtual, public charter schools provide residents with many alternatives to the bricks and mortar public school system. The cyber charter school [[Commonwealth Connections Academy Cyber School]] is headquartered in Harrisburg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paschoolperformance.org/Profile/7144 |title=Commonwealth Connections Academy Cyber School Fast Facts 2014 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=November 6, 2014}}</ref>

The [[Central Dauphin School District]], the largest public school district in the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and the 13th largest in Pennsylvania, has several Harrisburg postal addresses for many of the District's schools. [[Steelton-Highspire School District]] borders much of the Harrisburg School District.

===Private schools===
Harrisburg is home to an extensive Catholic educational system. There are nearly 40 parish-driven elementary schools and seven Catholic high schools within the region administered by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg]], including [[Bishop McDevitt High School (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania)|Bishop McDevitt High School]] and [[Trinity High School (Camp Hill, Pennsylvania)|Trinity High School]]. Numerous other private schools, such as [http://www.thelondonderryschool.org/ The Londonderry School] and [[The Circle School]], which is a [[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury Model]] school, also operate in Harrisburg.

==Notable people==

Since the early 18th century, Harrisburg has been home to many people of note. Because it is the seat of government for the state and lies relatively close to other urban centers, Harrisburg has played a significant role in the nation's political, cultural and industrial history. "Harrisburgers" have also taken a leading role in the development of Pennsylvania's history for over two centuries. Two former U.S. Secretaries of War, [[Simon Cameron]] and [[Alexander Ramsey]] and several other prominent political figures, such as former speaker of the house [[Newt Gingrich]], hail from Harrisburg. The actor [[Don Keefer]] was born near Harrisburg, along with the actor Richard Sanders, most famous for playing Les Nessman in WKRP in Cincinnati . Many notable individuals are interred at [[Harrisburg Cemetery]] and [[East Harrisburg Cemetery]].
