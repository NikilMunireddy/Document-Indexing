Hamadan province is one of the most ancient parts of Iran and its civilization. Relics of this area confirm this fact. Today's Hamedan is what is left of [[Ecbatana]], The [[Medes]]' capital before they formed a union with the Persians. The poet [[Ferdowsi]] says that Ecbatana was built by King Jamshid.

According to historical records, there was once a castle in this city by the name of Haft Hessar (Seven Walls) which had a thousand rooms and its grandeur equalled that of the Babylon Tower.

The structures of city are related to ''Diya Aku'', a King of the [[Medes]] from 700 BC. According to Greek records, this territory was called 'Ekbatan' and 'Hegmataneh' by this King, thus transformed into a huge capital.

During the [[Parthia]]n era, [[Ctesiphon]] became capital of Persia, and Hamedan became the summer capital and residence of the Parthian rulers. After the Parthians, the [[Sassanid]]s constructed their summer palaces in Hamedan as well.

In the year 633 when the war of [[Nahavand]] took place and Hamadan came into the hands of the invading Arabs, at times it thrived and at times it declined and witnessed hardships. During the [[Buwayhids]], it suffered plenty of damages. In the 11th century, the [[Seljuks]] shifted their capital from [[Baghdad]] to Hamadan once again.

The city of Hamadan was always at risk during the rise and fall of powers. It was completely destroyed during the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] invasion. But during the [[Safavid]] era the city thrived once more. In the 18th century, Hamadan surrendered to the [[Ottomans]], but Hamadan was retaken by [[Nader Shah Afshari]], and under the peace treaty between Iran and the Ottomans it was returned to Iran.

The city of Hamadan lay on the [[Silk Road]] and even in recent centuries enjoyed good prospects in commerce and trade being on the main road network in the western region of [[Iran]].

According to local Jewish traditions, the City of Hamedan is mentioned in the [[Bible]], as the capital of Ancient Persia in the days of King [[Ahasuerus]] in the [[Book of Esther]].  It was then known as [[Shushan]].  The Tombs of [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]] are located in modern-day Hamadan.
