'''AFC Wimbledon''' is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Greater London]], England. After the [[2016 Football League play-offs#League Two|2016 League Two play-offs]], the club was promoted to [[Football League One|League One]] of [[the Football League]], the third tier in the [[English football league system]]. They play at [[Kingsmeadow]], in Kingston upon Thames, a ground which is shared with [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]].

The club was founded by [[Wimbledon F.C.]] supporters in June 2002 as a direct reaction to the decision by an independent three-man commission appointed by [[the Football Association]] to allow Wimbledon F.C. to [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|relocate]] to [[Milton Keynes]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], about 56 miles north of Wimbledon. The large majority of Wimbledon F.C. supporters very strongly opposed the idea of moving the club so far away from Wimbledon, feeling that a club transplanted to Milton Keynes would no longer represent Wimbledon F.C.'s legacy and traditions,<ref name=reportfansviews>{{cite book

{{main|Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes}}

On 28 May 2002, [[the Football Association]] backed a three-man independent commission decision to allow [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] to [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|relocate]] 56 miles north to the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] of [[Milton Keynes]] in Buckinghamshire after claims from Wimbledon chairman Charles Koppel that such a move was necessary in order to prevent the club from going bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/3010879/Inside-Sport-Hammam-cast-in-villains-role-as-Dons-seek-happy-ending.html|title=Inside Sport: Hammam cast in villain's role as Dons seek happy ending

====The Combined Counties League years (2002–2004)====
In the [[2002–03 AFC Wimbledon season|2002–03]] season, AFC Wimbledon competed in the [[Combined Counties Football League|Combined Counties League Premier Division]]  under the management of former Wimbledon F.C. player [[Terry Eames]], who was appointed as AFC Wimbledon's first manager on 13 June 2002.<ref>{{cite web|author=Will Buckley |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/jul/14/sport.comment |title=A club is born &#124; Football &#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date=14 July 2002 |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> The first ever game, a pre-season friendly against [[Sutton United F.C.|Sutton United]] on 10 July 2002, resulted in a 4–0 loss in front of an astonishingly large attendance for this level of 4,657.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/-/reports/friendly--senior/1948/sutton-united|title=AFC Wimbledon match report vs. Sutton United|accessdate=23 November 2007|date= 10 July 2002|publisher= AFC Wimbledon| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071205043610/http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/-/reports/friendly--senior/1948/sutton-united| archivedate= 5 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> At the end of their debut season, AFC Wimbledon finished third in the league and narrowly failed to win promotion to the [[Isthmian League|Isthmian League First Division]], despite a strong end to the season that involved winning their final eleven league fixtures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/archive.php?squad=1&Psection_id=5&Psub_section_id=36&op=Viewby&season=2002|title=Combined Counties Football League Premier Division league table 2002–03|accessdate=23 November 2007|publisher= AFC Wimbledon| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071111070740/http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/archive.php?squad=1&Psection_id=5&Psub_section_id=36&op=Viewby&season=2002| archivedate= 11 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In [[2003–04 AFC Wimbledon season|2003–04]], AFC Wimbledon won their first 21 league games before a 2–2 draw against [[Sandhurst Town F.C.|Sandhurst Town]] on 10 January 2004, giving them 32 consecutive wins in league games over two seasons. Despite the success on the pitch, however, Manager [[Terry Eames]] was suspended as manager on 13 February 2002 (and ultimately sacked on 18 February) on the grounds of "gross misconduct" after evidence was produced which showed him to have firstly made unauthorised and untrue representations to a number of the coaching staff, secondly, that he had falsely informed members of the coaching staff that the club had decided not to support his plans for youth football and required him to make immediate budgetary cut-backs and thirdly that he dispensed with the services of members of the coaching staff citing untrue reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/non-league-notebook-70220.html|title=AFC Wimbledon sack eames for 'gross misconduct'  |accessdate=15 May 2016 |publisher=independent.co.uk}}</ref> Assistant manager Nick English took charge with immediate effect.

The [[2005–06 AFC Wimbledon season|2005–06]] season proved far more competitive than previous seasons – as after winning their first few games, AFC Wimbledon found themselves struggling to remain in the [[Play-off (association football)|play-off]] places. After fluctuating form they eventually reached the play-offs after a 1–0 win against Anderson's former club, [[Hendon F.C.|Hendon]], on 22 April 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wimbledonheritage.co.uk/livematch.php?Psection_id=5&Psub_section_id=11&fixture_id=5214&squad=1| title=Hendon 0 – 1 AFC Wimbledon |accessdate=24 November 2007|date= 12 May 2006|publisher= wimbledonheritage.co.uk| archiveurl= http://wimbledonheritage.co.uk/livematch.php?Psection_id=5&Psub_section_id=11&fixture_id=5214&squad=1|archivedate= 5 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, a 2–1 defeat at [[Fisher Athletic F.C.|Fisher Athletic]] on 2 May 2006 prevented the club from achieving three back-to-back promotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wimbledonheritage.co.uk/livematch.php?Psection_id=5&Psub_section_id=11&fixture_id=8703&squad=1|title=Fisher Athletic 2 – 1 AFC Wimbledon|accessdate=17 February 2013|publisher= wimbledonheritage.co.uk<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Dons once again reached the final of the [[Surrey Senior Cup]], however, this time they were narrowly defeated 1–0 by [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]] in a fiercely contested derby.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/-/reports/surrey-senior-cup/8689/kingstonian|title=Match report for Surrey Senior Cup vs. Kingstonian|accessdate=24 November 2007|date= 12 May 2006|publisher= AFC Wimbledon| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071205220847/http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/-/reports/surrey-senior-cup/8689/kingstonian| archivedate= 5 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Much of the [[2006–07 AFC Wimbledon season|2006–07]] season was overshadowed by the threat of a proposed 18-point deduction by [[The Football Association|the FA]] for the club's fielding of [[Jermaine Darlington]] who, it transpired, had not been registered correctly by the club and had therefore played in three games whilst still ineligible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/6339377.stm|title=AFC Wimbledon deducted 18 points|accessdate=24 September 2012 |publisher= BBC Football <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, this punishment was eventually reduced to a 3-point deduction and a £400 fine on appeal after the FA finally acknowledged that the club had made a simple administrative error.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/6496543.stm|title=FA cuts AFC Wimbledon punishment|accessdate=24 September 2012 |publisher= BBC Football <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The 'Darlington affair' also resulted in expulsion from the [[Surrey Senior Cup]] and the [[FA Trophy]] that year.

===Football League (2011–present)===

====League Two (2011–2016)====

The [[2011–12 AFC Wimbledon season|2011–12]] season marked AFC Wimbledon's first in the Football [[League Two]]. The team started the season well, winning 7 out of their first 12 matches, but failed to keep the momentum going and had a poor run, eventually finishing the season ranking 16th, ten points clear of the [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] zone.

The [[2012–13 AFC Wimbledon season|2012–13]] campaign marked the 10th anniversary of AFC Wimbledon's inaugural season. After an abysmal start to the season, manager [[Terry Brown (football manager)|Terry Brown]] was sacked on 19 September 2012 along with assistant manager [[Stuart Cash]], with AFC Wimbledon sitting just above the [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] zone.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-for-sep-19-377804.aspx|title=Terry and Stuart depart|accessdate=19 September 2012 |publisher= AFC Wimbledon}}</ref> First team coach [[Simon Bassey]] took over as [[caretaker manager]] with immediate effect.

The Dons secured their [[Football League]] status on the final day of the [[2012–13 AFC Wimbledon season|2012–13]] season, despite having started the day in the [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] zone, by beating [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]] 2–1 at [[Kingsmeadow]] on 27 April 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22229082|title=AFC Wimbledon 2–1 Fleetwood Town |accessdate=27 April 2013 |publisher=BBC Football}}</ref>

====League One (2016–present)====

The [[2016–17 AFC Wimbledon season|2016–17]] season will see AFC Wimbledon compete in [[League One]] for the first time.

==Crest and colours==
The club crest, which is based on the coat of arms of the [[Municipal Borough of Wimbledon]], features a black double headed eagle in reference to a local legend that [[Julius Caesar]] once made camp on [[Wimbledon Common]], this symbol being his own attributed coat of arms. The crest is designed to replicate, as closely as legally possible, the crest of the original Wimbledon F.C. in order to reflect the fact that AFC Wimbledon see themselves as a continuation of the club that existed before relocation and renaming as [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]].

The colours that were chosen for the AFC Wimbledon kit were the [[royal blue]] and yellow associated with the rise of the original Wimbledon F.C. to the top of the Football League (rather than the [[navy blue]] and yellow that Wimbledon F.C. were wearing at the time, adopted in 1993). The first kit ever used, during only in the pre-season friendlies of 2002, consisted of a blue shirt, white shorts and white socks. Since then the home kit has been predominantly all royal blue with yellow detailing. The away kit used between 2002 and 2004 was white, however since then it has usually been predominantly yellow with blue detailing.

To mark their first game in the [[Football League]] on 6 August 2011 against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], the team wore a white and blue commemorative kit based on that worn by the original Wimbledon F.C. during [[1977–78 in English football|1977–78]] in order to remember their own first season as a member of the Football League, in the old Fourth Division (now [[Football League Two|League Two]]). To prevent copyright infringement, a single blue stripe replaced the three trade mark stripes of the [[Adidas]] original and the shirts were emblazoned with a modified crest for the occasion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2011-2012/league-two.html|title=AFC Wimbledon Kit |accessdate=30 March 2012|date= 30 March 2012|publisher= historicalkits.co.uk| archiveurl=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2011-2012/league-two.html| archivedate= 30 March 2012 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Sponsorship and kit manufacturer==
AFC Wimbledon have been sponsored by computer games developers [[Sports Interactive]], creators of the ''[[Championship Manager series|Championship Manager]]'' and ''[[Football Manager]]'' series, since the club's inception in 2002; the Football Manager logo features on the home kit whilst the SI logo appears on the team's away strip. SI managing director Miles Jacobson said of the sponsorship deal: "We are huge supporters of grass roots football. Most of us play grass roots football at some level (or in my case, below grass roots!), and we know that that is where the stars from tomorrow are going to come from."<ref name="sponsor">{{cite news |author=Tom Bramwell |title=Sports Interactive sponsors AFC Wimbledon |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=308 |publisher=GamesIndustry.biz |date=10 July 2002 |accessdate=21 June 2007 }}</ref> The idea for Sports Interactive sponsorship came from Nick Robinson, who was an employee at [[Eidos Interactive|Eidos]], Sports Interactive's then-publishers. However, Eidos were not willing to fund the deal, and so Sports Interactive found the cash themselves.<ref name="sponsor"/>

Paul Strank Roofing Ltd. first became a sponsor of AFC Wimbledon in 2006, Mr Strank being a lifelong Wimbledon F.C. supporter. In the Summer of 2008, in one of the club's biggest ever sponsorship agreements, the main stand at [[Kingsmeadow]] was renamed the Paul Strank Stand in honour of one of AFC Wimbledon's biggest benefactors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.paulstrankroofing.co.uk/paul-strank-roofing-in-the-community/sporting-sponsorship.html|title=Paul Strank Roofing Ltd.

The kit used by the club in its inaugural pre-season in 2002 was manufactured by [[Umbro]] and lent to the club by shirt sponsors Sports Interactive as the team strip supplied by Tempest Sports <ref>Marc Jones, designer of first 3 kits worn by AFC Wimbledon</ref> was not ready in time. However, from the [[2002–03 AFC Wimbledon season|2002–03]] season onwards the kit has been manufactured exclusively by Wimbledon-based company Tempest Sports. For this reason the South Stand at Kingsmeadow was known as the ''"Tempest End"'' between 12 August 2005 and 23 July 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wimbledonheritage.co.uk/news.php?Psection_id=2&Psub_section_id=2&op=archive&monthID=7&yearID=2005|title=The Tempest End|publisher=wimbledonheritage.co.uk|accessdate=11 August 2013 }}</ref>

On 11 February 2014 the club announced that their long standing agreement with Tempest Sports would come to an end, and a four-year deal was signed with British kit maker [[Admiral Sportswear]] to supply the clubs playing kits and training wear for the 2014/15 season onwards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/news/article/dons-new-kit-supplier-1353879.aspx|title=Dons announce new kit deal|accessdate=23 June 2014 }}</ref>

==Mascot==
[[File:Haydon-AFCWimbledon.JPG|right|thumb|"Haydon" the [[mascot]] of AFC Wimbledon.]]
From 2000 to June 2003, the original Wimbledon F.C. had used a [[The Wombles|Womble]] named ''"Wandle"'', named after the local [[River Wandle]], as a club mascot. However, in light of the controversy over the moving of the club to Milton Keynes, the licence to use the character was withdrawn by the Wombles' creator, [[Elisabeth Beresford]].<ref>{{cite news|title = Even the Wombles refuse to follow Wimbledon to Milton Keynes|work= [[The Guardian]]|date=13 May 2003|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2003/may/13/newsstory.sport|accessdate=14 August 2011|location=London|first=David|last=Plummer}}</ref>

In 2006, AFC Wimbledon agreed a licensing deal for a new [[mascot]] to represent the club, once again choosing the character of a Womble due to their famed association with Wimbledon Common. After a naming competition in which the final name was chosen by [[Elisabeth Beresford]] herself, the club announced that the new Womble would be known as ''"Haydon"'' after [[Haydons Road railway station|Haydons Road]], the nearest railway station to Wimbledon F.C.'s original home ground, [[Plough Lane]].

Haydon's first ever appearance at a home game was on 26 August 2006 at a 1–1 draw with [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]] in the [[Isthmian League|Isthmian League Premier Division]]. He made his on-field debut as a substitute in the Wimbledon Heroes v Chelsea Legends game on 7 May 2007. He wears the team's current home strip at Kingsmeadow fixtures, where he can be found every Saturday wandering around the terraces entertaining and encouraging fans. He has taken part in numerous events in order to raise money for charity, including running the [[London Marathon]] in 2010 and taking part in the [[Mascot Grand National]] in which he finished 19th in 2009. On 9 September 2012 Haydon helped raise funds for the Children's Liver Disease Foundation by taking part in the AFC Wimbledon Mascot Triathlon on Wimbledon Common. The event raised over £600 for the charity thanks to donations and sponsorship from local businesses.

==Rivalries==
The most obvious of AFC Wimbledon's rivals are [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]]. This is due to them both claiming to be the continuation of [[Wimbledon F.C.]] after the [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes]] in 2003. However, both sides claim that it is not a rivalry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/aaron-gratton/wimbledon-mk-dons_b_5504002.html|title=MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon Is No Rivalry|date=17 June 2014|work=The Huffington Post UK|first=Aaron|last=Gratton|access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref> To date, the two sides have met three times in cup competitions, all games at Milton Keynes, of which AFC Wimbledon have won one. Owing to Milton Keynes relegation from the Championship in the 2015/2016 season, the 2016/2017 season will see AFC Wimbledon and Milton Keynes Dons compete in the same league division for the first time. 

Another of AFC Wimbledon's main rivals are [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thechriswhitingshow.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/2012-football-rivalry-census-results/|title=2012-13 Football Rivalry Survey Results|work=The Chris Whiting Show|date=28 August 2012|access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref> This is largely due to their frequent meetings since 2009. The two sides did not play each other between 2012 and 2015 due to Crawley's promotion to League One. However Crawley's relegation during the [[2014–15 Football League One]] season means the two sides played each other on 15 August 2015 which the Dons won 2–1 after going a goal down.

AFC Wimbledon have had smaller rivalries with [[Carshalton Athletic]], [[Tooting & Mitcham United]] and [[Hampton & Richmond Borough F.C.|Hampton & Richmond]] from the club's non-league days. They groundshare with [[Kingstonian]], though they are not considered to be a rival as such.

The club's promotion to League One for the 2016-17 season will see league play against fellow South London sides [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].

===Ground purchase and debt===
Upon their foundation in 2002, AFC Wimbledon entered into a ground–sharing arrangement with [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]] to play home fixtures at [[Kingsmeadow]] in the neighbouring borough of [[Kingston upon Thames]].

Kingsmeadow had been the home of Kingstonian since the club moved there in 1989 from its traditional Richmond Road ground. However, the club had hit major financial difficulties following relegation from the Conference. Administrators sold the club, including the lease to the stadium, to businessman Rajesh Khosla and his son, Anup. The Khoslas subsequently transferred ownership of the stadium away from the club and into separate subsidiary companies privately owned by the Khosla family, in a move widely seen as [[asset stripping]].

After an [[Extraordinary general meeting|SGM]], it was felt by the AFC Wimbledon board of directors that securing ownership of Kingsmeadow would safeguard the ground for the future of both clubs. In March 2003 the Dons Trust members voted to purchase part of the lease for Kingsmeadow and in June 2003 the contract for buying the lease to the stadium was agreed with Rajesh Khosla;<ref>[http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/news.php?Psection_id=2&Psub_section_id=2&op=archive&monthID=4&yearID=2003 Open meeting re the purchase of Kingsmeadow] Sunday 18 May 2003</ref> £3 million needed to be raised. This purchase took place a few weeks before the proposed formation of the Kingstonian Supporters Trust which AFC Wimbledon's Supporters Trust had been advising. That trust itself would have considered purchasing the lease to the ground had it been able to raise the funds.

Various innovative methods of fundraising (primarily a share issue offer to supporters which quickly realised £1.2m, and the Dons Trust Bond) meant that the debt to Mr Khosla was steadily reduced. On 30 March 2006, a Dons Trust meeting was held at which a majority voted to accept a commercial loan from [[Barclays]] in order to clear the outstanding debt to Mr Khosla, which was at a much higher rate of interest. On 24 November 2006 a statement on the website finally confirmed that the club had taken the Barclays loan, and had repaid Mr Khosla in full. Although the club has now settled its debt to Mr Khosla, around £300,000 is still owed in the form of the commercial loan, with a further £300,000 to Dons Trust bondholders.

The club continues to work on new ways of fundraising to clear the debt once and for all. Meanwhile, the future of the ground is secured as a home venue both for AFC Wimbledon and equally importantly for Kingstonian F.C. Kingstonian lease the ground at a nominal rate, paid for in part by the proceeds of an annual [[Exhibition game|pre-season friendly]] between the two clubs, the [[Trevor Jones Memorial Trophy]]. However, AFC Wimbledon ceased to take part after 2008, from then on the competition was to take place between [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]], [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] and a squad from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].

===Expansion of Kingsmeadow===
At the end of the [[2011-12 AFC Wimbledon season|2011–12]] season, AFC Wimbledon commenced work on building a new 1,000 capacity all-seater stand to replace the existing Kingston Road End. This was completed by the 13 October 2012 game against [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] which saw an attendance of 4,409.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19854935|title=AFC Wimbledon 1-2 Cheltenham|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> The new stand was named the North Stand before being renamed The [[Nongshim]] Stand  and in July 2015 the [[John Green (author)|John Green]] Stand following sponsorship deals. The work increased the stadium capacity to approximately 4,850 with 2,265 seats.<ref name="footballgroundguide.com"/>

===Future relocation plans===
It is AFC Wimbledon's long term ambition to relocate to a stadium, with a capacity around 10,000 (with potential for expansion), in the [[London Borough of Merton]] where the original Wimbledon F.C. played at [[Plough Lane]] between 1912 and 1991.<ref name="guardian">{{cite journal| date = 7 July 2003 | title = Home Sweet Home | first = Mike | last = Simmonds| journal = The Wimbledon Guardian}}</ref>

On 7 August 2012,<ref name="afcwimbledon.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/news/article/planning-application-2083852.aspx|title=Planning application|author=Chris Slavin|publisher=}}</ref> AFC Wimbledon released a statement in which they announced their intent to return to their spiritual home of Plough Lane, 21 years after the original Wimbledon F.C. last played there on 4 May 1991. However, since the original Plough Lane was demolished in 2002 and later converted into a housing development, the club chose the site of [[Wimbledon Stadium]], which is now used as a greyhound track.<ref name="yourlocalguardian.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/topstories/9859310.AFC_Wimbledon_announce_plans_to_move_back_to_Plough_Lane/?ref=rss.stm|title=AFC Wimbledon announce plans to move back to Plough Lane|accessdate=19 August 2012|date= 7 August 2012|publisher= yourlocalguardian.co.uk}}</ref>

The proposals include building a stadium with an initial capacity of 12,000 with potential expansion for up to 22,000. It is estimated that the Plough Lane project, which the club believes could take "around 10 years" to complete, will cost somewhere in the region of £100m to build on the five hectare (12.35 acre) site.

Erik Samuelson announced "We have entered a competition with other bidders to buy the Stadium from current owners, the Greyhound Racing Association, and now we hope to win it. This would be a fantastic next step in our journey. It's not the only site in Wimbledon but it is our preferred site by some distance." However, Stephen Alambritis, leader of Merton Council, said that although he welcomed the football club's plans for Wimbledon Stadium he warned they would face competition from other parties.<ref name="yourlocalguardian.co.uk"/>

On 14 November 2014,<ref name="afcwimbledon.co.uk"/> AFC Wimbledon announced they had submitted a planning application to Merton Council seeking permission to build a stadium with an initial capacity of 11,000 with permission to extend this to 22,000.  The planning application also seeks permission to build 600 residential units, along with retail and commercial space and a leisure club.  Planning permission to develop the new stadium and associated development was granted on the 11th December 2015.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> At the same time, the club reached a deal, backed by its own supporters to sell the [[Kingsmeadow]] ground to [[Chelsea F.C.]], who will use the ground for its youth teams and [[Chelsea L.F.C.|women's football team]].<ref name="mattlewis"/><ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/><ref name="simonjohnson"/>

==Ownership and legal status==
AFCW [[Public limited company|plc]] was placed under the ownership of The Dons Trust, a supporters' group which is pledged to retain at least 75% control of that ownership. In 2003 a minority interest was sold in a share issue in order to finance the purchase of Kingsmeadow, the ground that AFCW part owned with [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]]; given the circumstances of the club's formation, this decision raised concerns among some members but was quickly accepted.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The Dons Trust is an [[industrial and provident society]] registered with the [[Financial Services Authority]] as "Wimbledon Football Club Supporters' Society Limited". This is not to be confused with Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association (WISA) although WISA has as one of its stated constitutional aims "to purchase shares in AFC Wimbledon's holding company".

The chief executive is lifelong fan Erik Samuelson, a retired accountant, who carries out his full-time duties in return for the nominal sum of one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] a year, because "it sounded posher than a pound".<ref>{{cite news

==Community work==
The club places very great emphasis on its role as a social focus for the entire local community, and part of this role is to offer the chance to play football to all. For this reason AFC Wimbledon established the Community Football Scheme (CFS) in 2004. On 1 May 2010, AFC Wimbledon's Community Football Scheme was awarded the FA Charter Standard Community Club Award, the highest graded award attainable in the FA Charter Standard Club Programme, in recognition of the club's outstanding coaching facilities in the local community. The club offer a number of different football courses open to children of any ability aged 4–14, where they can learn new skills and develop their confidence and talent in a fun and enjoyable coaching environment, receiving quality coaching from FA qualified coaches. The club aim to reach as many children as possible through their football and multi-sports programme by having vital links with their surrounding boroughs, most notably [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] and [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], which has allowed them to become one of the main providers of sports coaching in their local community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afcwimbledoncfs.wordpress.com/about-2/|title= AFC Wimbledon Community Football Scheme|accessdate=25 August 2012 |publisher= AFC Wimbledon <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

AFC Wimbledon also offers a Schools Coaching Programme in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] and neighbouring boroughs. The club look to encourage a healthy and active lifestyle for both Primary and Secondary school children through football and a range of other sports. The sessions are run with an emphasis on learning, development and health awareness in a fun coaching environment. On 15 March 2012, coaches from the CFS, in partnership with the [[Football League|Football League's]] main sponsor [[RWE npower|nPower]], engaged in a community outreach scheme promoting the FA's 'Respect' campaign to school pupils. Nearly 2,000 children aged 10 and 11 were taught how abusive verbal and physical behaviour on the pitch to both players and referees should never be tolerated under any circumstances. The aim of the nationwide 'Respect' scheme in schools is to eradicate racism, homophobia, violence and dissent from the next generation of footballers and supporters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/news/9588192.AFC_Wimbledon_coaches_call_for_Respect_in_schools/|title= AFC Wimbledon coaches call for Respect in schools|accessdate=16 September 2012 |publisher= Wimbledon Guardian <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On 27 March 2012, AFC Wimbledon became the first football club to be presented with the Prime Minister's Big Society Award by Minister for Sport and the Olympics [[Hugh Robertson (politician)|Hugh Robertson]] for outstanding contributions to the local community. The club was recognised for the honour because it offers a wide range of community development schemes including 19 youth and women's teams, school health and sport projects (hundreds of children a week participate in the outreach schemes provided) and a range of innovative activities, including a stadium school to help children get to grips with maths by using football as a teaching aid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/afc-wimbledon-wins-the-big-society-award//|title=AFC Wimbledon wins the Big Society Award |accessdate=27 March 2012|date= 27 March 2012|publisher= 10 Downing Street| archiveurl=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/afc-wimbledon-wins-the-big-society-award//| archivedate= 27 March 2012 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Congratulating AFC Wimbledon on receiving the award, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] was quoted as saying:

{{quote|The team behind AFC Wimbledon have not just given fans a local club to support, but much more than this, they have united a community, given them the chance to have a real stake in their club's future and made a huge difference to the lives of many people in the area at the same time. Football is a team game, and AFC Wimbledon have shown just what can happen when people don't just sit on the sidelines, but choose to get involved and really pull together – a great example of the [[Big Society]]. Congratulations to AFC Wimbledon and all their fans and supporters whose determination and devotion has created a community-owned club that has gone from strength to strength.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/afc-wimbledon-wins-the-big-society-award|title= AFC Wimbledon wins the Big Society Award|accessdate=4 May 2016 |publisher= Prime Minister's Office <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>}}

Accepting the award, Erik Samuelson, chief executive of AFC Wimbledon stated:

{{quote|This club's achievements show that a co-operatively owned football club can be faithful to its high ethical standards, keep a keen focus on community involvement, be financially sustainable – and still be successful on the pitch. Everyone who has contributed to the club's success and this award should be very proud.|Erik Samuelson|statement on the Number 10 official website<ref name="AFC Wimbledon wins the Big Society Award">[http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/afc-wimbledon-wins-the-big-society-award//AFC Wimbledons wins the Big Society Award].</ref>}}

===Notable former players===
{{For|a list of all AFC Wimbledon players with articles on Wikipedia|Category:AFC Wimbledon players}}

As part of WISA's campaign to reclaim the history of Wimbledon Football Club for the community of Wimbledon, the Wimbledon Old Players Association (WOPA) was formed in 2005. Membership of WOPA is open to all former Wimbledon F.C. and AFC Wimbledon players and managers. Among the sixty founding members were [[Glenn Mulcaire]], who scored AFC Wimbledon's first ever goal in 2002<ref name="Crane, Rob">{{cite web | url=http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/matches/reports/bromley170702.html | title=Match report Wednesday 10 July 2002 Pre-season friendly Bromley 2 – 1 AFC Wimbledon | publisher=AFC Wimbledon Official Website | date=10 July 2002 | accessdate=6 September 2011 | author=Crane, Rob}}</ref> and Kevin Cooper, who remains the club's all-time highest goal scorer with 107 goals between August 2002 and May 2004, as well as retaining the title for the most goals scored in a season with 66 during [[2003-04 AFC Wimbledon season|2003–04]]. Others that joined included some of the legends of the old [[Wimbledon F.C.]] such as [[John Fashanu]], [[Dave Beasant]], [[Efan Ekoku]], [[Neil Sullivan]], [[Dave Bassett]], [[Wally Downes]], [[Marcus Gayle]], [[Neal Ardley]], [[Alan Kimble]], [[Andy Thorn (footballer)|Andy Thorn]], [[Roger Joseph]], [[Dickie Guy]], [[Allen Batsford]], Roger Connell, [[Ian Cooke (footballer)|Ian Cooke]], [[Roy Law]] and Steve Galliers.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/jul/14/sport.comment A club is born], Will Buckley, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 July 2002</ref> On 16 July 2006, WOPA fielded a team in the [[Masters Football|Masters Football Tournament]] at [[Wembley Arena]], with AFC Wimbledon's backing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisa.org.uk/wopa/news7.html|title=Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association news item re Wimbledon Old Players Association (WOPA)|accessdate=24 November 2007|date= 23 May 2006|publisher= Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080107205443/http://www.wisa.org.uk/wopa/news7.html| archivedate= 7 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The team included [[Carlton Fairweather]], [[Scott Fitzgerald (footballer, born 1969)|Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Marcus Gayle]], and [[Dean Holdsworth]].

Tony Milstead is the manager and the team competes in the [[London and South East Women's Regional Football League]].

Wimbledon Ladies' former player [[Sophie Hosking]] won an Olympic gold medal for [[Team GB]] in the women's lightweight double sculls at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012]] games. Hosking continues to be an avid supporter of AFC Wimbledon and demonstrated as such when she painted her fingernails in the club's royal blue and yellow colours for the Olympic final at [[Dorney Lake]] on 4 August 2012.
