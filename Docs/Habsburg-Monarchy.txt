{{History of Austria|marginright=0em}}
}}
The '''Habsburg Monarchy''' ({{lang-de|Habsburgermonarchie}}) or '''Empire''', occasionally also styled as the '''Danubian Monarchy''' (''Donaumonarchie''), is an unofficial [[wikt:appellation#English|appellation]] among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the junior [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]n branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] until 1780 and then by the successor branch of [[Habsburg-Lorraine]] until 1918. The Monarchy was a [[composite state]] composed of territories within and outside the [[Holy Roman Empire]], united only in the [[Personal union|person of the monarch]]. The dynastic capital was [[Vienna]], except from 1583 to 1611,<ref name=HHus/> when it was moved to [[Prague]]. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the [[Austrian Empire]], and from 1867 to 1918 as the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].<ref>Vienna website; http://www.wien-vienna.com/austrohungary.php</ref><ref name="Britannica AH">Encyclopedia Britannica online article Austria-Hungary; http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44386/Austria-Hungary</ref>

The head of the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg was often elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] until the Empire's dissolution in 1806; from 1415 until the empire's dissolution in 1806 only [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII of Bavaria]] was not a Habsburg ruler of Austria.<ref>Metropolitan Museum of Art; http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/habs/hd_habs.htm</ref><ref>University of Wisconsin; http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/holy%20roman%20empire.htm</ref> The two entities were never [[wikt:coterminous|coterminous]], as the Habsburg Monarchy covered many lands beyond the Holy Roman Empire, and most of the Empire was ruled by other dynasties. The Habsburg Monarchy did not usually include all the territories ruled by the Habsburgs. The senior branch [[Habsburg Spain|ruled Spain]] until 1700, but it is not usually included in the definition of "Habsburg Monarchy" after the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who divided the dynasty between its Austrian and Spanish branches upon his abdication in 1556.

==Origins and expansion==
The Habsburg family originated with the [[Habsburg Castle]] in modern [[Switzerland]], and after 1279 came to rule in [[Austria]] ("the Habsburg Hereditary Lands"). The Habsburg family grew to European prominence with the marriage and adoption treaty by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] at the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515, and the subsequent death of adopted [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in 1526.<ref name="HHus">"Czech Republic - Historic Centre of Prague (1992)" Heindorffhus, August 2007, [http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm HeindorffHus-Czech].</ref>

[[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Ferdinand of Austria]], the younger brother of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], was elected the next King of [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]]<ref name="Britannica2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204416/Ferdinand-I|title=Ferdinand I|work=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> following the death of [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the [[Battle of Mohács]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

==Terminology==
Names of the territory that (with some exceptions) finally became [[Austria-Hungary]]:
* Habsburg monarchy or Austrian monarchy (1526–1867): This was an unofficial, but very frequent name – even at that time. The entity had no [[Official#Adjective|official name]].
* [[Austrian Empire]] (1804–1867): This was the official name. Note that the German version is ''Kaisertum Österreich'', i.e. the English translation empire refers to a territory ruled by an [[emperor]], not just to a "widespreading domain".
* [[Austria-Hungary]] (1867–1918): This was the official name.<ref name="Adams2005">{{cite book|author=Simon Adams|title=The Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmm4J2Ug4o8C&pg=PA1974|date=30 July 2005|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1-58340-603-8|pages=1974–}}</ref><ref name="LACKEY1995">{{cite book|author=SCOTT LACKEY|title=The Rebirth of the Habsburg Army: Friedrich Beck and the Rise of the General Staff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sY9Pn3urkQ4C&pg=PA166|date=30 October 1995|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-03131-1|pages=166–}}</ref><ref name="Hodge2008">{{cite book|author=Carl Cavanagh Hodge|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Imperialism, 1800-1914: A-K|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtEZ7Zq7s-gC&pg=PA59|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33406-1|pages=59–}}</ref> An unofficial popular name was the Danubian Monarchy ({{lang-de|Donaumonarchie}}) also often used was the term ''Doppel-Monarchie'' ("Double Monarchy") meaning two states under one crowned ruler.
* [[Crownland]]s or [[crown land]]s (''Kronländer'') (1849–1918): This is the name of all the individual parts of the Austrian Empire (1849-1867), and then of Austria-Hungary from 1867 on. The Kingdom of Hungary (more exactly the Lands of the Hungarian Crown) was not considered a "crownland" after the establishment of Austria-Hungary 1867, so that the "crownlands" became identical with what was called the Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council (''Die im Reichsrate vertretenen Königreiche und Länder'').

The Hungarian parts of the Empire were called "[[Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of Saint Stephen]]" or "Lands of Holy (St.) Stephen's Crown" (''Länder der Heiligen Stephans Krone''). The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called "Lands of the St. Wenceslaus' Crown" (''Länder der Wenzels-Krone'').

Names of some smaller territories:
* Austrian lands (''Österreichische Länder'') or "Archduchies of Austria" (''Erzherzogtümer von Österreich'') - Lands up and below the [[Enns River|Enns]] (''ober und unter der Enns'') (996–1918): This is the historical name of the parts of the Archduchy of Austria that became the present-day Republic of Austria (''Republik Österreich'') on 12 November 1918 (after Emperor Charles I had abdicated the throne). Modern day Austria is a semi-federal republic of nine states (''Bundesländer'') that are: Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Vorarlberg and Burgenland and the Capital of Vienna that is a state of its own. [[Burgenland]] came to Austria in 1921 from Hungary. [[Salzburg]] finally became Austrian in 1816 after the Napoleonic wars (before it was ruled by [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|prince-archbishops of Salzburg]] as a sovereign territory).
:Vienna, Austria's capital became a state January 1, 1922, after being residence and capital of the Austrian Empire (''Reichshaupt und Residenzstadt Wien'') for the Habsburg monarchs for centuries. Upper and Lower Austria, historically, were split into "Austria above the Enns" and "Austria below the Enns" (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the [[Treaty of Teschen]] (1779) following the "War of the Bavarian Succession" by the so-called [[Innviertel]] ("[[Inn River|Inn]] Quarter"), formerly part of Bavaria.
* Hereditary Lands (''Erblande'' or ''Erbländer''; mostly used ''Österreichische Erblande'') or German Hereditary Lands (in the Austrian monarchy) or Austrian Hereditary Lands ([[Middle Ages]] – 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the "original" Habsburg Austrian territories, i.e. basically the Austrian lands and [[Carniola]] (not [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Italian territories or the [[Austrian Netherlands]]).<br /> In a wider sense the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were also included in (from 1526; definitely from 1620/27) the Hereditary lands. The term was replaced by the term "Crownlands" (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.<br /> The ''Erblande'' also included lots of small and smallest territories that were principalities, duchies or counties etc. some of them can namely be found in the reigning titles of the Habsburg monarchs like ''Graf'' (Earl/Count of) ''von Tyrol'' etc.

==Territories==
[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|left|560px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy]]

The territories ruled by the branch changed over the centuries, but the core always consisted of four blocs:
* The Hereditary Lands, which covered most of the modern states of [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], as well as territories in northeastern [[Italy]] and (before 1797) southwestern [[Germany]]. To these were added in 1779 the [[Innviertel|Inn Quarter]] of [[Bavaria]]; and in 1803 the [[Bishoprics]] of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the peace in 1815, with the exception of the [[Vorlande]]. The Hereditary provinces included:
** [[Archduchy of Austria]] ([[Upper Austria]]);
** [[Archduchy of Austria]] ([[Lower Austria]]);
** [[Duchy of Styria]];
** [[Duchy of Carinthia]];
** [[Duchy of Carniola]];
** The Adriatic port of [[Trieste]];
** [[Istria]] (although much of Istria was [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory until 1797);
** [[Gorizia and Gradisca]];
*** These lands (3–8) were often grouped together as [[Inner Austria]].
** The [[County of Tyrol]] (although the Bishoprics of Trent and Brixen dominated what would become the South Tyrol before 1803);
** The [[Vorarlberg]] (actually a collection of provinces, only united in the 19th century);
** The [[Vorlande]], a group of territories in [[Breisgau]] and elsewhere in southwestern Germany lost in 1801 (although the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] territories ([[Sundgau]]) which had formed a part of it had been lost as early as 1648);
*** Vorarlberg and the Vorlande were often grouped together as [[Further Austria]] and mostly ruled jointly with Tyrol.
** [[Grand Duchy of Salzburg]] (only after 1805);
* The [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] – initially consisting of the five lands: [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], [[March of Moravia]], [[Silesia]], and Upper and Lower [[Lusatia]]. Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] ({{lang-cs|zemský sněm}}) elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], later Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, as king in 1526.
** Lusatia was ceded to [[Saxony]] in 1635.
** Most of Silesia was conquered by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1740–1742 and the remnants which stayed under Habsburg sovereignty were ruled as [[Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia]] (Austrian Silesia).
* The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] – two thirds of the former territory that was administered by the medieval Kingdom of Hungary was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Princes of vassal Ottoman [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Transylvania]], while the Habsburg administration was restricted to the western and northern territories of the former kingdom, which remained to be officially referred as the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. In 1699, at the end of the [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars]], one part of the territories that were administered by the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg administration, with some other areas being picked up in 1718 (some of the territories that were part of medieval kingdom, notably those in the south of the Sava and Danube rivers, remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman administration]]).

Over the course of its history, other lands were, at times, under Austrian Habsburg rule (some of these territories were [[secundogeniture]]s, i.e. ruled by other lines of Habsburg dynasty):
* The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] (1527–1868);
* The [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (1699–1868);
* The [[Transylvania|Grand Principality of Transylvania]], between 1699 ([[Treaty of Karlowitz]]) and 1867 ([[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Ausgleich]])
* The [[Austrian Netherlands]], consisting of most of modern [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] (1713–1792);
* The [[Duchy of Milan]] (1713–1797);
* The [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1713–1735);
* The [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1713–1720);
* The [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718–1739)|Kingdom of Serbia]] (1718–1739);
* The [[Banat of Temeswar]] (1718–1778);
* [[Oltenia]] (1718–1739, de facto, 1737), as Grand-Voivodate (sometimes designated as ''Valachia Caesarea'');
* The [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1720–1735);
* The [[Duchy of Parma]] (1735–1748);
* The [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in modern [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] (1772–1918)
* [[Duchy of Bukovina]] (1774–1918);
* [[New Galicia]], the Polish lands, including [[Kraków]], taken in the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] (1795–1809);
* [[Venetian Republic|Venetia]] (1797–1805);
* [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (1797–1805, 1814–1918);
* [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]] (1814–1859);
* [[Kraków]], which was incorporated into [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (1846–1918);
* The [[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848–1849); de facto entity, officially unrecognized
* The [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]] (1849–1860);
* The [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (1868–1918);
* [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Sanjak of Novi Pazar occupation]] (1878–1913);
* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1878–1918).

The boundaries of some of these territories varied over the period indicated, and others were ruled by a subordinate (secundogeniture) Habsburg line. The Habsburgs also held the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] between 1438 and 1740, and again from 1745 to 1806.

==Characteristics==
The various Habsburg possessions never really formed a single country—each province was governed according to its own particular customs. Until the mid 17th century, all of the provinces were not even necessarily ruled by the same person—junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at centralization began under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] and especially her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph's more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the long [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternichian]] [[Age of Metternich|period]] which followed.

An even greater attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutions of 1848]]. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary, in particular, ceased to exist as a separate entity, being divided into a series of districts. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Wars of 1859 and 1866, this policy was abandoned, and after several years of experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] was arrived at, by which the so-called Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary was given sovereignty and a parliament, with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands, often, but erroneously, referred to as "Austria," received their own central parliament (the ''Reichsrat'', or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name – the "Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council" – shows that they remained something less than a genuine unitary state. When Bosnia and Herzegovina were [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed]] (after a long period of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupation and administration]]), they were not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, they were governed by the joint ministry of finance.

Austria-Hungary collapsed under the weight of the various unsolved ethnic problems that came to a head with its defeat in [[World War I]]. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], new republics of Austria (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] (the Magyar core of the old kingdom) were created, and the remainder of the monarchy's territory was shared out among the new states of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and [[Czechoslovakia]].

==Habsburg territories outside the Habsburg Monarchy==
{{see also|Spanish Empire}}
[[File:Habsburg dominions 1700.png|thumb|Habsburg territories in 1700. The Habsburg  Monarchy is shown in yellow, while the territories of the senior Spanish Habsburgs are shown in red.]]
The Habsburg monarchy should not be confused with various other territories ruled at different times by members of the Habsburg dynasty. The senior Spanish line of the Habsburgs ruled over [[Habsburg Spain]] and various other territories from 1516 until it became extinct in 1700. A junior line ruled over [[Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in [[Würzburg]] from 1805 to 1814. Another line ruled the [[Duchy of Modena]] from 1814 to 1859, while [[Marie Louise of Austria|Empress Marie Louise]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis, ruled over the [[Duchy of Parma]] between 1814 and 1847. Also, the [[Second Mexican Empire]], from 1863 to 1867, was headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], the brother of Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria]].
