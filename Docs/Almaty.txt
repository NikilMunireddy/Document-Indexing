'''Almaty''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|m|ə|t|i}} ({{lang-kz|Алматы/Almatı}} {{IPA-kz|ɑlmɑˈtə|}}; {{lang-ru|Алматы}}), formerly known as '''Alma-Ata''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|m|ə|.|ə|ˈ|t|ɑ:}} ({{lang-ru|Алма-Ата}}) and '''Verny''' ({{lang-ru|Верный}}), is the largest city in [[Kazakhstan]], with a population of 1,703,481 people, containing 9% of the country's total population. Almaty is considered a [[Global city|World City]] with a "Beta -" classification according to [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]].<ref>[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2012t.html]</ref> It served as capital of the Kazakh state in its various forms from 1929 to 1997, under the influence of the then [[Soviet Union]] and its appointees.<ref name="KazStat">{{cite web |url= http://stat.kz/digital/naselsenie/Pages/default.aspx |title= Население |publisher=Stat.kz |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref> Alma-Ata was the host city for a 1978 international conference on [[Primary healthcare|Primary Health Care]] where the [[Alma Ata Declaration]] was adopted, marking a paradigm shift in global public health. In 1997 the government relocated the capital to [[Astana]] in the north of the country.

Almaty continues as the major commercial and cultural centre of Kazakhstan, as well as its biggest population center. The city is located in the mountainous area of southern Kazakhstan in the foothills of the [[Trans-Ili Alatau]] at an elevation of 2,300–3,000 feet (700–900 m), where the Bolshaya and Malaya Almaatinka rivers run into the plain.<ref name="britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/place/Almaty-Kazakhstan "Almaty, Kazakhstan"], ''Encyclopedia Britannica''</ref>

==Status==

From 1929 to 1936 Almaty was the capital of [[Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh ASSR]]. From 1936 to 1991 it was the capital of Kazakh SSR. After Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, Almaty continued as the capital until 1997, when Astana was designated, a return to the historic capital.

Almaty remains the largest, most developed, and most ethnically and culturally diverse city in Kazakhstan. Due to development by the Soviet Union and relocation of workers and industries here from European areas of the Soviet Union during [[World War II]], the city has a high proportion of ethnic [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]]. The city is located in the foothills of [[Trans-Ili Alatau]] (or [[Trans-Ili Alatau|Zailiysky Alatau]]) in the extreme south-east.

It has a relatively mild climate with warm summers and quite cold winters. Since the city is located in a tectonically active area, it has an endemic risk of earthquakes. Although most do not cause any significant damage, Almaty has suffered some large destructive [[earthquake]]s.

In 1997 the capital was moved to [[Astana]] in the north-central part of the country. Since then Almaty has been referred to as the 'southern capital' of Kazakhstan.

==Toponymy==
The name ''Almaty'' has its roots in the medieval settlement ''Almatu'', that existed near the present-day city.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} A disputed theory holds that the name is derived from the [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] word for 'apple' (алма), and is often translated as "full of apples".  ''alma'' is also 'apple' in other Turkic languages, as well as in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] (under the influence of the Turkic languages). The English version of its name is Alma-Ata.

There is great [[genetic diversity]] among the [[wild apple]]s in the region surrounding Almaty; the region is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple. The wild ''[[Malus sieversii]]'' is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern [[apple|domestic apple]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/2961/  | last =Nabhan | first =Gary Paul | title =The Fatherland of Apples | date = May–June 2008 | work = Orion Magazine |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref>

The name of the city was written as آلماتي in Turkish and Persian written with the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] script.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Almaty}}

===Prehistoric Almaty===
During 1000–900 [[Before Christ|BC]] in the [[Bronze Age]], the first farmers and cattle-breeders established settlements in the territory of Almaty.<ref name="history"/> During the [[Saka]] period (from 700 BC to the beginning of the [[Common Era]]), these lands were occupied by the Saka and later [[Wusun]] tribes, who inhabited the territory north of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range. Evidence of these times can be found in the numerous burial mounds ([[Tumulus|tumuli]]) and ancient settlements, especially the giant burial mounds of the Saka [[tsar]]s. The most famous archaeological finds have been the "[[The Golden man]]", also known as "[[The Golden Warrior]]", from the [[Issyk Kurgan]]; the [[Zhalauly]] treasure, the [[Kargaly]] diadem, and the [[Zhetysu]] arts bronzes (boilers, lamps and altars). During the period of Saka and Wusun governance, Almaty became an early educational centre.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.almaty.kz/page.php?page_id=384&lang=2 |title=History of Almaty |publisher=Almaty.kz |accessdate=2 January 2012}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
During the [[Middle Ages]] (8–10th centuries), a city culture developed in Almaty. There was a transition to a settled way of living, the development of farming and handicrafts, and the emergence of a number of towns and cities in the territory of [[Zhetysu]].{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}  In the 10–14th centuries, settlements in the territory of the so-called "Greater Almaty" became part of the trade routes of the [[Silk Road]], which reached from China to western Asia and Europe. At that time, Almaty became one of the trade, craft and agricultural centres on the [[Silk Road]]. It had an official [[mint (coin)|mint]]. The city was first mentioned as ''Almatu'' in books from the 13th century.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

===15th–18th centuries===
In the 15th–18th centuries, the city was in decline as trade activities were decreasing on this part of the Silk Road. European nations were conducting more trade by shipping. This period was one of crucial ethnic and political transformations. The [[Kazakhs|Kazakh state and nation]] were founded here, close to Almaty.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

The [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] invaded, dominating the Kazakh people for a period. The Kazakh fought to protect their land and preserve independence. In 1730 the Kazakh defeated the Dzungar in the Anyrakay mountains, {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=off}} [[Ordinal directions|north-west]] of Almaty. During the eighteenth century, the city and region became part of the Russian Empire.

===Foundation of Verniy===
[[File:Zenkov cathedral.jpg|thumb|[[Ascension Cathedral, Almaty|Zenkov Cathedral]], a 19th-century [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] cathedral located in Panfilov Park, is the second-tallest wooden building in the world.<ref>Ness, Immanuel. ''Encyclopedia of World Cities''. M E Sharpe Reference, 1999. ISBN 0-7656-8017-3. Page 19.</ref>]]
To defend its empire, Russia built [[Fort]] ''Verniy'' near the Zailiysky Alatau mountain range between the Bolshaya and Malenkaya Almatinka rivers. Construction began on 4 February 1854 and was nearly completed by the autumn of that year. The fort was a wooden palisade, shaped like a pentagon, with one side built along the Malaya Almatinka. Later, the wood fence was replaced with a brick wall with embrasures. The main facilities were erected around the large square for training and parading.<ref>[http://lyakhov.kz/semirek/studies/150chron.shtml ] {{wayback|url=http://lyakhov.kz/semirek/studies/150chron.shtml |date=20130807024058 |df=y }}</ref>
[[File:Акимат Алматы на Площади Республики. Июль, 2015 года.JPG|thumb|223x223px|The former Presidential Palace]]

In 1855 Kazakhs displaced from their nomadic territory appeared in Verniy. Since 1856, Verniy started accepting Russian peasants. They founded the Bolshaya Almatinskaya Stanitsa ([[Cossack]] village) near the fortification. The inflow of migrants was increasing and led to construction of the Malaya Almatinskaya [[Stanitsa]] and Tatarskaya (Tashkentskaya) [[sloboda]]. It was the place of settlement for [[Tatar]] merchants and craftsmen.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

In 1867 Verniy Fort was developed as a town called ''Almatinsk''; the town soon returned to the name Verniy. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

According to the First City Plan, developed by administrators of the [[Russian Empire]], the city perimeters were {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=off}} on the south along Almatinka river, and {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=off}} on the west. The new city area was divided into residential parts, and the latter into districts. Three categories of city buildings were defined. Category I and II buildings were of one or two-storied construction with a high semi-basement; they were erected around and in the centre of the city, others on the [[Rural-urban fringe|outskirts]].{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}
[[File:Eternal fire.jpg|left|thumb|World War II monument "Feat" in Park of the 28 Panfilov Guardsmen]]
On 28 May 1887, at 4 a.m., an earthquake almost totally destroyed Verniy in 11–12 minutes. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Brick buildings were damaged the most, as they broke apart because of lack of flexibility. As a result, people were afterwards inclined to build one-storied buildings made of wood or [[adobe]].{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

By 1906, the population of the city had grown to 27,000, two-thirds of whom were Russians and Ukrainians.

===Soviet Era===
In 1918 following the Russian Revolution and establishment of the Bolshevik government, [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] power was established in Verniy. The city and the region became part of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR).{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}  On 5 February 1921 the government decided to rename Verniy to Alma-Ata, one of the ancient names of the area.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

====Revolution of 1917 to World War II====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

[[File:ПерекрестокАуэзоваОзтюркаАлмаАтаКазахстанОктябрь2014.JPG|left|thumb|Suburban region streets of Almaty.]]
In 1921, a joint consultation of regional government representatives, professional trade associations, and local faith-based groups was summoned in an effort to rename Verniy. Alma-Ata was the preferred choice.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

In 1926, the Council of Labor and Defence approved the construction of the [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] that was a crucial element of the future growth of Kazakhstan, especially in the east and southeast of the region. The [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] construction also had a decisive economic impact that strongly influenced the destiny of Alma-Ata as the capital of the [[Kazakh ASSR]]. In 1930 the construction of the highway and railway to Alma-Ata was completed.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}
[[File:ALAtwintowers.jpg|thumb|Rahat Towers are among the tallest buildings in Kazakhstan]]
On 29 April 1927, the government decided to transfer the capital of the [[Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] from [[Kyzyl-Orda]] to Alma-Ata, within the RFSFR.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}  This attracted more trade and people working with the government, stimulating intensive development in the city.

On 31 January 1928, [[Leon Trotsky]], leader of the 1917 [[October Revolution]], accompanied by his wife [[Natalia Sedova]] and his son Lev Sedov, was exiled to Alma Ata by [[Joseph Stalin]], then head of the [[Bolshevik party]] in [[Moscow]]. Trotsky was expelled from Alma-Ata to Turkey in February 1929, and went into exile in [[Mexico City]].

The Alma-Ata airport was opened in 1930, opening up a direct connection from Alma-Ata to [[Moscow]], the center of the Soviet government. Alma-Ata became the main entry by air to Kazakhstan, a status which it retains today. Transformation of this small town into the capital of the Kazakh SSR was accelerated by the large-scale construction of new administrative and government facilities and housing.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}} The Great Purge of the Stalin era extended to Kazakhstan, where numerous intellectuals, activists, leaders, teachers and others were killed. The Soviet government dominated the population. During the 1930s Kazakh nomads suffered starvation after disruption of their traditional living patterns.

[[File:Almaty 13.jpg|right|thumb|The Central Mosque of Almaty]]
In 1936 the Architecture and Planning Bureau developed a plan to enhance Alma-Ata as the new cultural capital of the Kazakh SSR. The plan was based on the existing rectangular system of districts. They were to be strengthened and reconstructed.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

====World War II====
During World War II the government dramatically affected the city's population and structures. To better organize the home front and concentrate industrial and material resources, the government evacuated 26,000 people and numerous industries from the European theatre of war. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Alma-Ata hosted over 30 industrial facilities removed from the European section of the [[USSR]], 8 evacuated hospitals, 15 institutes, universities and technical schools; and around 20 cultural institutions. Motion picture [[production companies]] from [[Leningrad]], [[Kiev]], and Moscow were also moved to Alma-Ata at this time.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}} This brought in so many ethnic Russians that the Kazakhs became a minority in the region.

Over 52,000 Alma-Ata residents received the title: ''Gratitude for Your Self-Denying Labour''. Forty-eight residents were granted the title of ''Hero of The Soviet Union''. Three rifle [[Division (military)|divisions]] were raised in Alma-Ata, including the well-known [[8th Guards Rifle Division]] '[[Ivan Panfilov|Panfilov]]' (originally the 316th rifle division), along with 2 rifle [[battalions]] and 3 aviation regiments that were raised on the bases of the air club of Alma-Ata.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

====Industrialisation in the Soviet period====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
After 1941, due to the mass evacuation of factories and workers from the European part of the [[Soviet Union]] during World War II, Alma-Ata became an administrative and trading centre. Although it had an underdeveloped industrial base it become one of the largest industrial centres of the Soviet Union. It was to the rear of the wartime fronts. {{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

During the years 1941–1945 the industrial potential of the city increased significantly. Development increased during the postwar years. The population of the city grew from 104,000 in 1919 to 365,000 in 1968. By 1967 the city had 145 enterprises, with the bulk of these being [[Light industry|light industrial]] and food industries.

The main industries in Alma-Ata were: food processing (36% of gross industrial output), based largely on locally abundant fruit and vegetable raw materials, light industry (31%), and heavy industry (33%). The main products of the region were:
*'''Food:''' Meat, flour and cereals (pasta factory), milk, wines, canned fruit, tobacco, confectionery, alcoholic spirits, beer, yeast, and tea (packaging)
*'''Light industry:''' textiles, fur, knitting, carpets, footwear, apparel, printing, and the Almaty Cotton combine.
*'''Heavy industry:''' electrical engineering, foundry engineering, car repair, bearing repair, building materials, woodworking, concrete structures and structural elements, and house-building.

From 1966 to 1971, 1,400,000 square metres of [[Public housing|public]] and [[Housing cooperative|cooperative housing]] were built. Annually, around 300,000 square metres of dwellings were under construction. Most of the buildings constructed during this time were [[Seismic analysis|earthquake-proof]] multi-storey buildings. The Soviet government tried to diversify architectural forms to create a more varied cityscape. During this period, many schools, hospitals, cultural, and entertainment facilities were constructed, including Lenin’s Palace, the [[Hotel Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan Hotel]], and the "[[Medeo]]" sports complex.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

The [[Medeu Dam]], designed to protect the city of Almaty and the Medeo skating rink from catastrophic [[mudflow]]s during flood season, was built in 1966. It was reinforced a number of times in the 1960s and 1970s.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

The supersonic transport [[Tupolev]] [[Tu-144]] went into service on 26 December 1975, carrying mail and freight between Moscow and Alma-Ata in preparation for passenger services; these began in November 1977. The Aeroflot flight on 1 June 1978 was the 55th and last scheduled passenger flight of the Tu-144.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

Alma-Ata was the host city for a 1978 international conference on [[Primary Health Care]]. The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] was adopted, marking a paradigm shift in global public health.

On 16 December 1986 the [[Jeltoqsan]] riot took place in response to General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s dismissal of [[Dinmukhamed Kunayev]].{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

September 7, 1988, the [[subway (rail)|subway]] [[Almaty Metro]] project started construction; the subway was opened on 1 December 2011 after 23 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zakon.kz/site_main_news/4460872-v-almaty-otkrylsja-metropoliten.html |title=В Алматы открылся Метрополитен (фото) |publisher=Zakon.kz |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref>

In 1993 the government made a decision to rename the city from Alma-Ata to ''Almaty''.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

In 1997 the President of the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]] [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] approved the Decree to transfer the capital from Almaty to [[Astana]] in the north of the country.<ref>[http://www.akorda.kz/www/www_akorda_kz.nsf/sections?OpenForm&id_doc=80696F88AC705680462572340019E5CD&lang=en ] {{wayback|url=http://www.akorda.kz/www/www_akorda_kz.nsf/sections?OpenForm&id_doc=80696F88AC705680462572340019E5CD&lang=en |date=20120209114845 |df=y }}</ref> On 1 July 1998 a law was passed to establish the special status of Almaty as a scientific, cultural, historical, financial, and industrial centre.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

The new General Plan of Almaty for 2030 was developed in 1998. It is intended to create ecologically safe, secure, and socially comfortable living conditions in the city. The main objective is to promote Almaty’s image as a garden-city.

It proposes continued [[Skyscraper|multi-storied]] and single-housing development, reorganization of industrial districts or territories, improving transport infrastructure, and expanding [[Almaty Metro]]. The first line of Almaty metro was launched on 1 December 2011, two weeks ahead of schedule. The extension of the line to Kalkaman is under construction, scheduled to open in 2015.
[[File:Alfarabi3.jpg|left|thumb|218x218px|Al-Farabi Avenue.]]
The area of the city has been expanded during recent years with the annexation of the suburban settlements of Kalkaman, Kok Tube, Gorniy Gigant (Mountain Giant). Numerous apartment blocks, and office skyscrapers have transformed the face of the town, which has been built into the mountains.

==Climate==
The climate in Almaty is a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Dfa'') with hot summers and cold winters. It is characterized by the influence of mountain-valley circulation. This is especially evident in the northern part of the city, located directly in the transition zone of the mountain slopes to the plains.

[[File:Smog over Almaty.jpg|thumbnail|left|Picture taken during a temperature [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]], showing smog trapped over Almaty]]
Annual average air temperature is equal to {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}, the coldest month is January, {{convert|-4.7|°C|0|abbr=on}} (on average), the warmest month (July) {{convert|23.8|°C|0|abbr=on}} (on average). In average years frost starts on about 14 October and ends on about 18 April, with sustained extreme cold from about 19 December to about 23 February, a period of about 67 days. Weather with temperature above {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} is average for about 36 days a year. In the center of Almaty, like any large city, there is a "heat island" – average daily temperature contrast between the northern and southern suburbs of the city is 3.8% and in the coldest and 2.2% and in the hottest five days. Therefore, frost in the city center starts about 7 days later and finishes 3 days earlier than in the northern suburbs. Annual precipitation is about {{convert|650|to|700|mm|1|abbr=on}}. April and May are the wettest months, during which about a third of the city’s annual precipitation is received.

It is not uncommon for snow and a cold snap to hit Almaty as late as the end of May. For example, in the last quarter century, such snowfalls were recorded on 13 May 1985, 1 May 1989, 5 May 1993 and 18 May 1998. The record latest snowfall in Almaty was on 17 June 1987.

Almaty sometimes experiences winter rain, despite heavy preceding snowfall and low temperatures. The most memorable winter rain took place at 16 December 1996 during a military parade to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Independence of the Republic.

Almaty Weather Station’s GM mostly records south-easterly wind (30%), its resistance increases during the summer (37%) and falls in winter (19%). Wind speeds exceed 15&nbsp;m/s on about 15 days a year, on average.

==Seismic activity in the territory of Kazakhstan==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
Industrially developed and densely populated areas in the south and southeast of Kazakhstan are situated in the zones where the maximum magnitudes of expected earthquakes are from 6.0 to 8.3 (the intensity of I0=8–10).

The south seismic active zone of Kazakhstan is a part of the North Tian-Shan ridge system. The main city of Almaty is located near the Zailiski Alatau mountain base. In recorded history prior to the late 19th century, three catastrophic earthquakes are known to have taken place there. The following are the dates of occurrence and extracts from the historical chronicles of the times:

*1770, "...Belovodka village was buried";
*1807, "a horrible catastrophe took place in Almaty";
*1865, Strong earthquake

Within the past 125 years, three more strong destructive earthquakes occurred here, with centres not more than 20 – {{convert|130|km|0|abbr=off}} from the current city location. Their magnitudes were 9 and 11 on the MSK scale – 64, and their centres were located within {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}}. Centres were located in a south and south–east directions:
*(1887 y., K=17.14) Vernenskoe
*(1889 y., K=19.12) Chilik,
*(1911 y., K=18.76) Keminskoe

K – indicates the energy of the earthquake.

In each of these earthquakes, the city suffered wide destruction.<ref>(Baimakhan, Dashdorj, 2006)</ref>

The Territory of the Kyrgyz State adjoins North Tian-Shan.<ref>(Aitmatov, Kojogulov, Nikolskaya, 1994.).</ref>

According to the USSR Census of 1989, the population of Almaty was 1,071,900; the Kazakhstan Census of 1999 reported 1,129,400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2002/057/analit04.php |title=О некоторых итогах переписи населения Казахстана |publisher=Demoscope.ru |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref>

==Economy==
Almaty generates approximately 20 per cent of Kazakhstan's GDP (or $36 billion in 2010). The nation is the most powerful economically in [[Central Asia]] and Almaty is a key financial center. It is considered to be a [[Global city|Beta- Global City]] as of the 2012 [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]] study.<ref name = "GaWC Intro">{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/gawcworlds.html |title=GaWC - The World According to GaWC |publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref>

One of the largest industries in Almaty is finance, and its [[financial export]]s make it a large contributor to Kazakhstan's balance of payments. Almaty is home to [[BTA Bank]], which is the largest bank in Central Asia, [[Kazkommertsbank]], and other major banks. The [[Kazakhstan Stock Exchange]] is based in Almaty.

Almaty is also developing as a regional financial and business centre (RFCA).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

Under construction is the 'Almaty Financial District and Esentai Park'. This was designed by [[T.J. Gottesdiener]], who designed both [[7 World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[Time Warner Center]] in [[Tokyo Midtown]], respectively. Its goal is to become the largest business centre in Central Asia. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Esentai Tower, a 37-floor building in the park, is the tallest mixed-use building in Kazakhstan, housing offices of companies such as [[Ernst & Young]], [[HSBC]] and [[Credit Suisse]]. The first Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Kazakhstan opened in 2013 in Esentai Tower.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ritz-Carlton Plans Kazakhstan Debut by End of 2013|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/ritz-carlton-plans-kazakhstan-debut-by-end-of-2013/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=4 December 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}</ref>

Along with professional services, media companies are concentrated in Almaty. The media distribution industry has been growing rapidly since 2006. Major broadcasting channels KTK and NTK are based in Almaty, as are several national newspapers.

There are plans to construct a Western Europe-Western China highway, passing through Almaty. A new airport in Almaty expects to handle about 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.

The economy of Almaty city and Almaty Region continues to grow, and is expected to increase at nearly 6 percent per year until 2020.<ref name=wb1>{{cite web|title=Keeping the Lights On in Kazakhstan’s Largest City|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2015/04/30/keeping-the-lights-on-in-kazakhstans-largest-city|website=http://www.worldbank.org/}}</ref> The city generates approximately 20 percent of the national GDP.<ref name="wb1"/> To mitigate the rapidly increasing electricity demand caused by this growth, the Kazakh authorities decided to upgrade the power system by building the new transmission line and modernizing the substations.<ref name="wb1"/> The Alma Transmission Project, supported by the World Bank, has helped achieve this goal.<ref name="wb1"/>
