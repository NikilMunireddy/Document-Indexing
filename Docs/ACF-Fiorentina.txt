'''ACF Fiorentina''',<ref name="fiorentina_society" /><ref name="fiorentina_society_legacalcio" /> commonly referred to as simply '''Fiorentina''' {{IPA-it|fjorenˈtiːna|}}, is a professional [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] club from [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]]. Founded by a merger in 1926, and refounded in 2002 following bankruptcy, Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more [[Serie A]] seasons.

Fiorentina has won two [[List of Italian football champions|Italian Championships]], in [[1955–56 Serie A|1955–56]] and again in [[1968–69 Serie A|1968–69]], as well as six [[Coppa Italia]] trophies and one [[Supercoppa Italiana]]. On the [[UEFA|European stage]], Fiorentina won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup|1960–61]] and lost the final one year later. They finished runners-up in the [[1956–57 European Cup]], losing against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and also came close to winning the [[1989–90 UEFA Cup]], finishing as runners-up against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].

Since 1931, the club have played at the [[Stadio Artemio Franchi]], which currently has a capacity of 47,282. The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname ''Viola'', a reference to their distinctive purple colours.

==History==
{{details|History of ACF Fiorentina}}

===Foundation to World War II===
'''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina''' was founded in the autumn of 1926 by local noble and [[National Fascist Party]] member Luigi Ridolfi,<ref name="Martin">{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Simon| title =Football and Fascism: The National Game Under Mussolini| publisher = Berg Publishers| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=LSOmTCa8g50C&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=fiorentina+Luigi+Ridolfi+fascist&source=web&ots=-TY6RPJtWP&sig=plBjFJCYajFpO1RG3DF128PVB7E&hl=en| isbn = 1-85973-705-6}}</ref> who initiated the merger of two older Florentine clubs, [[C.S. Firenze|CS Firenze]] and [[P.G. Libertas|PG Libertas]]. The aim of the merger was to give Florence a strong club to rival those of the more dominant [[Italian Football Championship]] sides of the time from [[Northern Italy|Northwest Italy]]. Also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of ''[[Calcio Fiorentino]]'', an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the [[Medici]] family.<ref name="Martin"/>

After a rough start and three seasons in lower leagues, Fiorentina reached the Serie A in 1931. That same year saw the opening of the new stadium, originally named after Giovanni Berta, after a prominent fascist, but now known as [[Stadio Artemio Franchi]]. At the time, the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering, and its inauguration was monumental. To be able to compete with the best teams in Italy, Fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players, notably the Uruguayan [[Pedro Petrone]], nicknamed ''el Artillero''. Despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place, Fiorentina were relegated the following year, although they would return quickly to Serie A. In 1941, they won their first [[Coppa Italia]], but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s because of World War II and other troubles.

===First ''scudetto'' and '50–'60s===
[[File:Fiorentina scudetto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The first Italian champion Fiorentina]]
In 1950, Fiorentina started to achieve consistent top-five finishes in the domestic league. The team consisted of great players such as well-known goalkeeper [[Giuliano Sarti]], [[Sergio Cervato]], Francesco Rosella, [[Guido Gratton]], [[Giuseppe Chiappella]] and Aldo Scaramucci but above all, the attacking duo of Brazilian [[Júlio Botelho|Julinho]] and Argentinian [[Miguel Montuori]]. This team won Fiorentina's first ''[[scudetto]]'' (Italian championship) in [[1955–56 Serie A|1955–56]], 12 points ahead of second-place [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Milan beat Fiorentina to top spot the following year, but more significantly Fiorentina became the first Italian team to play in a [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final, when a disputed penalty led to a 2–0 defeat at the hands of [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]]'s [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].
Fiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons. In the [[1960–61 Serie A|1960–61 season]], the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first [[Cup Winners' Cup]] against Scottish side [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

After several years of runner-up finishes, Fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s, bouncing from fourth to sixth place, although the club won the Coppa Italia and the [[Mitropa Cup]] in 1966.

===Second ''scudetto'' and '70s===
[[File:Giancarlo Antognoni (3).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Giancarlo Antognoni]], former captain of Fiorentina]]
While the 1960s did result in some trophies and good [[Serie A]] finishes for Fiorentina, nobody believed that the club could challenge for the title. The [[1968–69 Serie A|1968–69 season]] started with Milan as frontrunners, but on matchday 7, they lost to [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and were overtaken by [[Gigi Riva]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]]. Fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved to the top of the Serie A, but the first half of their season finished with a 2–2 draw against [[A.S. Varese 1910|Varese]], leaving Cagliari as outright league leader. The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, Milan, Cagliari and Fiorentina. Milan fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the European Cup, and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot. After Cagliari lost against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], however, Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals Juve in [[Turin]] on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year, Fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the [[Soviet Union]] against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3–0 defeat in [[Glasgow]] to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].

''Viola'' players began the 1970s decade with ''Scudetto'' sewed on their breast, but the period was not especially fruitful for the team. After a fifth-place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. The ''Viola'' did win the [[Anglo-Italian League Cup]] in 1974 and won the Coppa Italia again in 1975. The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi, who had the misfortune to suffer bad injuries, and above all [[Giancarlo Antognoni]], who would later become an idol to Fiorentina's fans. The young average age of the players led to the team being called ''Fiorentina Ye-Ye''.

===Pontello era===
[[File:Fiorentina-Circle-Logo.png|thumb|left|125px|The new team logo of the period]]
[[File:Roberto Baggio - AC Fiorentina 1985-1986.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Roberto Baggio]] (on his Serie A debut with Fiorentina, in 1986) helped the club to the [[1990 UEFA Cup Final]]]]
In 1980, Fiorentina was bought by Flavio Pontello, who came from a rich house-building family. He quickly changed the team's anthem and logo, leading to some complaints by the fans, but he started to bring in high-quality players such as [[Francesco Graziani]] and [[Eraldo Pecci]] from [[Torino F.C.|Torino]]; [[Daniel Bertoni]] from [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]; [[Daniele Massaro]] from [[A.C. Monza Brianza 1912|Monza]]; and a young [[Pietro Vierchowod]] from [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]]. The team was built around Giancarlo Antognoni, and in [[1981–82 Serie A|1982]], Fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rivals Juventus. After a bad injury to Antognoni, the league title was decided on the final day of the season when Fiorentina were denied a goal against Cagliari and were unable to win. Juventus won the title with a disputed penalty and the rivalry between the two teams erupted.

The following years were strange for Fiorentina, who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles. Fiorentina also bought two interesting players, ''El Puntero'' [[Ramón Díaz]] and, most significantly, the young [[Roberto Baggio]].

In 1990, Fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season, but did reach the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] final, where they again faced Juventus. The Turin team won the trophy, but Fiorentina's ''[[tifosi]]'' once again had real cause for complaint: the second leg of the final was played in [[Avellino]] (Fiorentina's home ground was suspended), a city with many Juventus fans, and emerging star Roberto Baggio was sold to the rival team on the day of the final. Pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in Florence's streets. The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker [[Mario Cecchi Gori]].

===Cecchi Gori era: from Champions League to bankruptcy===
[[File:Gabriel batistuta.jpg|thumb|175x175px|
[[Gabriel Batistuta]], the most prominent Fiorentina player of the 1990s]]
The first season under Cecchi Gori's ownership was one of stabilisation, after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like [[Brian Laudrup]], [[Stefan Effenberg]], [[Francesco Baiano]] and, most importantly, [[Gabriel Batistuta]], who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. In 1993, however, Cecchi Gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son, [[Vittorio Cecchi Gori|Vittorio]]. Despite a good start to the season, Cecchi Gori fired the coach, [[Luigi Radice]], after a defeat against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]],<ref>[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/gennaio/04/Fiorentina_caduta_sugli_allori_co_0_9301043372.shtml From Corriere della Sera of 5 January 1993]</ref> and replaced him with [[Aldo Agroppi]]. The results were dreadful: Fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season.

[[Claudio Ranieri]] was brought in as coach for the 1993–94 season, and that year, Fiorentina dominated [[Serie B]], Italy's second division. Upon their return to Serie A, Ranieri put together a good team centred around new top scorer Batistuta, signing the young talent [[Rui Costa]] from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and the new world champion Brazilian defender [[Márcio Roberto dos Santos|Márcio Santos]]. The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season. The ''Viola'' finished the season in tenth place.

The following season, Cecchi Gori bought other important players, namely Swedish midfielder [[Stefan Schwarz]]. The club again proved its mettle in cup competitions, winning the Coppa Italia against Atalanta and finishing joint-third in Serie A. In the summer, Fiorentina became the first non-national champions to win the [[Supercoppa Italiana]], defeating Milan 2–1 at the [[San Siro]].

Fiorentina's 1995–96 season was disappointing in the league, but they did reach the [[Cup Winners' Cup]] semi-final by beating [[AF Gloria Bistrița|Gloria Bistrița]], [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] and Benfica. The team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition, [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (away 1–1; home 0–2). The season's main signings were [[Luís Oliveira]] and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]], the latter of whom suffered from many injuries.

At the end of the season, Ranieri left Fiorentina for [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in Spain, with Cecchi Gori appointing [[Alberto Malesani]] as his replacement. Fiorentina played well but struggled against smaller teams, although they did manage to qualify for the UEFA Cup. Malesani left Fiorentina after only a season and was succeeded by [[Giovanni Trapattoni]]. With Trapattoni's expert guidance and Batistuta's goals, Fiorentina challenged for the title in [[1998–99 Serie A|1998–99]] but finished the season in third, earning them qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. The following year was disappointing in Serie A, but ''Viola'' played some historical matches in the Champions League, beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1–0 at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2–0 in Florence. They were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage.

At the end of the season, Trapattoni left the club and was replaced by Turkish coach [[Fatih Terim]]. More significantly, however, Batistuta was sold to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], who eventually won the title the following year. Fiorentina played well in [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01]] and stayed in the top half of Serie A, despite the resignation of Terim and the arrival of [[Roberto Mancini]]. They also won the Coppa Italia for the sixth and last time.

The year 2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed: they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around US$50 million. {{fact span|text=The club's owner, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, was able to raise some more money,|date=January 2016}} but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the [[2001–02 Serie A|2001–02 season]] and went into judicially-controlled administration in June 2002. This form of [[bankruptcy]] (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the [[2002–03 Serie A|2002–03 season]], and as a result effectively ceased to exist.

===The 2000s: Della Valle era===
The club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as '''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola''' with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner and the club was admitted into [[Serie C2]], the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was [[Angelo Di Livio]], whose commitment to the club's cause further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio and 30-goal striker [[Christian Riganò]], the club won its Serie C2 group with considerable ease, which would normally have led to a promotion to [[Serie C1]]. Due to the bizarre ''[[Calcio Catania#Decline and revival|Caso Catania]]'' (Catania Case), however, the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B, something that was only made possible by the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC)'s decision to resolve the [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for "sports merits."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2003/h/sezioni/sport/calcio/calciomercato/ventiquattro/ventiquattro/ventiquattro.html |publisher=La Repubblica |language=Italian |title=Serie B a 24 squadre. C'è anche la Fiorentina |date=20 August 2003|accessdate=4 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501051624/http://www.repubblica.it/2003/h/sezioni/sport/calcio/calciomercato/ventiquattro/ventiquattro/ventiquattro.html| archivedate= 1 May 2008| deadurl= no}}</ref> In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as '''ACF Fiorentina'''. The club finished the [[2003–04 Serie B|2003–04 season]] in sixth place and won the [[Playoffs#Association football|playoff]] against [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] to return to top-flight football.

[[File:Cesare Prandelli.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Cesare Prandelli]], the club's longest-serving manager (2005–2010)]]

In their first season back in Serie A, however, the club struggled to avoid relegation, only securing survival on the last day of the season on head-to-head record against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]]. In 2005, Della Valle decided to appoint [[Pantaleo Corvino]] as new sports director, followed by the appointment of [[Cesare Prandelli]] as head coach in [[2005–06 Serie A|the following season]]. The club made several signings during the summer transfer market, most notably [[Luca Toni]] and [[Sébastien Frey]]. This drastic move earned them a fourth-place finish with 74 points and a Champions League qualifying round ticket. Toni scored 31 goals in 38 appearances, the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since [[Antonio Valentin Angelillo]] in the [[1958–59 Serie A|1958–59 season]], for which he was awarded the [[European Golden Boot]]. On 14 July 2006, however, Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B due to their involvement in the [[2006 Serie A scandal|2006 Serie A match fixing scandal]] and given a 12-point penalty. The team was reinstated to the Serie A on appeal, but with a 19-point penalty for the [[2006–07 Serie A|2006–07 season]]. The team's [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|2006–07 Champions League]] place was also revoked.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5164194.stm|author=BBC|title=Italian trio relegated to Serie B | date=14 July 2006| accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref> After the start of the season, Fiorentina's penalisation was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the Italian courts. In spite of this penalty, they managed to secure a place in the UEFA Cup.

Despite Toni's departure to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Fiorentina had a strong start to the [[2007–08 Serie A|2007–08 season]] and were tipped by [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] head coach [[Marcello Lippi]], among others, as a surprise challenger for the ''[[Scudetto]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=472919|publisher=Goal.com|title=Lippi Tips Fiorentina For Surprise Scudetto Challenge|date=11 November 2007}}</ref> and although this form tailed off towards the middle of the season, the ''Viola'' managed to qualify for the Champions League. In Europe, the club reached the semi-final of the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], where they were ultimately defeated by Rangers on penalties. The [[2008–09 Serie A|2008–09 season]] continued this success, a fourth-place finish assuring Fiorentina's spot in [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|2010's Champions League playoffs]]. Their European campaign was also similar to that of the previous run, relegated to the [[2008–09 UEFA Cup]] and were eliminated by [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the end.

In the [[2009–10 Serie A|2009–10 season]], Fiorentina started their domestic campaign strongly before steadily losing momentum and slipped to mid-table positions at the latter half of the season. In Europe, the team proved to be a surprise dark horse: after losing their first away fixture against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], they staged a comeback with a five-match streak by winning all their remaining matches (including defeating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] home and away). The ''Viola'' qualified as group champions, but eventually succumbed to Bayern Munich due to the [[away goals rule]]. This was controversial due to a mistaken refereeing decision by [[Tom Henning Øvrebø]], who allowed a clearly offside goal for Bayern in the first leg. Bayern eventually finished the tournament as runners-up, making a deep run all the way to the [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|final]]. The incident called into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. Despite a good European run and reaching the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia, Fiorentina failed to qualify for Europe.

During this period, on 24 September 2009, Andrea Della Valle resigned from his position as chairman of Fiorentina, and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to Mario Cognini, Fiorentina's vice-president until a permanent position could be filled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Fiorentina/24-09-2009/della-valle-si-dimesso--501388850534.shtml|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|title=Fiorentina senza presidente Della Valle si è dimesso|date=24 September 2009|language=Italian}}</ref>

===The 2010s: Post-Prandelli Era===
[[File:Vincenzo montella (1).JPG|thumb|160px|left|Former manager [[Vincenzo Montella]].]]
In June 2010, the ''Viola'' bid farewell to long-time manager Cesar Prandelli, by then the longest-serving coach in the team's history, who was departing to coach the Italian national team. Catania manager [[Siniša Mihajlović]] was appointed to replace him. The club spent much of the early [[2010–11 Serie A|2010–11 season]] in last place, but their form improved and Fiorentina ultimately finished ninth. Following a 1–0 defeat to [[A.C. Chievo Verona|Chievo]] in November 2011, Mihajlović was sacked and replaced by [[Delio Rossi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/07/sport/football/football-fiorentina-mihajlovic/index.html|publisher=CNN.com|title=Mihajlovic sacked as Fiorentina coach|date=7 November 2011}}</ref> After a brief period of improvements, the ''Viola'' were again fighting relegation, prompting the sacking of Sporting Director [[Pantaleo Corvino]] in early 2012 following a 0–5 home defeat to Juventus. Their bid for survival was kept alive by a number of upset victories away from home, notably at Roma and Milan. During a home game against [[Novara Calcio|Novara]], trailing 0–2 within half an hour, manager Rossi decided to substitute midfielder [[Adem Ljajić]] early. Ljajić sarcastically applauded him in frustration, whereupon Rossi retaliated by physical assaulting his player, an action that ultimately prompted his termination by the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17933945|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Fiorentina boss Delio Rossi sacked for attacking player|date=3 May 2012}}</ref> His replacement, caretaker manager [[Vincenzo Guerini]], then guided the team away from the relegation zone to a 13th-place finish to end the turbulent year.

To engineer a resurrection of the club after the disappointing season, the Della Valle family invested heavily in the summer of 2012, buying 17 new players and appointing [[Vincenzo Montella]] as head coach. The team began the season well, finishing the calendar year in joint third place and eventually finishing the [[2012–13 Serie A|2012–13 season]] in fourth, enough for a position in the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League|2013–14 Europa League]].

The club lost fan favourite [[Stevan Jovetić]] during the summer of 2013, selling him to English Premier League club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for a €30 million transfer fee. They also sold Adem Ljajić to Roma and [[Alessio Cerci]] to Torino, using the funds to bring in [[Mario Gómez]], [[Josip Iličić]] and [[Ante Rebić]], among others. During the season, Fiorentina topped their Europa League group, moving on to the round of 32 to face Danish side [[Esbjerg fB]], which Fiorentina defeated 4–2 on aggregate. In the following round of 16, however, they then lost to Italian rivals Juventus 2–1 on aggregate, ousting them from the competition. At the end of the season, the team finished fourth again in the league, and also finishing they year as Coppa Italia runners-up after losing 3–1 to Napoli in the final.

In 2014–15, during the 2015 winter transfer window, the team club sold star winger [[Juan Cuadrado]] to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for €30 million but were able to secure the loan of [[Mohamed Salah]] in exchange, who was a revelation in the second half of the season. Their [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|2014–15 Europa League campaign]] saw them progress to the semi-finals, where they were knocked-out by Spanish side [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], the eventual champions. In the [[2014–15 Serie A|2014–15 domestic season]], Fiorentina once again finished fourth, thus qualifying for the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League|2015–16 Europa League]]. In June 2015, [[Vincenzo Montella]] was sacked as manager after the club grew impatient with the coaches inability to prove his commitment to the club,<ref>http://www.football-italia.net/67539/official-fiorentina-sack-montella</ref> later appointing [[Paulo Sousa]] on June 21 as the team's new head coach.

During the summer of 2015, Fiorentina participated in the [[International Champions Cup]] for the first time, where they lost 4–2 against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint Germain]] but went on to defeat Barcelona 2–1 at home and Chelsea 0–1 away. The results of the latter two games showed signs of a rejuvenated squad and a positive look towards their [[2015–16 ACF Fiorentina season|2015–16 campaign]].

===Badge===
[[File:Fleur de lis of Florence.svg|thumb|100px|The badge used by Florentia Viola]]
The official emblem of the city of [[Florence]], a red [[fleur-de-lis]] on a white field, has been pivotal in the all-round symbolism of the club.

Over the course of the club's history, they have had several badge changes, all of which incorporated Florence's fleur-de-lis in some way.<ref name="logo">{{cite news|url=http://www.weltfussballarchiv.com/Vereinsprofilnew.php?ID=3001|publisher=Weltfussballarchiv.com|title=ACF Fiorentina|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> The first one was nothing more than the city's coat of arms, a white shield with the red fleur-de-lis inside. It was soon changed to a very stylised fleur-de-lis, always red, and sometimes even without the white field. The most common symbol, adopted for about 20 years, had been a white [[lozenge]] with the flower inside. During the season they were Italian champions, the lozenge disappeared and the flower was overlapped with the ''[[scudetto]]''.

The logo introduced by owner Flavio Pontello in 1980 was particularly distinct, consisting of one-half of the city of Florence's emblem and one-half of the letter "F", for Fiorentina. People disliked it when it was introduced, believing it was a commercial decision and, above all, because the symbol bore more of a resemblance to a [[halberd]] than a fleur-de-lis.<ref name="logo"/>

Today's logo is a kite shaped double [[lozenge]] bordered in gold. The outer lozenge has a purple background with the letters "AC" in white and the letter "F" in red, standing for the club's name. The inner lozenge is white with a gold border and the red fleur-de-lis of Florence.<ref name="logo"/> This logo had been in use from 1992 to 2002, but after the financial crisis and resurrection of the club the new one couldn't use the same logo. Florence's ''[[comune]]'' instead granted Florentia Viola use of the stylised coat of arms used in other city documents. Diego Della Valle acquired the current logo the following year in a judicial auction for a fee of €2.5 million, making it the most expensive logo in Italian football.

===Kit and colours===
When Fiorentina was founded in 1926, the players wore red and white halved shirts derived from the colour of the city emblem.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/048/017/stemma.html|publisher=Comuni-Italiani|title=Stemma Comune di Firenze|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> The more well-known and highly distinctive purple kit was adopted in 1928 and has been used ever since, giving rise to the nickname ''La Viola'' ("The Purple (team)"). Tradition has it that Fiorentina got their purple kit by mistake after an accident washing the old red and white coloured kits in the river.

The away kit has always been predominantly white, sometimes with purple and red elements, sometimes all-white. The shorts had been purple when the home kit was with white shorts. Fiorentina's third kit was first one in the 1995–96 season and it was all-red with purple borders and two [[lily|lilies]] on the shoulders. The red shirt has been the most worn 3rd shirt by Fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts ('97–'98, '99–'00 and '10–'11) and a sterling version, mostly in the [[Coppa Italia]], in 2000–01.

==Fiorentina as a company==
'''A.C.

At that time the club was heavily rely on windfall profit from selling players, especially in pure player swap or cash plus player swap that potentially increase the cost by the increase in [[amortization]] of player contracts (an intangible assets). For example, [[Marco Rossi (footballer, born 1978)|Marco Rossi]] joined Fiorentina for 17 billion lire in 2000, but at the same time [[Lorenzo Collacchioni]] moved to [[U.S. Salernitana 1919|Salernitana]] for 1 billion lire, making the club had a player profit of 997 million lire and extra 1 billion lire to be amortize in 5-year.<ref name=Fiorentina2001bilancio/> In 1999, [[Emiliano Bigica]] also swapped with [[Giuseppe Taglialatela]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/1999/giugno/19/Napoli_sulle_tracce_Gautieri_albanese_ga_0_9906197031.shtml|title=Il Napoli sulle tracce di Gautieri L' albanese Myrtai va all' Alzano|date=19 June 1999|access-date=21 January 2016|work=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian}}</ref> which the latter was valued for 10 billion lire.<ref name=Fiorentina2001bilancio/> The operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading) of 2000–01 season was minus 113,271,475,933 [[Italian lira|Italian lire]] (minus €58,499,835).<ref name=Fiorentina2001bilancio/> It was only boosted by the sales of [[Francesco Toldo]], [[Rui Costa]] in June 2001 (a profit of 134.883 billion lire; €69.661 million).<ref name=Fiorentina2001bilancio>A.C.
