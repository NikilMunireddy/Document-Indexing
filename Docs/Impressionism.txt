This painting became the source of the movement's name, after [[Louis Leroy]]'s article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'' declared that the painting was at most, a sketch.]]
'''Impressionism''' is a 19th-century [[art movement]] that originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. Impressionist painting characteristics include relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of ''movement'' as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles.

The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a [[Claude Monet]] work, ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which provoked the critic [[Louis Leroy]] to [[word coinage|coin]] the term in a [[satire|satirical]] review published in the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]''.

The development of Impressionism in the [[visual arts]] was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as [[impressionist music]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist literature]].

==Overview==
[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])'', [[Musée d'Orsay]], 1876]] Radicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, [[still life]]s and [[portrait]]s as well as [[landscape art|landscapes]] were usually painted in a studio.<ref>Exceptions include [[Canaletto#Outdoor painting|Canaletto]], who painted outside and may have used the [[camera obscura]].</ref> The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting ''[[en plein air]]''. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short "broken" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour—not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary—to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.

Impressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the [[Macchiaioli]], and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States, were also exploring ''plein-air'' painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.

The public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.

By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], and [[Cubism]].

==Beginnings==
In the middle of the 19th century—a time of change, as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] rebuilt Paris and waged war—the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] dominated French art. The Académie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Académie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.<ref>Nathalia Brodskaya, Impressionism, Parkstone International, 2014, pp. 13-14</ref> Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.<ref name="The Met">[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm Samu, Margaret. "Impressionism: Art and Modernity". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2004)]</ref>

The Académie had an annual, juried art show, the [[Salon de Paris]], and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Académie, represented by the works of such artists as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].

In the early 1860s, four young painters—[[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[Frédéric Bazille]]—met while studying under the academic artist [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 21–27.</ref> By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the [[realism (arts)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]]. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the [[Café Guerbois]] on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by [[Édouard Manet]], whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Armand Guillaumin]].<ref>Greenspan, Taube G. "Armand Guillaumin", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.</ref>

[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]], ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]
During the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style.<ref>Seiberling, Grace, "Impressionism", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.</ref> In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' ''([[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]])'' primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.133.</ref> The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.

After Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the [[Salon des Refusés]] (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refusés drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.194.</ref>
[[File:Alfred Sisley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Sisley]], ''View of the Saint-Martin Canal, Paris'', 1870, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
Artists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refusés in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Edgar Degas]] and several other artists founded the ''Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' ("Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers") to exhibit their artworks independently.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, p. 209.</ref> Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon.<ref>Jensen 1994, p. 90.</ref> The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older [[Eugène Boudin]], whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt ''plein air'' painting years before.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.32.</ref> Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, [[Johan Jongkind]], declined to participate, as did [[Édouard Manet]]. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]].

[[File:Claude Monet - Graystaks I.JPG|thumb|left|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks, (sunset)]]'', 1890–1891, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]
The critical response was mixed. Monet and Cézanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist [[Louis Leroy]] wrote a scathing review in the newspaper ''Le Charivari'' in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' ''(Impression, soleil levant)'', he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'', Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.

He wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,
:''Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.''<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 323.</ref>

The term ''Impressionist'' quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together—albeit with shifting membership—eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.<ref name="The Met" />

Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the "purest" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors.<ref>Gordon; Forge (1988), pp. 11–12.</ref> Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader,<ref>Distel et al. (1974), p. 127.</ref> never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour, and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting ''Spanish Singer'' had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that "the Salon is the real field of battle" where a reputation could be made.<ref>Richardson (1976), p. 3.</ref>

[[File:Camille Pissarro - Boulevard Montmartre - Eremitage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Boulevard Montmartre'', 1897, the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
Among the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870), defections occurred as Cézanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and Cézanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.105.</ref> Degas invited [[Mary Cassatt]] to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of [[Jean-François Raffaëlli]], [[Ludovic Lepic]], and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of "opening doors to first-come daubers".<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 603.</ref> The group divided over invitations to [[Paul Signac]] and [[Georges Seurat]] to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.

The individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879.<ref>Distel, Anne, Michel Hoog, and Charles S. Moffett. 1974.

==Impressionist techniques==
[[File:Cassatt Mary At the Theater 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''Lydia Leaning on Her Arms'' (in a theatre box), 1879]]
French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] colourist [[Eugène Delacroix]], the leader of the realists [[Gustave Courbet]], and painters of the Barbizon school such as [[Théodore Rousseau]]. The Impressionists learned much from the work of [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Eugène Boudin]], who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.

A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists—and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Constable]], and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Turner]]—the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:

* Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied [[impasto]].
* Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of [[simultaneous contrast]] to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.
* Grays and dark tones are produced by mixing [[complementary colour]]s. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.
* [[Wet-on-wet|Wet paint is placed into wet paint]] without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.
* Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.
* The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds. 
* The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce ''[[effets de soir]]''—the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.
* In paintings made ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)

New technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 39–41.</ref> Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process]. ''[[The Phillips Collection]]'', retrieved May 21, 2011</ref>

Many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These included [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]], and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism.<ref name="Wallert_159"/> The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as [[cerulean blue]],<ref name="The Met"/> which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.<ref name="Wallert_159">Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995).

[Marina Del Rey, Calif.]: Getty Conservation Institute. p. 159. ISBN 0892363223.</ref>

The Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.<ref name="Hill_177">Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012).

ISBN 1136000410.</ref> By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting.<ref name="Hill_177"/> By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.<ref>Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012).

==Content and composition==

Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such [[Dutch Golden Age painting|17th-century Dutch painters]] as [[Jan Steen]], had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] were traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance.<ref>Rosenblum (1989), p. 228.</ref> [[Photography]] was gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[File:Berthe Morisot Reading.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berthe Morisot]], ''Reading,'' 1873, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]
The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and [[Landscape art|landscape]] paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography "produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably".<ref name = "impressionism757"/>

In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused "on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph—by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated".<ref name = "impressionism757"/> The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their "tacit imperatives of taste and conscience".<ref name="impressionism758">Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London</ref> Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: "The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph".<ref name="impressionism757">Levinson, Paul (1997) ''The Soft Edge; a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York</ref>

Another major influence was Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] art prints ([[Japonism]]). The art of these prints contributed significantly to the "snapshot" angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's ''Jardin à Sainte-Adresse'', 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kLEpf5a49V0C&pg=PA433&dq=Terrasse+%C3%A0+Sainte-Adresse+japanese+prints&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dwnPUtm_GKnNsQTV-4KIDA&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Terrasse%20%C3%A0%20Sainte-Adresse%20japanese%20prints&f=false Gary Tinterow, Origins of Impressionism, Metropolitan Museum of Art,1994, page 433]</ref>

[[Edgar Degas]] was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints.<ref>Baumann; Karabelnik, et al. (1994), p. 112.</ref> His ''The Dance Class'' ''(La classe de danse)'' of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the ''[[Little Dancer of Fourteen Years]]''.

==Associates and influenced artists==

Among the close associates of the Impressionists were several painters who adopted their methods to some degree. These include [[Giuseppe De Nittis]], an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.152.</ref> [[Federico Zandomeneghi]] was another Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. [[Eva Gonzalès]] was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. [[Walter Sickert]], an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer [[Wynford Dewhurst]] wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, ''Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development'', which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.

By the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as [[Jean Béraud]] and [[Henri Gervex]] found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.<ref>Rewald (1973), p.476–477.</ref> Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.

The influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like [[Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum|J.D. Kirszenbaum]] were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.

==Beyond France==
[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'' (1889, [[National Gallery of Australia]]) by [[Arthur Streeton]], a leader of the [[Heidelberg School]]]]

As the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists, too numerous to list, became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important examples are:
* The [[American Impressionism|American Impressionists]], including [[Mary Cassatt]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Willard Metcalf]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Theodore Robinson]], [[Edmund C. Tarbell|Edmund Charles Tarbell]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], [[Catherine Wiley]] and [[J. Alden Weir]].
* The [[Australian Impressionism|Australian Impressionists]], including [[Tom Roberts]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Walter Withers]], [[Charles Conder]] and [[Frederick McCubbin]] (who were prominent members of the [[Heidelberg School]]), and [[John Peter Russell]], a friend of Van Gogh, Rodin, Monet and Matisse.
* The [[Amsterdam Impressionism|Amsterdam Impressionists]] in the [[Netherlands]], including [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Isaac Israëls]], [[Willem Bastiaan Tholen]], [[Willem de Zwart]], [[Willem Witsen]] and [[Jan Toorop]].

* [[László Mednyánszky]] in Hungary
* [[Theodor von Ehrmanns]] and [[Hugo Charlemont]] who were rare Impressionists among the more dominant [[Vienna Secessionist]] painters in Austria
* [[William John Leech]], [[Roderic O'Conor]], and [[Walter Osborne]] in Ireland
* [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[Valentin Serov]] in Russia
* [[Francisco Oller|Francisco Oller y Cestero]], a native of [[Puerto Rico]] and a friend of Pissarro and Cézanne
* [[James Nairn]] in [[New Zealand]].
* [[William McTaggart]] in [[Scotland]].
* [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] artist
* [[Władysław Podkowiński]], a [[Poland|Polish]] Impressionist and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]
* [[Nicolae Grigorescu]] in [[Romania]]
* [[Nazmi Ziya Güran]], who brought Impressionism to [[Turkey]]
* [[Chafik Charobim]] in [[Egypt]]
* [[Eliseu Visconti]] in [[Brazil]]
* [[Joaquín Sorolla]] in Spain

* [[Skagen Painters]] a group of Scandinavian artists who painted in a small Danish fishing village
* [[Nadežda Petrović]] in [[Serbia]]
* [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]] in [[Iceland]]
* [[Fujishima Takeji]] in [[Japan]]
* [[Frits Thaulow]] in [[Norway]] and later France.

==Sculpture, photography and film==
The sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] is sometimes called an Impressionist for the way he used roughly modeled surfaces to suggest transient light effects.<ref>Kleiner, Fred S., and Helen Gardner (2014). ''Gardner's art through the ages: a concise Western history''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. p. 382. ISBN 9781133954798.</ref>

[[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.

[[French Impressionist Cinema]] is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919–1929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Germaine Dulac]], Marcel L’Herbier, [[Louis Delluc]], and Dmitry Kirsanoff.

==Music and literature==

Musical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in [[European classical music]] that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the [[nocturne]], [[Arabesque (classical music)|arabesque]], and [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], and often explored uncommon scales such as the [[whole tone scale]]. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.

The influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. [[Erik Satie]] was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. [[Paul Dukas]] is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as [[Ottorino Respighi]] (Italy) [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Cyril Scott]], and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (England), and [[Manuel De Falla]], and [[Isaac Albeniz]] (Spain).

The term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with its major exemplars being [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]. Authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and [[Joseph Conrad]] have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.

==Post-Impressionism==
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Post-Impressionism developed from Impressionism. During the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; [[Camille Pissarro]] briefly painted in a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] manner, and even Monet abandoned strict ''plein air'' painting. [[Paul Cézanne]], who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.
