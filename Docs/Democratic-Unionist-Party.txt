The '''Democratic Unionist Party''' ('''DUP''') is the largest [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[political party]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. Founded by [[Ian Paisley]] and now led by [[Arlene Foster]], it is the largest party in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the joint fourth-largest party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

The DUP has historically strong links to [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] churches, particularly the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]] (the church Paisley founded) and has traditionally been regarded as the more [[Ulster loyalist]] of the two large unionist parties. However, this influence has reduced somewhat under the Robinson leadership in an attempt to reach out to non-Protestants, particularly socially conservative Catholics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/Belfast_Telegraph/arts2012/dec4_Catholic_ex-mayor_DUP__LClarke_Bel-Telegraph.php|title=I may be a devout Catholic but I will vote for DUP, says ex-SDLP mayor|work=nuzhound.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/roundup/articles/2013/04/18/400601-priest-catholics-support-the-dup/|title=Priest: Catholics support the DUP|work=Impartial Reporter}}</ref>

Following on from the [[St Andrews Agreement]] in October 2006, the DUP agreed with the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] party [[Sinn Féin]] to enter into [[Consociationalism|power-sharing]] [[Devolution|devolved]] government in Northern Ireland. In the aftermath of the agreement there were reports of divisions within the DUP. Many of its leading members, including [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) [[Nigel Dodds]], [[David Simpson (UK politician)|David Simpson]] and [[Gregory Campbell (politician)|Gregory Campbell]], were claimed to be in opposition to Paisley. All the party's MPs fully signed up to the manifesto for the 2007 Assembly elections, supporting power-sharing in principle. An overwhelming majority of the party executive voted in favour of restoring devolution in a meeting in March 2007;<ref name="BBC1">{{cite news |title=DUP 'would share power in May'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6491769.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=BBC|date=24 March 2007|accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> however, the DUP's sole [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), [[Jim Allister]],<ref name="allisterquits">{{cite news |title=Allister quits power-sharing DUP|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6499623.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=BBC|date=27 March 2007|accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> and seven DUP councillors<ref name="councillors">{{cite news |title=Seventh councillor leaves the DUP|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6524109.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=BBC|date=5 April 2007|accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> later resigned from the party in opposition to its plans to share power with Sinn Féin.

The DUP is the largest party in Northern Ireland, holding eight seats at Westminster and 38 seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly. It has one seat in the [[European Parliament]], where its [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], [[Diane Dodds]], sits as a [[Non-Inscrits|Non-Inscrit]].

Although the party is primarily active in Northern Ireland politics, during 2004-5 it had one representative from the English constituency of [[Basingstoke constituency|Basingstoke]], as a result of a [[Andrew Hunter (British politician)|defection]] to the party.
==History==
{{See also|Ulster Protestant Action|Protestant Unionist Party}}

===Early years and successes===
The party was established in 1971 by [[Ian Paisley]] and [[Desmond Boal]] and other members of the [[Protestant Unionist Party]]. Since its foundation it has won seats at local council, [[Northern Ireland]], UK and European level. It won eight seats in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly of 1973-1974]], where it opposed the formation of a power-sharing executive made up of [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and [[Irish nationalist]]s following the [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. The DUP were more [[Ulster loyalist]] than the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP). and its establishment arguably stemmed from insecurities of the [[Ulster Protestant]] working class.<ref>''Beyond the Sectarian Divide: the Social Bases and Political Consequences of Nationalist and Unionist Party Competition in Ireland'' by Geoffrey Evans and Mary Duffy. In ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 27, No. 1. (Jan. 1997), p.58</ref> Paisley was elected one of Northern Ireland's three [[European Parliament]] members at the first elections in 1979 and retained that seat in every European election until 2004. In 2004 Paisley was replaced as the DUP MEP by [[Jim Allister]], who resigned from the party in 2007 while retaining his seat.<ref name="allisterquits" />

The DUP also holds seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], and has been elected to each of the Northern Ireland conventions and assemblies set up since the party's creation. It has long been the principal rival to the other major unionist party, the UUP (known for a time in the 1970s and 1980s as the ''Official Unionist Party'' (OUP) to distinguish it from the then multitude of other unionist parties, some set up by deposed former leaders). The DUP's main opponent is [[Sinn Féin]] and its main rival for votes is the [[Ulster Unionist Party]].

===Post-Troubles===

====1998-2005====
The DUP was originally involved in the negotiations under former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[George J. Mitchell]] that led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]], but withdrew in protest when Sinn Féin, an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] party with links to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), was allowed to participate while the IRA retained its weapons. The DUP opposed the Agreement in the [[Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum, 1998|Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum]], in which the Agreement was approved with 71.1% of the electorate in favour.

The opposition was based on a number of reasons, including:
* The early release of paramilitary prisoners
* The mechanism to allow [[Sinn Féin]] to hold government office despite ongoing IRA activity.
* The lack of accountability of ministers in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]
* The lack of accountability of the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] and North/South Implementation Bodies

The Good Friday Agreement relied on the support of a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists in order for it to operate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} During the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2003|2003 Assembly Election]], the DUP argued for a "fair deal" that could command the support of both unionists and nationalists. After the results of this election the DUP argued that support was no longer present within unionism for the Good Friday Agreement. They then went on to publish their proposals for devolution in Ireland entitled ''Devolution Now''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dr Martin Melaugh |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/dup/dup050204text.htm |title=CAIN: Issues: Politics: Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) (2004) Devolution Now: The DUP's Concept for Devolution, 5 February 2004 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>

These proposals have been refined and re-stated in further policy documents including ''Moving on''<ref>[http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPMovingOn05.pdf Moving On], Democratic Unionist Party {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPMovingOn05.pdf|date=20120313184328}}</ref> and ''Facing Reality''.<ref>[http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPFacingReality.pdf Facing Reality], Democratic Unionist Party {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPFacingReality.pdf|date=20120313184348}}</ref> The DUP holds the view that any party which is linked to a [[terrorist]] organisation should not be eligible to hold Government office.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The DUP fought the resulting election to the [[Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly]] and took two seats in the multi-party power-sharing executive. While serving as ministers, they refused to sit in at meetings of the Executive Committee in protest at Sinn Féin's participation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The Executive ultimately collapsed over an alleged IRA espionage ring at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]] (see [[Stormontgate]]).

In the delayed Northern Ireland Assembly election of 2003, the DUP became the largest political party in the region, with 30 seats. In 2004, it became the largest Northern Ireland party at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], with the defection of former UUP MP [[Jeffrey Donaldson]]. On 12 December 2004, English MP [[Andrew Hunter (British politician)|Andrew Hunter]] took the DUP whip, giving the party seven seats, in comparison to the UUP's five, Sinn Féin's four, and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]]'s (SDLP) three.

====2005-2007====
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], the party reinforced its position as the largest unionist party, winning nine seats, making it the fourth largest party in terms of seats in the British House of Commons behind Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. In terms of votes, the DUP was the fourth largest party on the island of Ireland.

At the [[Northern Ireland local elections, 2005|local government election of 2005]], the DUP also emerged as the largest party at local government level with 182 councillors across Northern Ireland's 26 district councils.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg05.htm|title= 2005 Local Government Election Results|website=Northern Ireland Elections|publisher=ARK}}</ref> The DUP has a majority of the members on both [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh Borough Council]], which has long been a DUP stronghold and is home to party leader [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]], also in [[Ballymena (borough)|Ballymena Borough Council]], home to the party's founder Ian Paisley, and finally [[Ards (borough)|Ards Borough Council]]. As well as outright control on these councils, the DUP is also the largest party in eight of the other councils. These are [[Antrim (borough)|Antrim Borough Council]], [[Ballymoney (borough)|Ballymoney Borough Council]], [[Banbridge (district)|Banbridge District Council]], [[Belfast City Council]], [[Carrickfergus Borough Council]], [[Coleraine Borough Council]], [[Craigavon Borough Council]] and [[Newtownabbey Borough Council]]

On 11 April 2006, it was announced that three DUP members were to be elevated to the [[House of Lords]]: [[Maurice Morrow]], [[Wallace Browne]], the former [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]], and [[Eileen Paisley]], a vice-president of the DUP and wife of DUP Leader [[Ian Paisley]]. None, however, sit as DUP peers.

On 27 October 2006, the DUP issued a four-page letter in the ''Belfast Telegraph'' newspaper asking "Are the terms of Saint Andrew's a basis of moving forward to devolution?", with responses to be received to its party headquarters by 8 November. It was part of the party's policy of consultation with its electorate before entering a power-sharing government.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

On 24 November 2006, Ian Paisley refused to nominate himself as [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] designate. There was confusion between all parties whether he actually said that if Sinn Féin supported policing and the rule of law that he would nominate himself on 28 March 2007 after the Assembly elections on 7 March 2007. The Assembly meeting was brought to an abrupt end when the building had to be evacuated because of a security breach. Paisley later released a statement through the press office stating that he did in fact imply that if Sinn Féin supported policing and the rule of law, he would go into a power-sharing government with  them. This was following a statement issued by 12 DUP MLAs stating that what Ian Paisley had said in the chamber could not be interpreted as a nomination.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/6181370.stm| title=Paisley 'will accept nomination' | work=BBC News}}</ref>

In February 2007, the DUP suggested that it would begin to impose fines up to [[Pound sterling|£]]20,000 on members disobeying the party whip on crucial votes.<ref name="st040207">Sunday Times, page 1.10, 4 February 2007</ref>

On 24 March 2007 the DUP party executive overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution put to them by the party officers which did not agree to an establishment of devolution and an executive in Northern Ireland by the Government's deadline of 26 March, but did agree to setting up an executive on 8 May 2007.<ref name="BBC1" />

On 27 March 2007, the party's sole Member of the European Parliament (MEP), [[Jim Allister]], resigned from the party, in opposition to the decision to enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin. He retained his seat as an independent MEP as leader of his new hard-line anti-St Andrews Agreement splinter group that he formed with other disaffected members who had left the DUP over the issue, [[Traditional Unionist Voice]], a seat which he retained until [[Diane Dodds]] won the seat back for the DUP in 2009. MP [[Gregory Campbell (politician)|Gregory Campbell]]  warned on 6 April 2007 that his party would be watching to see if benefits flow from its agreement to share power with Sinn Féin.<ref name="belfasttelegraph060407">{{cite news |title=Agreement must bring benefits, Congressmen are told|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/article2428174.ece|work= Noel McAdam|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=6 April 2007|accessdate=6 April 2007}}</ref>

===Robinson leadership===
On 31 May 2008, the party's central Executive Committee met at the offices of [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh Borough Council]] where Ian Paisley formally stepped down as party leader and Peter Robinson was ratified as the new leader, with Nigel Dodds as his deputy.

On 11 June 2008 the party supported the government's proposal to detain terror suspects for up to 42 days, leading to ''[[The Independent]]'' dubbing all of the party's nine MPs as part of "Brown's dirty dozen".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/twelve-good-folk-and-true-or-browns-dirty-dozen-847334.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Twelve good folk and true... or Brown's dirty dozen? | date=15 June 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' reported that the party had been given "sweeteners for Northern Ireland" and "a peerage for the Rev Ian Paisley", amongst other offers, to secure [[Gordon Brown]]'s bill.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4116811.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=42day detention bribes and concessions that got DUP on side | first1=David | last1=Sharrock | first2=Sam | last2=Coates | date=12 June 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

Members of the DUP were lambasted by the press and voters, after MPs' expenses reports were leaked to the media. Several newspapers referred to the "Swish Family Robinson" after Peter Robinson, and his wife Iris,  claimed £571,939.41 in expenses with a further £150,000 being paid to family members.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lucy Ballinger |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1167726/MP-couple-taking-570-000-taxpayer-salaries-expenses.html |title=MP couple taking more than £570,000 from taxpayer in salaries and expenses |work=Daily Mail |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=18 June 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Further embarrassment was caused to the party when its deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, had the highest expenses claims of any Northern Ireland MP, ranking 13th highest out of all UK MPs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/7976508.stm|title=Dodds' expenses bill NI's highest|work=BBC News}}</ref> Details of all MPs' expenses claims since 2004 were published in July 2009 under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]].

In January 2010, Peter Robinson was at the centre of a [[Iris Robinson scandal|high-profile scandal]] relating to his 60-year-old MP/MLA wife [[Iris Robinson]]'s infidelity with a 19-year-old man, and alleged serious financial irregularities associated with the scandal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jan/08/peter-iris-robinson-crisis | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The real Robinson affair | date=8 January 2010 | accessdate=1 April 2010 | first=Malachi | last=O'Doherty}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/85333 |title=Tatchell: Robinson is 'two-faced hypocrite' |work=Morning Star|date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:Northern Ireland election seats 1997-2015.svg|600px]]

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], the party suffered a major upset when its leader, Peter Robinson, lost his [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] seat to [[Naomi Long]] of the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|APNI]] on a swing of 22.9%. However, the party maintained its position elsewhere, fighting off a challenge from the [[Ulster Conservatives and Unionists – New Force]] in [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim South]] and [[Strangford (UK Parliament constituency)|Strangford]] and from [[Jim Allister]]'s [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] in [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim North]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 General Election]], when the result was expected to be a [[hung parliament]], the issue of DUP and the [[UK Independence Party]] forming a [[coalition government]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]] was considered by [[Nigel Farage]] (leader of UKIP).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Justice|first1=Adam|title=General Election 2015: Ukip could form coalition with Tories and DUP|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/general-election-2015-ukip-could-form-coalition-tories-dup-1492489|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=International Business Times|date=18 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Michael|title=Conservative Ukip coalition: what have the parties said|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11566274/Conservative-Ukip-coalition-what-have-the-parties-said.html|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 May 2015}}</ref> The then Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], warned against this "Blukip" coalition, with a spoof website highlighting imagined policies from this coalition – such as reinstating the [[death penalty]], scrapping all benefits for under 25s and charging for hospital visits.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cromie|first1=Claire|title=Nick Clegg warns of rightwing 'Blukip' alliance of DUP, Ukip and the Conservatives|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/nick-clegg-warns-of-rightwing-blukip-alliance-of-dup-ukip-and-the-conservatives-31147787.html|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Belfast Telegraph|date=16 April 2015}}</ref> Additionally, issues were raised about the continued existence of the [[BBC]] (as the DUP, UKIP and Conservatives had made a number of statements criticising the institution)<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Jon|title=Tory coalition with DUP and Ukip could spell the end of the BBC as we know it|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/tory-coalition-with-dup-and-ukip-could-spell-the-end-of-the-bbc-as-we-know-it-31177207.html|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Belfast Telegraph|date=28 April 2015}}</ref> and support for [[LGBT rights]] and [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunne|first1=Ciara|title=An alliance with the DUP will be a harder bargain than either Labour or the Tories think|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/alliance-dup-will-be-harder-bargain-either-labour-or-tories-think|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=New Statesman|date=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=JonesAttitude5May15>{{cite news|last1=Stroude|first1=Will|title=Owen Jones warns of 'homophobic' DUP holding influence over future government|url=http://attitude.co.uk/owen-jones-warns-of-homophobic-dup-holding-influence-over-future-government/|accessdate=12 January 2016|work=Attitude Magazine|date=5 May 2015}}</ref> However, in an interview with [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] deputy leader of the DUP [[Nigel Dodds]] told [[BBC Newsline]] in 2015 that, despite opposition to same-sex marriage, the DUP was "against discrimination based on religion ... or sexual orientation".<ref name=JonesAttitude5May15 /> Additionally, David Cameron said he "totally disagreed" with the DUP on the issue of same-sex marriage and LGBT rights, claiming that "nothing I will do" would go against the principle of "the values that I have", including "equality for gay and lesbian people".<ref>{{cite news|title=Cameron vow on DUP gay rights stance|url=https://www.facebook.com/BBCNewsline/videos/942564932442062/|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=BBC Newsline|via=Facebook|date=23 April 2015}}</ref>
