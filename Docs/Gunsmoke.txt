'''''Gunsmoke''''' is an American radio and television [[Western (genre)|Western]] drama series created by director [[Norman Macdonnell]] and writer [[John Meston]]. The stories take place in and around [[Dodge City, Kansas]], during the settlement of the [[Western United States|American West]]. The central character is lawman [[Marshal Matt Dillon]], played by [[William Conrad]] on radio and [[James Arness]] on television. When aired in the UK, the television series was initially titled '''''Gun Law''''',<ref>{{cite news |title=James Arness, symbol of power with restraint |author=Nicholaus Mills |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 8, 2011 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/08/james-arness-gunsmoke |accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> later reverting to ''Gunsmoke''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt#akas |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |title=Gunsmoke (1955 – 1975) Release Info|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref>

The radio series ran from 1952 to 1961.  [[John Dunning (writer)|John Dunning]]<ref>See Dunning. p. 305.</ref> wrote that among radio drama enthusiasts, "''Gunsmoke'' is routinely placed among the best shows of any kind and any time." The television series ran for 20 seasons from 1955 to 1975, and stands as the United States' longest-running prime time, live-action drama with 635 episodes. In 2010, ''[[Law & Order]]'' tied ''Gunsmoke'' for most seasons for a live action drama series when it finished its 20th and final season, but the show finished 179 episodes short of ''Gunsmoke'''s final total; in terms of prime-time scripted series with continuing characters, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' is the only program to exceed 20 seasons. At the end of its run in 1975, ''Los Angeles Times'' columnist Cecil Smith wrote: "''Gunsmoke'' was the dramatization of the American epic legend of the west. Our own ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'', created from standard elements of the dime novel and the pulp western as romanticized by [Ned] [[Ned Buntline|Buntline]], [Bret] [[Bret Harte|Harte]], and [Mark] [[Mark Twain|Twain]]. It was ever the stuff of legend."<ref>{{cite news |author=Cecil Smith |title=Gunsmoke |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 1975}}</ref>

In the late 1940s, [[CBS]] chairman [[William S. Paley]], a fan of the [[Philip Marlowe]] radio serial, asked his programming chief, Hubell Robinson, to develop a hardboiled Western series, a show about a "Philip Marlowe of the Old West". Robinson instructed his West Coast CBS Vice President, [[Harry Ackerman]], who had developed the Philip Marlowe series, to take on the task.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Ackerman and his scriptwriters, Mort Fine and David Friedkin, created an audition script called "Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye" based on one of their [[Michael Shayne]] radio scripts, "The Crooked Wheel". Two auditions were created in 1949. The first was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred [[Michael Rye]] (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon; the second starred ''[[Straight Arrow]]'' actor [[Howard Culver]] in a more Western, lighter version of the same script. CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.

A complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of ''Straight Arrow'' would not allow him to do another Western series. The project was shelved for three years, when producer [[Norman Macdonnell]] and writer John Meston discovered it while creating an adult Western series of their own.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Macdonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[The Cisco Kid]].'' ''Gunsmoke'' was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning<ref>Dunning, p. 303.</ref> notes, "The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism."

=== Radio cast and character biographies ===
The radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952 with the episode "Billy the Kid", written by [[Walter Newman (screenwriter)|Walter Newman]], and ended on June 18, 1961. The show stars [[William Conrad]] as Marshal Matt Dillon, [[Howard McNear]] as Doc Charles Adams, [[Georgia Ellis]] as Kitty Russell, and [[Parley Baer]] as Dillon's assistant, Chester Wesley Proudfoot.

====Matt Dillon====
[[File:William Conrad 1952.JPG|thumb|right|[[William Conrad]] in 1952, when Matt Dillon was created on radio]]
Two versions of the same pilot episode titled "Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye" are in the archives with two different actors, Rye Billsbury and Howard Culver, playing Marshal "Mark" Dillon<!-- sic --> as the lead, not yet played by Conrad. Conrad was one of the last actors to audition for the role of Marshal Dillon. With a resonantly powerful and distinctive voice, Conrad was already one of radio's busiest actors. Though Meston championed him, Macdonnell thought Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over Macdonnell after reading only a few lines. Dillon as portrayed by Conrad was a lonely, isolated man, toughened by a hard life. Macdonnell later claimed, "Much of Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad."<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/79-WilliamDillon.htm "Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref>

Meston relished the upending of cherished Western fiction clichés and felt that few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, inasmuch as the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as chattel were touched on well ahead of their time in most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up [[Hopalong Cassidy]].

Dunning writes that Meston was especially disgusted by the archetypal Western hero and set out "to destroy [that type of] character he loathed". In Meston's view, "Dillon was almost as scarred as the homicidal psychopaths who drifted into Dodge from all directions."<ref name="Dunning, 304">Dunning, 304.</ref>

====Chester====
Chester's character had no surname until Baer [[Ad libitum|ad lib]]bed "Proudfoot" during an early rehearsal. Initial Gunsmoke scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by "Townsman". Again, Conrad's sense of what the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's "assistant", but in the December 13, 1952, episode "Post Martin", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode "Hank Prine" (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his "deputy" stating "Chester is not my deputy", though they both agree Chester acts like he is.  Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies ("Never Pester Chester"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust. The TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode.

====Doc Adams====
Doc Adams was, at first, a grumpy and somewhat dark character, but McNear's performances steadily became more warm-hearted. Doc Adams' backstory evokes a varied and experienced life: In some episodes, he had educational ties to Philadelphia; in others, he spent time as ship's doctor aboard the gambling boats that plied the Mississippi River, which provided a background for his knowledge of New Orleans (and acquaintance with Mark Twain). In the January 31, 1953, episode "Cavalcade", a fuller history is offered, though subsequent programs kept close listeners' heads spinning. In "Cavalcade", his real name is Calvin Moore, educated in Boston, and he practiced as a doctor for a year in [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he fell in love with a beautiful young woman who was also being courted by a wealthy young man named Roger Beauregard. Beauregard forced Doc into fighting a duel with him, resulting in Beauregard's being shot and killed. Though it was a fair duel, because Doc was a Yankee and an outsider, he was forced to flee. The young woman fled after him and they were married in St. Louis, but two months later, she died of [[typhus]]. Doc wandered throughout the territories until he settled in Dodge City 17 years later under the name of "Charles Adams". The Adams moniker was another Conrad invention, borrowing the surname from cartoonist [[Charles Addams]] as a testament to Doc's occasionally ghoulish comportment.

====Miss Kitty====
Georgia Ellis first appeared in the radio episode "Billy the Kid" (April 26, 1952) as "Francie Richards", a former girlfriend of Matt Dillon and the widow of a criminal. "Miss Kitty" did not appear until the May 10, 1952, episode "Jaliscoe". Kitty's profession was hinted at, but never explicit; in a 1953 interview with ''Time,'' Macdonnell declared, "Kitty is just someone Matt has to visit every once in a while."<ref name="Dunning, 304"/> An out-take from the program makes this hilariously obvious.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/GunsmokeRehearsals|title=Gunsmoke Rehearsals|work=Internet Archive|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The television show first portrayed Kitty as a saloon employee (dance-hall girl/prostitute) then later as the owner of the Long Branch Saloon. Sometime in 1959, Ellis was billed as Georgia Hawkins instead of Georgia Ellis.

=== Distinction from other radio westerns ===
[[File:Long Branch Saloon interior.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of the actual interior of the real-life [[Long Branch Saloon]] in [[Dodge City, Kansas]], taken between 1870 and 1885]]
''Gunsmoke'' was often a somber program, particularly in its early years. Dunning writes that Dillon "played his hand and often lost. He arrived too late to prevent a lynching. He amputated a dying man's leg and lost the patient anyway. He saved a girl from brutal rapists then found himself unable to offer her what she needed to stop her from moving into ... life as a prostitute."<ref>(Dunning, 304)</ref> Some listeners, such as Dunning, argue the radio version was more realistic. Episodes were aimed at adults and featured some of the most explicit content of their time, including violent crimes, [[scalping]]s, [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], and [[opium]] addicts. Many episodes ended on a somber note, and villains often got away with their crimes. Nonetheless, due to the subtle scripts and outstanding ensemble cast, over the years, the program evolved into a warm, often humorous celebration of human nature.

Apart from the doleful tone, ''Gunsmoke'' was distinct from other radio Westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, and due to the outstanding [[sound effect]]s, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie where the show was set. The effects were subtle but multilayered, giving the show a spacious feel. [[John Dunning (writer)|John Dunning]] wrote, "The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above the muted shouts of kids playing in an alley. He heard noises from the next block, too, where the inevitable dog was barking."<ref>(Dunning, 305)</ref>

''Gunsmoke'' was also unique from other Westerns in that it was unsponsored for the first few years of production. The program got its support from CBS for the first two years. Series producers felt that if the show were sponsored, they would have to "clean the show up".<ref>(''Time'', 1953)</ref> The producers wanted to find a sponsor that would allow them to keep the show the way it was.<ref>{{cite news |title=Weeks of Prestige |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1953-03-23 |page=106}}</ref>

=== Talk of adapting ''Gunsmoke'' to television ===

Not long after the radio show began, talk began of adapting it to television. Privately, Macdonnell had a guarded interest in taking the show to television, but publicly, he declared, "our show is perfect for radio," and he feared, as Dunning writes, "''Gunsmoke'' confined by a picture could not possibly be as authentic or attentive to detail." "In the end", wrote Dunning, "CBS simply took it away from Macdonnell and began preparing for the television version."<ref>(Dunning, 305)</ref>

Conrad and the others were given auditions, but they were little more than token efforts—especially in Conrad's case, due to his obesity. However, Meston was kept as the main writer. In the early years, a majority of the TV episodes were adapted from the radio scripts, often using identical scenes and dialogue. Dunning wrote, "That radio fans considered the TV show a sham and its players impostors should surprise no one. That the TV show was not a sham is due in no small part to the continued strength of Meston's scripts." <ref>(Dunning, 304)</ref>

Macdonnell and Meston continued the radio version of ''Gunsmoke'' until 1961, making it one of the most enduring vintage radio dramas.

Conrad directed two television episodes, in 1963 and 1971, while McNear appeared on six, playing characters other than Doc, including three times as storekeeper Howard Rudd.

During its second season in 1956, the program joined the list of the top ten television programs broadcast in the United States. It quickly moved to number one and stayed there until 1961. It remained among the top 20 programs until 1964.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotv/gunsmoke.htm ''Gunsmoke''] Museum of Broadcast Communications. Retrieved October 23, 2014</ref>

=== Longevity records ===

The television series remains the longest-running, prime time series of the 20th century. {{As of|2016}}, it has the highest number of scripted episodes for any U.S. prime-time, commercial, live-action television series. Other TV show fans sometimes question its position as having the [[List of longest running United States television series|longest run]]. Outside the United States,  some foreign-made programs  have been broadcast in the United States which contend for the position as the longest-running series.<ref group=notes>Because the show was a "primetime" series, the competition does not include such long-lived shows as ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' (1955–84) and many daytime serials. As a "commercial" series, it cannot be compared to shows such as the PBS program ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' (1966–2001). As a "live-action" series, programs such as  the adult animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (1989–) are not included, whose voice-over actors age off-screen. Some foreign countries have broadcast series over a longer duration, but these programs have employed an array of actors in their principal lead roles.</ref> {{As of|2016}}, ''Gunsmoke'' is rated fourth globally, after ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1963–89, 2005–present), ''[[Taggart]]'' (1983–2010),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13374238|title=Taggart police drama axed by ITV|work=BBC News|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> and ''[[The Bill]]'' (1984–2010).

=== Character longevity ===

[[James Arness]] and [[Milburn Stone]] portrayed their ''Gunsmoke'' characters for 20 consecutive years, a feat later matched by [[Kelsey Grammer]] as the character [[Frasier Crane]], but over two half-hour sitcoms (''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Frasier]]'').<ref>[http://www.gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/107_FrasierDillon.htm "What do Frasier (Kelsey Grammer), Matt Dillon (James Arness) and Doc Adams (Milburn Stone) have in common?"] GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> George Walsh, the announcer for ''Gunsmoke'', began in 1952 on radio's ''Gunsmoke'' and continued until television's ''Gunsmoke'' was canceled in 1975.<ref name="Wayne">Bill O'Hallaren, [http://www.gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/24-walsh.htm "When Chester Forgot to Limp and other fond recollections of 20 years on Gunsmoke"], ''TV Guide'', August 23, 1975.</ref> The first seven seasons were jointly sponsored by [[L&M]] cigarettes and Remington shaving products.

=== Transition to TV from radio ===

When ''Gunsmoke'' was adapted for television in 1955, in spite of a campaign to persuade the network, the network was not interested in bringing either Conrad or his radio costars to the television medium. Conrad's weight was rumored to be a deciding factor.  [[Denver Pyle]] was also considered for the leading role, as was [[Raymond Burr]], who was ultimately also seen as too heavy for the part. [[Charles Marquis Warren|Charles Warren]], television ''Gunsmoke'''s first director, said "His voice was fine, but he was too big. When he stood up, his chair stood with him."<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/91-MattBurr.htm "Raymond Burr auditioned for the role of television's Matt Dillon"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> According to Dennis Weaver's comments on the 50th Anniversary DVD, Disc One, Episode "Hack Prine", John Wayne was never considered for the role; to have done so would have been preposterous since Wayne was a top movie leading man. The belief Wayne was asked to pin on the badge is disputed by Warren. Although he agrees Wayne encouraged Arness to take the role, Warren says, "I hired Jim Arness on the strength of a picture he's done for me ... I never thought for a moment of offering it to Wayne."<ref name="Wayne" />

According to Thomas "Duke" Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, this story was told to him by legendary actor James Stewart: "Jimmy said he was in the office with Charles Warren when Mr. Wayne came in. Mr. Warren asked Wayne if he knew James Arness, and Mr. Wayne said yes. Mr. Warren told Mr. Wayne about the transition of the show from radio to TV, and Mr. Wayne readily agreed that James Arness would be a terrific choice for the part of Matt Dillon. I have no reason to doubt the story, because Jimmy absolutely knew everybody."

In the end, the primary roles were all recast, with Arness taking the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon (on the recommendation of Wayne, who also introduced the pilot); [[Dennis Weaver]] playing Chester Goode; [[Milburn Stone]] being cast as Dr. G. "Doc" Adams (later Galen "Doc" Adams); and [[Amanda Blake]] taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell. Macdonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. Meston was named head writer.

=== Additional casting ===
[[File:Ken Curtis James Arness Gunsmoke 1968.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ken Curtis]] as [[Festus Haggen|Festus]] and Arness as Dillon, 1968]]
Chester and Festus Haggen are perhaps Dillon's most recognizable [[sidekick]]s, though others became acting deputies for {{frac|2|1|2}}- to {{frac|7|1|2}}-year stints: Quint Asper ([[Burt Reynolds]]) (1962–65), Thad Greenwood ([[Roger Ewing]]) (1966–68), and Newly O'Brian ([[Buck Taylor]]) (1967–75), who served as both back-up deputy and doctor-in-training, having some studies in medicine via his uncle, which then continued under Doc Adams.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1962, [[Burt Reynolds]] was added to the show's lineup, as the "halfbreed" blacksmith Quint Asper, and performed that role elipsing the years just before the departure of [[Chester Goode]] and just after the appearance of Festus Haggen. Three of the actors, who played Dodge deputies, Ken Curtis, Roger Ewing, and Buck Taylor, had previous guest roles. Curtis, a big band and Western singer ([[Tommy Dorsey]] Orchestra, [[Shep Fields]] Band, [[Sons of the Pioneers]]), had five previous guest roles, including one in 1963 as a shady ladies' man named Kyle Kelly ("Lover Boy", season 9, show 2 [episode 307]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594225/?ref_=ttep_ep24|title="Gunsmoke" Lover Boy (TV Episode 1963)|author=Morganalee|date=November 16, 2010|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

Curtis first appeared in the 1959 episode "Jayhawkers" (season 4, episode 21 [episode 138]), where he played Phil Jacks, a Texas cowboy, with Jack Elam as his boss during a cattle drive from Texas. The second was another 1959 episode entitled "Change of Heart" (season 4, episode 32 [episode 149]), where he played Brisco. The third appearance is the 1960 episode "The Ex-Urbanites" (season 5, episode 30 [episode 186]), where he plays Jesse. He also had a small role as an Indian named Scout in the episode "Speak Me Fair" (season 5, episode 34 [episode 190]) in 1960. Curtis was reared in [[Las Animas, Colorado]], and for a time was a son-in-law of director [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594366/|title="Gunsmoke" Speak Me Fair (TV Episode 1960)|author=dougdoepke|date=April 30, 2013|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

In 1963, Weaver left the series to pursue a broader acting career in TV series and films. In 1964, Curtis was signed as a regular to play the stubbornly illiterate hillbilly Festus Haggen. The character, heretofore a comic feature, came to town in a 1962 episode titled "Us Haggens", to avenge the death of his twin brother Fergus, and decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done. Initially on the fringes of Dodge society, Festus was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick/part-time deputy to Matt Dillon when Reynolds left in 1965. In the episode "Alias Festus Haggen", he is mistaken for a robber and killer whom he has to expose to free himself (both parts played by Curtis). In a [[comic relief]] episode ("Mad Dog"), another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin. As a side note, only one episode  has all three actors in it playing their respective roles. It is the 1964 episode entitled "Prairie Wolfer" (season 9, episode 16 [episode 321]), with Dennis Weaver as Chester, Burt Reynolds as Quint, and Ken Curtis as Festus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/|title=Gunsmoke (TV Series 1955–1975)|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

When Milburn Stone left the series for health reasons for several episodes in 1971, [[Pat Hingle]] played his temporary replacement, Dr. John Chapman, whose presence was at first roundly resisted by Festus, a bickersome but close friend of Doc Adams.

=== Character back stories ===

[[File:Gunsmoke main cast 1967.JPG|left|thumb|Clockwise from top: Ken Curtis (Festus), James Arness (Matt), Amanda Blake (Kitty), and Milburn Stone (Doc) in 1968]]
The back stories of some of the main characters were largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Matt Dillon spent his early years in foster care, knew the Bible, was a wayward, brawling cowboy, and later mentored by a caring lawman. Kitty Russell, born in New Orleans and reared by a flashy foster mother (who once visited Dodge), apparently had no living family. <!-- (See "Miss Kitty" in the following section "Differences between the characters on the radio & TV versions".) --> Barkeep Sam was said to be married, but no sightings of a wife were made (In the episode "Tafton", he is seen side-by-side with a woman in a church singing). Quint Asper's white father was killed by white scavengers. Thad Greenwood's father, a storekeeper, was harassed to death by a trio of loathsome ne'er-do-well thieves. Chester Goode was known to be one of many brothers raised by an aunt and uncle, and he mentions his mother on one occasion; he referred to past service in the cavalry, and years as a [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle driver]] in Texas. The cause of Chester's stiff right leg was never given, but it was shown as his own leg and not a prosthesis. No direct reference was ever made to his disability in the script, although some oblique moments painted the free-spirited, comic deputy with a darker tone. Newly O'Brien was named after a physician uncle, who ignited his interest in medicine.

While Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly had a close personal relationship, the two never married. In a July 2, 2002, [[Associated Press]] interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, "If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with." In the episode "Waste", featuring [[Johnny Whitaker]] as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist "at the law's discretion" (meaning the marshal's). Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, [[Glenn Strange]], who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress [[Fran Ryan]] (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS' ''[[Green Acres]]'').

For over a decade on television, a sign hung over Doc's office that read "Dr. G. Adams". Milburn Stone was given free rein to choose the character's first name. The actor chose the name of an ancient Greek physician and medical researcher named [[Galen]].<ref>[[Galen]]</ref> He is first referred to in this manner by [[Theodore Bikel]] as "Martin Kellums" in the season-10 episode, "Song for Dying", aired February 13, 1965.<ref>[[List of Gunsmoke television episodes]]</ref>

=== Radio and TV character differences ===

[[File:Dennis Weaver Mariette Hartley Gunsmoke 1962.JPG|thumb|right|[[Dennis Weaver]] and [[Mariette Hartley]]]]
Differences were noted between the characters on the radio and TV versions of ''Gunsmoke.'' In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholic—at least in the program's early years. On radio's ''Gunsmoke'', Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore.<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/76-DocsRealName.htm "On radio's ''Gunsmoke'', Doc Adams' real name was Dr. Calvin Moore"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still crusty, was in many ways softer and warmer.

Nothing in the radio series suggested that Chester Proudfoot was disabled; this merely visual feature was added to the Chester Goode character on television because of actor Dennis Weaver's athletic build, to emphasize Chester's role as a follower and not an independent agent.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Miss Kitty, who after the radio series ended, was said by some to have engaged in prostitution, began in that role in the television series, working in the Long Branch Saloon. In an earlier 1956 episode, the owner of the Long Branch was named Bill Pence. A later 1956 episode begins with Chester pointing out to Matt (who had been out of town) a new sign under the Long Branch Saloon sign stating "Russell & Pence, Proprietors". In that same episode, John Dehner portrayed a dubious New Orleans businessman claiming to be Kitty's father, who tried to talk her into selling her half interest in the Long Branch and returning to New Orleans with him as a partner in his alleged freight business. In another 1956 episode (involving a new saloon girl named "Rena Decker" who causes four deaths by provoking men into fighting over her), Miss Kitty identifies herself as half-owner of the Long Branch with Mr. Pence (played by Judson Pratt). Subsequently, Miss Kitty transitioned to sole owner. Although early film episodes showed her descending from her second-floor rooms in the saloon with Matt, or showed her or one of her girls leading a cowboy up to those same rooms, these scenes disappeared later on, and viewers were guided to see Miss Kitty just as a kindhearted businesswoman.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Format ===

From 1955 to 1961, ''Gunsmoke'' was a half-hour show (retitled ''Marshal Dillon'' in syndication). It then went to an hour-long format. The series was retitled ''Gun Law'' in the UK. The ''Marshal Dillon'' syndicated rerun lasted from 1961 until 1964 on CBS, originally on Tuesday nights within its time in reruns.

=== Popularity ===

''Gunsmoke'' was TV's number one-ranked show from 1957 to 1961 before slipping into a decline after expanding to an hour. In 1967, the show's 12th season, CBS planned to cancel the series, but widespread viewer reaction (including a mention in Congress and the behind-the-scenes pressure from the wife of CBS's president) prevented its demise. On the Biography Channel's ''Behind The Scenes: Gilligan's Island'' (2002); ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' producer [[Sherwood Schwartz]] states that the wife of CBS's president pressured her husband not to cancel ''Gunsmoke'' in 1967, so the network cut ''Gilligan's Island'' instead. The show continued in its new time slot at 8&nbsp;pm on Mondays. This scheduling move led to a spike in ratings that had it once again rally to the top 10 in the [[Nielsen ratings]] until the 1973–74 television season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1973.htm|title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings > 1970's|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> In September 1975, despite still ranking among the top 30 programs in the ratings, ''Gunsmoke'' was canceled after a 20-year run; it was replaced by ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Mary Tyler Moore]]'' spin-offs ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' (though ''Rhoda'' actually debuted while ''Gunsmoke'' was still airing first-run). Thirty TV Westerns came and went during its 20-year tenure, and ''Gunsmoke'' was the sole survivor, with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' and ''[[Bonanza]]'' both leaving the airwaves in January 1973.

<!--not related [[Image:Coffeepot at Cracker Barrel, Lubbock, TX IMG 4686.JPG|200px|right|thumb|For most of its run, ''Gunsmoke'' ran its closing credits over a photograph of a coffee pot sitting on a stove in the [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] jail. Pictured here is a pot similar to the one used on the TV show.]] -->
Arness and Stone remained with the show for its entire run, though Stone missed seven episodes in 1971.

The entire cast was stunned by the cancellation, as they were unaware that CBS was considering it. According to Arness, "We didn't do a final, wrap-up show. We finished the 20th year, we all expected to go on for another season, or two or three. The (network) never told anybody they were thinking of canceling." The cast and crew read the news in the trade papers.<ref>Associated Press, July 2, 2002, Bob Thomas.</ref>

=== TV movies ===

In 1987, CBS commissioned a reunion movie entitled ''[[Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge]]''. James Arness and Amanda Blake returned in their iconic roles of Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty, with Fran Ryan returning in her role as Kitty's friend/saloon-owner Hannah and Buck Taylor returning as Newly O'Brian. Doc Adams and Festus Haggen were not featured in the film. Milburn Stone passed away in 1980 and the role of Doc was not recast. Ken Curtis, meanwhile, balked at the salary offer he received and said that he should be paid based on Festus' importance in the character hierarchy. The screenwriters responded to Curtis' absence by making Newly the new Dodge City marshal. The film, shot in [[Alberta]], featured a now-retired Marshal Dillon being attacked and a vengeful former rival returning to Dodge City to entrap him.

In 1990, the second telefilm, ''Gunsmoke: The Last Apache'', premiered. Since Amanda Blake had died the year before from [[AIDS]]-related complications, the writers decided to revisit a 1973 episode for the movie. The episode was based on "Matt's Love Story", which was noted for the marshal's first overnight visit to a female's lodgings. In the episode, Matt loses his memory and his heart, during a brief [[affair|liaison]] with "Mike" Yardner (played by [[Michael Learned]]). In the film, Learned returned and Mike reveals to Marshal Dillon that he is the father of their daughter Beth (played by [[Amy Stock-Poynton]]) and asks him for help in saving her. Dodge City was never again seen.

Other films included ''[[Gunsmoke: To the Last Man]]'' (1992), ''[[Gunsmoke: The Long Ride]]'' (1993), and ''[[Gunsmoke: One Man's Justice]]'' (1994). Arness appeared in all five films.

=== Syndication ===

All 635 episodes of the television series, and almost all 480 episodes of the radio show, still exist.

In syndication, the entire 20-year run of ''Gunsmoke'' is separated into three packages by [[CBS Television Distribution]]:

* '''1955 – 61 half-hour episodes''': These episodes are sometimes seen in their original format and sometimes in the ''Marshal Dillon'' format. When first-run, prime-time episodes of ''Gunsmoke'' expanded to an hour in fall 1961, CBS-TV reran the half-hour episodes as ''Marshal Dillon'' on the network on Tuesday nights from 1961 through 1964. These were later rerun in syndication. General syndication ended in the 1980s, but they do air occasionally on cable TV. Local stations would show the retitled ''Marshal Dillon'' version of the series, while the series under the original ''Gunsmoke'' title (with some episodes under the ''Marshal Dillon'' retitling) were seen in the late 1990s on [[TV Land]] and later [[Me-TV]]. [[Encore (TV channel)#Channels|Encore Westerns]] aired this version under the ''Marshal Dillon'' title. [[RetroPlex]] also aired two half-hour episodes under the original ''Gunsmoke'' title, although the episodes are advertised as ''Marshal Dillon'', on Saturday nights from 8 to 9 pm Eastern time.
* '''1961 – 66 one-hour black-and-white episodes''': These episodes have not been widely seen in regular syndication since the 1980s, although selected episodes did air from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s on [[ABC Family|CBN Cable/The Family Channel]], and later on Encore Westerns on a three-year contract that ended around 2006. As of January 2010, Encore Westerns was again airing the episodes. In October 2015, Me-TV announced that it would begin airing the one-hour black-and-white episodes on October 26.<ref>[http://www.metv.com/lists/6-classic-black-and-white-episodes-of-gunsmoke Classic black and white episodes of ''Gunsmoke''] at MeTV.com</ref>
* '''1966 – 75 one-hour color episodes''': The last nine seasons of the Western, the most widely syndicated episodes of the entire series' run, are still aired on some local stations, as well as nationally on TV Land and Me-TV.

=== DVD releases ===

In 2006, as part of ''Gunsmoke''{{'}}s 50th anniversary on TV, certain selected episodes were released on DVD in three different box sets. Twelve episodes, from 1955 to 1964, were selected for the ''Gunsmoke: Volume I'' box set, and another twelve episodes, from 1964 to 1975, were selected for the ''Gunsmoke: Volume II'' box set. Both sets are also available as a combined single "Gift Box Set". A third unique DVD box set, known as ''Gunsmoke: The Directors Collection'', was also released with 10 selected episodes from certain seasons throughout the series' 20-year history. All of these box sets are available on Region 1 DVD from [[Paramount Home Entertainment]] and [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]].

Additionally, Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD have released the first 11 seasons (seasons one to six are known as the "half-hour years") on DVD in Region 1, with season 11, volumes 1 and 2 being released on December 2, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Gunsmoke-Season-11/20232|title=Gunsmoke DVD news: Release Date for Gunsmoke - The 11th Season, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 - TVShowsOnDVD.com|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

* Despite a rumor to the contrary, [[Albert Einstein]] never appeared on ''Gunsmoke.'' Albert Einstein died on Aril 18, 1955, 4 1/2 months before ''Gunsmoke'' aired.

Actor [[Brent Spiner]] was quoted at the time as saying it was "the most notable moment in television history since Albert Einstein guest-starred on ''Gunsmoke''." Although Spiner's remark was a joke, someone wrote to ''[[TV Guide]]'' in 1994 to ask if Einstein really had appeared on the show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hopalong Einstein|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/gunsmoke1.asp|website=Snopes.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>
