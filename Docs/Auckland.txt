'''Auckland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|k|l|ə|n|d}} {{respell|AWK|lənd}}), in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], is the largest and most populous [[urban areas of New Zealand|urban area in the country]]. Auckland has a population of {{NZ population data||y}} - {{Decimals|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data||y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|0}} percent of New Zealand's population.{{NZ population data||||y}} It is part of the wider [[Auckland Region]], which includes the rural areas and towns north and south of the urban area, plus the islands of the [[Hauraki Gulf]], resulting in a total population of {{NZ population data|Auckland Council|y}}<ref name="NZ_population_data"/> that is governed by the [[Auckland Council]]. Auckland also has the largest [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] population of any city in the world.<ref name="AAAROUND">{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/destination/content/?titleid=83&xid=idh185804920_0099|title=Auckland and around|work=[[Rough Guides|Rough Guide]] to New Zealand, Fifth Edition|accessdate=16 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227085220/http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/destination/content/?titleid=83&xid=idh185804920_0099|archivedate=27 February 2008}}</ref> In [[Māori language|Māori]], Auckland's name is '''Tāmaki Makaurau''' and the adaptation of Auckland, to suit Māori phonetic rules, is '''Ākarana'''.

The Auckland urban area (as defined by [[Statistics New Zealand]]) ranges to [[Waiwera]] in the north, [[Kumeu]] in the northwest, and Runciman in the south. It is not contiguous; the section from Waiwera to [[Whangaparāoa Peninsula]] is separate from its nearest neighbouring suburb of [[Long Bay, New Zealand|Long Bay]]. Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east, the low [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south-east, the [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south-west, and the [[Waitakere Ranges]] and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow [[List of isthmuses|isthmus]] between the Manukau Harbour on the [[Tasman Sea]] and the [[Waitemata Harbour]] on the Pacific Ocean. It is one of the few cities in the world to have two harbours on two separate major bodies of water.

The 2014 [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey]] ranked Auckland 3rd place in the world on its list,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mercer.com/content/mercer/global/all/en/insights/view/2014/quality-of-living-rankings-spotlight-emerging-cities.html |title=Quality of living rankings spotlight emerging cities |date=June 2014 |publisher=Mercer |accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> while the ''[[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s'' [[World's most liveable cities]] index of 2015 ranked Auckland in 9th place.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eiu.com/public/thankyou_download.aspx?activity=download&campaignid=Liveability2015|title=Global Liveability Ranking 2015 |date=August 2015 |publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit |accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>
In 2010, Auckland was classified as a [[Global city|Beta World City]] in the World Cities Study Group's inventory by [[Loughborough University]].<ref>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html | "The World According to GaWC 2008"</ref> In terms of population it is the largest [[Oceanian]] city outside Australia.<ref>Long-Range Futures Research: An Application of Complexity Science, Robert Samet, 2009, 272</ref>

==History==
:''Main article [[History of Auckland]]''
{{see also|Timeline of Auckland}}
[[File:Lower Queen Street.jpg|thumb|Lower Queen Street in 1919]]

===Early history===
The isthmus was settled by [[Māori people|Māori]] around 1350, and was valued for its rich and fertile land. Many ''[[Pā (Māori)|pā]]'' (fortified villages) were created, mainly on the volcanic peaks. Māori population in the area is estimated to have been about 20,000 people before the arrival of Europeans.<ref>{{Cite book|title= New Zealand|author=[[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]]|year=1867|page=243 |url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document/1867_-_von_Hochstetter%2C_Ferdinand._New_Zealand/CHAPTER_XI%3A_The_Isthmus_of_Auckland}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkeologi.uu.se/afr/projects/BOOK/Bulmer/bulmer.pdf|title=''City without a state?

As a result, the region had relatively low numbers of Māori when European settlement of New Zealand began. There is, however, nothing to suggest that this was the result of a deliberate European policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/NgatiWhatua/3/en|title=Ngāti Whātua – European contact|work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=3 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|author=[[Michael King]]|isbn=0-14-301867-1|year=2003|page=135|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Auckland, N.Z.}}</ref> On 27 January 1832, Joseph Brooks Weller, eldest of the [[Weller brothers]] of [[Otago]] and Sydney bought land including the sites of the modern cities of Auckland and North Shore and part of Rodney District for "one large cask of powder" from "Cohi Rangatira".<ref>George Weller's Claim to lands in the Hauraki Gulf – transcript of original in National Archives, ms-0439/03 (A-H) HC.</ref>

After the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in February 1840 the new Governor of New Zealand, [[William Hobson]], chose the area as his new [[Capital of New Zealand|capital]] and named it after [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|George Eden, Earl of Auckland]] then [[Viceroy of India]].<ref name="DOING">''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD6123BF936A15752C1A966958260&scp=31&sq=auckland&st=nyt What's Doing In; Auckland]'' – ''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 November 1990</ref> The land that Auckland was established on was given to the Governor by local Maori [[iwi]] [[Ngāti Whātua]] as a sign of goodwill and in the hope that the building of a city would attract commercial and political opportunities for the iwi. Auckland was officially declared New Zealand's capital in 1841<ref>{{Cite book |title=From Tamaki-Makau-Rau to Auckland |author=[[Russell Stone]] |publisher=University of Auckland Press |year=2002 |ISBN=1-86940-259-6}}</ref> and the transfer of the administration from Russell (now [[Okiato|Old Russell]]) in the Bay of Islands was completed in 1842. However, even in 1840 [[Port Nicholson]] (later [[Wellington]]) was seen as a better choice for an administrative capital because of its proximity to the [[South Island]], and Wellington became the capital in 1865. After losing its status as capital Auckland remained the principal city of the [[Auckland Province]] until the provincial system was abolished in 1876.

[[File:Map of the Auckland urban area, 2009, cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The urbanised extent of Auckland (red), {{As of|2009|lc=y}}]]

In response to the ongoing rebellion by [[Hone Heke]] in the mid-1840s the government encouraged retired but fit British soldiers and their families to migrate to Auckland to form a defence line around the port settlement as garrison soldiers. By the time the first [[Fencibles]] arrived in 1848 the rebels in the north had been defeated so the outlying defensive towns were constructed to the south stretching in a line from the port village of Onehunga in the West to Howick in the east. Each of the four settlements had about 800 settlers, the men being fully armed in case of emergency but spent nearly all their time breaking in the land and establishing roads.

In the early 1860s Auckland became a base against the [[Māori King Movement]].<ref>http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-practice/slide-to-war</ref> This, and continued road building towards the south into the [[Waikato]], enabled [[Pākehā]] (European New Zealanders) influence to spread from Auckland. Its population grew fairly rapidly, from 1,500 in 1841 to 12,423 by 1864. The growth occurred similarly to other [[Commerce|mercantile]]-dominated cities, mainly around the port and with problems of overcrowding and pollution. Auckland had a far greater population of ex soldiers, many of whom were Irish, than other settlements. About 50% of the population was Irish which contrasted heavily with the majority English settlers in Wellington, [[Christchurch, New Zealand|Christchurch]] or [[New Plymouth]]. Most of the Irish, though not all, were from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Ulster]]. The majority of settlers in the early period were assisted by receiving a cheap passage to New Zealand.

===Modern history===

Trams and railway lines shaped Auckland's rapid expansion in the early first half of the 20th century, but soon afterward the dominance of the motor vehicle emerged and has not abated since; arterial roads and motorways have become both defining and geographically dividing features of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of urban areas such as the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]] (especially after the construction of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]), and [[Manukau City]] in the south.

Economic deregulation in the mid-1980s led to dramatic changes to Auckland's economy and many companies relocated their head offices from Wellington to Auckland. The region was now the nerve centre of the national economy. Auckland also benefited from a surge in tourism, which brought 75% of New Zealand's international visitors through its airport. In 2004, Auckland's port handled 43% of the country's container trade.<ref name="teara.govt.nz">{{cite web|title=Auckland Region – Driving the Economy: 1980s Onwards|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/auckland-region/page-11|publisher=Te Ara, Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref>

The face of urban Auckland changed when the government's immigration policy began allowing immigrants from Asia in 1986. According to the 1961 census data, Māori and Pacific Islanders comprised 5% of Auckland's population; Asians less than 1%.<ref>"[http://auckland.royalcommission.govt.nz/web/part2/2_auckland_now.html Auckland Now]". Royal Commission on Auckland Governance.</ref> By 2006 the Asian population had reached 18.0% in Auckland, and 36.2% in the central city. New arrivals from [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Korea]] gave a distinctive character to the areas where they clustered, while a range of other immigrants introduced [[mosque]]s, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temples, [[halal]] butchers and ethnic restaurants to the suburbs. The assertiveness of Pacific Island street culture and the increasing political influence of ethnic groups contributes to the city's multicultural vitality.<ref name="teara.govt.nz"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Rangitoto from Achilles Point.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rangitoto Island]] (in the background) from [[Achilles Point]]]]

===Volcanoes===
Auckland straddles the [[Auckland volcanic field]], which has produced about 90 volcanic eruptions from 50 volcanoes in the last 90,000 years. It is the only city in the world built on a basaltic volcanic field that is still active. It is estimated that the field will stay active for about 1 million years. Surface features include cones, lakes, lagoons, islands and depressions, and several have produced extensive lava flows. Some of the cones and flows have been partly or completely [[quarry|quarried]] away. The individual volcanoes are all considered extinct, although the volcanic field itself is merely [[dormant volcano|dormant]]. The trend is for the latest eruptions to occur in the north west of the field. Auckland has at least 14 large lava tube caves which run from the volcanoes down towards the sea. Some are several kilometres long. A new suburb, [[Stonefields]], has been built in an excavated lava flow, north west of [[Maungarei|Maungarei / Mount Wellington]], that was previously used as a quarry by Winstones.

Auckland's volcanoes are fuelled entirely by [[Mafic|basalt]]ic [[magma]], unlike the explosive [[subduction]]-driven [[volcanism]] in the central North Island, such as at [[Mount Ruapehu]] and [[Lake Taupo]] which are of  tectonic origin.<ref name="Smith and Allen">Ian E.M. Smith and Sharon R. Allen. ''[http://gns.cri.nz/Home/Learning/Science-Topics/Volcanoes/New-Zealand-Volcanoes/Volcano-Geology-and-Hazards/Auckland-Volcanic-Field-Geology Auckland volcanic field geology]''. Volcanic Hazards Working Group, Civil Defence Scientific Advisory Committee. Retrieved 30 March 2013. Also published in print as ''Volcanic hazards at the Auckland volcanic field''. 1993.</ref> The most recent and by far the largest volcano, [[Rangitoto Island]], was formed within the last 1000 years, and its eruptions destroyed the Māori settlements on neighbouring [[Motutapu Island]] some 700 years ago. Rangitoto's size, its symmetry, its position guarding the entrance to [[Waitemata Harbour]] and its visibility from many parts of the Auckland region make it Auckland's most iconic natural feature. Few birds and insects inhabit the island because of the rich acidic soil and the type of flora growing out of the rocky soil.

[[File:Auckland20061016222837.jpg|thumb|right|Auckland and the inner [[Hauraki Gulf]] from space]]

===Harbours, gulf and rivers===
Auckland lies on and around an [[isthmus]], less than two kilometres wide at its narrowest point, between [[Mangere Inlet]] and the [[Tamaki River]]. There are two harbours in the Auckland urban area surrounding this isthmus: [[Waitemata Harbour]] to the north, which opens east to the [[Hauraki Gulf]], and [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south, which opens west to the [[Tasman Sea]]. The total coastline of Auckland is {{convert|3702|km|mi}} long.<ref name=DRAFTLTP2012Page12>{{cite book|title=Draft Long-term Plan 2012–2022|author=Auckland Council|page=13|year=2012}}</ref>

Bridges span parts of both harbours, notably the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] crossing the Waitemata Harbour west of the [[Auckland CBD|Auckland Central Business District]] (CBD). The [[Mangere Bridge (bridges)|Mangere Bridge]] and the [[Upper Harbour Bridge]] span the upper reaches of the Manukau and Waitemata Harbours, respectively. In earlier times, [[portage]] paths crossed the narrowest sections of the isthmus.

Several islands of the Hauraki Gulf are administered as part of Auckland, though they are not part of the Auckland metropolitan area. Parts of [[Waiheke Island]] effectively function as [[Suburbs of Auckland|Auckland suburbs]], while various smaller islands near Auckland are mostly zoned 'recreational open space' or are nature sanctuaries.

Auckland also has a total length of approximately {{convert|21000|km|mi}} of rivers and streams, about 8&nbsp;percent of these in urban areas.<ref name=DRAFTLTP2012Page12/>

===Climate===
[[File:Auckland cbd view.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Auckland CBD|Central Business District]]]]
According to [[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research|NIWA]], Auckland has a [[subtropical climate]], with warm, humid summers and mild, damp winters.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/schools/resources/climate/overview/map_north |title = Overview of New Zealand Climate—Northern New Zealand |publisher = National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research |accessdate = 29 April 2015 }}</ref> Under [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's climate classification]], the city has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'').<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

The early morning calm on the isthmus during settled weather, before the sea breeze rises, was described as early as 1853: "In all seasons, the beauty of the day is in the early morning. At that time, generally, a solemn stillness holds, and a perfect calm prevails...".<ref name=1853_morning>''Auckland, the Capital of New Zealand'' – [[William Swainson (lawyer)|Swainson, William]], Smith Elder, 1853</ref> Many Aucklanders use this time of day to walk and run in parks.

Auckland occasionally suffers from air pollution due to [[Atmospheric particulate matter|fine particle]] emissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/albany/index.cfm?6901EAA9-14C2-3D2D-B939-BF1991A4D1E7|title=Air pollutants – Fine particles (PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>)|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> There are also occasional breaches of guideline levels of [[carbon monoxide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/environment/air-quality/air-pollutants/carbon-monoxide.cfm|title=Air pollutants – Carbon monoxide (CO)|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> While maritime winds normally disperse the pollution relatively quickly it can sometimes become visible as smog, especially on calm winter days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/environment/air-quality/aucklands-air-quality/aucklands-air-quality_home.cfm|title=Auckland's air quality|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>

Auckland is home to {{NZ population data||y}} people according to Statistics New Zealand's {{NZ population data|||y}}, {{Decimals|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data||y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|0}} percent of New Zealand's population.<ref name="NZ population data" />

Ethnic groups from all corners of the world have a presence in Auckland, making it by far the country's most [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] city. [[New Zealand European|Europeans]] make up the majority of Auckland's population, however substantial numbers of [[Māori people|Māori]], [[Pacific Islander]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] peoples exist as well. Auckland has the largest [[Polynesia]]n population of any city in the world.

The following table shows the ethnic profile of Auckland's population, as recorded in the 2001, 2006, & 2013 [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|New Zealand Census]]es.<ref>[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/data-tables/tables-about-a-place.aspx?request_value=24394&tabname=Culturaldiversity] 2013 Census about a place: Auckland region, Cultural Diversity</ref> The substantial percentage drop of 'Europeans' in 2006 was mainly caused by the increasing numbers of people from this group choosing to define themselves as 'New Zealanders', as a result of a media campaign that encouraged people to give the response 'New Zealander' even though this was not one of the groups listed on the census form. In the 2013 census fewer Europeans identify themselves as 'New Zealander', leading to a significant increase of numbers in 'Europeans'.<ref>[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/cultural-diversity.aspx] 2013 Census QuickStats about national highlights</ref>

Auckland's population is predominantly of [[Europe]]an origin, though the proportion of those of [[Asia]]n or other non-European origins has increased in recent decades due to immigration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7F0D2AFF-54F4-4CE9-BE7C-974597403FCB/0/Auckland.pdf|format=PDF|title=New Zealand — A Regional Profile — Auckland|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=3 October 2007|year=1999|pages=19–20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025142501/http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7F0D2AFF-54F4-4CE9-BE7C-974597403FCB/0/Auckland.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 25 October 2007}}</ref> and the [[Immigration to New Zealand|removal of restrictions directly or indirectly based on race]]. Immigration to New Zealand is heavily concentrated towards Auckland (partly for job market reasons). This strong focus on Auckland has led the immigration services to award extra points towards immigration visa requirements for people intending to move to other parts of New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/4DAD508D-CC26-425A-A57B-D2AF557C8510/0/1003.pdf Residence in New Zealand] ([[PDF]]) (Page 8, from the [[Immigration New Zealand]] website.

At the 2013 Census, 39.1 percent of Auckland's population were born overseas; in the local board areas of Puketapapa and Howick, overseas-born residents outnumbered those born in New Zealand.<ref name="quickstats_culture" /><ref name="NZdotstat" /> Auckland is home to over half (51.6 percent) of New Zealand's overseas born population, including 72 percent of the country's Pacific Island-born population, 64 percent of its Asian-born population, and 56 percent of its Middle Eastern and African born population.<ref name="quickstats_culture" />

===Religion===
[[File:St Mark's Anglican Church.jpg|thumb|[[Anglican]] church in [[Remuera]]]]
Around 48.5 percent of Aucklanders at the 2013 census affiliated with [[Christianity]] and 11.7 percent affiliated with non-Christian religions, while 37.8 percent of the population were [[irreligion|irreligious]] and 3.8 percent objected to answering. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the largest Christian denomination with 13.3 percent affiliating, followed by [[Anglicanism]] (9.1 percent) and [[Presbyterianism]] (7.4 percent).<ref name="quickstats_culture" />

==Lifestyle==
[[File:Vulcan Lane, Auckland, 2012.jpg|thumb|Pedestrians on Vulcan Lane]]
Auckland's lifestyle is influenced by the fact that while it is 70% rural in land area, 90% of Aucklanders live in urban areas<ref name=HISTORYMAKING>{{cite news|title=Auckland Council – History in the Making|date=March 2011|newspaper=Our Auckland|agency=Auckland Council|page=5}}</ref> – though large parts of these areas have a more suburban character than many cities in Europe and Asia.

Positive aspects of Auckland life are its mild climate, plentiful employment and educational opportunities, as well as numerous leisure facilities. Meanwhile, traffic problems, the lack of good public transport, and increasing housing costs have been cited by many Aucklanders as among the strongest negative factors of living there,<ref name=criticisms>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/transport/ctc/theproject.asp Central Transit Corridor Project] ([[Auckland City]] website, includes mention of effects of transport on public satisfaction)</ref> together with crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/safer/crimesafety/police.asp|title=Crime and safety profile – 2003|publisher=[[Auckland City Council]]|accessdate=8 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626092351/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/safer/crimesafety/police.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 June 2007}}</ref> Nonetheless, Auckland ranks 3rd in a survey of the [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey|quality of life]] of 215 major cities of the world (2015 data).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/features/quality_survey.html|title=City Mayors: Best cities in the world|work=citymayors.com}}</ref><ref name=top_cities>[http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.htm?idContent=1173105 Quality of Living global city rankings 2009] ([[Mercer Management Consulting]].

In 2011, Auckland was ranked by the [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] consulting firm as 149 of 214 centres for affordability, i.e. making it one of the most affordable cities world-wide to live in, with living expense of $20,000 per year, based on the comparative cost of 200 aspects of life including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods.<ref name="AFFORD">{{cite news|title=Auckland, Wellington, among 'best value' cities in the world|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10655269|accessdate=9 July 2010|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=29 June 2010|first=Susie|last=Nordqvist}}</ref>

===Leisure===

One of Auckland's nicknames, the "City of Sails", is derived from the popularity of sailing in the region. 135,000 [[yacht]]s and [[Launch (boat)|launches]] are registered in Auckland, and around 60,500 of the country's 149,900 registered yachtsmen are from Auckland,<ref>''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10405832 Punters love City of Sails]'' – ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Saturday 14 October 2006</ref><ref name="Heraldyacht"/> with about one in three Auckland households owning a boat.<ref name="LIVINGGULF">{{cite news|page=4|title=The Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, Part 2|newspaper=Inset to [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=2 March 2010}}</ref> The [[Viaduct Basin]], on the western edge of the CBD, hosted two [[America's Cup]] challenges ([[2000 America's Cup|2000 Cup]] and [[2003 America's Cup|2003 Cup]]).

On the eastern coastline of the North Shore, where the Rangitoto Channel divides the inner Hauraki Gulf islands from the mainland, there are excellent swimming beaches at Cheltenham and Narrow Neck in [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]], [[Takapuna]], Milford, and the various beaches further north in the area known as East Coast Bays. The west coast has popular surf spots such as [[Piha]], [[Muriwai]] and [[Bethells Beach]]. The [[Whangaparaoa Peninsula]], [[Orewa]], [[Omaha, New Zealand|Omaha]] and [[Pakiri]], to the north of the main urban area, are also popular. Many Auckland beaches are patrolled by [[surf lifesaving]] clubs, such as [[Piha Surf Life Saving Club]] the home of [[Piha Rescue]]. All surf lifesaving clubs are part of the [[Surf Life Saving Northern Region]].

[[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]], [[Britomart Transport Centre|Britomart]], [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby Road]], [[Karangahape Road]], [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]] and [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]] are popular retail areas, whilst the [[Otara]] and [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] [[fleamarket]]s offer an alternative shopping experience on weekend mornings. Most shopping malls are located in the middle- and outer-suburbs, with [[Sylvia Park]] and [[Westfield Albany]] being the largest.

===Arts and culture===
[[File:Auckland Art Gallery - Extension.jpg|thumb|The modern section of the [[Auckland Art Gallery]], completed in 2011]]

A number of arts events are held in Auckland, including the [[Auckland Festival]], the Auckland Triennial, the [[New Zealand International Comedy Festival]], and the [[New Zealand International Film Festival]]. The [[Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra]] is the city and region's resident full-time symphony orchestra, performing its own series of concerts and accompanying opera and ballet. Events celebrating the city's cultural diversity include the [[Pasifika Festival]], Polyfest, and the [[Lantern Festival|Auckland Lantern Festival]], all of which are the largest of their kind in New Zealand.

Important institutions include the [[Auckland Art Gallery]], [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]], [[New Zealand Maritime Museum]], [[Torpedo Bay Navy Museum|National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy]], and the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]]/. The Auckland Art Gallery is considered the home of the visual arts in New Zealand with a collection of over 15,000 artworks, including prominent New Zealand and Pacific Island artists, as well as international painting, sculpture and print collections ranging in date from 1376 to the present day. In 2009 the Gallery was promised a gift<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/the-collection/collections-bequests-and-donations/julian-and-josie-robertson-collection |title=Julian and Josie Robertson Collection |publisher=Auckland Art Gallery |date= |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> of fifteen works of art by New York art collectors and philanthropists [[Julian Robertson|Julian and Josie Robertson]] – including well-known paintings by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]. This is the largest gift ever made to an art museum in Australasia.

===Parks and nature===
[[File:Albert Park, Auckland, NZ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]] in downtown Auckland]]
[[File:View of Aukland from outside city.JPG|thumb|right|View from the top of [[Maungawhau|Maungawhau / Mount Eden]]]]

[[Auckland Domain]] is one of the largest parks in the city, close to the [[Auckland CBD]] and having a good view of the [[Hauraki Gulf]] and [[Rangitoto Island]]. Smaller parks close to the city centre are [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]], [[Myers Park, Auckland|Myers Park]], [[Western Park, Auckland|Western Park]] and [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]].

While most volcanic cones in the [[Auckland volcanic field]] have been affected by quarrying, many of the remaining cones are now within parks, and retain a more natural character than the surrounding city. Prehistoric earthworks and historic fortifications are in several of these parks, including [[Mount Eden]] / Maungawhau, [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]] and [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill]].

Other parks around the city are in [[Western Springs]], which has a large park bordering the [[MOTAT]] museum and the [[Auckland Zoo]]. The [[Auckland Botanic Gardens]] are further south, in [[Manurewa]].

Ferries provide transport to parks and nature reserves at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]], [[Waiheke Island]], Rangitoto Island and [[Tiritiri Matangi]]. The [[Waitakere Ranges]] Regional Park to the west of Auckland offers beautiful and relatively unspoiled [[The Bush#New Zealand|bush]] territory, as do the [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south.

===Horse and greyhound racing===

There are two thoroughbred racecourses in the city, at [[Ellerslie, New Zealand|Ellerslie]] and [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]].  The former hosts the [[Auckland Cup]] and [[New Zealand Derby]] in March, and the [[Railway Stakes (New Zealand)|Railway Stakes]] on New Year's Day, as well as many other feature events throughout the year.  The famed "Ellerslie Hill" is part of what is generally recognized as one of the great steeplechase courses in world racing.  The premier jumping events (the Great Northern Hurdles and [[Great Northern Steeplechase]]) are held at the beginning of September.  There is also a racecourse at [[Pukekohe Park Raceway]], inside the motor racing track.

Harness racing is held at [[Alexandra Park, Auckland|Alexandra Park]] in [[Greenlane]].  The [[Auckland Trotting Cup]] is held on 31 December, with many other feature events spread throughout the year.  Greyhound racing is held at Manukau Stadium.

==Economy==
{{Wide image|AucklandPano MC.jpg|1280px|The skyline of Auckland City, viewed from Mount Eden.}}

[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|[[Britomart Transport Centre]] looking northeast]]

Most major international corporations have an Auckland office, as the city is the economic capital of the nation. The most expensive office space is around lower [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] and the [[Viaduct Basin]] in the [[Auckland CBD]], where many financial and business services are located, which make up a large percentage of the CBD economy.<ref name="GLANCE">[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/glance.asp Auckland's CBD at a glance] (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])</ref> A large proportion of the technical and trades workforce is based in the industrial zones of [[South Auckland]].

The largest commercial and industrial areas of Greater Auckland are in the southeast of [[Auckland City]] and the western parts of Manukau City, mostly bordering the [[Manukau Harbour]] and the [[Tamaki River]] estuary.

The sub-national GDP of the Auckland region was estimated at US$47.6 billion in 2003, 36% of New Zealand's national GDP, 15% greater than the entire South Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|title=Regional Gross Domestic Product|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|year=2007|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref>

Auckland's status as the largest commercial centre of the country reflects in the high median personal income (per working person, per year) which was NZ$44,304 (approx. US$33,000) for the region in 2005, with jobs in the Auckland CBD often earning more.<ref name="income1">[http://www.labourmarket.co.nz/regionalprofile_ak.htm Auckland Regional Profile] (from labourmarket.co.nz, composed from various sources)</ref> The median personal income (for all persons older than 15 years of age, per year) was NZ$22,300 (2001),<ref name="income2">[http://www.emigratenz.org/nz-cities-compared.html Comparison of New Zealand's cities] (from ENZ emigration consulting)</ref> behind only [[North Shore City]] (also part of the Greater Auckland area) and [[Wellington]]. While office workers still account for a large part of Auckland's commuters, large office developments in other parts of the city, for example in [[Takapuna]] or [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]], both on the North Shore, are slowly becoming more common, reducing concentration on the Auckland CBD somewhat.

===Primary and secondary===
{{see also|List of schools in the Auckland Region}}

The Auckland urban area has 340 primary schools, 80 secondary schools, and 29 composite (primary/secondary combined) schools as of February 2012, catering for nearly quarter of a million students. The majority are state schools, but 63 schools are state-integrated and 39 are private.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0004/62572/Directory-Schools-Current.xls |title= Directory of Schools – as at 01 February 2012 |publisher= Ministry of Education New Zealand |accessdate= 7 March 2011}}</ref>

The city is home to some of the largest schools in New Zealand, including [[Rangitoto College]] in the East Coast Bays area, the largest school in New Zealand with {{NZ school roll data|28|y}} students as of {{NZ school roll data|||y|y||.}}

===Tertiary===
Auckland has a number of important educational institutions, including some of the largest universities in the country. Auckland is a major centre of overseas language education, with large numbers of foreign students (particularly East Asians) coming to the city for several months or years to learn English or study at universities – although numbers New Zealand-wide have dropped substantially since peaking in 2003.<ref>[http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/4c2567ef00247c6a4c2567be0008d2f8/4c2567ef00247c6acc2571b900127ca3?OpenDocument Survey of English Language Providers – Year ended March 2006] (from [[Statistics New Zealand]].

Amongst the more important tertiary educational institutes are the [[University of Auckland]], [[Auckland University of Technology]], [[Massey University]], [[Manukau Institute of Technology]] and [[Unitec New Zealand]].

==Housing==
Housing varies considerably between some suburbs having [[state housing|state owned housing]] in the lower income neighbourhoods, to palatial waterfront estates, especially in areas close to the Waitemata Harbour. Traditionally, the most common residence of Aucklanders was a standalone dwelling on a '[[quarter acre]]' (1,000 m²).<ref name="ARCGRO"/> However, subdividing such properties with 'infill housing' has long been the norm. Auckland's housing stock has become more diverse in recent decades, with many more apartments being built since the 1970s – particularly since the 1990s in the CBD.<ref name=DBHreport>{{cite web|title=Residential Land Supply Reports|url=http://www.dbh.govt.nz/residential-land-supply-reports|publisher=Department of Building and Housing|accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> Nevertheless, the majority of Aucklanders live in single dwelling housing and are expected to continue to do so – even with most of future urban growth being through [[intensification]].<ref name="ARCGRO"/>

Auckland's housing is amongst the least affordable in the world, based on comparing average house prices with average household income levels<ref>{{cite web|title=Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey|url=http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf|publisher=Demographia|accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> and house prices have grown well above the rate of inflation in recent decades.<ref name=DBHreport /> In April 2015, [[Quotable Value Limited|Quotable Value]] reported the average house price for Auckland metro was [[NZ$]]809,200, compared with $458,300 in Wellington, $473,100 in Christchurch and $375,900 in Hamilton.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.qv.co.nz/resources/monthly-residential-value-index |title= Residential house values |publisher= Quotable Value |accessdate= 17 June 2015}}</ref> There is significant public debate around why Auckland's housing is so expensive, often referring to a lack of land supply,<ref name=DBHreport /> the easy availability of credit for residential investment<ref name=bloomberg>{{cite web|last=Brockett|first=Matthew|title=Auckland's New York House Prices Prompt Lending Curbs: Mortgages|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-11/auckland-s-new-york-house-prices-prompt-lending-curbs-mortgages.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> and Auckland's high level of liveability.

In some areas, the Victorian [[villa]]s have been torn down to make way for redevelopment. The demolition of the older houses is being combated through increased heritage protection for older parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unitary Plan Key Topics: Historic Heritage and Special Character|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/planspoliciesprojects/plansstrategies/unitaryplan/Documents/Key%20topics%20in%20detail/upkeytopicshistoricheritageandspecialcharacterareas.pdf|publisher=Auckland Council|accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> Auckland has been described as having 'the most extensive range of timbered housing with its classical details and mouldings in the world', many of them Victorian-Edwardian style houses.<ref>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/district/Part07a.pdf Section 7.6.1.2 – Strategy] ([[PDF]]) (from the [[Auckland City Council]] District Plan – Isthmus Section)</ref>

==Government==

===Local===
{{See also|Auckland Region|Auckland Council}}
[[File:Aucklandtownhallnight.jpg|thumb|[[Auckland Town Hall]]]]
The [[Auckland Council]] is the [[Regions of New Zealand|local council]] with jurisdiction over the city of Auckland, along with surrounding rural areas, parkland, and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf.

From 1989 to 2010 Auckland was governed by several separate city and district councils. In the late 2000s (decade), New Zealand's central government and parts of Auckland's society felt that this large number of councils, and the lack of strong regional government (with the [[Auckland Regional Council]] having only limited powers) were hindering Auckland's progress. A [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]] was set up in 2007,<ref>''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/0a11.html4147429a11.html Auckland governance inquiry welcomed]'' – [[NZPA]], via 'stuff.co.nz', Tuesday 31 July 2007.

Retrieved 29 October 2007</ref> and in 2009 recommended a unified local governance structure for Auckland, amalgamating the councils.<ref>''[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0903/S00405.htm Minister Releases Report Of Royal Commission]'' – ''[[Scoop.co.nz]]'', Friday 27 March 2009</ref> Government subsequently announced that a "super city" would be set up with a single mayor by the time of New Zealand's local body elections in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10565528|title='Super city' to be in place next year, Maori seats axed|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|first=Edward|last=Gay|date=7 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://media.nzherald.co.nz/webcontent/document/pdf/Making%20Ak%20Greater%20final%20media.pdf|title=Making Auckland Greater|format=PDF|date=7 April 2009|work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref>
Many aspects of the reorganisation [[Auckland Council#Establishment|were or are still controversial]], from matters such as the form of representation for Maori, the inclusion or exclusion of rural council areas in the city, to the role of [[council-controlled organisation]]s that are intended to place much of the day-to-day business of council services at arms length from the elected Council.

In October 2010, [[Manukau City]] mayor [[Len Brown]] was elected the mayor of the amalgamated [[Auckland Council]]. He was re-elected for a second term in October 2013.
Twenty councillors make up the remainder of the Auckland Council governing body, elected from thirteen electoral wards.

===National===
Between 1842 and 1865, Auckland was the capital city of New Zealand. Parliament met in what is now [[Old Government House, Auckland|Old Government House]] on the [[University of Auckland]]'s City campus. The capital was moved to the more centrally located [[Wellington]] in 1865.

Auckland, because of its large population, is covered by 22 general electorates and three Maori electorates,<ref>{{cite web |title= Find my electorate |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/voters/find-my-electorate |publisher= Electoral Commission |accessdate= 29 December 2015}}</ref> each returning one member to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]]. The governing [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] holds thirteen general electorates, the opposing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] holds eight general electorates and all three Maori electorates, and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] holds the remaining electorate ({{NZ electorate link|Epsom}}).

In addition, there are a varying number of Auckland-based List MPs, who are elected via party lists. As of December 2015, there are twelve list MPs in the House who contested Auckland-based electorates at the {{NZ election link|2014}}: six from National, four from [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]], and one each from Labour and [[New Zealand First]].

;Road and rail
Private vehicles are the main form of transportation within Auckland, with around 7% of journeys in the Auckland region being undertaken by bus (2006 data),<ref name="TRAPLAN">{{Cite book|title=Auckland Transport Plan – June 2007|year=2007|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Transport Authority]]|page=8|url=http://www.arta.co.nz/assets/arta%20publications/publications%20page/Auckland%20Transport%20Plan%20June%202007%20-%20section%202.pdf}}</ref> and 2% undertaken by train and ferry.<ref name="TRAPLAN"/> For trips to the city centre at peak times the use of public transport is much higher, with more than half of trips are undertaken by bus, train or ferry.<ref name="arta.co.nz">[http://www.arta.co.nz/assets/board%20papers/2010/MBR%20June%202010.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> Auckland still ranks quite low in its use of public transport, having only 46 public transport trips per capita per year,<ref name="arta.co.nz"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods_and_services/access-data/tables/subnational-pop-estimates.aspx |title=Subnational population estimates tables |publisher=Stats.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> while Wellington has almost twice this number at 91, and Sydney has 114 trips.<ref>[http://www.arta.co.nz/assets/arta%20publications/2009/8-0%20134040%20ART%20RTLP%20Draft%202009_hires.pdf Auckland's Transport Challenges] (from the Draft 2009/10-2011/12 Auckland Regional Land Transport Programme, Page 8, [[Auckland Regional Transport Authority|ARTA]], March 2009.

Bus services in Auckland are mostly radial, with few cross-town routes. Late-night services (i.e. past midnight) are limited, even on weekends. A major overhaul of Auckland's bus services is planned to be implemented by 2016, significantly expanding the reach of "frequent" bus services: those that operate at least every 15 minutes during the day and early evening, every day of the week.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Network Project|url=https://www.aucklandtransport.govt.nz/improving-transport/new-network/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Auckland Transport|accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref>

;Other modes
[[Ports of Auckland|Auckland's ports]] are the second largest of the country, behind the [[Port of Tauranga]],<ref>"http://www.taurikobusinessestate.co.nz/about_tauranga.php"</ref> and a large part of both inbound and outbound New Zealand commerce travels through them, mostly via the facilities northeast of Auckland CBD. Freight usually arrives at or is distributed from the port via road, though the port facilities also have rail access. Auckland is a major cruise ship stopover point, with the ships usually tying up at [[Princes Wharf]]. Auckland CBD is connected to coastal suburbs, to the North Shore and to outlying islands by ferry.

[[File:Auckland airport international terminal.jpg|thumb|left|The International Terminal at [[Auckland International Airport]]]]
;Air
Auckland has various small regional airports and [[Auckland Airport]], the busiest of the country. Auckland Airport, New Zealand's largest, is in the southern suburb of Mangere on the shores of the Manukau Harbour. There are frequent services to Australia, and to other New Zealand destinations. There are also direct connections to many locations in the South Pacific, as well as the United States, Asia and [[Santiago]] and [[Buenos Aires]] in South America.<ref>Auckland Airport, http://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/</ref>

;Policies
Research at [[Griffith University]] has indicated that in the last 50 years, Auckland has engaged in some of the most pro-automobile transport policies anywhere in the world.<ref name="GRIFF">''[http://www.griffith.edu.au/centre/urp/urp_publications/Issues_Papers/URP_IP5_MeesDodsonAucklandTransport_April, 2006.pdf Backtracking Auckland: Bureaucratic rationality and public preferences in transport planning]'' – Mees, Paul; Dodson, Jago; Urban Research Program Issues Paper 5, [[Griffith University]], April 2006</ref> With public transport declining heavily during the second half of the 20th century (a trend mirrored in most Western countries such as the US),<ref>[http://www.publicpurpose.com/ut-usptshare45.htm US Urban Personal Vehicle & Public Transport Market Share from 1900] (from publicpurpose.com, a website of the [[Wendell Cox]] Consultancy)</ref> and increased spending on roads and cars, New Zealand (and specifically Auckland) now has the second-highest vehicle ownership rate in the world, with around 578 vehicles per 1000 people.<ref name=vehicle_ownership>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/ Sustainable Transport] North Shore City Council website</ref> Auckland has also been called a very pedestrian- and cyclist-unfriendly city, though some efforts are being made to change this.<ref name="Big steps to change City of Cars">''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10539171 Big steps to change City of Cars]'' – ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Friday 24 October 2008</ref> At the same, high-profile gaps in the network, such as the inability for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the Waitemata Harbour, will probably remain for the foreseeable future, with councils generally not considering the costs involved as sensible expense.<ref>''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10530271 Cycleway for bridge could prove too pricey]'' – ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Wednesday 3 September 2008</ref>

[[File:Auckland Harbour Bridge aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Auckland Harbour Bridge]]

===Infrastructure===
The [[New Zealand State Highway network|State Highway network]] connects the different parts of Auckland, with [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] being the major north-south thoroughfare through the city (including both the [[Auckland Northern Motorway|Northern]] and [[Auckland Southern Motorway|Southern Motorways]]) and the main connection to the adjoining regions of [[Northland Region|Northland]] and [[Waikato]]. The [[Northern Busway, Auckland|Northern Busway]] runs alongside parts of the Northern Motorway on the North Shore. Other state highways within Auckland include [[New Zealand State Highway 16|State Highway 16]] (the Northwest Motorway), [[New Zealand State Highway 18|State Highway 18]] (the Upper Harbour Motorway) and [[New Zealand State Highway 20|State Highway 20]] (the Southwest Motorway). [[New Zealand State Highway 22|State Highway 22]] is a non-motorway rural arterial connecting [[Pukekohe]] to the Southern Motorway at [[Drury, New Zealand|Drury]].

The [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]], opened in 1959, is the main connection between the [[North Shore City|North Shore]] and the rest of the Auckland metropolitan area. The Harbour Bridge provide eight lanes of vehicle traffic with a moveable median barrier, but does not provide access for rail, pedestrians or cyclists. The [[Central Motorway Junction]], also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland (State Highway 1 and State Highway 16).

Two of the longest arterial roads within Greater Auckland are [[Great North Road, New Zealand|Great North Road]] and [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] – the main connections in those directions before the construction of the State Highway network. Numerous arterial roads also provide regional and sub-regional connectivity, with many of these roads (especially on the isthmus) previously used to operate Auckland's [[Trams in New Zealand#Auckland|former tram network]] along.

Auckland has three main railway lines ([[Western Line, Auckland|Western]], [[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern]] and [[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern]]) with branch lines to [[Manukau Branch|Manukau]] and [[Onehunga Branch|Onehunga]]. These railway lines serve the general western, southern and central eastern parts of Auckland from the [[Britomart Transport Centre]] in downtown Auckland, the terminal station for all lines, where connections are also available to ferry and bus services. Preliminary work began in late 2015 to connect Britomart with the Western Line near Mount Eden railway station via an underground rail tunnel known as the [[City Rail Link]] project.

==Electricity==
Auckland is New Zealand's largest electricity consumer, and uses around 20% of the country's total electricity each year. Vector, which operates the majority of Auckland's local distribution system, measured maximum demand to be 1722&nbsp;MW in 2011, with 8679&nbsp;GWh delivered.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vector.co.nz/sites/vector.co.nz/files/Vector%20-%20Electricity%20AMP.pdf |title= Electricity Asset Management Plan 2012 – 2022 |publisher= Vector Limited |date= April 2012 |accessdate= 12 September 2012}}</ref>

There are two major electricity generation stations located within the city, both of which are natural gas-fired [[combined cycle]] [[gas turbine]] stations. [[Otahuhu Power Station|Otahuhu B]] is owned by [[Contact Energy]] and generates 380&nbsp;MW, while [[Southdown Power Station|Southdown]] is owned by [[Mighty River Power]] and generates 175&nbsp;MW. Since there is not enough generation in Auckland to meet the demand, and there is very little generation north of Auckland, most of the electricity for Auckland and Northland must be transmitted from power stations in the south, mainly from [[Huntly Power Station]] and the [[Waikato River]] hydroelectric stations.

[[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] owns the [[National Grid (New Zealand)|national grid]] and is responsible for the high voltage transmission lines into and across Auckland. Five major 220&nbsp;kV transmission lines connect Auckland with the Waikato, terminating into Otahuhu and Brownhill substations. The sub-transmission and distribution network in the Auckland region is mostly owned by [[Vector Limited|Vector]]. The network south of central Papakura is owned by Counties Power.

There have been several notable power outages in Auckland. The five-week-long [[1998 Auckland power crisis]] blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure occurred on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network. The [[2006 Auckland Blackout]] interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire shackle at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and short-circuited the lines supplying the inner city. In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, as well as all of [[Northland Region|Northland]], experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came into contact with the Otahuhu to Henderson 220&nbsp;kV line, the only major line supplying the region.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/forklift-sparks-blackout-thousands-3102479 |title= Forklift sparks blackout for thousands – tvnz.co.nz |publisher= Television New Zealand |date= 30 October 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153906/http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/forklift-sparks-blackout-thousands-3102479| archivedate= 15 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Transpower spent $1.25 billion in the early 2010s reinforcing the supply into and across Auckland, including a [[Whakamaru to Brownhill Road transmission line|400&nbsp;kV-capable transmission line]] from the Waikato River to Brownhill substation (operated at 220&nbsp;kV initially), and 220&nbsp;kV underground cables between Brownhill and Pakuranga, and between [[North Auckland and Northland grid upgrade project|Pakuranga and Albany via the CBD]]. These reduced the Auckland Region's reliance on Otahuhu substation and northern and western Auckland's reliance on the Otahuhu to Henderson line.

==Future growth==

Retrieved 2010)</ref> This substantial increase in population will have a major impact on transport, housing and other infrastructure that is in many cases already considered under pressure. It is also feared by some organisations, such as the [[Auckland Regional Council]], that [[urban sprawl]] will result from the growth and, as a result, that it is necessary to address this proactively in planning policy.

A 'Regional Growth Strategy' has been adopted that sees the intensification of existing areas and limits on further suburban expansion as its main [[sustainability]] measures.<ref>''[http://portal.jarbury.net/thesis.pdf From Urban Sprawl to Compact City: an analysis of Auckland's Urban Growth Management Strategies]'' – Arbury, Joshua – MA Thesis, University of Auckland</ref> This policy is contentious, as it naturally limits the uses of private land, especially the subdivision of urban fringe properties,<ref name="GREEN">''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=139&objectid=10436540 Green belt under siege]'' – ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Saturday 28 April 2007</ref> by setting 'Metropolitan Urban Limits' in planning documents like the [[District Plan]].<ref>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/growthstrategy/docs/Glossary.pdf Growth Strategy: Glossary and References] ([[PDF]]) (from the [[Auckland City Council]])</ref>

According to the 2006 Census projections, the medium-variant scenario shows that the population is projected to continue growing, to reach 1.93 million by 2031. The high-variant scenario shows the region's population growing to over two million by 2031.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Publications/PopulationStatistics/mapping-trends-in-the-auckland-region/population-change.aspx|title=Mapping Trends in the Auckland Region|work=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref>
