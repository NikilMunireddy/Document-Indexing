Located in the Moldavia region, Iași has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Romanian social, cultural, academic and artistic life. The city was the capital of the [[Principality of Moldavia]] from 1564 to 1859, then of the [[United Principalities]] from 1859 to 1862, and the capital of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] from 1916 to 1918.

Known as ''The Cultural Capital of Romania'', Iași is a symbol in Romanian history.

{{As of|2011}}, the city proper has a population of 290,422, making it the fourth [[Cities in Romania|most populous]] in Romania. According to [[Eurostat]], with 382,484 residents, Iași has the second most populous [[larger urban zone|functional urban area]] in Romania,<ref name="luz">{{cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&lang=en | title=Population by age groups and sex - larger urban zone | accessdate=30 July 2015 | publisher=Eurostat}}</ref> whereas more than 500,000 people live within its [[peri-urbanisation|peri-urban area]].<ref name="INSSER"/><ref name="periurban">{{cite web

Scholars have different theories on the origin of the name "Iași".<ref>[http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/local/inceputurile-iasului-o-incursiune-in-istoria-timpurie-a-orasului~ni4i2v The beginnings of Iași] {{Ro icon}}</ref> Some argue that the name originates with the [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribe [[Iazyges]] (of Iranian origin; possibly connected to the [[Yaz culture]] of Eastern Iran), one mentioned by [[Ovid]] as {{lang-la|"Ipse vides onerata ferox ut ducata '''Iasyx'''/ Per media Histri plaustra bubulcus aquas" and "'''Iazyges''' et Colchi Metereaque turba Getaque/ Danubii mediis vix prohibentur aquis"}}.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Ovid]]|title=Ovid: Tristia Book III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmZEAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60|page=60|edition=2nd, rev.|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1893|editor=Sidney George Owen|origyear=c. 8 a.d.}}</ref>

Other explanations show that the name originated from the Iranian [[Alans|Alanic]] tribe of '''Jassi''', having same origin with Yazyges tribes [[Jassic people]]. The Prut river was called as ''Alanus fluvius'' and the city as ''Forum Philistinorum''.<ref>Alexandru I. Gonța, Românii și hoarda de aur, Editura Demiurg,Iași, 2010, p. 102</ref><ref>C.C. Giurescu, Târguri sau orașe și cetăti moldovene, București, 1967, p.242-245</ref><ref>Gh. Ghibănescu, Originile Iașilor, în "Arhiva", Iași,1904, p.42-46</ref> From this population derived the plural of town name, "Iașii".

Another historian wrote that the '''Iasians''' lived among the Cumans and that they left the Caucasus after the first Mongolian campaign in the West, settling temporarily near the Prut. He asserts that the ethnic name of Jasz which is given to Iasians by Hungarians has been erroneously identified with Jazyges; also he shows that the word jasz is a Slavic loan word.<ref>A.P. Horvath, Pechenegs, Cumans, Iașians, Hereditas, Budapest, 1989, p. 64</ref>  The Hungarian name of the city (''Jászvásár'') literally means "Jassic Market"; the antiquated Romanian name, ''Târgul Ieșilor'' (and the once-favoured ''Iașii''), and the German ''Jassenmarkt'', may indicate the same meaning.

===Ancient times===
Archaeological investigations attest to the presence of human communities on the present territory of the city and around it as far back as the prehistoric age.<ref name="Mono"/> Later settlements included those of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]], a late [[Neolithic]] [[archaeological culture]].

There is archaeological evidence of human settlements in the area of Iași dating from the 6th to 7th centuries (Curtea Domnească) and 7th to 10th centuries; these settlements contained rectangular houses with semicircular ovens.<ref>C. Cihodaru, G. Platon, Istoria orașului Iași, Editura Junimea, 1980, pp 30-50</ref> Also a lot of vessels (9th-11th centuries) found in Iaşi had a cross, showing that inhabitants were Christians.<ref>Dan Gh. Teodor, Creștinismul la est de Carpați, Editura Mitopoliei Moldovei și Bucovinei, Iași, 1984, p.91,93,136</ref>

===Early development===
The name of the city is first found in a document from 1408. This is a grant of certain commercial privileges by the Moldavian [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander]] to the Polish merchants of [[Lviv|Lvov]]. However, as buildings older than 1408 still exist, e.g. the Armenian Church believed to be originally built in 1395, it is certain that the city existed before its first mentioning.

===Capital of Moldavia===
Around 1564, Prince [[Alexandru Lăpuşneanu|Alexandru Lăpușneanu]] moved the Moldavian capital from [[Suceava]] to Iași. Between 1561 and 1563, a school and a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church were founded by the [[Greeks|Greek]] adventurer Prince, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]].
[[File:Iglesia_Trei_Ierarhi_(acabada).jpg|thumb|left|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (1639)]]
[[File:Iassy-1701.jpg|thumb|Iași in the 1700s]]
[[File:Princely Court of Jassy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Culture (Iaşi)|Princely Court of Moldavia]]]]
In 1640, [[Vasile Lupu]] established the first school in which the mother-tongue replaced Greek, and set up a printing press in the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (''Monastery of the [[Three Holy Hierarchs|Three Hierarchs]]''; built 1635–39). In 1643, the first volume ever printed in [[Moldavia]] was issued in Iași.

The city was burned down by the [[Nogais|Tatars]] in 1513, by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1538, and by [[Imperial Russia]]n troops in 1686. In 1734, it was hit by the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].

Through the [[Peace of Iaşi|Peace of Iași]], the sixth [[Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792|Russo-Turkish War]] was brought to a close in 1792. A Greek revolutionary maneuver and occupation under [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] (Αλέξανδρος Υψηλάντης) and the [[Filiki Eteria]] (Φιλική Εταιρία) (1821, at the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]]) led to the storming of the city by the Turks in 1822. In 1844 there was a severe conflagration.

===Mid–19th to 20th century===
[[File:Iasi str al lapusneanu.jpg|thumb|left|Al. Lăpușneanu Street]]
[[File:Statuia lui Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Iaşi3.jpg|thumb|right|Union Square]]
Between 1564 and 1859, the city was the capital of Moldavia; then, between 1859 and 1862, both Iași and [[Bucharest]] were de facto capitals of the [[United Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia. In 1862, when the union of the two principalities was recognized under the name of ''Romania'', the national capital was established in Bucharest. For the loss caused to the city in 1861 by the removal of the seat of government to Bucharest the [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]] voted 148,150 [[Romanian leu|lei]] to be paid in ten annual instalments, but no payment was ever made.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

During [[World War I]], Iași was the capital of a severely reduced Romania for two years, following the [[Central Powers]]' occupation of Bucharest on 6 December 1916. The capital was returned to Bucharest after the defeat of [[Imperial Germany]] and its allies in November 1918. In November–December 1918 Iași hosted the [[Jassy Conference]].

===Jewish community===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Romania}}
Iași also figures prominently in [[Jew]]ish history, with the first documented presence of [[Sephardi Jews]] from the late 16th century. The oldest tomb inscription in the local cemetery probably dates to 1610.<ref name="yivo">[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Iasi Iași - YIVO Encyclopedia of  Jews in Eastern Europe]</ref> By the mid-19th century, owing to widespread [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Russian Jewish]] and [[History of the Jews in Poland|Galician Jewish]] [[immigration]] into Moldavia, the city was at least one-third Jewish.
[[File:Sinagoga Mare Iasi Dec 2015.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great Synagogue (Iaşi)|Great Synagogue]] (1671)]]

In 1855, Iași was the home of the first-ever [[Yiddish]]-language newspaper, ''Korot Haitim'', and, in 1876, the site of what was arguably the first-ever professional [[Yiddish theater]] performance, established by [[Abraham Goldfaden|Avraham Goldfaden]]. The words of [[HaTikvah]], the national anthem of [[Israel]], were written in Iași by [[Naftali Herz Imber]]. Jewish musicians in Iași played an important role as preservers of Yiddish folklore, as performers and composers.

According to the 1930 census, with a population of 34,662 (some 34%) out of the total of 102,872, Jews were the second largest ethnic group in Iași. There were over 127 [[synagogue]]s. 
After [[World War II]], in 1947, there were about 38,000 Jews living in Iași. Because of massive emigration to Israel, in 1975 there were about 3,000 Jews living in Iași and four synagogues were active.<ref name="yivo"/>

Currently, Iași has a dwindling Jewish population of ca. 300 to 600 members and two working synagogues, one of which, the 1671 [[Great Synagogue (Iaşi)|Great Synagogue]], is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest surviving synagogue]] in Romania.<ref name="samgrubersjewishartmonuments.blogspot.com">Samuel Gruber's Jewish Art & Monuments, Romania: Iași Synagogue in Restoration, May 31, 2010 [http://samgrubersjewishartmonuments.blogspot.com/2010/05/romaina-iasi-synagogue-in-restoration.html]</ref>

===World War II===
{{Main|Iași pogrom}}
During the war, while the full scale of [[the Holocaust]] remained generally unknown to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], the [[Iaşi pogrom|Iași pogrom]] stood as one of the known examples of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] brutality toward the Jews.

The pogrom lasted from 29 June to 6 July 1941, and over 13,266 people,<ref name="Iasipogrom">[http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0099_Iasi.html Jewishgen]<br/>[http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&sec=9&art=149652 The Iași Pogrom] at Radio Romania International<br/>[http://www.zionism-israel.com/dic/iasi_pogrom.htm Iași Pogrom] quotes 13,266 or 14,850 Jews killed.</ref> or one third of the Jewish population, were massacred in the pogrom itself or in its aftermath, and many were deported.

{{Main|First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive|Jassy–Kishinev Offensive (August 1944)}}
In May 1944, the Iași area became the scene of ferocious fighting between Romanian-[[Germany|German]] forces and the advancing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the city was partially destroyed. The German [[Grossdeutschland Division|Panzergrenadier Division ''Großdeutschland'']] won a defensive victory at the [[First Battle of Târgu Frumos|Battle of Târgul Frumos]], near Iași, which was the object of several [[NATO]] studies during the [[Cold War]]. By 20 August, Iași had been taken by Soviet forces.<ref>[http://www.ziarullumina.ro/articole;1985;1;2005;0;20-august-1944-ultima-zi-de-razboi-la-Iasi.html The last day of the war in Iași] {{Ro icon}}</ref>

===Postwar era===
Iași experienced a major wave of industrialization, in 1955-1975.<ref name="monumente">[http://www.monumenteiasi.ro/pagina.php?v=iasi_prezentare General View-The historical and architectural Iași] {{Ro icon}}</ref> During this period of time, it received numerous migrants from rural regions, and the urban area expanded.<ref>http://www.humangeographies.org.ro/articles/51/5_1_11_9_paftala.pdf</ref> The [[Socialist Republic of Romania|socialist period]] saw a growth of 235% in population and 69% in area in Iași; however, the urban planning was sometimes arbitrary and followed by dysfunctions.<ref name="Spatial Evolution Iași Stoleriu and Stoleriu">"THE SPATIAL EVOLUTION OF IAȘI CITY:

By 1989, Iași had become highly industrialized, with 108,000 employees (representing 47% of the total workforce) active in 46 large [[state-owned enterprise]]s, in various industries: chemical, pharmaceutical, metallurgical, heavy equipment, electronics, textile, food, energy, building materials, furniture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioge.ubbcluj.ro/maegs16/volume/6%20urban%20geology%20and%20impact%20of%20geohazards.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 6 urban geology and impact of geohazards.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref><ref name="industria">[http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/stiri/metalurgica-tepro-sau-delphi-cum-s-a-transformat-industria-din-iasi-fata-de-1989--84145.html Studiu comparativ de caz despre industria ieșeană] {{Ro icon}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Topography===
{{See also|Seven hills of Iași}}
[[File:RO IS Iaşi , panoramic view 4.JPG|thumb|Panoramic view of the Copou Hill]]
Located in the North-East of Romania, between the [[Iași Ridge]] ({{lang-ro|Coasta Iașilor}}) (the northern-most hill formation of the [[Bârlad Plateau]]) and the [[Jijia Plain]], Iași used to be the crossroads place of the commercial routes that passed through Moldavia coming from [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]], [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Tsardom of Russia]] and [[Constantinople]].

The city lies on the [[Bahlui River]], a tributary of the [[Jijia River (Prut)|Jijia]] (tributary of the [[Prut River|Prut]]). The surrounding country is one of uplands and woods, featuring monasteries and parks. Iași itself stands amid vineyards and gardens, partly on hills, partly in the in-between valley.

It is a common belief that Iași is built on seven hills ({{lang-ro|coline}}): Cetățuia, Galata, Copou-Aurora, Bucium-Păun, Șorogari, Repedea and Breazu, thus triggering comparisons with [[Rome]].

[[File:Central University Library Jan 1st 2016.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central University Library of Iași|Central University Library]]]]
The first institute of higher learning that functioned on the territory of Romania was [[Vasilian College|Academia Vasiliană]] (1640) founded by Prince [[Vasile Lupu]] as a "higher school for Latin and Slavonic languages", followed by the [[Princely Academy, Iaşi|Princely Academy]] in 1707.

The first high education structure in [[Romanian language]] was established in the autumn of 1813, when engineer [[Gheorghe Asachi]] laid the foundations of a class of engineers, its activities taking place within the [[Greek language|Greek]] Princely Academy.

After 1813, other moments marked the development of higher education in Romanian language, regarding both [[humanities]] and the technical science. In 1835, [[Academia Mihăileană]] founded by [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Mihail Sturdza]] is considered first Romanian superior institute in the country.
