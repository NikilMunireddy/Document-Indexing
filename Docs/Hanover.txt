'''Hanover''' or '''Hannover''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|n|oʊ-|v|ər}}; {{lang-de|Hannover}}, {{IPA-de|haˈnoːfɐ|pron|De-Hannover.ogg}}), on the River [[Leine]], is the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Lower Saxony]] (''Niedersachsen''), [[Germany]] and was once by [[personal union]] the family seat of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Kings of Great Britain]], under their title as the dukes of [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (later described as the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Electorate of Brunswick-Luneburg|of Hanover]]). At the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the Electorate was enlarged to become the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]].

From 1868 to 1946 Hanover was the capital of the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]] and also of the [[Hanover (region)|Hanover administrative region]] until that was abolished in 2005. It is now the capital of the ''Land'' of [[Lower Saxony]]. Since 2001 it has been part of the [[Hanover (district)|Hanover district]] (''Region Hannover''), which is a municipal body made up from the former [[Districts of Germany|district]] (''Landkreis Hannover'') and city of Hanover (note: although both ''Region'' and ''Landkreis'' are translated as ''district'' they are not the same).

With a population of 518,000, Hanover is a major centre of [[Northern Germany]] and the country's [[List of cities in Germany by population|thirteenth largest city]]. Hanover also hosts annual commercial [[World's fair|trade fairs]] such as the [[Hanover Fair]] and the [[CeBIT]]. Every year Hanover hosts the [[Schützenfest Hannover]], the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the [[Oktoberfest celebrations#Hannover|Oktoberfest Hannover]], the second largest [[Oktoberfest]] in the world (beside [[Oktoberfest of Blumenau]]). In 2000, Hanover hosted the world fair [[Expo 2000]]. The [[Hanover fairground]], due to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover is of national importance because of its universities and medical school, its international airport and its large [[Hanover Zoo|zoo]]. The city is also a major crossing point of railway lines and highways ([[Autobahn]]en), connecting European main lines in both the east-west ([[Berlin]]–[[Ruhr|Ruhr area]]) and north-south ([[Hamburg]]–[[Munich]], etc.) directions.

"Hanover" is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopaedias prefer the German spelling,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254472/Hannover Encyclopædia Britannica] uses "Hannover". It says "''English'' Hanover" but uses "Hannover" in the prose.</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254472/Hannover Microsoft Encarta] gives the primary spelling as "Hannover".</ref> and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hannover.de/english/ |title=Official Website of the City and Region of Hannover |publisher=Hannover.de |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}</ref> The English pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|n|ə|v|ər}}, with [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] on the first syllable and a [[Stress and vowel reduction in English|reduced]] second syllable, is applied to both the [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] spellings, which is different from German pronunciation {{IPA-de|haˈnoːfɐ|}}, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British [[House of Hanover]].

==History==
[[File:Merian Hannover Ostseite.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Hanover by [[Matthäus Merian]], 1654]]
{{see also|Timeline of Hanover|History of Hanover (region)}}
Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River [[Leine]]. Its original name ''Honovere'' may mean "high (river)bank", though this is debated (cf. ''das Hohe Ufer''). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the [[Hanseatic League]] city of [[Bremen]] by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide [[North German Plain]] and north-west of the [[Harz]] mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the [[Rhine]], [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the [[Low Countries]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] or [[Thuringia]].

In the 14th century the main [[Church (building)|churches]] of Hanover were built, as well as a [[Defensive wall|city wall]] with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern [[Harz Mountains]], which increased the city's importance.

In 1636 [[George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], ruler of the [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] [[principality of Calenberg]], moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] to the rank of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], colloquially known as the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Hanover]] after Calenberg's capital (see also: [[House of Hanover]]). Its electors would later become monarchs of [[Great Britain]] (and from 1801, of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]). The first of these was [[George I of Great Britain|George I Louis]], who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. [[Semi-Salic law]], which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]]. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also [[prince-elector|Electoral Princes]] of Hanover.

During the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714–1837), the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact, during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760–1837), there was only one short visit, by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 [[Viceroy]] [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|Adolphus]] represented the monarch in Hanover.

During the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The [[France|French]] army defeated the [[Hanoverian Army of Observation]], leading to the city's occupation as part of the [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|Invasion of Hanover]]. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick|Ferdinand of Brunswick]] the following year.

===19th century===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Hannover Georgstraße mit Theater (um 1895).jpg|thumb|Am [[Kröpcke]], 1895]]
[[File:Hannover Schloss zu Herrenhausen (um 1895).jpg|thumb|right|Schloss [[Herrenhausen Gardens|Herrenhausen]], 1895]]
After [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] imposed the [[Convention of Artlenburg]] (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 30,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to [[Great Britain]], where the [[King's German Legion]] was formed. It was the only German army to fight against France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815. The [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 elevated the electorate to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the [[Leine]] and since then has grown considerably.

In 1837, the [[personal union]] of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV's]] heir in the United Kingdom was female ([[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]], and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian war]]. Despite being expected to defeat Prussia at the [[Battle of Langensalza (1866)|Battle of Langensalza]], Prussia employed [[Prussian Army#Moltke the Elder|Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle]] to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]]. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.

For Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with [[Prussia]] meant an improvement in business. The introduction of [[free trade]] promoted economic growth, and led to the recovery of the [[Gründerzeit]] (the founders' era). Between 1871 and 1912 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,400.

In 1872 the first [[Horsecar|horse railway]] was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric [[tram]] was installed. In 1887 Hanover's [[Emile Berliner]] invented the record and the [[phonograph|gramophone]].

===Nazi Germany===
After 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] (Nazi party). A large [[German Jews|Jewish population]] then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to [[Poland]], including the [[Herschel Grynszpan|Grynszpan family]]. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and Jewish welfare organisations. The Gryszpan's son [[Herschel Grynszpan]] was in [[Paris]] at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard [[Ernst vom Rath]], who died shortly afterwards.<ref name=book-on-grynszpan>{{cite book|last=Schwab|first=Gerald|title=The Day the Holocaust Began: The Odyssey of Herschel Grynszpan|year=1990|publisher=Praeger|page=14}}</ref>

The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as [[Kristallnacht]].<ref name="kristal">{{cite web | url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005201 | title=Kristallnacht: A Nationwide Pogrom, November 9–10, 1938 | publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | work=Holocaust Encyclopedia | accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> It was in Hanover on 9 November 1938 that the [[synagogue]], designed in 1870 by [[Edwin Oppler]] in [[Neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] style, was burnt by the Nazis.

In September 1941, through the "Action Lauterbacher" plan, a [[ghetto]]isation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the [[Wannsee Conference]], on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to [[Riga]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Deutsch-jüdische Geschichte der Neuzeit.

During the war seven [[concentration camps]] were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined.<ref>{{cite book |title=Konzentrationslager in Hannover - KZ-Arbeit und Rüstungsindustrie in der Spätphase des Zweiten Weltkriegs |publisher=August Lax |author=Fröbe, Rainer |year=1989 |location=Hildesheim |isbn=3-7848-2422-6}}</ref> Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the [[United States Army]] arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. 
After the war a large group of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] survivors of the nearby [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] settled in Hanover.<ref name="lexikon">{{cite book |title='Stadtlexikon Hannover: Von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart' |publisher=Schlütersche |author=Mlynek, Klaus |year=2009 |location=Hannover |pages=17 |language=German}}</ref>

===World War II===
[[File:1943 WWII map of Hannover, Germany.jpg|thumb|right|WWII map of Hanover in 1943]]
As an important railroad and [[Junction (road)|road junction]] and production center, Hanover was a major target for [[strategic bombing during World War II]], including the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Oil Campaign]]. Targets included the [[VARTA|AFA]] ([[Herrenhausen|Stöcken]]), the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Deurag-Nerag]] refinery ([[Misburg]]), the [[Continental AG|Continental]] plants ([[Vahrenwald]] and [[Linden-Limmer|Limmer]]), the United light metal works (VLW) in [[Ricklingen]] and [[Laatzen]] (today [[Hanover fairground]]), [[Oil Campaign of World War II#References|the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant]], the [[Hanomag]] factory ([[Linden-Limmer|Linden]]) and the tank factory ''M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen'' (Badenstedt). [[Unfree labour|Forced labourers]] were sometimes used from the [[List of subcamps of Neuengamme|Hannover-Misburg subcamp]] of the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]]. Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city center was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/geschichte/geschichte_/Stadt_Hannover/gesch_zah/gesch_za3.html |title=History of Hanover 1866-1945, official web site of the city (German) |publisher=Hannover.de |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07}}</ref> After the war, the [[:de:Aegidienkirche (Hannover)|Aegidienkirche]] was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.

Hanover was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new [[States of Germany|state (Land)]] of [[Lower Saxony]] in 1946.

Today Hanover is a Vice-President City of [[Mayors for Peace]], an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2020visioncampaign.org |title=Mayors for Peace |publisher=2020visioncampaign.org |date=|accessdate=2011-04-07}}</ref>

One of the most famous sights is the ''[[Herrenhausen Gardens|Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen]]'':

The ''Great Garden'' is an important European baroque garden. The palace itself, however, was largely destroyed by Allied bombing but is currently under reconstruction.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Some points of interest are the ''Grotto'' (the interior was designed by the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle|Niki de Saint-Phalle]]), the ''Gallery Building'', the ''Orangerie'' and the two pavilions by Remy de la Fosse.
