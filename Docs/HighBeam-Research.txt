== History ==
The company was established in August 2002 after [[Patrick Spain]], who had just sold [[Hoover's]], which he had co-founded, bought [[eLibrary]] and Encyclopedia.com from [[Tucows]]. The new company was called Alacritude, LLC (a combination of Alacrity and Attitude). ELibrary had a library of 1,200 newspaper, magazine and radio/ TV transcript archives that were generally not freely available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/about-us|title=About Us|work=Highbeam|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref>

Original investors included Prism Opportunity Fund of Chicago and 1 to 1 Ventures of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]].

Spain stated, "There was a glaring gap between free search like [[Google]] and high-end offerings like [[LexisNexis]] and [[Factiva]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/fina-news/article.php/3315981|title=Q&A: Patrick Spain, Founder HighBeam|work=[[InterNetNews]]|date=February 20, 2004|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref>

Later in 2002, it bought Researchville.com. By 2003, it had increased its archive base to articles from 2,600 publishers. In 2004, it was renamed HighBeam Research. In 2005, it increased its publisher base to 3,500 publishers. In 2006, [[Oxford University Press]], [[Knight Ridder]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' archives were added. In 2008, it was purchased by [[Cengage Learning]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Gwen|url=http://www.websearchguide.ca/netblog/archives/008099.html|title=Gale Acquired HighBeam Research|work=Web search guide|date=December 16, 2008|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref> Highbeam features many articles by the UK based [[Trinity Mirror]] Group.
