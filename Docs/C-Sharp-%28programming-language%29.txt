'''C#'''<ref group="note">By convention, a [[number sign]] is used for the second character in normal text; in artistic representations, sometimes a true [[♯|sharp sign]] is used: C♯.</ref> (pronounced as ''see sharp'') is a [[multi-paradigm programming language]] encompassing [[strong typing]], [[Imperative programming|imperative]], [[Declarative programming|declarative]]<!--e.g. attributes-->, [[Functional programming|functional]], [[Generic programming|generic]], [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] ([[Class (computer science)|class]]-based), and [[Component-based software engineering|component-oriented]] programming disciplines. It was developed by [[Microsoft]] within its [[.NET Framework|.NET]] initiative and later approved as a standard by [[Ecma International|Ecma]] (ECMA-334) and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the [[Common Language Infrastructure]].

C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.<ref name="ECMA-334"/> Its development team is led by [[Anders Hejlsberg]]. The most recent version is C# 6.0, which was released on July 20, 2015.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last1=Lander|first1=Rich|title=Announcing .NET Framework 4.6|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/07/20/announcing-net-framework-4-6.aspx|website=.NET Blog|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=20 July 2015}}</ref>

* The C# language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, [[object-oriented programming]] language.
* The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering principles such as [[strong type]] checking, array [[bounds checking]], detection of attempts to use [[uninitialized variable]]s, and automatic [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]. Software robustness, durability, and programmer productivity are important.
* The language is intended for use in developing [[software components]] suitable for deployment in distributed environments.
* Portability is very important for source code and programmers, especially those already familiar with [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]].
* Support for [[internationalization and localization|internationalization]] is very important.
* C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and [[embedded system]]s, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated [[operating system]]s, down to the very small having dedicated functions.
* Although C# applications are intended to be economical with regard to memory and [[processing power]] requirements, the language was not intended to compete directly on performance and size with C or assembly language.

==History==
During the development of the .NET Framework, the [[Base Class Library|class libraries]] were originally written using a [[managed code]] compiler system called ''Simple Managed C'' (SMC).<ref>{{cite web

By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 [[Professional Developers Conference]], the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and [[ASP.NET]] runtime had been ported to C#.

C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft is Anders Hejlsberg, who was previously involved with the design of [[Turbo Pascal]], [[Embarcadero Delphi]] (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and [[Visual J++]]. In interviews and technical papers he has stated that flaws{{Citation needed| date = February 2010}} in most major programming languages (e.g. [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]], and [[Smalltalk]]) drove the fundamentals of the [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language itself.

[[James Gosling]], who created the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language in 1994, and [[Bill Joy]], a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation" of Java; Gosling further said that "[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted."<ref name="gosling">{{cite web

Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming somewhat less similar. One of the first major departures came with the addition of [[Generic programming|generics]] to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of [[Reification (computer science)|reification]] to provide "first-class" generic objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at class-load time.<ref>{{cite web

 | title = Generics (C# Programming Guide)
 | publisher = Microsoft| accessdate  = March 21, 2011}}</ref>
Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]] extensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of [[lambda expressions]], [[extension method]]s, and anonymous types.<ref>{{cite web
 | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx
 | title = LINQ: .NET Language-Integrated Query|author=Don Box and Anders Hejlsberg
 | publisher = Microsoft
 | date = February 2007
 | accessdate  = March 21, 2011}}</ref>  These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as [[Closure (computer science)|closures]], when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of "boilerplate" code that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability.<ref>{{cite web

C# was originally submitted to the ISO subcommittee JTC 1/SC 22 for review,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee.html?commid=45202 |title=Technical committees - JTC 1/SC 22 - Programming languages, their environments and system software interfaces |publisher=ISO |date= |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref> under ISO/IEC 23270:2003,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36768 |title=ISO/IEC 23270:2003 - Information technology - C# Language Specification |publisher=Iso.org |date=August 23, 2006 |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref> was withdrawn and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=42926 |title=ISO/IEC 23270:2006 - Information technology - Programming languages - C# |publisher=Iso.org |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref>

=== Name ===
[[File:Treblecsharp5.svg|thumb|100px|right|[[C♯ (musical note)|C-sharp musical note]]]]
The name "C sharp" was inspired by musical notation where a [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] indicates that the written note should be made a [[semitone]] higher in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]].<ref>{{cite web

This is similar to the language name of [[C++]], where "++" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1. The sharp symbol also resembles a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] of four "+" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++.<ref>{{cite web

Due to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol ({{unichar|266F|MUSIC SHARP SIGN|html=|nlink=Sharp (music)}}) is not present on the standard keyboard, the [[number sign]] ({{unichar|0023|NUMBER SIGN|html=}}) was chosen to represent the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language.<ref name="MS CSharp FAQ">{{cite web

This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification.<ref name="ECMA-334"/>  However, when it is practical to do so (for example, in advertising or in box art<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>), Microsoft uses the intended musical symbol.

The "sharp" suffix has been used by a number of other .NET languages that are variants of existing languages, including [[J Sharp|J#]] (a .NET language also designed by Microsoft that is derived from Java 1.1), [[A Sharp (.NET)|A#]] (from [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]), and the [[functional programming]] language [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]].<ref name="MS FSharp FAQ">{{cite web

==Syntax==
{{Main|C Sharp syntax}}
{{See also|Syntax (programming languages)}}
The core syntax of C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++ and Java. In particular:

* Semicolons are used to denote the end of a statement.
* [[Curly brackets]] are used to group statements.  Statements are commonly grouped into methods (functions), methods into classes, and classes into [[namespaces]].
* Variables are assigned using an [[equals sign]], but compared using [[==|two consecutive equals signs]].
* [[Square brackets]] are used with [[Array data structure|arrays]], both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.
<!-- I tried to make this overview easily readable for people other than computer scientists.  Sorry that it was nowhere near inclusive enough, but I lacked adequate time to finish it.-->

== Distinguishing features ==
{{See also|Comparison of C Sharp and Java}}
Some notable features of C# that distinguish it from C, C+, C++, and Java where noted, are:

=== Portability ===
By design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying [[Common Language Infrastructure]]&nbsp;(CLI).<ref>{{cite book|title=Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4 Six-in-One|year=2010|publisher=Wrox Press|isbn=0470499486}}</ref>  Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the CLI framework. However, the language specification does not state the code generation requirements of the compiler: that is, it does not state that a C# compiler must target a Common Language Runtime, or generate [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), or generate any other specific format. Theoretically, a C# compiler could generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or [[Fortran]].

=== Typing ===
C# supports strongly typed implicit variable declarations with the keyword <code>var</code>, and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword <code>new[]</code> followed by a collection initializer.

C# supports a strict [[Boolean data type]], <code>bool</code>. Statements that take conditions, such as <code>while</code> and <code>if</code>, require an expression of a type that implements the <code>true</code> operator, such as the Boolean type. While C++ also has a Boolean type, it can be freely converted to and from integers, and expressions such as <code>if(a)</code> require only that <code>a</code> is convertible to bool, allowing <code>a</code> to be an int, or a pointer. C# disallows this "integer meaning true or false" approach, on the grounds that forcing programmers to use expressions that return exactly <code>bool</code> can prevent certain types of programming mistakes such as <code>if (a = b)</code> (use of assignment <code>=</code> instead of equality <code>==</code>, which while not an error in C or C++, will be caught by the compiler anyway).

C# is more [[Type safety|type safe]] than C++. The only implicit conversions by default are those that are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]], and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ [[copy constructor]]s and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.

C# has explicit support for [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance and contravariance]] in generic types, unlike C++ which has some degree of support for contravariance simply through the semantics of return types on virtual methods.

[[enumerated type|Enumeration]] members are placed in their own [[Scope (programming)|scope]].

The C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions.

Local variables cannot [[Variable shadowing|shadow]] variables of the enclosing block, unlike C and C++.
<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Classes do NOT *NEED* to go in a Namespace. Check the spec or try it out yourself before stating otherwise.-->

=== Meta programming ===
[[Metaprogramming|Meta programming]] via C# attributes is part of the language. Many of these attributes duplicate the functionality of GCC's and VisualC++'s platform-dependent preprocessor directives.

=== Methods and functions ===
Like C++, and unlike Java, C# programmers must use the keyword <code>virtual</code> to allow methods to be overridden by subclasses.

''Extension methods'' in C# allow programmers to use static methods as if they were methods from a class's method table, allowing programmers to add methods to an object that they feel should exist on that object and its derivatives.

The type <code>dynamic</code> allows for run-time method binding, allowing for JavaScript-like method calls and run-time object composition.

C# has support for strongly-typed function pointers via the keyword <code>delegate</code>. Like the Qt framework's pseudo-C++ ''signal'' and ''slot'', C# has semantics specifically surrounding publish-subscribe style events, though C# uses delegates to do so.

C# offers Java-like <code>synchronized</code> method calls, via the attribute <code>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)]</code>, and has support for [[Mutual exclusion|mutually-exclusive locks]] via the keyword <code>lock</code>.

=== Property ===
C# provides [[property (programming)|properties]] as [[syntactic sugar]] for a common pattern in which a pair of methods, [[Mutator method|accessor (getter) and mutator (setter)]] encapsulate operations on a single [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]] of a class. No redundant method signatures for the getter/setter implementations need be written, and the property may be accessed using attribute syntax rather than more verbose method calls.

=== Namespace ===
A C# <code>namespace</code> provides the same level of code isolation as a Java <code>package</code> or a C++ {{C++|namespace}}, with very similar rules and features to a <code>package</code>.

=== Memory access ===
In C#, memory address pointers can only be used within blocks specifically marked as ''unsafe'', and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a "live" object or have the well-defined [[Nullable type|null]] value; it is impossible to obtain a reference to a "dead" object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of a value-type, array, string, or a block of memory allocated on a stack. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the <code>System.IntPtr</code> type, but it cannot dereference them.

Managed memory cannot be explicitly freed; instead, it is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses the problem of [[memory leak]]s by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory that is no longer needed.

=== Exception ===
[[Checked exceptions]] are not present in C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a conscious decision based on the issues of scalability and versionability.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>

=== Polymorphism ===
Unlike [[C++]], C# does not support [[multiple inheritance]], although a class can implement any number of interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.

However, unlike [[Java (programming language)|Java]], C# supports [[operator overloading]]. Only the most commonly overloaded operators in C++ may be overloaded in C#.

=== Functional programming ===
Though primarily an imperative language, C# 2.0 offered limited support for functional programming through [[first-class functions]] and closures in the form of anonymous delegates. C# 3.0 expanded support for functional programming with the introduction of a light weight syntax for lambda expressions, extension methods (an affordance for modules), and a [[list comprehension]] syntax in the form of a "query comprehension" language.

==Common type system==
C# has an ''unified type system''. This unified type system is called [[Common Type System]] (CTS).<ref name="insidecsharpp2ch4">{{cite book| last = Archer| first = Tom| title = Inside C#| year = 2001| publisher = Microsoft Press|location=Redmond, Washington|isbn=0-7356-1288-9|chapter=Part 2, Chapter 4: The Type System}}</ref>

An unified type system implies that all types, including primitives such as integers, are subclasses of the {{C sharp|System.Object}} class. For example, every type inherits a {{C sharp|ToString()}} method.

===Categories of data types===
CTS separates data types into two categories:<ref name="insidecsharpp2ch4" />

#  Reference types
#  Value types

Instances of value types do not have referential identity nor referential comparison semantics - equality and inequality comparisons for value types compare the actual data values within the instances, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded. Value types are derived from {{C sharp|System.ValueType}}, always have a default value, and can always be created and copied. Some other limitations on value types are that they cannot derive from each other (but can implement interfaces) and cannot have an explicit default (parameterless) constructor. Examples of value types are all primitive types, such as {{C sharp|int}} (a signed 32-bit integer), {{C sharp|float}} (a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number), {{C sharp|char}} (a 16-bit Unicode code unit), and {{C sharp|System.DateTime}} (identifies a specific point in time with nanosecond precision). Other examples are {{C sharp|enum}} (enumerations) and {{C sharp|struct}} (user defined structures).

In contrast, reference types have the notion of referential identity - each instance of a reference type is inherently distinct from every other instance, even if the data within both instances is the same. This is reflected in default equality and inequality comparisons for reference types, which test for referential rather than structural equality, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded (such as the case for {{C sharp|System.String}}). In general, it is not always possible to create an instance of a reference type, nor to copy an existing instance, or perform a value comparison on two existing instances, though specific reference types can provide such services by exposing a public constructor or implementing a corresponding interface (such as {{C sharp|ICloneable}} or {{C sharp|IComparable}}). Examples of reference types are {{C sharp|object}} (the ultimate base class for all other C# classes), {{C sharp|System.String}} (a string of Unicode characters), and {{C sharp|System.Array}} (a base class for all C# arrays).

Both type categories are extensible with user-defined types.

===Boxing and unboxing===
''Boxing'' is the operation of converting a value-type object into a value of a corresponding reference type.<ref name="insidecsharpp2ch4" /> Boxing in C# is implicit.

''Unboxing'' is the operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type.<ref name="insidecsharpp2ch4" /> Unboxing in C# requires an explicit [[Type conversion|type cast]]. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).<ref>{{cite web|last=Lippert |first=Eric |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/03/19/representation-and-identity.aspx |title=Representation and Identity |work=Fabulous Adventures In Coding |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=March 19, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref>

Example:
<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>
int foo = 42;         // Value type.
object bar = foo;     // foo is boxed to bar.
int foo2 = (int)bar;  // Unboxed back to value type.
</syntaxhighlight>

==Libraries==
The C# specification details a minimum set of types and class libraries that the compiler expects to have available. In practice, C# is most often used with some implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI), which is standardized as ECMA-335 ''Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)''.

== Examples ==
The following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic "[[Hello world]]" example:

<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The effect is to write the following text to the output console:

 Hello, world!

Each line has a purpose:

<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>
using System;
</syntaxhighlight>

The above line of code tells the compiler to use <code>System</code> as a candidate prefix for types used in the source code. In this case, when the compiler sees use of the <code>Console</code> type later in the source code, it tries to find a type named <code>Console</code>, first in the current assembly, followed by all referenced assemblies. In this case the compiler fails to find such a type, since the name of the type is actually <code>System.Console</code>. The compiler then attempts to find a type named <code>System.Console</code> by using the <code>System</code> prefix from the {{C sharp|using}} statement, and this time it succeeds. The {{C sharp|using}} statement allows the programmer to state all candidate prefixes to use during compilation instead of always using full type names.

<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>
class Program
</syntaxhighlight>

Above is a [[Class (computer science)|class]] definition. Everything between the following pair of braces describes {{C sharp|Program}}.

<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>
static void Main()
</syntaxhighlight>

This declares the class member method where the program begins execution. The .NET runtime calls the {{C sharp|Main}} method. (Note: {{C sharp|Main}} may also be called from elsewhere, like any other method, e.g. from another method of {{C sharp|Program}}.) The [[Method (computer programming)#Static methods|{{C sharp|static}} keyword]] makes the method accessible without an instance of {{C sharp|Program}}. Each console application's {{C sharp|Main}} entry point must be declared {{C sharp|static}}. Otherwise, the program would require an instance, but any instance would require a program. To avoid that irresolvable [[circular dependency]], C# compilers processing [[console application]]s (like that above) report an error, if there is no {{C sharp|static Main}} method. The {{C sharp|void}} keyword declares that {{C sharp|Main}} has no [[return value]].

<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>
Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
</syntaxhighlight>

This line writes the output. {{C sharp|Console}} is a static class in the {{C sharp|System}} namespace. It provides an interface to the standard input, output, and error streams for console applications. The program calls the {{C sharp|Console}} method {{C sharp|WriteLine}}, which displays on the console a line with the argument, the string {{C sharp|"Hello world!"}}.

A [[GUI]] example:

<syntaxhighlight lang=CSharp>
using System.Windows.Forms;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Hello, world!");
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

This example is similar to the previous example, except that it generates a [[dialog box]] that contains the message "Hello, world!" instead of writing it to the console.

==Standardization and licensing==

In August 2000, Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett-Packard and Intel Corporation co-sponsored the submission of specifications for C# as well as the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to the standards organization [[Ecma International]].
In December 2001, ECMA released ECMA-334 ''C# Language Specification''. C# became an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard in 2003 (ISO/IEC 23270:2003 - ''Information technology — Programming languages — C#''). ECMA had previously adopted equivalent specifications as the 2nd edition of C#, in December 2002.

In June 2005, ECMA approved edition 3 of the C# specification, and updated ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and [[Generic programming|generics]] (somewhat similar to C++ [[template (programming)|templates]]).

In July 2005, ECMA submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1, via the latter's Fast-Track process, the standards and related TRs. This process usually takes 6–9 months.

The C# language definition and the [[Common Language Infrastructure|CLI]] are standardized under [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[Ecma]] standards that provide [[Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing|reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing]] protection from patent claims.

==Implementations==
The reference C# compiler is [[Microsoft Visual C Sharp|Microsoft Visual C#]], which is open-source.<ref>https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn</ref>

Microsoft is leading the development of a new [[open source|open-source]] C# compiler and set of tools, previously codenamed "[[Microsoft Roslyn|Roslyn]]". The compiler, which is entirely written in [[managed code]] (C#), has been opened up and functionality surfaced as APIs. It is thus enabling developers to create refactoring and diagnostics tools.

Other C# compilers exist, often including an implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] and the .NET class libraries up to .NET 2.0:
* The [[Mono (software)|Mono]] project provides an open-source C# compiler, a complete open-source implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure including the required framework libraries as they appear in the ECMA specification, and a nearly complete implementation of the Microsoft proprietary .NET class libraries up to .NET 3.5. As of Mono 2.6, no plans exist to implement [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]]; [[Windows Workflow Foundation|WF]] is planned for a later release; and there are only partial implementations of [[Language Integrated Query#LINQ to SQL|LINQ to SQL]] and [[Windows Communication Foundation|WCF]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mono-project.com/Compatibility |title=Compatibility - Mono |publisher=Mono-project.com |date=December 19, 2011 |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref>
* The [[DotGNU]] project (now discontinued) also provided an open-source C# compiler, a nearly complete implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure including the required framework libraries as they appear in the ECMA specification, and subset of some of the remaining Microsoft proprietary .NET class libraries up to .NET 2.0 (those not documented or included in the ECMA specification, but included in Microsoft's standard .NET Framework distribution).
* Microsoft's Rotor project (currently called [[Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure]]) (licensed for educational and research use only) provides a [[shared source]] implementation of the CLR runtime and a C# compiler, and a subset of the required [[Common Language Infrastructure]] framework libraries in the ECMA specification (up to C# 2.0, and supported on Windows XP only).
