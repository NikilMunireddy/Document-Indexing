Smith, "A Doll's House", in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History'', Vol. 2, p. 81, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>

Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen's later work examined the realities that lay behind many façades, revealing much that was disquieting to many contemporaries. It utilized a critical eye and free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. The poetic and cinematic early play ''Peer Gynt'', however, has strong [[surrealism|surreal]] elements.<ref>Klaus Van Den Berg, "Peer Gynt" (review), Theatre Journal 58.4 (2006) 684-687</ref>

Ibsen wrote his plays in [[Danish language|Danish]] (the common written language of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]])<ref>[[Danish language]] was the written language of both Denmark and Norway at the time, although it was referred to as Norwegian in Norway and occasionally included some minor differences from the language used in Denmark. Ibsen occasionally used some Norwegianisms in his early work, but in his later work wrote a more standardised Danish, as his plays were published by a Danish publisher and marketed at both Norwegian and Danish audiences in its original language. Cf. {{cite book|last=Haugen|first=Einar|authorlink=Einar Haugen|title=Ibsen's Drama: Author to Audience|year=1979|publisher=University of Minnesota|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8166-0896-2|page=99|chapter=The nuances of Norwegian}}</ref> and they were published by the Danish publisher [[Gyldendal]]. Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in places reminiscent of [[Skien]], the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into [[Ibsen (family)|a merchant family]] connected to the [[Patriciate of Norway|patriciate]] of Skien, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister [[Sigurd Ibsen]]. Ibsen's dramas continue in their influence upon contemporary culture and film with notable film productions including ''A Doll's House'' featuring Jane Fonda and ''[[A Master Builder]]'' featuring Wallace Shawn.

==Early life and family==
[[File:Altenburg2.png|thumb|A [[silhouette]] of the [[Johan Andreas Altenburg|Altenburg]]/[[Paus]] family, members of the [[Skien]] [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciate]], shortly after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. To the right Ibsen's mother [[Marichen Altenburg]], her parents Hedevig Christine {{née}} Paus and ship-owner Johan Andreas Altenburg in the centre, to the left of Hedevig her nephew Henrik Johan Paus, who was not only Marichen Altenburg's cousin, but also the half brother of [[Knud Ibsen]], and who grew up with his uncle and aunt]]

Ibsen was born to [[Knud Ibsen]] (1797–1877) and [[Marichen Altenburg]] (1799–1869), a well-to-do merchant family, in the small port town of [[Skien]] in [[Telemark]] county, a city which was noted for shipping timber. As he wrote in an 1882 letter to critic and scholar [[Georg Brandes]], "my parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien", explaining that he was closely related with "just about all the [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] families who then dominated the place and its surroundings", mentioning the families [[Paus]], [[Plesner (Norwegian family)|Plesner]], [[von der Lippe (Norwegian family)|von der Lippe]], [[Cappelen (family)|Cappelen]] and [[Blom (family from Skien)|Blom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibsen.uio.no/BREV_1880-1889ht%7cB18820921GB.xhtml|title=Henrik Ibsens skrifter|publisher=}}</ref><ref>Haugen (1979: 23)</ref> Ibsen's grandfather, ship captain Henrich Ibsen (1765–1797), had died at sea in 1797, and Knud Ibsen was raised on the estate of ship-owner [[Ole Paus (shipowner)|Ole Paus]] (1776–1855), after his mother Johanne, {{née}} Plesner (1770–1847), remarried. Knud Ibsen's half brothers included lawyer and politician [[Christian Cornelius Paus]], banker and ship-owner [[Christopher Blom Paus]], and lawyer Henrik Johan Paus, who grew up with Ibsen's mother in the Altenburg home and after whom Henrik (Johan) Ibsen was named.

[[File:Hedvig C Paus2.jpg|thumb|left|Ibsen's grandmother Hedevig Altenburg, {{née}} [[Paus]] (cf. the character Hedvig in ''[[The Wild Duck]]'')]]
Knud Ibsen's [[Ibsen (family)|paternal ancestors]] were ship captains of Danish origin, but he decided to become a merchant, having initial success. His marriage to Marichen Altenburg, a daughter of ship-owner [[Johan Andreas Altenburg]] (1763–1824) and Hedevig Christine Paus (1763–1848), was a successful match.<ref name="Templeton"/> Theodore Jorgenson points out that "Henrik's ancestry [thus] reached back into the important Telemark family of Paus both on the father's and on the mother's side. Hedvig Paus must have been well known to the young dramatist, for she lived until 1848."<ref>Theodore Jorgenson (1945). ''Henrik Ibsen: life and drama''. Northfield, Minnesota: St. Olaf College Press</ref> Henrik Ibsen was fascinated by his parents' "strange, almost incestuous marriage," and would treat the subject of incestuous relationships in several plays, notably his masterpiece ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.<ref>Ferguson p. 280</ref>

When Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, however, his father's fortunes took a significant turn for the worse, and the family was eventually forced to sell the major Altenburg building in central Skien and move permanently to their small summer house, Venstøp, outside of the city.<ref>Michael Meyers. ''Henrik Ibsen'', Chapter one.</ref> Henrik's sister Hedvig would write about their mother: "She was a quiet, lovable woman, the soul of the house, everything to her husband and children. She sacrificed herself time and time again. There was no bitterness or reproach in her."<ref name="Templeton">Michael Meyers. ''Henrick Ibsen''. Chapter one.</ref><ref>Hans Bernhard Jaeger, ''Henrik Ibsen, 1828-1888: et literært livsbillede'', Copenhagen, [[Gyldendal]], 1888</ref> The Ibsen family eventually moved to a city house, Snipetorp, owned by Knud Ibsen's half-brother, wealthy banker and ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus.<ref name="Templeton"/>

His father's financial ruin would have a strong influence on Ibsen's later work; the characters in his plays often mirror his parents, and his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral conflicts stemming from dark secrets hidden from society. Ibsen would both model and name characters in his plays after his own family. A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his mother [[Marichen Altenburg]]; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their portrayal in dramas such as ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.<ref name="Templeton"/>

At fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school. He moved to the small town of [[Grimstad]] to become an apprentice [[pharmacist]] and began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was age 18, a liaison with a servant produced an illegitimate child, whose upbringing Ibsen had to pay for until the boy was in his teens, though Ibsen never saw the boy. Ibsen went to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (later renamed Kristiania and then Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His first play, the [[tragedy]] ''[[Catilina (play)|Catilina]]'' (1850), was published under the pseudonym "Brynjolf Bjarme", when he was only 22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, ''[[The Burial Mound]]'' (1850), received little attention. Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful.<ref>Michael Meyes. ''Henrik Ibsen.'' Chapters corresponding to individual early plays.</ref> Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', was apparently Norwegian author [[Henrik Wergeland]] and the [[Norwegian folk tales]] as collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]]. In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright.

==Life and writings==
He spent the next several years employed at [[Det norske Theater (Bergen)]], where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new, though largely unremarkable, plays. Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing.

Ibsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the [[Christiania Theatre]]. He married [[Suzannah Ibsen|Suzannah Thoresen]] on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child [[Sigurd Ibsen|Sigurd]] on 23 December 1859. The couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In 1864, he left Christiania and went to [[Sorrento]] in Italy in self-imposed exile. He didn't return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned to it he was a noted, but controversial, playwright.

His next play, ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'' (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1867), to which [[Edvard Grieg]] famously composed [[incidental music]] and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and traces of the latter's influence are evident in ''Brand'', it was not until after ''Brand'' that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously. Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read ''[[Either/Or]]'' and ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Ibsen's next play ''Peer Gynt'' was consciously informed by Kierkegaard.<ref>Shapiro, Bruce. ''Divine Madness and the Absurd Paradox''. (1990) ISBN 978-0-313-27290-5</ref><ref>Downs, Brian. ''Ibsen: The Intellectual Background'' (1946)</ref>

With success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the "drama of ideas". His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[File:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Ibsen photographed in Dresden ca. 1870]]

Ibsen moved from Italy to [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his main work, ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'' (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to [[Munich]] in 1875 and began work on his first contemporary realist drama ''[[The Pillars of Society]]'', first published and performed in 1877.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts about Pillars of Society|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/index.gan?id=473|work=ibsen.nb.no|date=10 August 2001|first=Jens-Morten|last=Hanssen|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> ''[[A Doll's House]]'' followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen's society.

''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her fiancé despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households. In ''An Enemy'', controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often "right" than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In ''An Enemy of the People'', Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the [[liberalism]] of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. ''An Enemy of the People'' was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, ''Ghosts''. The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of ''Ghosts''. The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local [[tanning|tannery]]. He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor.

As audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an iconoclast, Ibsen was equally willing to tear down the ideologies of any part of the political spectrum, including his own.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex. It tells the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the "Summons of the Ideal". Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed. Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary "invention", his wife is earning the household income.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Ibsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the "ideal" is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[File:Handwriting2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Letter from Ibsen to his English reviewer and translator [[Edmund Gosse]]: "30.8.[18]99. Dear Mr. Edmund Gosse! It was to me a hearty joy to receive your letter. So I will finally personally meet you and your wife. I am at home every day in the morning until 1 o'clock. I am happy and surprised at your excellent Norwegian! Your amicably obliged Henrik Ibsen."]]

Late in his career, Ibsen turned to a more introspective drama that had much less to do with denunciations of society's moral values. In such later plays as ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890) and ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation.  ''Hedda Gabler'' is probably Ibsen's most performed play,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} with the title role regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day. ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''A Doll's House'' center on female protagonists whose almost demonic energy proves both attractive and destructive for those around them, and while Hedda has a few similarities with the character of Nora in ''A Doll's House'', many of today's audiences and theatre critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} feel that Hedda's intensity and drive are much more complex and much less comfortably explained than what they view as rather routine feminism on the part of Nora.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Ibsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] which was to be adopted by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and others and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and [[Edmund Gosse]]. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel "Stephen Hero". Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Death==

==Ancestry==
[[File:Ibsen monogram.svg|thumb|[[Monogram]] of Henrik Ibsen]]

Ibsen's ancestry has been a much studied subject, due to his perceived foreignness<ref>Johan Kïelland Bergwitz, ''Henrik Ibsen i sin avstamning: norsk eller fremmed?'', [[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]], 1916</ref> and due to the influence of his biography and family on his plays. Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them.

The oldest documented member of the [[Ibsen family]] was ship's captain Rasmus Ibsen (1632–1703) from [[Stege, Denmark]]. His son, ship's captain Peder Ibsen became a [[Citizen|burgher]] of [[Bergen]] in Norway in 1726.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Ibsen/norsk_slekt_som_stammer_fra_skipper_Rasmus_Ibsen|title=Ibsen – norsk slekt|author=Terje Bratberg|work=Store norske leksikon}}</ref> Henrik Ibsen has Danish, German, Norwegian and some distant Scottish ancestry. Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish/German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship's captains. His biographer [[Henrik Jæger]] famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that "the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane". This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from one of the very few families of the patrician class of original Norwegian extraction, known since the 15th century. Ibsen's ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry.<ref>[[Henrik Jæger|Henrik Jaeger]], ''Henrik Ibsen. A Critical Biography'', Chicago: A.C. McClurg & Co., 1891</ref><ref>Bergwitz, Joh. K, ''Henrik Ibsen i sin avstamning. Norsk eller fremmed?'', Nordisk forlag, Gyldendalske boghandel, Christiania and Copenhagen, 1916</ref>

The name Ibsen is originally a [[patronymic]], meaning "son of Ib" (Ib is a Danish variant of [[Jacob (name)|Jacob]]). The patronymic became "frozen", i.e. it became a permanent [[family name]], already in the 17th century. The phenomenon of patronymics becoming frozen started in the 17th century in bourgeois families in Denmark, and the practice was only widely adopted in Norway from around 1900.

==English translations==
The authoritative translation in the English language for Ibsen remains the 1928 ten-volume version of the ''Complete Works of Henrik Ibsen'' from Oxford University Press. Many other translations of individual plays by Ibsen have appeared since 1928 though none have purported to be a new version of the complete works of Ibsen.
