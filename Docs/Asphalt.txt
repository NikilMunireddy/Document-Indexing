The primary use (70%) of asphalt/bitumen is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] particles to create [[asphalt concrete]]. Its other main uses are for [[bituminous waterproofing]] products, including production of [[roofing felt]] and for sealing flat roofs.<ref name=Ullmann>Anja Sörensen and Bodo Wichert "Asphalt and Bitumen" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2009. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a03_169.pub2}}http://www.qrpoil.com/site/?bitumen</ref>

The terms ''asphalt'' and ''bitumen'' are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance. In [[American English]], asphalt (or asphalt cement) is the carefully refined residue from the [[distillation]] process of selected crude oils. Outside the United States, the product is often called bitumen. Geologists often prefer the term ''bitumen''. Common usage often refers to various forms of asphalt/bitumen as "[[tar]]", such as at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. Another archaic term for asphalt/bitumen is "pitch".

Naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen is sometimes specified by the term "crude bitumen". Its viscosity is similar to that of cold [[molasses]]<ref>{{cite web

==Composition==
{{see also|Asphaltene}}
The components of asphalt are classified into four classes of compounds: 
*saturates, [[saturated hydrocarbons]], the % saturates correlates with softening point of the material
*Naphthene aromatics, consisting of partially hydrogenated polycyclic aromatic compounds.
*Polar aromatics, consisting of high [[molecular weight]] [[phenols]] and [[carboxylic acid]]s
*Asphaltenes, consisting of high molecular weight phenols and [[heterocyclic compound]]s
The naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components.   Additionally, most natural bitumens contain [[organosulfur compound]]s, resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to 4%.  Nickel and [[vanadium]] are found in the <10 ppm level, as is typical of some petroleum.<ref name=Ullmann/>

The substance is soluble in [[carbon disulfide]]. It is commonly modelled as a [[colloid]], with [[asphaltene]]s as the dispersed phase and [[wikt:maltene|maltenes]] as the continuous phase.<ref name="Quddus">{{cite book|author=Muhammad Abdul Quddus|year=1992 | title=thesis submitted to Department of Applied Chemistry; University of Karachi |chapter=Catalytic Oxidation of Asphalt| publisher=Higher Education Commission Pakistan: Pakistan Research Repository| location=Pakistan |page=6, in ch.2 pdf |url=http://eprints.hec.gov.pk/1171/1/891.html.htm}}</ref> and "it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt, because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large".<ref name="Quddus99">Muhammad Abdul Quddus (1992), p.99, in ch.5 pdf</ref>

Asphalt/bitumen can sometimes be confused with "[[coal tar]]", which is a visually similar black, thermoplastic material produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of coal. During the early and mid-20th century when [[town gas]] was produced, coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of tar to [[macadam]] roads led to the word [[tarmac]], which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and the Canadian [[oil sands]], both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar. Pitch is another term sometimes used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in [[Pitch Lake]].

==Occurrence==
[[File:Puy de Poix, gisement bitumeux.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Bituminous outcrop of the Puy de la Poix, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], France]]

The great majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum. Nonetheless, large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature. Naturally occurring deposits of asphalt/bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic [[algae]] ([[diatom]]s) and other once-living things. These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived. Under the heat (above 50&nbsp;°C) and [[pressure]] of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as asphalt/bitumen, [[kerogen]], or petroleum.

Natural deposits of asphalt/bitumen include lakes such as the [[Pitch Lake]] in Trinidad and Tobago and [[Lake Bermudez]] in Venezuela. Natural [[petroleum seep|seeps]] of asphalt/bitumen occur in the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and in the [[Dead Sea]].

Asphalt/bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as "oil sands" in Alberta, Canada, and the similar "tar sands" in Utah, US.
The Canadian province of [[Alberta]] has most of the world's reserves of natural bitumen, in three huge deposits covering {{convert|142000|km2}}, an area larger than [[England]] or [[New York state]]. These bituminous sands contain {{convert|166|Goilbbl}} of commercially established oil reserves, giving Canada the third largest [[oil reserves]] in the world. and produce over {{convert|2.3|Moilbbl/d}} of [[heavy crude oil]] and [[synthetic crude oil]]. Although historically it was used without refining to pave roads, nearly all of the bitumen is now used as [[raw material]] for [[oil refineries]] in Canada and the United States.<ref name="ST98"/>

The world's largest deposit of natural bitumen, known as the [[Athabasca oil sands]] is located in the [[McMurray Formation]] of Northern Alberta. This formation is from the early [[Cretaceous]], and is composed of numerous [[lens (geology)|lenses]] of oil-bearing sand with up to 20% oil.<ref name=bunger>{{cite journal | last1 = Bunger | first1 = J. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = K. | last3 = Dorrence | first3 = S. | year = 1979 | title = Compound types and properties of Utah and Athabasca tar sand bitumens | url = | journal = Fuel | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 183–195 | doi=10.1016/0016-2361(79)90116-9}}</ref> Isotopic studies attribute the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Selby | first1 = D. | last2 = Creaser | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Direct radiometric dating of hydrocarbon deposits using rhenium-osmium isotopes | url = | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = | pages = 1293–1295 | doi=10.1126/science.1111081}}</ref> Two smaller but still very large formations occur in the [[Peace River oil sands]] and the [[Cold Lake oil sands]], to the west and southeast of the Athabasca oil sands, respectively. Of the Alberta bitumen deposits, only parts of the Athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining. The other 80% has to be produced by oil wells using [[enhanced oil recovery]] techniques like [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]].<ref name=oilsandfacts>{{cite web |title= Facts about Alberta’s oil sands and its industry |publisher = Oil Sands Discovery Centre |url= http://history.alberta.ca/oilsands/resources/docs/facts_sheets09.pdf | accessdate= 19 January 2015}}</ref>

Much smaller heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the [[Uinta Basin]] in Utah, US.  The [[Tar Sand Triangle]] deposit, for example, is roughly 6% bitumen.<ref name=bunger />

Asphalt/bitumen occurs in [[hydrothermal vein]]s. An example of this is within the Uinta Basin of Utah, in the US, where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed [[Gilsonite]]. These veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the [[Green River Formation]] during burial and diagenesis.<ref>{{cite book |author=T. Boden and B. Tripp |title=Gilsonite Veins of the Uinta Basin, Utah |publisher=Utah Geological Survey, Special Study 141 |location=Utah, US |year=2012}}</ref>

They were covered by mud, buried deeply over the eons, and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of {{convert|50|to|150|C|sigfig=2}}. Due to pressure from the rising of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in southwestern Alberta, 80 to 55 million years ago, the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches, thus forming the oil sands.<ref name=oilsandfacts/>

==History==

===Ancient times===
The use of asphalt/bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth [[millennium]] BC in the early [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus valley sites]] like [[Mehrgarh]], where it was used to line the baskets in which crops were gathered.<ref>McIntosh, Jane. The Ancient Indus Valley. p. 57</ref>

In the ancient Middle East, the [[Sumer]]ians used natural asphalt/bitumen deposits for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between bricks and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship [[caulking]], and for waterproofing.<ref name="Abraham1938" /> The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] said hot asphalt/bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of [[Babylon]],<ref>Herodotus, Book I, 179</ref> as did [[Moses]] in reference to the [[Tower of Babel]].<ref>[http://biblehub.com/esv/genesis/11.htm Genesis 11:3]</ref>

A {{convert|1|km}} tunnel beneath the river [[Euphrates]] at [[Babylon]] in the time of Queen [[Semiramis]] (ca. 800 BC) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with asphalt/bitumen as a waterproofing agent.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/asphaltsandallie031010mbp/asphaltsandallie031010mbp_djvu.txt|title=Asphalts And Allied Substances|year=1920|author=Abraham, Herbert|publisher=D. Van Nostrand}}</ref>

Asphalt/bitumen was used by [[ancient Egypt]]ians to [[embalm]] mummies.<ref name="Abraham1938" /><ref>{{cite book |author=Pringle, Heather Anne |title=The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead |publisher=Barnes & Noble Books |location=New York, NY |year=2001 |pages= 196–197|isbn=0-7607-7151-0}}</ref> The [[Persian language|Persian]] word for asphalt is ''moom'', which is related to the English word [[mummy]]. The Egyptians' primary source of asphalt/bitumen was the [[Dead Sea]], which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew as ''Palus Asphaltites'' (Asphalt Lake).

Approximately 40 AD, [[Dioscorides]] described the Dead Sea material as ''Judaicum bitumen'', and noted other places in the region where it could be found.<ref>{{cite book|title=De Materia Medica|author=Pedanius Dioscorides|year=}}. Original written ca. 40 AD, translated by Goodyer (1655) [http://www.therenaissanceman.org/images/DIOSCORIDES-Intro_Book_1.doc] ''or'' ''(Greek/Latin)'' compiled by Sprengel (1829) [https://books.google.com/books/download/Pedanii_Dioscoridis_____de_materia_medic.pdf?id=JwAUAAAAQAAJ&output=pdf] p. 100 (p. 145 in PDF).</ref>

In the ancient Far East, natural asphalt/bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher [[Fraction (chemistry)|fractions]], leaving a thermoplastic material of higher molecular weight which when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling. This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing,<ref name="Abraham1938" /> such as [[scabbard]]s and other items. Statuettes of household [[deities]] were also cast with this type of material in Japan, and probably also in China.

In North America, archaeological recovery has indicated asphalt/bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone [[projectile point]]s to wooden shafts.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18502 |title=C.Michael Hogan (2008) '&#39;Morro Creek'&#39;, ed. by A.

===Early use in Europe===
One hundred years after the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, [[Pierre Belon]] described in his work ''[[Observations (Pierre Belon)|Observations]]'' in 1553 that ''pissasphalto'', a mixture of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and bitumen, was used in [[Dubrovnik]] for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in [[Venice]] where it could be bought by anyone.<ref>Africa and the Discovery of America, Volume 1, page 183, [[Leo Wiener]], BoD – Books on Demand, 1920 reprinted in 2012, ISBN 978-3864034329</ref>
An 1838 edition of ''Mechanics Magazine'' cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by "a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – "principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth", which at that time made the water unusable. "He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces" in palaces, "the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation".<ref name="MechanicsMagazineSep1838176">{{cite book|date=7 April – 29 September 1838 | title=The Mechanic's magazine, museum, register, journal and gazette| volume=29|chapter=Nothing New under the Sun (on French asphaltum use in 1621)| publisher=W.A.

Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used "for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes". Its rise in Europe was "a sudden phenomenon", after natural deposits were found "in France at Osbann ([[Bas-Rhin]]), the Parc ([[Ain]]) and the Puy-de-la-Poix ([[Puy-de-Dôme]])", although it could also be made artificially.<ref name="LewisMiles">{{cite book |author=Miles, Lewis |title=in Australian Building: A Cultural Investigation |volume=|chapter=Section 10.6: Damp Proofing|year=2000 | publisher= | location=|page=10.06.1| url=http://www.mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/climatic-design/climatic-design-damp-proofing.pdf|accessdate=11 November 2009}}.

===Photography and art===
Bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist [[Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]] to make the [[View from the Window at Le Gras|oldest surviving photograph from nature]]. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a [[pewter]] plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a [[photoresist]] in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.<ref>[http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html Niépce Museum history pages.] Retrieved 27 October 2012. {{wayback|url=http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html |date=20070803222723 |df=y }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ The First Photograph (Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin).] Retrieved 27 October 2012.</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2016}}

Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is [[Théodore Géricault]]'s [[Raft of the Medusa]] (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.<ref name="WSJ 2009-08-21">{{cite news |last=Spiegelman |first=Willard |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204119704574236393080650258 |title=Revolutionary Romanticism: 'The Raft of the Medusa' brought energy to French art |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York City |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2016-01-27 }}</ref>

===Early use in the United Kingdom===
Among the earlier uses of asphalt/bitumen in the United Kingdom was for etching.

In 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt/bitumen, which had uses beyond paving.

=== Early use in the US ===
The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples. On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]] and [[Chumash people|Chumash]] peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits. All three used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water. Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.

Roads in the US have been paved with materials that include asphalt/bitumen since at least 1870, when a street in front of the Newark, NJ City Hall was paved. In many cases, these early pavings were made from naturally occurring "bituminous rock", such as at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in [[Ritchie County, West Virginia]] from 1852 to 1873. In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial.<ref name="NAPA2005">{{cite book|first=Dan |last=McNichol|year=2005| title=Paving the Way: Asphalt in America| edition=|chapter=| publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association| location=Lanham, MD |pages= |url=http://store.hotmix.org/index.php?productID=144|isbn=0-914313-04-5}}</ref> Asphalt/bitumen was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.<ref name="Gerhard1908" />

=== Early use in Canada ===
{{see also | Bitumount | History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)}}
Canada has the world's largest deposit of natural bitumen in the [[Athabasca oil sands]] and Canadian [[First Nations]] along the [[Athabasca River]] had long used it to waterproof their canoes. In 1719, a [[Cree]] Indian named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample for trade to [[Henry Kelsey]] of the [[Hudson’s Bay Company]], who was the first recorded European to see it. However, it wasn't until 1787 that fur trader and explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] saw the Athabasca oil sands and said, "At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance."<ref name=oilsandfacts/>

The value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen were not. The nearest town, [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]] was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the bitumen to pave 600 feet of road in [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. Other roads in Alberta were paved with oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl A. Clark]] of the [[Alberta Research Council]] patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/robert-fitzsimmons.html | title = Robert C. Fitzsimmons (1881-1971) | year = 2010 | publisher = Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame | access-date = 2016-01-20}}</ref> built the [[Bitumount]] oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to {{convert|300|oilbbl|sigfig=1}} per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives.<ref name = oilsandfacts/> Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a [[Provincial historic sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.history.alberta.ca/energyheritage/bitumount/default.aspx | title = Bitumount | year = 2016 | publisher = Government of Alberta | access-date = 2016-01-20}}</ref>

==Modern use==

[[File:Road repaving.jpg|thumb|The [[road surface]] is removed and a new bitumen layer is added]]

=== Rolled asphalt concrete ===
{{main|Asphalt concrete}}
The largest use of asphalt/bitumen is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States. Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt/bitumen cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt/bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt/bitumen and the aggregates, but [[Asphalt concrete#Mixture formulations|warm-mix asphalt technologies]] allow producers to reduce the temperature required. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Asphalt Paving Industry: A Global Perspective, 2nd Edition | publisher = National Asphalt Pavement Association and European Asphalt Pavement Association | date = February 2011  | location = Lanham, Maryland, and Brussels | url = http://www.asphaltpavement.org/images/stories/GL_101_Edition_3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 27 September 2012 | isbn = 0-914313-06-1}}</ref>

When maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements, such as [[Pavement milling|milling]] to remove a worn or damaged surface, the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures. The asphalt/bitumen in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=How Should We Express RAP and RAS Contents? |journal=Asphalt Technology E-News |year=2014 |authorlink=National Center for Asphalt Technology |volume=26 |issue=2 |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/ncat/info-pubs/newsletters/fall-2014/recycledcontents.html |accessdate=2015-08-13 }}</ref> With some 95% of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2012/hm12.cfm |title=Highway Statistics Series: Public Road Length Miles by Type of Surface and Ownership |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2015-08-13 }}</ref> a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year. According to industry surveys conducted annually by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and the National Asphalt Pavement Association, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asphalt Pavement Recycling|url=http://www.asphaltpavement.org/recycling|work=Annual Asphalt Pavement Industry Survey on Recycled Materials and Warm-Mix Asphalt Usage: 2009–2013|publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>

Asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world. Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off.

=== Mastic asphalt ===
[[Mastic asphalt]] is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt ([[asphalt concrete]]) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen ([[binder (material)|binder]]) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% added asphalt/bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of {{convert|210|°C|°F}} and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} thick.

=== Asphalt emulsion ===
A number of technologies allow asphalt/bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form "cutbacks" with reduced melting point, or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt/bitumen into an [[emulsion]]. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt/bitumen and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, [[cationic]] and [[anionic]]. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. [[Chipseal]] involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.

=== Synthetic crude oil ===
{{main|Synthetic crude oil}}
{{see also|Petroleum production in Canada}}
Synthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) [[power shovel]]s and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) [[dump trucks]] for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl Clark]] of the [[University of Alberta]] during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a [[Upgrader|bitumen upgrader]] which converts it into a [[light crude oil]] equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional [[oil pipeline]]s and can be fed into conventional [[oil refineries]] without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over {{convert|1|Moilbbl}} per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.<ref name=NEBstats>{{Cite web | url = https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/index-eng.html | title = Crude Oil and Petroleum Products | publisher  = [[National Energy Board]] of Canada | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}</ref>

In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products: The [[Suncor Energy]] upgrader near [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]] produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the [[Syncrude Canada]], [[Canadian Natural Resources]], and [[Nexen]] upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell [[Scotford Upgrader]] near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery.<ref name=CAPP2015>{{Cite web | url = http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 | title = 2015 CAPP Crude Oil Forecast, Markets & Transportation | publisher = [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}</ref> A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near [[Redwater, Alberta]], will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.nwrpartnership.com/ | title = The Project | publisher = North West Redwater Partnership | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}</ref>

=== Non-upgraded crude bitumen ===
{{See also|Western Canadian Select}}
Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican [[heavy crude oil|heavy oil]] in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through [[oil pipeline]]s to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US [[Gulf coast]], where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US [[Midwest]] where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline.<ref name=CAPP2015/> By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over {{convert|1.3|Moilbbl}} per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.<ref name=NEBstats/>

Because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with [[natural-gas condensate]] in a form called [[dilbit]] or with synthetic crude oil, called [[synbit]]. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as [[Western Canadian Select]]. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|Mexican Mayan]] or Arabian [[Dubai Crude]].<ref name=CAPP2015/>

===Other uses===
[[Asphalt shingle|Roofing shingle]]s account for most of the remaining asphalt/bitumen consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt/bitumen is used to make [[Japan black]], a [[lacquer]] known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink, and to make the color much darker.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Asphalt/bitumen is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.

==Production==
[[File:Asphalt plant pic.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Picture of typical asphalt plant for making asphalt.]]
About 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984{{update inline|date=June 2014}}. It is obtained as the "heavy" (i.e., difficult to distill) fraction. Material with a [[boiling point]] greater than around 500&nbsp;°C is considered asphalt. Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], gasoline and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a [[de-asphalting unit]], the crude asphalt is treated with either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by "blowing" the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This step makes the product harder and more viscous.<ref name=Ullmann/>

Asphalt/bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around {{convert|150|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Sometimes [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called "bitumen feedstock", or BFS. Some [[dump truck]]s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt/bitumen, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a [[release agent]] due to environmental concerns.

===From oil sands===
{{see also | oil sands}}
Naturally occurring crude asphalt/bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from "[[Oil sands]]", currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres<ref name=oilsands/> (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven [[oil reserves]] in the world. The [[Athabasca oil sands]] is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to [[surface mining]], although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by ''[[in-situ#Petroleum|in situ]]'' methods. Because of [[world oil market chronology from 2003|oil price increases after 2003]], producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about {{convert|2.3|Moilbbl|m3}} per day and was projected to rise to {{convert|4.4|Moilbbl|m3}} per day by 2020.<ref name="CAPP"/> The total amount of crude asphalt/bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about {{convert|310|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=1}},<ref name=ST98/> which at a rate of {{convert|4400000|oilbbl/d}} would last about 200 years.

===Alternatives and bioasphalt ===
{{Main|Peak oil|Global warming|Bioasphalt}}
Although uncompetitive economically, asphalt/bitumen can be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, [[molasses]] and rice, corn and potato [[starch]]es. Asphalt/bitumen can also be made from waste material by [[fractional distillation]] of used [[motor oil]], which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills. Use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates, resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/10298436.2010.488729| issn = 1029-8436| volume = 11| issue = 6| pages = 541–553| last = Hesp| first = Simon A.M.|author2=Herbert F.

Nonpetroleum-based asphalt/bitumen binders can be made light-colored. Lighter-colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation, and have less surface heat than darker surfaces, reducing their contribution to the [[urban heat island]] effect.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/ Heat Island Effect]. From the website of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</ref> Parking lots that use asphalt alternatives are called [[green parking lots]].

===Natural bitumen===
{{expand section|with=description of other natural sources of bitumen|date=May 2015}}
Selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in the native asphalt deposit of [[Selenice]], in [[Albania]], the only European asphalt mine still in use. The rock asphalt is found in the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction. The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon disulphide), with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring & ball) around 120&nbsp;°C. The insoluble matter, consisting mainly of silica ore, ranges from 8% to 17%.
 
The Albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman [[Henri Coquand|Coquand]] published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giavarini|first1=Carlo|title=Six Thousand Years of Asphalt|date=March 2013|publisher=SITEB|isbn=978-88-908408-3-8|pages=71–78}}</ref>

Today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable. The bitumen Selenizza is produced primarily in granular form, after melting the asphalt pieces selected in the mine.
 
Selenizza<ref name="Selenice Bitumi">[http://www.selenicebitumi.com/engindex.php], Selenice Bitumi for more information about Selenizza</ref> is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional bitumen to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot bitumen in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in big bags or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.

A [[Life-cycle assessment|Life Cycle Assessment]] (LCA) study of the natural bitumen Selenizza compared with petroleum bitumen, has shown that the environmental impact of the natural bitumen is about half the impact of the road bitumen produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Giavarini|first1=C.|last2=Pellegrini|first2=A.|title=Life cycle assessment of Selenice asphalt compared with petroleum bitumen|journal=The 1st Albanian Congress on Roads|pages=234–237}}</ref>

=== Occupational safety ===
People can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[Recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> over a 15-minute period.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Asphalt fumes|url = http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0042.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}</ref> Asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing, and other applications. In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly temperature, that effect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions.<ref>{{cite book |last=IARC |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol103/ |title=Bitumens and Bitumen Emissions, and Some N- and S-Heterocyclic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons |volume=103 |location=Lyon, France |publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-92-832-1326-0 |accessdate=2015-12-07 }}</ref> In particular, temperatures greater than 199&nbsp;°C (390&nbsp;°F), were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement.<ref name="CavallariZwack2012">{{cite journal|last1=Cavallari|first1=J.

==Etymology==
The word ''asphalt'' is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French ''asphalte'', based on [[Late Latin]] ''asphalton'', ''asphaltum'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄσφαλτος (''ásphaltos'', ''ásphalton''), a word meaning "asphalt/bitumen/[[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fsfaltos ἄσφαλτος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> which perhaps derives from ἀ-, "without" and σφάλλω (''sfallō''), "make fall".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfa%2Fllw σφάλλω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> Note that in French, the term ''asphalte'' is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the "asphaltic concrete" used to pave roads. It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically [[Herodotus]] mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall.<ref>Herodotus, ''The Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.179.4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 1.179.4], on Perseus</ref> From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (''asphalte'') and English ("asphaltum" and "asphalt").

The expression "bitumen" originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words ''jatu'', meaning "pitch," and ''jatu-krit'', meaning "pitch creating", "pitch producing" (referring to coniferous or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally ''gwitu-men'' (pertaining to pitch), and by others, ''pixtumens'' (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to ''bitumen'', thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word ''cwidu'' (mastix), the German word ''Kitt'' (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word ''kvada''.<ref name="Abraham19381">Abraham, Herbert (1938), p.1</ref>

Neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with [[tar]] or [[coal tars]].

=== Modern usage ===
[[File:Asfaltna baza Ivanovec.1.jpg|thumb|An asphalt mixing plant for hot aggregate]]
In [[British English]], the word 'asphalt' is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and asphalt/bitumen (also called [[tarmac]] in common parlance). When bitumen is mixed with clay it is usually called asphaltum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Béguin|first1=André|title=A technical dictionary of printmaking - Bitumen|url=http://www.polymetaal.nl/beguin/mapb/bitumen.htm|website=www.polymetaal.nl|accessdate=27 January 2016}}</ref> The earlier word 'asphaltum' is now archaic and not commonly used.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  In [[American English]], 'asphalt' is equivalent to the British 'bitumen'. However, 'asphalt' is also commonly used as a shortened form of '[[asphalt concrete]]' (therefore equivalent to the British 'asphalt' or 'tarmac'). In [[Australian English]], bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces. In [[Canadian English]], the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy [[crude oil]],<ref name=oilsands>{{cite web

Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen. The [[tar sands]] of [[Alberta, Canada]] are a similar material.
