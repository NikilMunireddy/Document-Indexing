'''Ayr United Football Club''' are a Scottish [[association football]] club based in [[Ayr]] that plays soccer in the [[Scottish Championship]], the second tier of the [[Scottish Professional Football League]]. Formed in 1910 after the merger of former clubs [[Ayr Parkhouse F.C.]] and [[Ayr F.C.]] (the latter being a prior merger of [[Ayr Thistle F.C.]] and [[Ayr Academicals F.C.]] in 1879), their nickname is "The Honest Men", taken from a line in the poem "[[Tam o' Shanter (Burns poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]" by [[Scotland]]'s national poet, [[Robert Burns]]. They play at [[Somerset Park]].<ref>http://www.ayr-united.co.uk/html/club_history.html</ref>

The club have spent 34 seasons in Scotland's top division altogether, though the last was in the [[1977–78 in Scottish football|1977–78 season]]. The club have been the champions of the second tier of Scottish football on six occasions and of the third tier twice, but have not won any national cup competitions. The club's most famous and most successful manager is [[Ally MacLeod]], who went on to manage the [[Scottish national football team]]. In May 2016 United secured promotion to the [[Scottish Championship]] via the Playoffs.

In 2016 Ayr were criticised for there shirt release, by painting there new kits onto women with big knockers. Craig Mclurkin was in favour of the move.

==History==
{{See also|List of Ayr United F.C. seasons}}

Ayr United were founded in 1910 after the merger of [[Ayr Parkhouse F.C.|Ayr Parkhouse]] and [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]]. Although [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] are also the product of a merger between two clubs, Ayr United are the only Scottish Football League club to have been formed from a merger of two existing league clubs.

The club's honours include winning six Second Division titles (as the second tier championship) and a further two such titles (as the third tier championship), most recently in 1996–97. They have not won any national cup competitions, although they were runners-up in the 2001–02 Scottish League Cup, and in the Scottish Challenge Cup in the first two seasons in which the competition was held: 1990–91 and 1991–92. They have won the local competition the Ayrshire Cup on 26 occasions, most commonly facing fierce local rivals [[Kilmarnock F.C.]] in the final. The Ayrshire Cup was last played for in season 1996–97, since when the competition has been suspended.

The club's record scorer in a single season is [[Jimmy Smith (footballer born 1902)|Jimmy Smith]], who scored 66 goals for Ayr in only 38 league matches in 1927–28 and currently holds the British goalscoring record for the most league goals scored in a single season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ayrunitedfc.co.uk/club-honours/|title=Club Honours – Ayr United Football Club|website=www.ayrunitedfc.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> The club's overall record scorer is [[Peter Price (footballer born 1932)|Peter Price]], who scored 213 times in competitive matches for the club between 1955 and 1962.

Former Scottish national team manager [[Ally MacLeod]] is regarded as the club's most famous and most successful manager. He led the club on three separate occasions spanning 15 years, during which his teams recorded a record 214 wins, and won two league titles. In 1973 Macleod was voted Ayr's Citizen of the Year. More recent managers have also included the recent Scottish national team manager, [[George Burley]], and former [[Scottish League Cup]] winner with [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], [[Gordon Dalziel]]. Their current manager is [[Ian McCall (footballer)|Ian McCall]].

Although the club has spent 34 seasons in Scotland's top division, they have played in the second and third tiers of Scottish senior football since the 1977–78 season. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the club established a record of defeating teams which played in higher leagues in [[Scottish football#Scottish Cup|cup competitions]], including [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], [[Dunfermline F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and four consecutive wins in cup competitions against their fiercest rivals [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]].

In 1988, Ayr United fan and businessman [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|Sir David Murray]] offered to buy the club but the club's shareholders rejected the bid by a vote of 60 to 56. The manager at that time, Ally MacLeod, had threatened to leave if Murray's bid had succeeded:{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Murray went on to become Chairman of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], which coincided with a period of financial growth and league success for that club. During much of the 1990s and 2000s, a period of relative success both in league and cup competitions, the Ayr United chairman was local construction magnate [[Bill Barr]]. After Barr stood down, there were occasional boardroom struggles: the club suffered significant cashflow problems in 2004 although it survived with a combination of efforts. [[Prestwick]]-based Roy Kennedy failed to takeover the club in 2005, and his company Kennedy Construction went bankrupt in 2006.

On 24 May 2009, Ayr won the Scottish First Division Play-off against [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] 3–2 on aggregate to win promotion to the First Division. The following season, to celebrate the club's centenary, Ayr United played in black and white hoops, the club's original black and white kit. The away kit was crimson and gold with blue shorts to reflect the original club colours. But it was not a successful season. Ayr were relegated on the last day of the season after losing 2–1 to Morton.
The club bounced back the following season, winning promotion after defeating Forfar Athletic and Brechin City in the play-offs. That same season, they knocked out [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the [[Scottish Cup]], winning 1–0 at Somerset Park in a replay.

In the 2011–2012 season, Ayr enjoyed success in the [[2011–12 Scottish League Cup]], beating [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] sides [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] on their way to the semi-finals. Ayr United played [[Ayrshire derby]] rivals [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] in the semi-finals, the first time the two clubs had met at this stage. Kilmarnock won one-nil. But the league campaign was less successful, United were relegated to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] following play-off defeat to [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ayrunitedfc.co.uk/news.asp?int_news_id=2962&bln_archive=no&int_month=5&int_year=2012 |title=Ayr United 1–3 Airdrie United |accessdate=15 May 2012 }}</ref>

Following relegation, United announced that [[Brian Reid (footballer)|Brian Reid's]] contract would not be renewed. The club appointed [[Mark Roberts (footballer born 1975)|Mark Roberts]], top scorer in the previous three seasons, manager, with head of youth development, Davie White, as his assistant.<ref name="COM">{{cite web | url=http://www.ayrunitedfc.co.uk/news.asp?int_news_id=2965&bln_archive=no&int_month=5&int_year=2012 | title=Change in Manager | publisher=Ayr United F.C. | date=15 May 2012 | accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref>  
In January 2015, [[Ian McCall (footballer)|Ian McCall]] was appointed Ayr's new manager, taking over from Roberts. After saving the club from relegation on the final day of the 2014/15 season, McCall led Ayr back to the Championship with a penalty shoot-out victory over Stranraer in the Playoffs.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36240303</ref>

==Crest and colours==

===Crests===

Since 1948, Ayr United have used a crest which is a shield containing a [[flag of Scotland|Scottish saltire]], with a scroll beneath stating the club's name.<ref name = "Lyon">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/ayr-united-face-legal-action-over-team-badge-1-3952853#ixzz3s29DWupx |title=Ayr United face legal action over team badge |first=Findlay |last=Mair |work=The Scotsman |publisher= |date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> In 2015, the club became subject to a legal action which claimed that the crest was an unregistered coat of arms.<ref name = "Lyon"/> After it had emerged that the clubs badge was in jeopardy, a petition was started by fans and gained 700 signatures in 24 hours.<ref name = "petition">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ayr-united-badge-700-signatures-6906045 |title=Ayr United badge: Almost 700 signatures raised in 24 hours after The Ayrshire Post launch petition to save historic crest |work=Daily Record |publisher= |date=26 November 2015 |accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref> The campaign gained support and many political, footballing figures and fans alike have lent support to keep the Ayr badge intact.

===Colours===
The club's original jerseys were red and gold, inherited from [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr FC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Ayr/ayr.html |title=Ayr FC kit history |publisher=HistoricalKits.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}</ref> with navy blue shorts and socks. In 1914, Ayr adopted black and white hoops, which were worn, with several modifications, up to 1930, when The ''Honest Men'' switched to a plain white jersey, with navy blue shorts and socks, worn until the outbreak of [[World War II]]. After the war, the club retained the white jersey, and switched back to the black shorts that had originally complimented the hooped shirts, kits similar to these were worn up to 1958, when Ayr had changed the black and white look for a white with a blue trim, used until 1963, when they once again reverted to the black and white hoops, that were kept until 1968 and not used again until the [[2009–10 Ayr United F.C. season|2009–10 centenary season]]. From then until 1994, Ayr maintained white jerseys trimmed with black with either black or white shorts and socks, then switching to a striped shirt for a single season. The following season, Ayr wore an all-black jersey for the first and only time. Ayr went back to keeping an all-white jersey with either white or black shorts and socks until the centenary season. For the [[2011–12 Ayr United F.C. season|2011–12 season]], a half-black-half-white shirt for the first time, however, Ayr FC had previously wore a similar jersey between 1899 and 1903. The [[2013–14 Ayr United F.C. season|2013–14 season]] saw Ayr return to the white jersey, black shorts and socks for the first time since 1973.

==Stadium==
{{Main|Somerset Park}}
Ayr play their football at [[Somerset Park]] in Ayr's New Town. One of the few surviving traditional stadium designs, it consists of one stand, two covered terraces, and one open terrace. It has a capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|ayr}}.<ref name="capacity">{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/ayr-united/ |title=Ayr United Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> The first match to take place at Somerset Park was between the former [[Ayr F.C.]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in a 3–0 victory for Ayr.

During the 1990s the club's chairman was [[Bill Barr]], who owned and managed the company which built modern-style stadiums and stands for several other clubs around the UK. United also sought&nbsp;— and obtained&nbsp;— planning permission from [[South Ayrshire]] Council for a new 10,200 all-seated stadium at Heathfield in Ayr with an associated retail development. The [[Scottish Executive]] then "called in" the application and reversed the decision in respect of the retail development. Since the club considered this aspect of the proposal necessary to fund the construction, the development did not proceed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ayrunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?p=somersetpark |title=Ayr United Football Club&nbsp;— Official Website |publisher=Ayrunitedfc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref>

In November 2006, United signed a contract with [[Barratt Developments|Barratt Homes]] for the sale of [[Somerset Park]], having secured a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in the [[Heathfield, South Ayrshire|Heathfield]] area of Ayr. The site would house a new {{£|18 million}} stadium seating 7,650 as part of a "sports and business campus".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/ayr_united/6190994.stm |title=Ayr poised to sell Somerset Park |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 November 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref> The project did not ultimately proceed.
