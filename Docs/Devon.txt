'''Devon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|v|ən}}; archaically known as '''Devonshire''') is a [[Counties of England|county]] of [[England]], reaching from the [[Bristol Channel]] in the north to the [[English Channel]] in the south. It is part of [[South West England]], bounded by [[Cornwall]] to the west, [[Somerset]] to the northeast, and [[Dorset]] to the east. The City of [[Exeter]] is the [[county town]]; seven other districts of [[East Devon]], [[Mid Devon]], [[North Devon]], [[South Hams]], [[Teignbridge]], [[Torridge]], and [[West Devon]] are under the jurisdiction of [[Devon County Council]]; [[Plymouth]] and [[Torbay]] are each a part of Devon but administered as [[unitary authorities]]. Combined as a [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]], Devon's area is {{convert|6707|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/councildemocracy/improving_our_services/facts_figures_and_statistics/factsandfigures/thecounty/geographicareas/geogareasdevondis.htm |title=Devon County Council Geographic areas |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher= Devon County Council |accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref> and its population is about 1.1 million.

Devon derives its name from [[Dumnonia]], which, during the [[British Iron Age]],  [[Roman Britain]], and [[Sub-Roman Britain|Early Medieval]] was the homeland of the [[Dumnonii]] [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] Celts. The [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of [[Wessex]] during the eighth and ninth centuries. The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the [[River Tamar]] by [[Æthelstan|King Æthelstan]] in 936.  Devon was constituted as a [[shire]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] thereafter.

The north and south coasts of Devon each have both cliffs and sandy shores, and the county's [[bay]]s contain [[seaside resort]]s, fishing towns, and ports. The inland terrain is [[rural]], generally hilly, and has a low population density in comparison to many other parts of England. [[Dartmoor]] is the largest open space in southern England at {{convert|954|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}},<ref>http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/dartmoor.aspx|Natural England: Dartmoor. Retrieved 13 May 2009</ref> its [[moorland]] extending across a large expanse of [[granite]] bedrock. To the north of Dartmoor are the [[Culm Measures]] and [[Exmoor]]. In the valleys and lowlands of south and east Devon the soil is more fertile, drained by rivers including the [[River Exe|Exe]], the [[River Culm|Culm]], the [[River Teign|Teign]], the [[River Dart|Dart]], and the [[River Otter|Otter]].

As well as [[agriculture]], much of the [[economy of Devon]] is linked with [[tourism]]. The comparatively mild climate, coastline and landscape give rise to Devon as a destination for [[tourism in England|recreation and leisure in England]], with visitors particularly attracted to the Dartmoor and Exmoor [[National Parks in England and Wales|national parks]]; its coasts, including the resort towns along the south coast known collectively as the [[English Riviera]], the [[Jurassic Coast]], and [[North Devon's Biosphere Reserve|North Devon's UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]]; and the countryside including the [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Devon}}

===Toponymy===
The name ''Devon'' derives from the name of the [[Britons]] who inhabited the southwestern peninsula of Britain at the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] known as the [[Dumnonii]], thought to mean "deep valley dwellers" from proto Celtic ''*dubnos'' 'deep'. In the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]], Devon is known as {{lang-cy|Dyfnaint}}, {{lang-br|Devnent}} and {{lang-kw|Dewnens}}, each meaning "deep valleys." (For an account of Celtic ''[[Dumnonia]]'', see the separate article.)

[[William Camden]], in his 1607 edition of ''Britannia'', described Devon as being one part of an older, wider country that once included Cornwall:
{{quote|THAT region which, according to the Geographers, is the first of all Britaine, and, growing straiter still and narrower, shooteth out farthest into the West, [...] was in antient time inhabited by those Britans whom Solinus called Dumnonii, Ptolomee Damnonii [...] For their habitation all over this Countrey is somewhat low and in valleys, which manner of dwelling is called in the British tongue Dan-munith, in which sense also the Province next adjoyning in like respect is at this day named by the Britans Duffneit, that is to say, Low valleys. [...] But the Country of this nation is at this day divided into two parts, knowen by later names of Cornwall and Denshire, [...]|William Camden, ''Britannia''.<ref>{{cite web

The term "Devon" is normally used for everyday purposes e.g. "Devon County Council" but "Devonshire" continues to be used in the names of the "Devonshire and Dorset Regiment" and "The Devonshire Association". One erroneous theory is that the "shire" suffix is due to a mistake in the making of the original letters patent for the [[Duke of Devonshire#Earls of Devon|Duke of Devonshire]], resident in [[Derbyshire]]. However, there are references to "Defenascire" in [[Anglo-Saxon]] texts from before 1000 AD (this would mean "Shire of the Devonians"),<ref>{{cite web|title=Manuscript A: The Parker Chronicle|url=http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/a/a-L.html|accessdate=29 June 2007}}</ref> which translates to modern English as "Devonshire". The term Devonshire may have originated around the 8th century, when it changed from ''Dumnonia'' ([[Latin]]) to ''Defenascir''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=The Isles: A History|page=207|year=2000|isbn=0-333-69283-7}}</ref>

===Human occupation===
[[File:Drizzlecombe stones 6.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Menhir]] at [[Drizzlecombe]]]]
[[Kents Cavern]] in Torquay had produced human remains from 30–40,000 years ago. [[Dartmoor]] is thought to have been occupied by [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples from about 6000 BC. The Romans held the area under military occupation for around 350 years. Later, the area began to experience Saxon incursions from the east around 600 AD, firstly as small bands of settlers along the coasts of [[Lyme Bay]] and southern estuaries and later as more organised bands pushing in from the east. Devon became a frontier between [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]]  and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Wessex]], and it was largely absorbed into Wessex by the mid 9th century. A genetic study carried out by the [[University of Oxford]] & [[University College London]] discovered separate genetic groups in Cornwall and Devon, not only were there differences on either side of the Tamar, with a division almost exactly along the modern county boundary dating back to the 6th Century<ref>http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-03-19-who-do-you-think-you-really-are-genetic-map-british-isles</ref> but also between Devon and the rest of Southern England, and similarities with the modern northern [[France]], including [[Brittany]]. This suggests the Anglo-Saxon migration into Devon was limited rather than a mass movement of people.<ref>{{cite web

The border with Cornwall was set by King [[Æthelstan]] on the east bank of the [[River Tamar]] in 936 AD. Danish raids also occurred sporadically along many coastal parts of Devon between around 800AD and just before the time of the Norman conquest, including the silver mint at ''Hlidaforda'' [[Lydford]] in 997 and Taintona (a settlement on the [[River Teign|Teign]] estuary) in 1001.<ref>More ancient Lydford silver pennies - paid as [[Danegeld]] - can now be found in modern Sweden than in their country of origin.http://www.lydford.co.uk/stockholm-museum.htm</ref>

Devon has also featured in most of the civil conflicts in England since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], including the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Perkin Warbeck]]'s rising in 1497, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] of 1549, and the [[English Civil War]]. The arrival of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] to launch the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 took place at [[Brixham]].

Devon has produced [[tin]], copper and other metals from ancient times. Devon's tin miners enjoyed a substantial degree of independence through Devon's [[Stannary Courts and Parliaments|Stannary Parliament]], which dates back to the 12th century. The last recorded sitting was in 1748.<ref>{{cite web

==Economy and industry==
{{Main|Economy of Devon}}
Like neighbouring [[Cornwall]] to the west, historically Devon has been disadvantaged economically compared to other parts of [[Southern England]], owing to the decline of a number of core industries, notably fishing, mining and farming. Agriculture has been an important industry in Devon since the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.swcore.co.uk/southwest.htm], South West Chamber of Rural Enterprise</ref> The [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|2001 UK foot and mouth crisis]] harmed the farming community severely.<ref>''In Devon, the county council estimated that 1,200 jobs would be lost in agriculture and ancillary rural industries'' – [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmhansrd/vo010425/debtext/10425-17.htm#column_357 ''Hansard'', 25 April 2001]</ref> Since then some parts of the agricultural industry have begun to diversify and recover, with a strong local food sector and many artisan producers. Nonetheless the dairy industry is still{{when|date=September 2015}} suffering from the low prices offered for wholesale milk by major dairies and especially large supermarket chains.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

[[File:torquay.devon.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the seafront of [[Torquay]], south Devon, at high tide]]
The attractive lifestyle of the area is drawing in new industries which are not heavily dependent upon geographical location;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investdevon.co.uk/|title=Devon Delivers|work=Invest Devon}}</ref><ref>http://www.northdevon.gov.uk/ndc_northern_devon_economic_strategy.pdf</ref> [[Dartmoor]], for instance, has recently seen a significant rise in the percentage of its inhabitants involved in the financial services sector. The [[Met Office]], the UK's national and international weather service, moved to Exeter in 2003.

Since the rise of seaside resorts with the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Devon's economy has been heavily reliant on tourism. The county's economy followed the declining trend of British seaside resorts since the mid-20th century, but with some recent revival and regeneration of its resorts, particularly focused around camping; sports such as surfing, cycling, sailing and heritage. This revival has been aided by the designation of much of Devon's countryside and coastline as the Dartmoor and [[Exmoor]] national parks, and the [[Jurassic Coast]] and [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]] World Heritage Sites. In 2004 the county's tourist revenue was £1.2&nbsp;billion.<!-- Should try to put this in context of total Devon economy &ndash; the GVA is around 9&nbsp;billion, but I don't know enough about economic statistics to know if it's valid to compare the two? --><ref>Devon County Council, 2005. [http://www.devon.gov.uk/tourism_trends_2005.pdf Tourism trends in Devon].</ref> Unique experiences in Europe are particularly concentrated on food and drink, the South West Coast Path and watersports, including sea-view restaurants in North-West Devon (such as one example belonging to [[Damien Hurst]]); surfing there, indoor and outdoor folk music festivals across the county and sailing in the {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} hill-surrounded inlet ([[ria]]) at Salcombe.

Incomes vary significantly and the average is bolstered by a high proportion of affluent retired people from across Europe's major cities, particularly from the rest of England. Incomes in much of the South Hams and in villages surrounding Exeter and Plymouth are above the national average.  The claimant count of the unemployed and people receiving very low incomes is close to the national average of 4.5% in Torbay, Plymouth and Exeter. Their exurbs and rural villages contribute to low unemployment in the administrative county as shown below.

The table also shows the population change in the ten years to the 2011 census by subdivision.  It also shows the proportion of residents in each district reliant upon lowest income and/or joblessness benefits, the national average proportion of which was 4.5% as at August 2012, the year for which latest datasets have been published.  It can be seen that the most populous district of Devon is [[East Devon]] but only if excluding [[Torbay]] which has marginally more residents and [[Plymouth]] which has approximately double the number of residents of either of these.  [[West Devon]] has the fewest residents, having 63,839 at the time of the census.

==Transport==

===Rail===
The key train operator for Devon is [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]], which operates numerous regional, local and suburban services, as well as intercity services to and from London Paddington. Other intercity services are operated by [[CrossCountry]], to Manchester Piccadilly, Edinburgh Waverley, Glasgow Central, Dundee, Aberdeen and Penzance, and [[South West Trains]], operating express services between [[London Waterloo]] and [[Exeter St Davids]] on the [[West of England Main Line]]. All Devon services are diesel-hauled, since there are no electrified lines in the county.

The [[Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR]] needs to be reopened to connect [[Cornwall]] and [[Plymouth]] to the rest of the UK railway system on an all weather basis.  There are proposals to reopen the line from Tavistock to Bere Alston for a through service to Plymouth.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Harris| first = Nigel| title = Taking trains back to Tavistock| journal = Rail| issue = 590| pages = 40–45| publisher = Bauer| year = 2008}}</ref> On the night of 4 February 2014, amid high winds and extremely rough seas, part of the [[South Devon Railway sea wall|sea wall]] at Dawlish was breached washing away around {{convert|40|m}} of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind.

====Devon Metro====
Devon County Council has proposed a "Devon Metro" scheme to improve rail services in the county and offer a realistic alternative to car travel. This includes the delivery of [[Cranbrook (Devon) railway station|Cranbrook station]], plus four new stations (including [[Edginswell railway station|Edginswell]]) as a priority.<ref>http://www.devon.gov.uk/devon_metro_briefing.pdf</ref>

===Air===
[[Exeter International Airport]] is a base for [[Flybe]]. Destinations include London (City), Manchester, Dublin, Paris and Amsterdam.

[[File:Devon Cliffs.jpg|thumb|right|Cliffs in Devon]]
[[File:Ilfracombe.jpg|thumb|[[Ilfracombe]], on the coast of [[North Devon]].]]
Devon straddles [[South West Peninsula|a peninsula]] and so has two separate coastlines, on the [[Bristol Channel]] and [[Celtic Sea]] in the north, and on the [[English Channel]] in the south.<ref>Dewey, Henry (1948) ''British Regional Geology: South West England'', 2nd ed. London: H.M.S.O.</ref> The [[South West Coast Path]] runs along the entire length of both, around 65% of which is named as [[Heritage Coast]]. Before the changes to English counties in 1974, Devon was the [[Historic counties of England#List of counties|third largest county]] by area and the largest of the counties not divided into county-like divisions (only Yorkshire and Lincolnshire were larger and both were sub-divided into ridings or parts, respectively).<ref>''Whitaker's Almanack'', 1972; p. 631</ref> Since 1974 the county is ranked fourth by area (due to the creation of Cumbria) [[List of ceremonial counties of England|amongst ceremonial counties]] and is the [[List of two-tier counties of England|third largest non-metropolitan county]]. The island of [[Lundy]] and the reef of [[Eddystone Rocks|Eddystone]] are also in Devon. The county has more mileage of road than any other county in England.

Inland, the [[Dartmoor]] [[National park|National Park]] lies wholly in Devon, and the [[Exmoor]] National Park lies in both Devon and [[Somerset]]. Apart from these areas of high moorland the county has attractive rolling rural scenery and villages with [[thatch]]ed [[Cob (building)|cob]] cottages. All these features make Devon a popular [[tourism|holiday]] destination.

In [[South Devon]] the landscape consists of rolling hills dotted with small towns, such as [[Dartmouth, England|Dartmouth]], [[Ivybridge]], [[Kingsbridge]], [[Salcombe]], and [[Totnes]]. The towns of [[Torquay]] and [[Paignton]] are the principal [[seaside resort]]s on the south coast. East Devon has the first seaside resort to be developed in the county, [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] and the more upmarket Georgian town of [[Sidmouth]], headquarters of the East Devon District Council. Exmouth marks the western end of the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Another notable feature is the [[Exeter to Plymouth Line|coastal railway line]] between Newton Abbot and the Exe Estuary: the red sandstone cliffs and sea views are very dramatic and in the resorts railway line and beaches are very near.

[[North Devon]] is very rural with few major towns except [[Barnstaple]], [[Great Torrington]], [[Bideford]] and [[Ilfracombe]]. Devon's Exmoor coast has the highest cliffs in southern Britain, culminating in the [[Hangman cliffs|Great Hangman]], a {{convert|318|m|ft|abbr=on}} "hog's-back" hill with an {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} cliff-face, located near Combe Martin Bay.<ref>http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/index/learning_about/moor_facts.htm|Exmoor National Park, National Park Facts |accessdate=10 May 2009</ref> Its sister cliff is the {{convert|218|m|ft|abbr=on}} Little Hangman, which marks the western edge of coastal Exmoor. One of the features of the North Devon coast is that [[Bideford Bay]] and the [[Hartland Point]] peninsula are both west-facing, Atlantic facing coastlines; so that a combination of an off-shore (east) wind and an Atlantic swell produce excellent surfing conditions. The beaches of Bideford Bay ([[Woolacombe]], [[Saunton]], [[Westward Ho!]] and [[Croyde]]), along with parts of North Cornwall and South Wales, are the main centres of surfing in Britain.

===Geology===
[[File:Geologic map Wales & SW England EN.svg|thumb|Geological map of Wales & Southwest England]]
A geological dividing line cuts across Devon roughly along the line of the [[Bristol to Exeter Line]] and the M5 motorway east of Tiverton and Exeter. It is a part of the [[Tees-Exe line]] broadly dividing Britain into a southeastern lowland zone typified by gently dipping [[sedimentary rock]]s and a northwestern upland zone typified by [[igneous rock]]s and folded sedimentary and [[metamorphic rock]]s.

The principal geological components of Devon are the [[Devonian]] (in north Devon, south west Devon and extending into Cornwall); the [[Culm Measures]] (north western Devon also extending into north Cornwall); and the [[granite]] [[intrusion]] of [[Dartmoor]] in central Devon, part of the [[Cornubian batholith]] forming the 'spine' of the southwestern peninsula. There are small remains of pre-Devonian rocks on the south Devon coast.<ref>Edmonds, E. A., et al. (1975) ''South-West England''; based on previous editions by H. Dewey ([[British Geological Survey]] UK Regional Geology Guide series no. 17, 4th ed.) London: HMSO ISBN 0-11-880713-7</ref>

The oldest rocks which can be dated are those of the Devonian period which are approximately 395–345 million years old. Sandstones and shales were deposited in North and South Devon beneath tropical seas. In shallower waters, limestone beds were laid down in the area now near Torquay and Plymouth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devon's Geology: An Introduction |last=Hesketh |first=Robert|publisher=Bossiney Books|year=2006 |isbn=978-1-899-383-89-4}}</ref>
This geological period was named after Devon by [[Roderick Murchison]] and [[Adam Sedgwick]] in the 1840s and is the only British county whose name is used worldwide as a geological time period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Devon Geology Guide – Devonian Slates, Sandstones and Volcanics|last=Laming |first=Deryck |author2=Roche, David |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/geo-devonianslatessandstonesandvolcanics.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>

Devon's second major rock system<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/environmentplanning/natural_environment/geology/geology-guide.htm|title=Devon's Rocks – A Geological Guide|publisher=Devon County Council|accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref> is the Culm Measures, a geological formation of the [[Carboniferous]] period that occurs principally in Devon and [[Cornwall]]. The measures are so called either from the occasional presence of a soft, sooty coal, which is known in Devon as ''culm'', or from the contortions commonly found in the beds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Edmonds|first=E. A.|author2=McKeown, M. C. |author3=Williams, M. |others=Dewey, H.|title=South-West England|publisher=HMSO/British Geological Survey|location=London|year=1975|edition=4th|series=British Geology|page=34|chapter=Carboniferous Rocks|isbn=0-11-880713-7}}</ref> This formation stretches from [[Bideford]] to [[Bude]] in Cornwall, and contributes to a gentler, greener, more rounded landscape. It is also found on the western, north and eastern borders of Dartmoor.

The sedimentary rocks in more eastern parts of the county include [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] sandstones (giving rise to east Devon's well known fertile red soils); Bunter [[pebble beds]] around Budleigh Salterton and Woodbury Common and [[Jurassic]] rocks in the easternmost parts of Devon. Smaller outcrops of younger rocks also exist, such as Cretaceous [[chalk]] cliffs at Beer Head and gravels on Haldon, plus [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] [[ball clay]] and [[lignite]] deposits in the Bovey Basin, formed around 50 million years ago under tropical forest conditions.

===Climate===

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Devon generally has a mild climate, heavily influenced by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]]. In winter snow is relatively uncommon away from high land, although there are exceptions, such as the snowfalls of [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall|February 2009]], and [[Winter of 2010-2011 in Great Britain and Ireland|December 2010]]. The county has warm summers with occasional hot spells and cool rainy periods. Winters are generally mild and the county often experiences some of the mildest winters in the world for its latitude, with average daily maximum temperatures in January approaching {{convert|10|C}}. Rainfall varies significantly across the county, ranging from over {{convert|2000|mm|in|abbr=on}} on parts of Dartmoor, to around {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the [[rain shadow]] along the coast in southeastern Devon and around Exeter. Sunshine amounts also vary widely: the moors are generally cloudy, but the SE coast from Salcombe to Exmouth is one of the sunniest parts of the UK. In summer, easterly or southeasterly winds mean the area around Saunton and Croyde often records among the highest temperatures in Britain, exceeding {{convert|32|C}} about twice every decade. Similarly, with westerly or southwesterly winds and high pressure the area around Torbay and Teignmouth will often be very warm, with long sunny spells due to shelter by high ground ([[Foehn wind]]).

===Ecology===
[[Image:Pnies5.jpg|thumb|right|Ponies grazing on Exmoor near [[Brendon]], [[North Devon]]]]
The variety of habitats means that there is a wide range of wildlife (see [[Dartmoor wildlife]], for example). A popular challenge among [[bird-watching|birders]] is to find over 100 species in the county in a day. The county's wildlife is protected by several wildlife charities such as the [[Devon Wildlife Trust]], a charity which looks after 40 nature reserves. The Devon Bird Watching and Preservation Society (DBWPS) is a county bird society with a long and distinguished history dating back to 1928. It is dedicated to the study and conservation of wild birds looks after several areas, such as Beesands Ley. There is also the RSPB, which has reserves in the county, as well as English Nature, who look after several reserves such as Dawlish Warren. The botany of the county is very diverse and includes some rare species not found elsewhere in the British Isles other than Cornwall. Botanical reports begin in the 17th century and there is a ''Flora Devoniensis'' by Jones and Kingston in 1829, and a ''Flora of Devon'' in 1939 by [[William Keble Martin|Keble Martin]] and Fraser.<ref>Jones, John Pike & Kingston, J. F. (1829) ''Flora Devoniensis''. 2 pts, in 1 vol. London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green</ref><ref>[[Martin, W. Keble]] & Fraser, G. T. (eds.) (1939) Flora of Devon. Arbroath</ref> There is a general account by W. P. Hiern and others in ''The Victoria History of the County of Devon'', vol. 1 (1906); pp.&nbsp;55–130, with map. Devon is divided into two Watsonian vice-counties: north and south, the boundary being an irregular line approximately across the higher part of Dartmoor and then along the canal eastwards.

Rising temperatures have led to Devon becoming the first place in modern Britain to cultivate [[olives]] commercially.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article1785059.ece|title=Britain warms to the taste for home-grown olives|author=Paul Simons|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=20 September 2007|date=14 May 2007}}</ref>

==Politics and administration==
{{See also|Devon County Council election, 2013|Local Government Act 2010}}
[[File:Clock tower, County Hall, Exeter.jpg|thumb|right|County Hall, Exeter. Headquarters for Devon County Council]]
The administrative centre and capital of Devon is the city of [[Exeter]]. The largest city in Devon, [[Plymouth]], and the conurbation of [[Torbay]] (which includes the largest town in Devon and capital of Torbay [[Torquay]], as well as [[Paignton]] and [[Brixham]]) have been [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]] since 1998, separate from the remainder of Devon which is administered by [[Devon County Council]] for the purposes of local government.

Devon County Council is controlled by the Conservatives, and the political representation of its 62 councillors are: 38 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], 9 [[Liberal Democrats]], seven [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], four [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]], three [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]s and one [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/8084708.stm|title=Tories take over county council|date=5 June 2009|publisher=The [[BBC]]|accessdate=6 June 2009}}</ref>

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], Devon returned 11 Conservatives and one Labour MP from its [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Devon|12 constituencies]] through first-past-the-post. The county is represented in the wider [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)]], which returned two UKIP, two Conservative, one Labour and one Green [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] at the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 election]] using the [[d'Hondt method]] of [[party-list proportional representation]].

;Hundreds
Historically Devon was divided into 32 [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]]:<ref>GENUKI http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Hundreds.html</ref> [[Axminster Hundred|Axminster]], [[Bampton Hundred|Bampton]], [[Black Torrington Hundred|Black Torrington]], [[Braunton Hundred|Braunton]], [[Cliston Hundred|Cliston]], [[Coleridge Hundred|Coleridge]], [[Colyton Hundred|Colyton]], [[Crediton Hundred|Crediton]], [[East Budleigh Hundred|East Budleigh]], [[Ermington Hundred|Ermington]], [[Exminster Hundred|Exminster]], [[Fremington Hundred|Fremington]], [[Halberton Hundred|Halberton]], [[Hartland Hundred|Hartland]], [[Hayridge Hundred|Hayridge]], [[Haytor Hundred|Haytor]], [[Hemyock Hundred|Hemyock]], [[Lifton Hundred|Lifton]], [[North Tawton and Winkleigh Hundred|North Tawton and Winkleigh]], [[Ottery Hundred|Ottery]], [[Plympton Hundred|Plympton]], [[Roborough Hundred|Roborough]], [[Shebbear Hundred|Shebbear]], [[Shirwell Hundred|Shirwell]], [[South Molton Hundred|South Molton]], [[Stanborough Hundred|Stanborough]], [[Tavistock Hundred|Tavistock]], [[Teignbridge Hundred|Teignbridge]], [[Tiverton Hundred|Tiverton]], [[West Budleigh Hundred|West Budleigh]], [[Witheridge Hundred|Witheridge]], and [[Wonford Hundred|Wonford]].

==Cities, towns and villages==
{{Main|List of places in Devon|List of towns and cities in Devon by population}}
[[File:devon.brixham.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|The inner harbour, [[Brixham]], south Devon, at low tide]]
The main settlements in Devon are the cities of [[Plymouth]], a historic port now administratively independent, [[Exeter]], the [[county town]], and [[Torbay]], the county's tourist centre. Devon's coast is lined with tourist resorts, many of which grew rapidly with the arrival of the railways in the 19th century. Examples include [[Dawlish]], [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] and [[Sidmouth]] on the south coast, and [[Ilfracombe]] and [[Lynmouth]] on the north. The Torbay conurbation of [[Torquay]], [[Paignton]] and [[Brixham]] on the south coast is now administratively independent of the county. Rural [[market town]]s in the county include [[Barnstaple]], [[Bideford]], [[Honiton]], [[Newton Abbot]], [[Okehampton]], [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]], [[Totnes]] and [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]].

The boundary with Cornwall has not always been on the River Tamar as at present: until the late 19th century a few parishes in the Torpoint area were in Devon and five parishes now in north-east Cornwall were in Devon until 1974. (However, for ecclesiastical purposes these were nevertheless in the [[List of Archdeacons of Cornwall|Archdeaconry of Cornwall]] and in 1876 became part of the [[Diocese of Truro]].)

==Religion==

===Ancient and medieval history===
[[Celtic paganism|Celtic]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman practice]]s were the first known religions in Devon, although in the first centuries AD, Christianity was introduced to Devon. In the [[Sub-Roman Britain|Sub-Roman period]] the church in the British Isles was characterised by some differences in practice from the Latin Christianity of the continent of Europe and is known as [[Celtic Christianity]];<ref>Bowen, E. G. (1977) ''Saints, Seaways and Settlements in the Celtic Lands''. Cardiff: University of Wales Press ISBN 0-900768-30-4</ref> however it was always in communion with the wider Roman Catholic Church. Many [[list of Cornish saints|Cornish saints]] are commemorated also in Devon in legends, churches and placenames. [[Western Christianity]] came to Devon when it was over a long period incorporated into the kingdom of Wessex and the jurisdiction of the bishop of Wessex. [[Saint Petroc]] is said to have passed through Devon, where ancient dedications to him are even more numerous than in Cornwall: a probable seventeen (plus [[Timberscombe]] just over the border in Somerset), compared to Cornwall's five. The position of churches bearing his name, including one within the old Roman walls of [[Exeter]], are nearly always near the coast, reminding us that in those days travelling was done mainly by sea. The Devonian villages of [[Petrockstowe]] and Newton St Petroc are also named after Saint Petroc and the [[flag of Devon]] is dedicated to him.

The history of Christianity in the South West of England remains to some degree obscure. Parts of the historic county of Devon formed part of the diocese of Wessex, while nothing is known of the church organisation of the Celtic areas. About 703 Devon and Cornwall were included in the separate diocese of Sherborne and in 900 this was again divided into two, the Devon bishop having from 905 his seat at Tawton (now [[Bishop's Tawton]]) and from 912 at [[Crediton]], birthplace of St Boniface. [[Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock|Lyfing]] became [[Bishop of Crediton]] in 1027 and shortly afterwards became [[Bishop of Cornwall]].

The two dioceses of Crediton and Cornwall, covering Devon and Cornwall, were permanently united under [[Edward the Confessor]] by [[Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock|Lyfing]]'s successor [[Leofric, Bishop of Exeter|Bishop Leofric]], hitherto Bishop of Crediton, who became first Bishop of Exeter under [[Edward the Confessor]], which was established as his cathedral city in 1050. At first, the abbey church of St Mary and St Peter, founded by Athelstan in 932 and rebuilt in 1019, served as the cathedral.

===Later history===
In 1549, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] caused the deaths of thousands of people from Devon and Cornwall. During the [[English Reformation]], churches in Devon officially became affiliated with the [[Church of England]]. From the late sixteenth century onwards, zealous Protestantism - or ‘puritanism’ - became increasingly well-entrenched in some parts of Devon, while other districts of the county remained much more conservative. These divisions would become starkly apparent during the English Civil War of 1642-46, when the county split apart along religious and cultural lines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoyle|first1=Mark|title=Loyalty and Locality: Popular Allegiance in Devon during the English Civil War|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85989-428-2|page=passim.}}</ref> The [[Methodism]] of [[John Wesley]] proved to be very popular with the working classes in Devon in the 19th century. Methodist chapels became important social centres, with male voice choirs and other church-affiliated groups playing a central role in the social lives of working class Devonians. Methodism still plays a large part in the religious life of Devon today, although the county has shared in the post-World War II decline in British religious feeling.

The [[Diocese of Exeter]] remains the Anglican diocese including the whole of Devon. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth]] was established in the mid 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth-diocese.org.uk/|title= Diocese of Plymouth|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref>

===Judaism===
Despite its small Jewish population, Devon is also noted for containing two of Britain's oldest synagogues, located in [[Plymouth Synagogue|Plymouth]] and [[Exeter Synagogue|Exeter]], built in 1762 and 1763 respectively.

==Symbols==

===Coat of arms===
[[File:Devon arms.png|thumb|right|The [[coat of arms]] of Devon County Council]]
There was no established [[coat of arms]] for the county until 1926: the arms of the City of [[Exeter]] were often used to represent Devon, for instance in the badge of the [[Semper fidelis#The Devonshire Regiment|Devonshire Regiment]]. During the forming of a county council by the [[Local Government Act 1888]] adoption of a common seal was required. The seal contained three shields depicting the arms of Exeter along with those of the first chairman and vice-chairman of the council ([[Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 20th Baron Clinton|Lord Clinton]] and the [[Earl of Morley]]).<ref>Fox-Davies, A. C. (1915) ''The Book of Public Arms'', 2nd edition, London</ref>

On 11 October 1926, the county council received a grant of arms from the [[College of Arms]]. The main part of the shield displays a red crowned lion on a silver field, the arms of [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall|Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall]]. The ''chief'' or upper portion of the shield depicts an ancient ship on wavers, for Devon's seafaring traditions. The [[Latin]] motto adopted was ''Auxilio Divino'' (by Divine aid), that of Sir [[Francis Drake]]. The 1926 grant was of arms alone. On 6 March 1962 a further grant of crest and supporters was obtained. The crest is the head of a [[Dartmoor Pony]] rising from a "Naval Crown". This distinctive form of crown is formed from the sails and sterns of ships, and is associated with the [[Royal Navy]]. The supporters are a [[North Devon cattle|Devon bull]] and a sea lion.<ref>W. C. Scott-Giles, ''Civic Heraldry of England and Wales'', 2nd edition, London, 1953</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/democracycommunities/county_councillors/historic/brief_history.htm |title=A brief history of Devon's coat of arms (Devon County Council) |publisher=Devon.gov.uk |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>

[[Devon County Council]] adopted a "ship silhouette" logo after the 1974 reorganisation, adapted from the ship emblem on the coat of arms, but following the loss in 1998 of Plymouth and Torbay re-adopted the coat of arms. In April 2006 the council unveiled a new logo which was to be used in most everyday applications, though the coat of arms will continue to be used for "various civic purposes".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/4851278.stm |title=Council's designs cause logo row |publisher=BBC News  |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/democracycommunities/decision_making/cma/cma_document.htm?cmadoc=minutes_spr_20060403.html |title=Policy and Resources Overview Scrutiny Committee Minutes, 3 April 2006 |publisher=Devon.gov.uk |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>

===Flag===
{{Main|Flag of Devon}}
Devon also has its own flag which has been dedicated to [[Saint Petroc]], a local [[saint]] with dedications throughout Devon and neighbouring counties. The flag was adopted in 2003 after a competition run by [[BBC Radio Devon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/community_life/features/devon_flag.shtml |title=Flag celebrates Devon's heritage |publisher=BBC |date=18 July 2003 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref> The winning design was created by website contributor Ryan Sealey, and won 49% of the votes cast. The colours of the flag are those popularly identified with Devon, for example, the colours of [[Exeter University]], the [[rugby union]] team, and the Green and White flag flown by the first [[Viscount Exmouth]] at the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|Bombardment of Algiers]] (now on view at the Teign Valley Museum), as well as one of the county's [[Association football|football]] teams, [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. On 17 October 2006, the flag was hoisted for the first time outside County Hall in Exeter to mark Local Democracy Week, receiving official recognition from the county council.<ref>[http://www.devon.gov.uk/press_devonflagpr Devon County Council Press Release, 16 October 2006] {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/press_devonflagpr |date=20081014214602 }}</ref>

==Place names and customs==
[[File:westwardho.beach.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The beach at [[Westward Ho!]], North Devon, looking north towards the shared [[estuary]] of the rivers [[River Taw|Taw]] and [[River Torridge|Torridge]].]]

Devon's toponyms include many with the endings "coombe/combe" and "tor".  Both 'coombe' (valley or hollow, cf. Welsh ''cwm'', Cornish ''komm'') and 'tor' (Old Welsh ''twrr'' and Scots Gaelic ''tòrr'' from Latin ''turris''; 'tower' used for granite formations) are rare  [[List of English words of Welsh origin|Celtic loanwords in English]] and their frequency is greatest in Devon which shares a boundary with [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] speaking Cornwall.  Ruined medieval settlements of [[Dartmoor longhouse]]s indicate that dispersed rural settlement (OE ''tun'', now often -ton) was very similar to that found in Cornish 'tre-' settlements, however these are generally described with the local placename -(a)cott, from the Old English for homestead, cf. [[cottage]]. Saxon endings in -worthy (from Anglo-Saxon ''worthig'') indicate larger settlements.  Several 'Bere's indicate Anglo-Saxon wood groves, as 'leighs' indicate clearings.<ref>[http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/DevonMisc/Nomenclature.html Madalene Frost, "Origins of Devon Place-Names", ''http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/'']. Retrieved 17 June 2014</ref>

Devon has a variety of festivals and traditional practices, including the traditional orchard-visiting [[Wassail]] in [[Whimple]] every 17 January, and the carrying of flaming tar barrels in [[Ottery St. Mary]], where people who have lived in Ottery for long enough are called upon to celebrate [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] by running through the village (and the gathered crowds) with flaming barrels on their backs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/discovering/legends/ottery_tar_barrels.shtml|title=Ottery Tar Barrels|publisher=BBC |accessdate=14 May 2008}}</ref> [[Berry Pomeroy]] still celebrates "Queen's Day" for [[Elizabeth I]].

==Education==
{{Main|List of schools in Devon}}
Devon has a mostly [[comprehensive education]] system. There are 37 state and 23 independent secondary schools. There are three tertiary ([[Further education|FE]]) colleges and an [[agricultural college]] ([[Bicton College]], near [[Budleigh Salterton]]). Torbay has 8 state (with 3 [[grammar school]]s) and 3 independent secondary schools, and Plymouth has 17 state (with 3 grammar schools – two female and one male) and one independent school, [[Plymouth College]]. East Devon and Teignbridge have the largest school populations, with West Devon the smallest (with only two schools). Only one school in Exeter, Mid Devon, Torridge and North Devon have a [[sixth form]] – the schools in other districts mostly have sixth forms, with all schools in West Devon and East Devon having a sixth form.

The county also plays host to two major British universities, the [[University of Exeter]] (split between the [[Streatham Campus]] and [[St Luke's Campus]] both in Exeter and a campus in [[Cornwall]]); in Plymouth the [[University of Plymouth]] in Britain is present, along with the [[University of St Mark & St John]] to the city's north. Both the universities of Exeter and Plymouth have co-formed the [[Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry]] which has bases in Exeter and Plymouth. There is also [[Schumacher College]].

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Cuisine of Devon}}
The county has given its name to a number of culinary specialities. The Devonshire [[cream tea]], involving [[Scone (bread)|scones]], [[jam]] and [[clotted cream]], is thought to have originated in Devon (though claims have also been made for neighbouring counties); in other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, it is known as a "Devonshire tea".<ref>Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith. Totnes: Prospect Books</ref><ref>Pettigrew, Jane (2004) Afternoon Tea. Andover: Jarrold</ref><ref>Fitzgibbon, Theodora (1972) A Taste of England: the West Country. London: J. M. Dent</ref> In Australia, [[Devon (sausage)|Devon]] is a name for luncheon meat (processed ham).

In October 2008, Devon was awarded Fairtrade County status by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]].

==Sport==
Devon has been home to a number of customs, such as its own form of [[Devon wrestling]], similar in some ways to [[Cornish wrestling]]. As recently as the 19th century, a crowd of 17,000 at Devonport, near [[Plymouth]], attended a match between the champions of Devon and Cornwall. Another Devon sport was [[Cornish hurling|outhurling]] which was played in some regions until the 20th century (e.g. 1922, at Great Torrington). Other ancient customs which survive include [[Dartmoor]] step dancing, and "[[Crying The Neck]]".

Devon has three professional football teams, based in each of its three most populous towns and cities. In the [[2014–15 in English football|2014/2015 football season]] [[Exeter City F.C.]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]] compete in [[Football League Two]], while [[Torquay United F.C]] compete in the [[Conference Premier]]. Plymouth's highest Football League finish was fourth in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] which was achieved twice in 1932 and 1953 respectively, while Torquay and Exeter have never progressed beyond the third tier of the league although Torquay did miss out on winning the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division (S)]] by finishing 2nd on goal difference to Sir Alf Ramsey's Ipswich Town in 1957, Exeter's highest position has been 8th in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division (S)]].  The county's biggest non-league club's is [[Bideford F.C.]] which competes in the [[Southern Football League Premier Division]] and [[Tiverton Town F.C.]] which is in the [[Southern Football League Division One South and West]].

[[Rugby Union]] is popular in Devon with two teams – [[Exeter Chiefs]] play in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|Aviva Premiership]] and [[Plymouth Albion R.F.C.|Plymouth Albion]] who are, as of 2011, in the [[RFU Championship]]. In basketball, [[Plymouth Raiders]] play in the [[British Basketball League]]. [[Tamar Valley Cannons]], also based in Plymouth, are Devon's only other representatives in the National Leagues. [[Motorcycle speedway]] is also supported in the county, with both the [[Exeter Falcons]] and [[Plymouth Devils]] succeeding in the National Leagues in recent years.

There are five [[rugby league]] teams in Devon. [[Plymouth R.L.F.C|Plymouth Titans]], [[Exeter Centurions]], [[Torquay|Devon Sharks]] from Torquay, North Devon Raiders from Barnstaple and [[East Devon Eagles]] from Exmouth. They all play in the [[Rugby League Conference]].

Devon also boasts a [[field hockey]] club who play in the [[English Hockey League|National Premier League]], the [[University of Exeter Hockey Club]]

Horse Racing, particularly [[point to point (steeplechase)|point to point]] racing and [[National Hunt]] Racing is also popular in the county, with two National Hunt racecourses (Exeter and Newton Abbot), and numerous point to point courses. There are also many successful professional racehorse trainers based in Devon.

The county is represented in [[cricket]] by [[Devon County Cricket Club]], who play at a [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|Minor counties]] level.
