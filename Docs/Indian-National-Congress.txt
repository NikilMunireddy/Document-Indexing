The '''Indian National Congress''' ({{audio|Indian National Congress pronounciation.ogg|pronunciation}}) ('''INC''', often called '''Congress'''), is one of two major [[political parties in India]]; the other being the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/-In-Numbers-The-Rise-of-BJP-and-decline-of-Congress/articleshow/52341190.cms|title=In Numbers: The Rise of BJP and decline of Congress}}</ref>

Congress is one of the largest and oldest political parties in the world. The party was founded in 1885 during the [[British Raj]]; its founders include [[Allan Octavian Hume]] (a prominent member of the [[Theosophical Society]]), [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and [[Dinshaw Edulji Wacha|Dinshaw Wacha]]. In the late nineteenth and early to mid-twentieth centuries, Congress became a pivotal participant in the [[Indian Independence Movement]], with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants in its opposition to British colonial rule in India.<ref name=research>{{cite web|title=Information about the Indian National Congress|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/indian-national-congress|website=www.open.ac.uk|publisher=''Arts & Humanities Research council''|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>

After [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence]] in 1947, Congress became India's dominant political party; {{as of|2015|alt=as of 2015}}, in the 15 general elections since independence, it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times, heading the central government for 49 years. There have been seven Congress [[List of Prime Ministers of India|Prime Ministers]], the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947–64), and the most recent [[Manmohan Singh]] (2004–14). The party's [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] platform is generally considered to be on the [[centre-left]] of [[Politics of India|Indian politics]].<ref name="election.in">{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.in/political-parties-in-india/indian-national-congress.html |title=Indian National Congress – about INC, history, symbol, leaders and more |publisher=Elections.in |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

From 2004 to 2014, the Congress-led [[United Progressive Alliance]], a coalition of several regional parties, formed the Indian government and was headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In November 2014, the party was in power in ten states and had a majority in six&nbsp;&ndash; [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Manipur]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[Mizoram]]. In [[Assam]], [[Kerala]] and [[Uttarakhand]] it shared power with its alliance partners. The Congress has previously directly ruled [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Goa]]. In the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 general election]], the Congress had its poorest post-independence general election performance, winning only 44 seats of the 543-member house.

The Congress' social policy is based upon the [[Gandhian]] principle of [[Sarvodaya]]&nbsp;&ndash; the lifting up of all sections of society&nbsp;&ndash; which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people. The party primarily endorses [[social liberalism]]&nbsp;&ndash;&#32;seeking to balance individual [[liberty]] and [[social justice]], and [[secularism]]&nbsp;&ndash; asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Indian National Congress}}
The history of the Indian National Congress (INC) falls into two distinct eras:
* The pre-independence era, when the party was the umbrella organisation leading the campaign for independence;
* The post-independence era, when the party has had a prominent place in Indian politics.

====Foundation====
The Congress was founded in 1885 by Indian and British members of the [[Theosophical Society]] movement, including Scotsman [[Allan Octavian Hume]].<ref name="escholarship">{{cite web

}}</ref> It has been suggested{{by whom|date=August 2015}} that the idea was conceived in a private meeting of 17 men after a Theosophical Convention held in [[Madras]] in December 1884. Hume took the initiative, and in March 1885 the first notice convening the first Indian National Union to meet in [[Poona]] the following December was issued.<ref name=pattabhi>Sitaramayya, B. Pattabhi. 1935. The History of the Indian National Congress. Working Committee of the Congress. [https://archive.org/details/TheHistoryOfTheIndianNationalCongress Scanned version]</ref>

Its objective was to obtain a greater share in government for educated Indians and to create a platform for civic and political dialogue between educated Indians and the British Raj. The Congress met each December. The first meeting was scheduled to be held in Poona, but due to a [[cholera]] outbreak there it was shifted to [[Bombay]]. Hume organised the first meeting in Bombay with the approval of the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]]. [[Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee]] was the first president of the Congress; the first session was held from 28–31 December 1885, and was attended by 72 delegates. Representing each province of India, the Party's delegates comprised 54 Hindus and 2 Muslims; the rest were of [[Parsi]] and [[Jain]] backgrounds.<ref name="INC">{{cite book|author1=Judith E. Walsh|title=A Brief History of India|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108254|page=154}}</ref>

====Early years====
Within the next few years, the demands of the Congress became more radical in the face of constant opposition from the British government, and the party decided to advocate in favour of the independence movement because it would allow a new political system in which the Congress could be a major party. By 1905, a division between the moderates led by Gokhale&nbsp;&ndash; who downplayed public agitation&nbsp;&ndash; and the new "extremists"&nbsp;&ndash; who advocated agitation and regarded the pursuit of social reform as a distraction from nationalism&nbsp;&ndash; opened. [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]]&nbsp;&ndash; who tried to mobilise Hindu Indians by appealing to an explicitly Hindu political identity displayed in the annual public [[Ganapati]] festivals he inaugurated in western India&nbsp;&ndash; was prominent among the extremists.<ref>Stanley A. Wolpert, ''Tilak and Gokhale: revolution and reform in the making of modern India'' (1962) p 67</ref>

The Congress included a number of prominent political figures; [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], a member of the sister [[Indian National Association]] was elected president of the party in 1886 and was the first Indian Member of Parliament in the [[British House of Commons]] (1892–95). It also included Bal Gangadhar Tilak, [[Bipin Chandra Pal]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] and [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]]&nbsp;&ndash; later leader of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and instrumental in the creation of [[Pakistan]]. The Congress was transformed into a mass movement by [[Surendranath Banerjea]] and [[Henry John Stedman Cotton|Sir Henry Cotton]] during the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal in 1905]] and the resultant [[Swadeshi movement]].<ref name="INC"/>

====Congress as a mass movement====
[[File:Subhas Chandra Bose.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Subhas Chandra Bose|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose]], when he was president of the Congress Party]]

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] returned from South Africa in 1915. With the help of the moderate group led by Ghokhale, Gandhi became president of the Congress, and formed an alliance with the [[Khilafat Movement]]. In protest, a number of leaders&nbsp;– [[Chittaranjan Das]], [[Annie Besant]], and [[Motilal Nehru]]&nbsp;– resigned to set up the [[Swaraj Party]]. The Khilafat movement collapsed and the Congress was split. After the [[First World War]], the party became associated with Mahatma Gandhi, who remained its unofficial spiritual leader and icon.<ref name=M.Ghandi1>{{cite book|author1=Mahatma Gandhi|authorlink1=Gandhi|title=The Gandhi Reader: A Sourcebook of His Life and Writings|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802131614|page=254}}</ref> The rise of Gandhi's popularity and his [[Satyagraha]] art of revolution led to support from [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], [[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Rajendra Prasad|Dr. Rajendra Prasad]], [[Khan Mohammad Abbas Khan]], [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], [[C. Rajagopalachari|Chakravarti Rajgopalachari]], [[Anugrah Narayan Sinha|Dr. Anugraha Narayan Sinha]], [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], [[Jivatram Kripalani]], and [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]]. The prevailing nationalism, Gandhi's popularity, and polices aimed at eradicating [[caste]] differences, [[untouchability]], poverty, and religious and ethnic divisions, the Congress became a forceful and dominant group. Although its members were predominantly Hindu, it had members from other religions, economic classes, and ethnic and linguistic groups.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

At the Congress' 1929 Lahore session under the presidency of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Purna Swaraj]] (complete independence) was declared as the party's goal, declaring 26 January 1930 as "Purna Swaraj Diwas", Independence Day. The same year, Srinivas Iyenger was expelled from the party for demanding full independence, not just [[home rule]] as demanded by Gandhi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainbharathun.org/inc.html |title=Main Bharat Hun |publisher=Main Bharat Hun |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

The British government allowed [[Indian provincial elections, 1937|provincial elections]] in India in the winter of 1936–37 under the [[Government of India Act 1935]]. Elections were held in eleven provinces&nbsp;– Madras, Central Provinces, Bihar, Orissa, United Provinces, Bombay Presidency, Assam, NWFP, Bengal, Punjab and Sindh. After contesting these elections, the Indian National Congress gained power in eight of the provinces&nbsp;– the three exceptions were Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh. The All-India Muslim League failed to form the government in any province.<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian Muslims and Partition of India|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|isbn=9788171563746|page=240|author1=[[S. M. Ikram]]}}</ref> The Congress ministries resigned in October and November 1939 in protest against Viceroy [[Lord Linlithgow]]'s declaration that India was a belligerent in the Second World War without consulting the Indian people.<ref>{{cite book|author1=SN Sen|title=History Modern India|publisher=New Age International|isbn=9788122417746|page=202}}</ref>

In 1939, [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], the elected president in both 1938 and 1939, resigned from the Congress over the selection of the working committee. The party was not the sole representative of the Indian polity&nbsp;– other parties including [[Hindu Mahasabha]] and [[Forward Bloc]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Dates of time spent in Britain:&nbsp; 1919–21 |url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/subhas-chandra-bose |title=Subhas Chandra Bose &#124; |publisher=Open.ac.uk |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The party was an umbrella organisation, sheltering radical socialists, traditionalists, and Hindu and Muslim conservatives. All the socialist groupings, including the Congress Socialist Party, Krishak Praja Party, and Swarajya Party, were expelled by Gandhi, along with [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in 1939.<ref name=M.Ghandi1 />

In 1943 [[Azad Hind]]&nbsp;&ndash; an Indian [[provisional government]]&nbsp;&ndash;  had been established in [[Singapore]] and was supported by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rudolph |first=Lloyd I. |authorlink= |author2=Hoeber Rudolph, Susanne |title=Explaining Indian Democracy: The realm of institutions : state formation and institutional change |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]; Original from: [[University of California Press]] |year=2008 |page=58 |isbn=978-0-19-569365-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ghose |first=Sankar |authorlink= |title=Political ideas and movements in India |publisher=[[Allied Publishers]]; Original from: [[University of Michigan Press]] |year=1975 |page=136 |isbn=}}</ref>

In 1946 Indian soldiers, who had fought alongside the Japanese during World War II, were tried by the British in the [[INA trials]]. In response the Congress helped to form the [[INA Defence Committee]], which assembled a legal team to defend the case of the soldiers of the Azad Hind government. The team included several famous lawyers, including [[Bhulabhai Desai]], [[Asaf Ali]], and Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/about/about-the-legal-profession/lawyers-in-the-indian-freedom-movement/ |title=Lawyers in the Indian Freedom Movement &ndash; The Bar Council of India |publisher=Barcouncilofindia.org |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The same year, Congress members initially supported the sailors who led the [[Royal Indian Navy mutiny]], but they withdrew support at the critical juncture and the mutiny failed.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Post-independence===
After Indian independence in 1947, the Indian National Congress became the dominant political party in the country. In 1952, in the [[Indian general election, 1951|first general election]] held after Independence, the party swept to power in the national parliament and most state legislatures. The party held power nationally until 1977 when it was defeated by the Janata coalition. It returned to power in 1980 and ruled until 1989, when it was once again defeated. It formed the government in 1991 at the head of a coalition, as well as in 2004 and 2009, when it led the [[United Progressive Alliance]]. During this period the Congress remained centre-left in its social policies while steadily shifting from a socialist to a [[neoliberal]] economic outlook. The Party's rivals at state level has been national parties the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPM), and various regional parties such as [[Telugu Desam Party|Telgu Desam]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

After Shastri's death, the Congress elected Indira Gandhi as leader over [[Morarji Desai]]. Once again, politician K. Kamaraj was instrumental in achieving this result. In 1967, following a poor performance in the general election, Indira Gandhi started moving towards the political left. In 1969, she was in dispute with senior party leaders on a number of issues; the party president [[S.

In the mid-1970s, the New Congress Party’s popular support began to wane. From 1975, Gandhi’s government grew increasingly more authoritarian and unrest among the opposition grew. On 12&nbsp;June 1975, the [[Allahabad High Court|High Court of Allahabad]] declared Indira Gandhi's election to the [[Lok Sabha]]&nbsp;&ndash: the lower house of India’s parliament&nbsp;&ndash; void on the grounds of electoral malpractice.<ref name=emergency>{{cite web|title=The Emergency, and Indian democracy|url=https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Independent/Indira.html|website=https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu|publisher=''UCLA Division of Social Science''|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> However, Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]]. She moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. In response to increasing disorder and lawlessness, Gandhi's cabinet and government recommended that President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declare a [[State of Emergency in India|State of Emergency]], which he declared on 25 &nbsp;June 1975 based on the provisions of [[Part Eleven of the Constitution of India|Article 352]] of the Constitution.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====Modern era====
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Sonia Gandhi (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|alt=|UPA chairperson [[Sonia Gandhi]], the leader of INC since 1998.]]
In the 1998 general election, the Congress won 141 seats in the Lok Sabha, its lowest tally until then. To boost its popularity and improve its performance in the forthcoming election, Congress leaders urged Sonia Gandhi&nbsp;– widow of Rajiv Gandhi&nbsp;– to assume the leadership of the party. She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs and had hitherto stayed away from politics. After her election as party leader, a section of the party that objected to the choice because of her Italian ethnicity broke away and formed the [[Nationalist Congress Party]] (NCP), led by [[Sharad Pawar]]. The breakaway faction commanded strong support in the state of Maharashtra and limited support elsewhere. The remainder continued to be known as the Indian National Congress.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Sonia Gandhi's appointment initially failed to have an impact; in the snap polls called by the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) government in 1999, the Congress won 114 seats&nbsp;– its lowest tally ever. The leadership structure was unaltered and the party campaigned strongly in the assembly elections that followed. At these elections the party was successful; at one point, the Congress ruled 15 states.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the 2004 general election, the Congress forged an alliance with several regional parties, including the NCP and the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]]. The party's campaign emphasised social inclusion and the welfare of common people, contrasting with the NDA's "[[India Shining]]" campaign that sought to highlight the successes of the NDA government in making India into a "modern nation".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Congress-led [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) won 222 seats in the new parliament, defeating the NDA by a substantial margin. With the support of the communist front, the Congress won a majority and formed the new government. Despite massive support from within the Party, Gandhi declined the post of prime minister, choosing to appoint Manmohan Singh instead. She remained as party president and headed the [[National Advisory Council]] (NAC).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

During its first term in office, the UPA government passed several bills aimed at social reform. These included an [[Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act|employment guarantee]] bill, the [[Right to Information Act]], and a [[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act|right to education]] act. The NAC, as well as [[Left Front (India)|the Left Front]] that supported the government from the outside, were widely seen as being the driving force behind such legislation. The Left Front withdrew its support of the government over disagreements about the U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement. Despite the effective loss of 62 seats in parliament, the government survived the trust vote that followed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manmohan survives trust vote|url=http://specials.indiatoday.com/trustvote/|work=India Today|accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref> In the Lok Sabha elections that occurred soon after, the Congress won 207 seats, the highest tally of any party since 1991. The UPA as a whole won 262, enabling to form the government for the second time. The social welfare policies of the first UPA government and the perceived divisiveness of the BJP are broadly credited for the victory.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bidwai|first=Praful|title=Reading the Verdict|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&page=archiveSearch&aid=20090619261209100&ais=12&avol=26|work=Frontline|accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref>

By the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party had lost much of its popular support, mainly because of several years of poor economic conditions in the country and growing discontent over a series of corruption allegations involving government officials, including the [[2G spectrum scam]] and the [[Indian coal allocation scam]].<ref name=2G>{{cite news|title=2G spectrum scam|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/what-is-the-2g-scam-all-about/1/188832.html|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=India Today Group|publisher=''India Today''|date=October 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=coal>{{cite news|title=Coal Block Allocations Scam|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-what-is-the-indian-coal-allocation-scam-1828830|accessdate=22 June 2014|publisher=''[[Daily News and Analysis]]''|date=April 30, 2013}}</ref> The Congress won only 44 seats,<ref name=performance>{{cite news|title=List of Congress winners|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lok-sabha-election-results-list-of-congress-winners/472493-37-64.html|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=CNN - Indian Broadcasting Network|publisher=''[[CNN-IBN]]''|date=May 17, 2014}}</ref> which was its worst-ever performance in a national election that brought into question whether it would continue to be identified as an officially recognised party.<ref name=result>{{cite news|title=Congress Vote Share Dips Below 20 Per Cent for First Time|url=http://www.ndtv.com/elections/article/election-2014/election-results-2014-congress-vote-share-dips-below-20-per-cent-for-first-time-526000|accessdate=22 June 2014|publisher=''[[NDTV India]]''|date=May 17, 2014}}</ref>

==Election symbol==
As of 2014, the election symbol of the Congress, as approved by the [[Election Commission of India]], is an image of a right hand with its palm facing front and its fingers pressed together;<ref name=hand>{{cite news|title=A Short History of the Congress Hand|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/03/28/a-short-history-of-the-congress-hand/|accessdate=27 June 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|agency=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|date=Mar 28, 2012}}</ref> this is usually shown in the centre of a tricolor flag.

==Current structure and composition==
The Congress is structured in a hierarchical manner and the organisational structure, created by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi's]] re-arrangement of the party between 1918 and 1920 has been largely retained.<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian National Congress Since Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDFfstlFA-gC&pg=PA214|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=978-81-8382-050-9|page=214}}</ref>  A president and the [[All India Congress Committee]] (AICC) are elected by delegates from state and district parties at an annual national conference, In every Indian state and union territory&nbsp;– or ''pradesh''&nbsp;– there is a [[Pradesh Congress Committee]] (PCC), which is the state-level unit of the party responsible for directing political campaigns at local and state levels, and assisting the campaigns for parliamentary constituencies.<ref name=committee>{{cite web|title=Structure of All India Congress Committe|url=http://adrindia.org/sites/default/files/INC%20A.Y.2011-2012%20(1).pdf|publisher=''Association of Democratic Reform''|accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref> Each PCC has a working committee of twenty members, most of whom are appointed by the party president&nbsp;– the leader of the state party&nbsp;–  who is chosen by the prime minister. Those elected as members of the states' legislative assemblies form the Congress Legislature Parties in the various state assemblies; their chairperson is usually the party's nominee for Chief Ministership. The party is also organised into various committees, and sections; it publishes a daily newspaper, the ''[[The National Herald (India)|National Herald]]''.<ref name="Kumar1990">{{cite book|author=Kedar Nath Kumar|title=Political Parties in India, Their Ideology and Organisation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3pJ8t4rxIsC&pg=PA41|date=1 January 1990|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-205-9|pages=41–43}}</ref>

The AICC is composed of delegates sent from the PCCs.<ref name="Kumar1990"/> The delegates elect Congress committees, including the [[Congress Working Committee]] consisting of senior party leaders and office bearers. The AICC takes all important executive and political decisions.<ref name=committee/> Since Indira Gandhi formed the Congress&nbsp;(I) in 1978, the [[Congress President|President of the Indian National Congress]] has effectively been the party's national leader, head of the organisation, head of the Working Committee and all chief Congress committees, chief spokesman, and the Congress' choice for [[Prime Minister of India]]. Constitutionally, the president is elected by the PCCs and members of the AICC; however, this procedure has often been by-passed by the Working Committee, which has elected its own candidate.<ref name="Kumar1990"/>

The Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) consists of elected MPs in the Lok Sabha and [[Rajya Sabha]].<ref name=committee/> There is also a Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader in each state. The CLP consists of all Congress [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) in each state.

==Ideology and policies==
The Congress is a [[Civic nationalism|liberal nationalist]] party that follows a form of [[nationalism]] that supports the values of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite book|author=N. S. Gehlot|title=The Congress Party in India: Policies, Culture, Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06HLD2_3Qj4C&pg=PA177|year=1991|publisher=Deep & Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-7100-306-8|page=177}}</ref>

Throughout much of the Cold War period, the Congress supported a foreign policy of [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonalignment]] that called for India to form ties with both the Western and eastern Blocs but to avoid formal alliances with either.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} American support for Pakistan led the Party to endorse a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the premiership to Manmohan Singh. This Singh-led "UPA I" government executed several key legislations and projects, including the [[National Rural Health Mission|Rural Health Mission]], [[Unique Identification Authority of India|Unique Identification Authority]], the Rural Employment Guarantee scheme, and the Right to Information Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Economic policy===
The Congress endorses a mixed economy in which the private sector and the state direct the economy, reflecting characteristics of both [[market economy|market economies]] and [[Planned economy|planned economies]]. The modern Congress advocates [[import substitution industrialisation]]; the replacement of foreign imports with domestic products. The party also believes mixed economies are likely to protect the environment, standardise the welfare system, and maintain employment standards and competition.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=June 2014}} The Congress also believes the Indian economy should be liberalised to increase the pace of development. In 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh introduced [[value added tax]], which replaced [[sales tax]], and has continued the [[Golden Quadrilateral]] and the highway modernisation program that was initiated by Vajpayee's government. In 2009, India achieved its highest GDP growth rate of 9% and became the second-fastest growing major economy in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual percentage growth rate of GDP|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG|website=worldbank.org|publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>

===Healthcare and education===
In 2005, the Congress-led government started the National Rural Health Mission, which employed about 500,000 community health workers. It was praised by the American economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].<ref name="timepoverty">{{cite news|title=The End of Poverty|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1034738,00.html|first=Jeffrey D.|last=Sachs|date=6 March 2005|work=Time}}</ref> In 2006, it implemented a proposal to reserve 27% of seats in the All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS), the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other central higher education institutions for [[Other Backward Class]]es, which led to [[2006 Indian anti-reservation protests]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Singh government also continued the [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] programme, which includes the introduction and improvement of mid-day school meals and the opening of new schools throughout India&nbsp;&ndash especially in rural areas&nbsp;&ndash  to fight [[illiteracy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Direct SSA funds for school panels|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/338571/direct-ssa-funds-school-panels.html|accessdate=14 June 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald}}</ref> During Manmohan Singh's prime-ministership, eight [[Indian Institutes of Technology|Institutes of Technology]] were opened in the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], Bihar, [[Gujarat]], Orissa, [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Madhya Pradesh, [[Rajasthan]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite web|title=LS passes bill to provide IIT for eight states.|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/148456/ls-passes-bill-provide-iit.html|publisher=Deccan Herald|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>

===Security and home affairs===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The Congress has strengthened anti-terrorism laws with amendments to the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]] (UAPA). The [[National Investigation Agency (India)]] (NIA) was created soon after the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Nov 2008 Mumbai terror attacks]] in response to the need for a central agency to combat terrorism. The Unique Identification Authority of India was established in February 2009 to implement the proposed [[Multipurpose National Identity Card]] with the objective of increasing national security.

===Foreign policy===
