'''Howard Phillips Lovecraft''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|v|k|r|æ|f|t|,_|-|ˌ|k|r|ɑː|f|t}};<ref>"Lovecraft". ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> August 20, 1890&nbsp;– March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of [[horror fiction]]. Virtually unknown and only published in [[pulp magazine]]s before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where he spent most of his life.  Among his most celebrated tales  is "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]", canonical to the ''[[Cthulhu Mythos]]''. Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Weird Tale|last=Joshi|first=S.

==Early life==

===Family===
Lovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, in his family home at 194 (later 456) Angell Street in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]<ref name=joshi-2001-xiii>{{Harvnb|Joshi, Schultz|2001|p=xiii|ref=hplencyclopedia}}</ref> (the house was demolished in 1961). He was the only child of Winfield Scott Lovecraft (1853–1898), a traveling salesman of jewelry and [[precious metal]]s, and Sarah Susan Phillips Lovecraft (1857–1921), who could trace her ancestry to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1631.<ref>The Dream World of H. P. Lovecraft, Donald Tyson, Chapter 1 'Silver Spoon' page 18</ref> Both of his parents were of entirely English ancestry, all of whom had been in [[New England]] since the colonial period.<ref>http://www.esotericorderofdagon.org/cults_of_cthulhu.pdf</ref><ref>The Dream World of H. P. Lovecraft, Donald Tyson, Chapter 1 'Silver Spoon'</ref>  In 1893, when Lovecraft was three, his father became acutely psychotic and was placed in the Providence psychiatric institution, [[Butler Hospital]], where he remained until his death in 1898.<ref name=joshi-2001-xiii/>  H. P. Lovecraft maintained throughout his life that his father had died in a condition of paralysis brought on by "nervous exhaustion."  Although it has been suggested his father's mental illness may have been caused by [[syphilis]], neither the younger Lovecraft nor his mother (who also died in Butler Hospital) seems to have shown signs of being infected with the disease.<ref>{{Harvnb|Joshi|1996|p=14|ref=magick}}</ref>

[[File:Howard Phillips Lovecraft - circa 1900.jpg|thumb|upright|Lovecraft at {{circa}} nine years old]]

After his father's hospitalization, Lovecraft was raised by his mother, his two maternal aunts (Lillian Delora Phillips and Annie Emeline Phillips), and his maternal grandfather, [[Whipple Van Buren Phillips]], an American businessman. All five resided together in the family home. Lovecraft was a prodigy, reciting poetry at the age of three, and writing complete poems by six. His grandfather encouraged his reading, providing him with classics such as ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|The Arabian Nights]]'', ''[[Thomas Bulfinch|Bulfinch's Age of Fable]]'', and children's versions of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. His grandfather also stirred the boy's interest in the weird by telling him his own original tales of [[Gothic horror]].<ref>The Dream World of H. P. Lovecraft – Page 25</ref>

===Upbringing===
Lovecraft was frequently ill as a child. Because of his sickly condition, he barely attended school until he was eight years old, and then was withdrawn after a year. He read voraciously during this period and became especially enamored of chemistry and astronomy.<ref name="theguardian.com">http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/20/ten-things-you-should-know-about-hp-lovecraft</ref> He produced several [[hectograph]]ed publications with a limited circulation, beginning in 1899 with ''The Scientific Gazette''. Four years later, he returned to public school at [[Hope High School (Rhode Island)|Hope High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.biography.com/people/hp-lovecraft-40102#awesm=~oASkG4XhLNleSC|title=H.P. Lovecraft Biography|publisher = biography.com |accessdate= April 8, 2014}}</ref> Beginning in his early life, Lovecraft is believed to have suffered from [[sleep paralysis]], a form of [[parasomnia]]; he believed himself to be assaulted at night by horrific "[[nightgaunt|night gaunts]]".<ref name="theguardian.com"/> Much of his later work is thought to have been directly inspired by these terrors. (Indeed, "Night Gaunts" became the subject of a poem he wrote of the same name, in which they were personified as devil-like creatures without faces.)

His grandfather's death in 1904 greatly affected Lovecraft's life. Mismanagement of his grandfather's estate left his family in a poor financial situation, and they were forced to move into much smaller accommodations at 598<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories|last = Lovecraft|first = H. P.|publisher = Penguin Classics|year = 1999|isbn = 0141182342|location = |pages = Introduction|editor-last = Joshi|editor-first = S.T.}}</ref> (now a duplex at 598–600) Angell Street. In 1908, prior to his high school graduation, he is said to have suffered what he later described as a "nervous breakdown", and consequently never received his high school diploma (although he maintained for most of his life that he did graduate).{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[S. T. Joshi]] suggests in his biography of Lovecraft that a primary cause for this breakdown was his difficulty in higher mathematics, a subject he needed to master to become a professional astronomer.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Dreamer and a Visionary: H.P.

==Adulthood==

===Reclusion===
[[File:Howard Phillips Lovecraft in 1915 (2).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Lovecraft in 1915]]
The adult Lovecraft was gaunt with dark eyes set in a very pale face (he rarely went out before nightfall).<ref name="ReferenceB">Ronan, Margaret, Forward to ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth and Other Stories of Horror'', Scholastic Book Services, 1971</ref> For five years after leaving school, he lived an isolated existence with his mother,<ref name="hplovecraft.com">http://www.hplovecraft.com/life/biograph.aspx</ref> writing primarily poetry without seeking employment or new social contacts. This changed in 1913 when he wrote a letter to ''[[Argosy (magazine)|The Argosy]]'', a [[pulp magazine]], complaining about the insipidness of the love stories in the publication by writer [[Frederick J. Jackson|Fred Jackson]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Murrary |first=Will |authorlink=Will Murray (writer) |chapter=Lovecraft and the Pulp Magazine Tradition |editor-first1=David E. |editor-last1=Schultz |editor-last2=Joshi |editor-first2=S.

Lovecraft |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3oH_VdH3BcC&pg=PA105 |accessdate=September 17, 2013 |year=1991 |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]] |isbn=0-8386-3415-X |page=105}}</ref> The ensuing debate in the magazine's letters column caught the eye of [[Edward F. Daas]], president of the [[Amateur Press Association|United Amateur Press Association]] (UAPA), who invited Lovecraft to join the organization in 1914.<ref name="hplovecraft.com"/>

In April 1917, Lovecraft tried to join the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], but did not pass the physical examination.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Branney; Leman|title=The Spirit of Revision: Lovecraft's Letters to Zelia Brown Reed Bishop|date=2015|publisher=The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society|isbn=978-0-692-49524-7|page=180|edition=1}}</ref>

===Writing===
The UAPA reinvigorated Lovecraft and incited him to contribute many poems and essays; in 1916, his first published story, ''[[The Alchemist (short story)|The Alchemist]]'', appeared in the ''United Amateur Press Association''. The earliest commercially published work came in 1922, when he was thirty-one. By this time he had begun to build what became a huge network of correspondents. His lengthy and frequent missives would make him one of the great letter writers of the century. Among his correspondents were [[Robert Bloch]] (''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''), [[Clark Ashton Smith]], and [[Robert E. Howard]] (''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' series). Many former aspiring authors later paid tribute to his mentoring and encouragement through the correspondence.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

His oeuvre is sometimes seen as consisting of three periods: an early [[Edgar Allan Poe]] influence; followed by a [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]–inspired Dream Cycle; and finally the ''[[Cthulhu Mythos]]'' stories. However, many distinctive ideas and entities present in the third period were introduced in the earlier works, such as the 1917 story "[[Dagon (short story)|Dagon]]", and the threefold classification is partly overlapping.<ref>Weinstock, J.R., in  Forward to ''The Call of Cthulhu and Other Dark Tales'' (2009) Barnes and Noble, page ''X''</ref>

===Death of mother===
In 1919, after suffering from [[hysteria]] and depression for a long period of time, Lovecraft's mother was committed to Butler Hospital - the mental institution where her husband had died.<ref>{{Harvnb|Joshi, Schultz|2001|p=xv|ref=hplencyclopedia}}</ref> Nevertheless, she wrote frequent letters to Lovecraft, and they remained close until her death on May 24, 1921, the result of complications from gallbladder surgery.<ref name="hplovecraft.com"/>

===Marriage and New York===
A few days after his mother's death, Lovecraft attended a convention of amateur journalists in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, where he met and became friendly with [[Sonia Greene]], a widow and owner of a successful hat shop and seven years his senior. Lovecraft's aunts disapproved of the relationship. Lovecraft and Greene married on March 3, 1924, and relocated to her [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] apartment; she thought he needed to get out of Providence in order to flourish and was willing to support him financially.<ref name=decamp>{{cite book|last1=de Camp|first1=L Sprague|title=Lovecraft: a Biography}}</ref> Greene, who had been married before, later said Lovecraft had performed satisfactorily as a lover, though she had to take the initiative in all aspects of the relationship.<ref name=decamp /> She attributed Lovecraft's passive nature to a stultifying upbringing by his mother.<ref name=decamp /> Lovecraft's weight increased to 90 kg (200 lb) on his wife's home cooking.<ref name=decamp />

He was enthralled by New York, and, in what was informally dubbed the [[Kalem Club]], he acquired a group of encouraging intellectual and literary friends who urged him to submit stories to ''Weird Tales''; editor [[Edwin Baird]] accepted many otherworldly 'Dream Cycle' Lovecraft stories for the ailing publication, though they were heavily criticized by a section of the readership.<ref name="JoshiSchultz2001">{{cite book|editor=S. T. Joshi|editor2=David E. Schultz|title=An H.P.

In 1925 these four regular attendees were joined by Lovecraft along with his protégé [[Frank Belknap Long]], bookseller George Willard Kirk, and Lovecraft's close friend [[Samuel Loveman]]. Loveman was Jewish, but was unaware of Lovecraft's [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] attitudes. Conversely, it has been suggested Lovecraft, who disliked mention of sexual matters, was unaware that Loveman and some of his other friends were homosexual.<ref>The Dream World of H. P. Lovecraft: His Life, His Demons, His Universe (2010) – Donald Tyson ISBN 9780738728292</ref>

===Financial difficulties===
Not long after the marriage, Greene lost her business and her assets disappeared in a bank failure; she also became ill. Lovecraft made efforts to support his wife through regular jobs, but his lack of previous work experience meant he lacked proven marketable skills. After a few unsuccessful spells as a low level clerk, his job-seeking became desultory. The publisher of ''Weird Tales'' attempted to put the loss-making magazine on a business footing and offered the job of editor to Lovecraft, who declined, citing his reluctance to relocate to Chicago; "think of the tragedy of such a move for an aged antiquarian," the 34-year-old writer declared. Baird was replaced with [[Farnsworth Wright]], whose writing Lovecraft had criticized. Lovecraft's submissions were often rejected by Wright. (This may have been partially due to censorship guidelines imposed in the aftermath of a ''Weird Tales'' story that hinted at necrophilia, although after Lovecraft's death Wright accepted many of the stories he had originally rejected.)<ref name="JoshiSchultz2001"/><ref name="Tyson2010"/>

===Red Hook===
Greene, moving where the work was, relocated to Cincinnati, and then to Cleveland; her employment required constant travel. Added to the daunting reality of failure in a city with a large immigrant population, Lovecraft's single room apartment in the run down area of [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] was burgled, leaving him with only the clothes he was wearing. In August 1925 he wrote "[[The Horror at Red Hook]]" and "[[He (short story)|He]]", in the latter of which the narrator says "My coming to New York had been a mistake; for whereas I had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration ... I had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master, paralyze, and annihilate me". It was at around this time he wrote the outline for "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]" with its theme of the insignificance of all humanity. In the bibliographical study ''[[H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life]]'', [[Michel Houellebecq]] suggested that the misfortunes fed Lovecraft's central motivation as a writer, which he said was racial resentment.<ref name="ReferenceA">Michel Houellebecq. ''[[H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life]]''. San Francisco: Believer Books, 2005.</ref> With a weekly allowance Greene sent, Lovecraft moved to a working class area of [[Brooklyn Heights]] where he subsisted in a tiny apartment.

===Return to Providence===
[[File:The Samuel B. Mumford House.jpg|thumb|left|Lovecraft's final home, May 1933 until March 10, 1937]]
[[File:H.P. Lovecraft Grave marker.jpg|thumb|upright|Original Phillips family gravestone bearing H. P. Lovecraft's name]]
Back in Providence, Lovecraft lived in a "spacious brown [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] wooden house" at 10 Barnes Street until 1933. The same address is given as the home of Dr. Willett in Lovecraft's ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]''. The period beginning after his return to Providence—the last decade of his life—was Lovecraft's most prolific; in that time he produced short stories, as well as his longest work of fiction ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'' and ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''. He frequently revised work for other authors and did a large amount of [[ghost-writing]], including "[[The Mound (short story)|The Mound]]", "Winged Death", "The Diary of Alonzo Typer". Client [[Harry Houdini]] was laudatory, and attempted to help Lovecraft by introducing him to the head of a newspaper syndicate. Plans for a further project were ended by Houdini's death.<ref>An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia, edited by S. T. Joshi, David E. Schultz, page 117</ref>

Although he was able to combine his distinctive style (allusive and amorphous description by horrified though passive narrators) with the kind of stock content and action Weird Tales's editor wanted—Wright paid handsomely to snap up "[[The Dunwich Horror]]" which proved very popular with readers—Lovecraft increasingly produced work that brought him no remuneration. Affecting a calm indifference to the reception of his works, Lovecraft was in reality extremely sensitive to criticism and easily precipitated into withdrawal. He was known to give up trying to sell a story after it had been once rejected. Sometimes, as with ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth'' (which included a rousing chase that supplied action) he wrote a story that might have been commercially viable, but did not try to sell it. Lovecraft even ignored interested publishers. He failed to reply when one inquired about any novel Lovecraft might have ready: although he had completed such a work, ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'', it was never typed up.<ref name="Anderson2014">{{cite book|author=James Arthur Anderson|title=Out of the Shadows: A Structuralist Approach to Understanding the Fiction of H.

===Last years===
Throughout his life, selling stories and paid literary work for others did not provide enough to cover Lovecraft's basic expenses. Living frugally, he subsisted on an inheritance that was nearly depleted by the time of his last years. He sometimes went without food to afford the cost of mailing letters.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Eventually, he was forced to move to smaller and meaner lodgings with his surviving aunt. He was also deeply affected by the suicide of his correspondent [[Robert E. Howard#Death|Robert E. Howard]]. In early 1937, Lovecraft was diagnosed with [[Small intestine cancer|cancer of the small intestine]],<ref name="JoshiDreamer">{{cite book |first=S. T. |last=Joshi |authorlink=S. T.

He lived in constant pain until his death on March 15, 1937, in Providence.

[[File:H.P. Lovecraft's grave.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of H. P. Lovecraft]]
[[File:HP Lovecraft Memorial Square intersection of Angell St and Prospect St in Providence.2013-07-27.jpg|thumb|upright|H. P. Lovecraft Memorial Square with commemorative sign installed by the City of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] at the intersection of Angell St and Prospect St, near [[Brown University]].|thumb|right|Lovecraft Square, Providence]]

In accordance with his lifelong scientific curiosity, he kept a diary of his illness until close to the moment of his death.

Lovecraft was listed along with his parents on the Phillips family monument ({{coord|41.8540176|-71.3810921|format=dms|type:landmark}}). That was not enough for his fans, who in 1977 raised the money to buy him a headstone of his own in [[Swan Point Cemetery]], on which they had inscribed Lovecraft's name, the dates of his birth and death, and the phrase "I AM PROVIDENCE", a line from one of his personal letters.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Notable Persons Interred at Swan Point Cemetery {{!}} Civil War Veterans {{!}} Governors {{!}} Swan Point Cemetery|url = http://swanpointcemetery.com/notable-people.php|website = swanpointcemetery.com|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref>

Groups of enthusiasts annually observe the anniversaries of Lovecraft's death at [[Ladd Observatory]] and of his birth at his grave site. In July 2013, the Providence City Council designated the intersection of Angell and Prospect streets near the author's former residences as "H. P. Lovecraft Memorial Square" and installed a commemorative sign.<ref name="motif-we-are-providence">{{cite news |url=http://motifri.com/we-are-providence-the-h-p-lovecraft-community/ |title=We are Providence: The H.P.

==Appreciation==

===Within genre===
According to [[Joyce Carol Oates]], Lovecraft – as with [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in the 19th century – has exerted "an incalculable influence on succeeding generations of writers of horror fiction".<ref name=Oates>{{cite journal |title=The King of Weird |date=October 31, 1996 |journal=The New York Review of Books |author=Joyce Carol Oates |volume=43 |issue=17 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1376 |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref> Horror, fantasy, and science fiction author [[Stephen King]] called Lovecraft "the twentieth century's greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/man-who-can-scare-stephen-king?page=show |title=The Man Who Can Scare Stephen King |last=Wohleber |first=Curt |work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |volume=46 |number=8 |date=December 1995 |accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>''The Best of H.

===Literary===
Early efforts to revise an established literary view of Lovecraft as an author of 'pulp' were resisted by some eminent critics; in 1945 [[Edmund Wilson]] expressed the opinion that "the only real horror in most of these fictions is the horror of bad taste and bad art". But "Mystery and Adventure" columnist [[Will Cuppy]] of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' recommended to readers a volume of Lovecraft's stories, asserting that "the literature of horror and macabre fantasy belongs with mystery in its broader sense." <ref>{{cite book

===Philosophical===
Philosopher [[Graham Harman]], seeing Lovecraft as having a unique—though implicit—anti-reductionalist [[ontology]], says "No other writer is so perplexed by the gap between objects and the power of language to describe them, or between objects and the qualities they possess."<ref>Weird Realism: Lovecraft and Philosophy (2013) Graham Harman</ref>
Harman said of leading figures at the initial [[speculative realism]] conference (which included philosophers [[Quentin Meillassoux]], [[Ray Brassier]], and [[Iain Hamilton Grant]]) that, though they shared no philosophical heroes, all were enthusiastic readers of Lovecraft.<ref>ASK/TELL, October 23, 2011 [http://eeevee2.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/interview-with-graham-harman.html Interview with Graham Harman]</ref> According to scholar S.

==Themes==
{{Synthesis|section|date=February 2009}}

Several themes recur in Lovecraft's stories:

{|class="toccolours" style="float:left;width:35.0em;max-width:35%;margin-left:1.0em;margin-right:2.0em;font-size:85%;background:#e9f7ff;color:black;" cellspacing="5"
|-
|style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;"| Now all my tales are based on the fundamental premise that common human laws and interests and emotions have no validity or significance in the vast cosmos-at-large. To me there is nothing but puerility in a tale in which the human form—and the local human passions and conditions and standards—are depicted as native to other worlds or other universes. To achieve the essence of real externality, whether of time or space or dimension, one must forget that such things as organic life, good and evil, love and hate, and all such local attributes of a negligible and temporary race called mankind, have any existence at all. Only the human scenes and characters must have human qualities. ''These'' must be handled with unsparing ''realism'', (''not'' catch-penny ''romanticism'') but when we cross the line to the boundless and hideous unknown—the shadow-haunted ''Outside''—we must remember to leave our humanity and terrestrialism at the threshold.

===Non-human influences on humanity===
The beings of Lovecraft's [[mythos]] often have human servants; [[Cthulhu]], for instance, is worshiped under various names by [[cult]]s<ref>http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/literature/cthulhu3.htm</ref> amongst both the [[Greenlandic Inuit]] and [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo circles of Louisiana]], and in many other parts of the world.

These worshippers served a useful narrative purpose for Lovecraft. Many beings of the Mythos were too powerful to be defeated by human opponents, and so horrific that direct knowledge of them meant insanity for the victim. When dealing with such beings, Lovecraft needed a way to provide [[Dramatic structure#Exposition|exposition]] and build tension without bringing the story to a premature end. Human followers gave him a way to reveal information about their "gods" in a diluted form, and also made it possible for his protagonists to win paltry victories. Lovecraft, like his contemporaries, envisioned "savages" as closer to supernatural knowledge unknown to civilized man.

===Inherited guilt===
Another recurring theme in Lovecraft's stories is the idea that descendants in a bloodline can never escape the stain of crimes committed by their forebears, at least if the crimes are atrocious enough. Descendants may be very far removed, both in place and in time (and, indeed, in [[culpability]]), from the act itself, and yet, they may be haunted by the revenant past, e.g. "[[The Rats in the Walls]]", "[[The Lurking Fear]]", "[[Arthur Jermyn]]", "[[The Alchemist (short story)|The Alchemist]]", "The Shadow Over Innsmouth", "[[The Doom that Came to Sarnath]]" and ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''.

===Fate===
Often in Lovecraft's works the protagonist is not in control of his own actions, or finds it impossible to change course. Many of his characters would be free from danger if they simply managed to run away; however, this possibility either never arises or is somehow curtailed by some outside force, such as in "[[The Colour Out of Space]]" and "[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]". Often his characters are subject to a compulsive influence from powerful malevolent or indifferent beings. As with the inevitability of one's ancestry, eventually even running away, or death itself, provides no safety ("[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]", "[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]", ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'', etc.). In some cases, this doom is manifest in the entirety of humanity, and no escape is possible ("[[The Shadow Out of Time]]").

===Civilization under threat===
Lovecraft was familiar with the work of the German conservative-revolutionary theorist [[Oswald Spengler]], whose pessimistic thesis of the decadence of the modern West formed a crucial element in Lovecraft's overall [[anti-modern]] worldview. Spenglerian imagery of cyclical decay is present in particular in ''At the Mountains of Madness''. S. T. Joshi, in ''H. P. Lovecraft: The Decline of the West'', places Spengler at the center of his discussion of Lovecraft's political and philosophical ideas.<ref>S. T. Joshi, ''H. P. Lovecraft: Decline of the West'', (Starmont Studies in Literary Criticism, No. 37), Borgo Pr, 1991, ISBN 978-1-55742-208-8.</ref>

Lovecraft wrote to Clark Ashton Smith in 1927: "It is my belief, and was so long before Spengler put his seal of scholarly proof on it, that our mechanical and industrial age is one of frank [[decadence]]".<ref>[[China Miéville]]'s introduction to "At the Mountains of Madness", Modern Library Classics, 2005</ref> Lovecraft was also acquainted with the writings of another German philosopher of decadence: [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Joshi|1996|p=38|ref=magick}}</ref>

Lovecraft frequently dealt with the idea of [[civilization]] struggling against dark, primitive barbarism. In some stories this struggle is at an individual level; many of his [[protagonist]]s are cultured, highly educated men who are gradually corrupted by some obscure and feared influence.

In such stories, the "[[curse]]" is often a hereditary one, either because of interbreeding with non-humans (e.g., "[[Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family]]" (1920), "[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]" (1931)) or through direct magical influence (''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''). Physical and mental degradation often come together; this theme of 'tainted blood' may represent concerns relating to Lovecraft's own family history, particularly the death of his father due to what Lovecraft must have suspected to be a [[syphilis|syphilitic]] disorder.

In other tales, an entire society is threatened by barbarism. Sometimes the barbarism comes as an external threat, with a civilized race destroyed in war (e.g., "[[Polaris (short story)|Polaris]]"). Sometimes, an isolated pocket of humanity falls into decadence and [[atavism]] of its own accord (e.g., "[[The Lurking Fear]]"). But most often, such stories involve a civilized culture being gradually undermined by a malevolent underclass influenced by inhuman forces.

It is likely that the "[[roaring twenties]]" left Lovecraft disillusioned as he was still obscure and struggling with the basic necessities of daily life, combined with seeing non-Western European immigrants in New York City.

===Race, ethnicity, and class===
Race is the most controversial aspect of Lovecraft's works, and it comes across through many disparaging remarks against the various non-Anglo-Saxon [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] and cultures within his work. As he grew older, his original Anglo-Saxon racial worldview softened into a universal classism or elitism regarding any fellow human being of self-ennobled high culture as of metaphorical superior race. Lovecraft did not from the start hold all [[white people]] in uniform high regard, but rather he held English people and people of English descent, above all others.<ref name="joshimagic">{{Cite book|title=A Subtler Magick: The Writings and Philosophy of H.

===Risks of a scientific era===
At the turn of the 20th century, humanity's increased reliance upon science was both opening new worlds and solidifying the manners by which he could understand them. Lovecraft portrays this potential for a growing gap of man's understanding of the universe as a potential for horror. Most notably in "The Colour Out of Space", the inability of science to comprehend a contaminated meteorite leads to horror.

In a letter to [[James F. Morton]] in 1923, Lovecraft specifically points to [[Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|theory on relativity]] as throwing the world into chaos and making the cosmos a jest; in a letter to Woodburn Harris in 1929, he speculates that technological comforts risk the collapse of science. Indeed, at a time when men viewed science as limitless and powerful, Lovecraft imagined alternative potential and fearful outcomes. In "The Call of Cthulhu", Lovecraft's characters encounter architecture which is "abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours".<ref>Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu", p. 151.</ref> [[Non-Euclidean geometry]] is the mathematical language and background of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]], and Lovecraft references it repeatedly in exploring alien [[archaeology]].

===Religion===
Lovecraft's works are ruled by several distinct pantheons of deities (actually aliens worshiped as such by humans) who are either indifferent or actively hostile to humanity. Lovecraft's actual philosophy has been termed "cosmic indifference" and this is expressed in his fiction.<ref>Mosig, Yozan Dirk W. "Lovecraft: The Dissonance Factor in imaginary Literature" (1979).</ref> Several of Lovecraft's stories of the Old Ones (alien beings of the Cthulhu Mythos) propose alternate mythic human origins in contrast to those found in the [[creation myth|creation]] stories of existing religions, expanding on a natural world view. For instance, in Lovecraft's "[[At the Mountains of Madness]]" it is proposed that humankind was actually created as a slave race by the Old Ones, and that life on Earth as we know it evolved from scientific experiments abandoned by the Elder Things. Protagonist characters in Lovecraft are usually educated men, citing scientific and rationalist evidence to support their non-faith. "[[Herbert West–Reanimator]]" reflects on the [[atheism]] common within academic circles. In "[[The Silver Key]]", the character [[Randolph Carter]] loses the ability to dream and seeks solace in religion, specifically [[Congregational church|Congregationalism]], but does not find it and ultimately loses faith.

Lovecraft himself adopted the stance of atheism early in his life. In 1932 he wrote in a letter to [[Robert E. Howard]]: "All I say is that I think it is damned unlikely that anything like a central cosmic will, a spirit world, or an eternal survival of personality exist. They are the most preposterous and unjustified of all the guesses which can be made about the universe, and I am not enough of a hairsplitter to pretend that I don't regard them as arrant and negligible moonshine. In theory I am an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], but pending the appearance of radical evidence I must be classed, practically and provisionally, as an atheist."<ref>H. P. Lovecraft Letter to Robert E. Howard (August 16, 1932), in ''Selected Letters 1932–1934'' (Sauk City, Wisconsin: Arkham House, 1976), p.57."</ref>

===Superstition===
In 1926, famed [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and [[Escapology|escapist]] [[Harry Houdini]] asked Lovecraft to ghostwrite a treatise exploring the topic of superstition. Houdini's unexpected death later that year halted the project, but ''[[The Cancer of Superstition]]'' was partially completed by Lovecraft along with collaborator [[C. M. Eddy, Jr.]] A previously unknown manuscript of the work was discovered in 2016 in a collection owned by a magic shop. The book states “all superstitious beliefs are relics of a common ‘prehistoric ignorance’ in humans,” and goes on to explore various superstitious beliefs in different cultures and times.<ref name="Flood">Alison Flood, [http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/16/hp-lovecraft-harry-houdini-manuscript-cancer-superstition-memorabilia Lost HP Lovecraft work commissioned by Houdini escapes shackles of history], The Guardian 16 March 2016.</ref>

== Influences on Lovecraft ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}

Some of Lovecraft's work was inspired by his own nightmares. His interest started from his childhood days when his grandfather would tell him Gothic horror stories.

Lovecraft's most significant literary influence was [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He had a British writing style due to his love of British literature. Like Lovecraft, Poe's work was out of step with the prevailing literary trends of his era. Both authors created distinctive, singular worlds of fantasy and employed [[archaism]]s in their writings. This influence can be found in such works as his novella ''[[The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]''<ref name="The Shadow Over Innsmouth">{{cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/soi.aspx |title=Lovecraft's Shadow Over Innsmouth |publisher=Donovan K. Loucks}}</ref> where Lovecraft references Poe's story ‘’[[The Imp of the Perverse]]’’ by name in Chapter 3, and in his poem "Nemesis", where the "''…ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber''"<ref name="ghoul-guarded">{{cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/poetry/p121.aspx |title=Lovecraft's Nemesis |publisher=Donovan K. Loucks}}</ref> suggest the "''…ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir''"<ref name="ghoul-haunted">{{cite wikisource |first=Edgar Allan |last=Poe |authorlink=Edgar Allan Poe |chapter=Ulalume |wslink=The Works of the Late Edgar Allan Poe/Volume 2}}</ref> found in Poe's "[[Ulalume]]". A direct quote from the poem and a reference to Poe's only novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' is alluded to in Lovecraft's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''. Both authors shared many biographical similarities as well, such as the loss of their fathers at young ages and an early interest in poetry.

He was influenced by [[Arthur Machen]]'s<ref name="newstatesman.com">http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/10/weird-realism-john-gray-moral-universe-h-p-lovecraft</ref> carefully constructed tales concerning the survival of ancient evil into modern times in an otherwise realistic world and his beliefs in hidden mysteries which lay behind reality. Lovecraft was also influenced by authors such as Oswald Spengler and [[Robert W. Chambers]]. Chambers was the writer of ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', of whom Lovecraft wrote in a letter to [[Clark Ashton Smith]]: "Chambers is like [[Rupert Hughes]] and a few other fallen Titans – equipped with the right brains and education but wholly out of the habit of using them". Lovecraft's discovery of the stories of [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], with their pantheon of mighty gods existing in dreamlike outer realms, moved his writing in a new direction, resulting in a series of imitative fantasies in a "Dreamlands" setting.

Lovecraft also cited [[Algernon Blackwood]] as an influence, quoting ''The Centaur'' in the head paragraph of "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]". He declared Blackwood's story "[[The Willows (story)|The Willows]]" to be the single best piece of weird fiction ever written.<ref>{{cite wikisource|wslink=Supernatural Horror in Literature |chapter=The Modern Masters |plaintitle=[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]] |last=Lovecraft |first=H. P. |year=1938 |origyear=Written 1927 |quote=The well-nigh endless array of Mr. Blackwood's fiction includes both novels and shorter tales... Foremost of all must be reckoned The Willows... Here art and restraint in narrative reach their very highest development, and an impression of lasting poignancy is produced without a, [sic] single strained passage or a single false note.}}</ref>

Another inspiration came from a completely different source: scientific progress in biology, astronomy, geology, and physics. His study of science contributed to Lovecraft's view of the human race as insignificant, powerless, and doomed in a [[materialistic]] and [[mechanistic]] universe. Lovecraft was a keen amateur astronomer from his youth, often visiting the [[Ladd Observatory]] in Providence, and penning numerous astronomical articles for local newspapers. His astronomical telescope is now housed in the rooms of the [[August Derleth]] Society.

Lovecraft's materialist views led him to espouse his philosophical views through his fiction; these philosophical views came to be called [[cosmicism]]. Cosmicism took on a dark tone with his creation of what is today often called the Cthulhu Mythos, a pantheon of alien extra-dimensional deities and horrors which predate humanity, and which are hinted at in eons-old myths and legends. The term "Cthulhu Mythos" was coined by Lovecraft's correspondent and fellow author, August Derleth, after Lovecraft's death; Lovecraft jocularly referred to his artificial mythology as "Yog-Sothothery".

Lovecraft considered himself a man best suited to the early 18th century. His writing style, especially in his many letters, owes much to [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] British writers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] like [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Jonathan Swift]].

Among the books found in his library (as evidenced in ''Lovecraft's Library'' by S. T. Joshi) was ''[[The Seven Who Were Hanged]]'' by [[Leonid Andreyev]] and ''[[A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder]]'' by [[James De Mille]].

Lovecraft's style has often been criticized by unsympathetic critics,<ref name="newstatesman.com"/> yet scholars such as S. T. Joshi have shown that Lovecraft consciously utilized a variety of literary devices to form a unique style of his own – these include conscious [[archaism]], prose-poetic techniques combined with essay-form techniques, [[alliteration]], [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], [[crescendo]], [[transferred epithet]], [[metaphor]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], and [[colloquialism]].

{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}

Lovecraft was relatively unknown during his own time.<ref>http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16993/hp-lovecraft-an-appreciation</ref> While his stories appeared in the pages of prominent pulp magazines such as ''Weird Tales'' (eliciting letters of outrage as often as letters of praise from regular readers of the magazines), not many people knew his name. He did, however, correspond regularly with other contemporary writers, such as Clark Ashton Smith and August Derleth, people who became good friends of his, even though they never met in person. This group of writers became known as the "Lovecraft Circle", since they all freely borrowed elements of Lovecraft's stories&nbsp;– the mysterious books with disturbing names, the pantheon of ancient alien entities, such as Cthulhu and Azathoth, and eldritch places, such as the New England town of [[Arkham]] and its [[Miskatonic University]]&nbsp;– for use in their own works with Lovecraft's encouragement.

After Lovecraft's death, the Lovecraft Circle carried on. August Derleth in particular added to and expanded on Lovecraft's vision. However, Derleth's contributions have been controversial. While Lovecraft never considered his pantheon of alien gods more than a mere plot device, Derleth created an entire cosmology, complete with a war between the good [[Elder God (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder God]]s and the evil [[Outer God]]s, such as [[Cthulhu]] and his ilk. The forces of good were supposed to have won, locking Cthulhu and others up beneath the earth, in the ocean, and so forth. Derleth's Cthulhu Mythos stories went on to associate different gods with the traditional four elements of fire, air, earth and water—an artificial constraint which required rationalizations on Derleth's part as Lovecraft himself never envisioned such a scheme.

Lovecraft's fiction has been grouped into three categories by some critics. While Lovecraft did not refer to these categories himself, he did once write: "There are my '[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]' pieces and my '[[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Dunsany]] pieces'—but alas—where are any Lovecraft pieces?"<ref>Letter to Elizabeth Toldridge, March 8, 1929, quoted in ''Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos''</ref>
* Macabre stories ({{circa}} 1905–1920);
* [[Dream Cycle]] stories ({{circa}} 1920–1927);
* [[Cthulhu Mythos|Cthulhu{{\}}Lovecraft Mythos]] stories ({{circa}} 1925–1935).

Lovecraft's writing, particularly the so-called Cthulhu Mythos, has influenced fiction authors including modern horror and fantasy writers. [[Stephen King]], [[Ramsey Campbell]], [[Bentley Little]], [[Joe R. Lansdale]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Junji Ito]], [[F. Paul Wilson]], [[Brian Lumley]], [[Caitlín R. Kiernan]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Neil Gaiman]], have cited Lovecraft as one of their primary influences. Beyond direct adaptation, Lovecraft and his stories have had a profound impact on popular culture. Some influence was direct, as he was a friend, inspiration, and correspondent to many of his contemporaries, such as August Derleth, Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch and [[Fritz Leiber]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17472580</ref> Many later figures were influenced by Lovecraft's works, including author and artist [[Clive Barker]], prolific horror writer Stephen King,<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> comics writers Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman<ref name="irishtimes.com">http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/hp-lovecraft-love-the-craft-loathe-the-creed-1.2489413</ref> and [[Mike Mignola]], film directors [[John Carpenter]], [[Stuart Gordon]], [[Guillermo Del Toro]]<ref name="irishtimes.com"/> and artist [[H.

Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote his short story "[[There Are More Things]]" in memory of Lovecraft. Contemporary French writer [[Michel Houellebecq]] wrote a literary biography of Lovecraft called ''[[H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life]]''. Prolific American writer Joyce Carol Oates wrote an introduction for a collection of Lovecraft stories.

===Music===
Lovecraft's fictional Mythos has influenced a number of musicians. 
* The psychedelic rock band [[H. P. Lovecraft (band)|H. P. Lovecraft]] (who shortened their name to Lovecraft and then Love Craft in the 1970s) released the albums ''[[H. P. Lovecraft (album)|H. P. Lovecraft]]'' and ''[[H. P. Lovecraft II]]'' in 1967 and 1968 respectively; their titles included "The White Ship". 
* [[Metallica]] recorded a song inspired by "The Call of Cthulhu", an instrumental titled "The Call of Ktulu", and another song based on ''[[The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]'' titled "The Thing That Should Not Be", and another based on [[Frank Belknap Long]]'s "[[The Hounds of Tindalos]]", titled "[[All Nightmare Long]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/M/Metallica/2008/12/08/7668306-sun.html |title=CANOE – JAM!

* New Zealand Jazz musician Reuben Bradley's 2015 album with [[Taylor Eigsti]] and Matt Penman, entitled "Cthulhu Rising", programmatically recounts a Lovecraft story for each of its tracks.

===Games===
Lovecraft has also influenced gaming. [[Chaosium]]'s [[role-playing game]] ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' (currently in its seventh major edition) has been in print for 30 years. The tabletop games ''[[Arkham Horror]]'', ''[[Eldritch Horror]]'', ''Mansions of Madness'' and ''[[Elder Sign (card game)|Elder Sign]]'' include some themes derived from the Call of Cthulhu RPG. Two collectible card games are ''[[Mythos (card game)|Mythos]]'' and ''Call of Cthulhu, the Living Card Game''. With the rise in popularity of tabletop gaming, many other Lovecraft-themed games have been produced, for example (note that this is not an exhaustive list; it is a small selection from better-known designers and publishers):
* ''Cthulhu Fluxx'' ([[Looney Labs]]) by [[Keith Baker (game designer)|Keith Baker]] with art by Derek Ring. This is a Lovecraft-themed version of the [[Fluxx]] series of games.
* ''Cthulhu Gloom'' ([[Atlas Games]]) by [[Keith Baker (game designer)|Keith Baker]] with art by Todd Remick. This is a Lovecraft-themed version of the [[Gloom (card game)|Gloom]] series of games.
* ''Cthulhu Realms'' (Tasty Minstrel Games) by [[Darwin Kastle]].
* ''Cthulhu Wars'' (Green Eye Games/Petersen Games) by [[Sandy Petersen]], original writer of the Call of Cthulhu RPG, and art by Richard Luong.
* ''The Doom that Came to Atlantic City'' ([[Cryptozoic Entertainment]]) by [[Lee Moyer]] and [[Keith Baker (game designer)|Keith Baker]], with miniatures by sculptor Paul Komoda.<ref>[http://www.cryptozoic.com/games/doom-came-atlantic-city The Doom That Came to Atlantic City | Cryptozoic Entertainment]. Cryptozoic.com. Retrieved on April 12, 2014.</ref>
* ''Kingsport Festival'' (Passport Game Studios) by Andrea Chiarvesio and Gianluca Santopietro. Based thematically on Lovecraft's ''[[The Festival]]'' and his fictional town of [[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]] from ''[[The Terrible Old Man]]''.
* ''Munchkin Cthulhu'' ([[Steve Jackson Games]]) by J. H. G. Hendricks and [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|Steve Jackson]]. This is a Lovecraft-themed version of the [[Munchkin (card game)|Munchkin]] series of games.
* ''The Stars are Right'' ([[Steve Jackson Games]]) by Klaus Westerhoff, with art by François Launet.
Several video games are based on or influenced heavily by Lovecraft such as ''[[Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth]]'', ''[[Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Comet]]'', ''[[Prisoner of Ice]]'', ''[[Shadow Man (video game)|Shadowman]]'', ''[[Alone in the Dark]]'',<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> ''[[Chzo Mythos]]'', ''[[Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem]]'',<ref>http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/10/feature_the_making_of_eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem</ref> ''[[Cthulhu Saves the World]]'', ''[[Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened]]'',<ref>http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/09/13/sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-review</ref> ''[[Amnesia: The Dark Descent]]'', ''[[Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs]]'', ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', ''[[Bloodborne]]'',<ref>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-10-how-bloodborne-honours-the-legacy-of-h-p-lovecraft</ref> ''[[Darkest Dungeon]]'', ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'',<ref>http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-art-of-fear-how-dead-space-was-built-to-scare-you/</ref> ''[[Terraria]]'', ''[[Splatterhouse (2010 video game)|Splatterhouse]]'', ''[[Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder]]'', ''[[Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage]]'', ''[[Penumbra (video game series)|Penumbra]]'', ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'', ''[[The Last Door]]'', the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise,<ref>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/PSP/Shin+Megami+Tensei%3A+Persona+2/psp_news.asp</ref> [[Shadow Hearts]]<ref>http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2001/111401a.html</ref> and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> The MMORPG ''[[The Secret World]]'' is heavily based on Lovecraftian lore. In ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Dragonborn]]''. the Daedric Prince ''Hermaeus Mora'' and his realm of Oblivion, Apocrypha, are both heavily influenced by Lovecraft. The Old Gods featured in [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s ''[[Warcraft]]'' franchise are heavily influenced by Lovecraft's works. For example, the Old Gods C'Thun and Yogg-Saron have names that are very similar to Cthulhu and [[Yog-Sothoth]], respectively.

===Lovecraft as a character in fiction===
Aside from his thinly veiled appearance in Robert Bloch's "The Shambler from the Stars", Lovecraft continues to be used as a character in supernatural fiction. An early version of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s "The Exiles"<ref>Published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', Volume 1 No. 2 (Winter-Spring 1950), and later to become part of Bradbury's ''[[Martian Chronicles]]''</ref> uses Lovecraft as a character, who makes a brief, 600-word appearance eating ice cream in front of a fire and complaining about how cold he is. Lovecraft and some associates are included at length in [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Robert Shea]]'s ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' (1975). Lovecraft makes an appearance as a rotting corpse in ''The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril'' by [[Paul Malmont]], a novel with fictionalized versions of a number of period writers.

Other notable works with Lovecraft as a character include [[Richard Lupoff]]'s ''Lovecraft's Book'' (1985), ''[[Cast a Deadly Spell]]'' (1991), ''[[H.P. Lovecraft's: Necronomicon]]'' (1993), ''[[Witch Hunt (1994 film)|Witch Hunt]]'' (1994), ''[[Out of Mind: The Stories of H. P. Lovecraft]]'' (1998) and ''[[Stargate SG-1: Roswell]]'' (2007). Lovecraft also appears in the Season 6, Episode 21 episode "Let it Bleed" of the TV show ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''. A satirical version of Lovecraft named "H. P. Hatecraft" appeared as a recurring character on the [[Cartoon Network]] television series ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]''. A character based on Lovecraft also appears in the [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'', under the name "Howard Phillips" (or "Mr. Howard" to most of the main characters).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}. Another character based on Lovecraft appears in [[Afterlife with Archie]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/comics/afterlife-with-archie-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-returns/#/8|title=‘Afterlife With Archie': Sabrina the Teenage Witch returns |date=July 22, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 10, 2015| first=Justin| last=Sullivan}}</ref>  He appears as a minor character in [[Brian Clevinger]]'s comic book series [[Atomic Robo]], as an acquantance and fellow-scientist of [[Nikola Tesla]], having been driven insane by his involvement in the [[Tunguska Event]] which exposed him to the hidden horrors of the wider universe. He is eventually killed when his body becomes host to an extradimensional being infecting the timestream.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Editions and collections of Lovecraft's work ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}

For most of the 20th century, the definitive editions (specifically ''At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels'', ''Dagon and Other Macabre Tales'', ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', and ''The Horror in the Museum and Other Revisions'') of his prose fiction were published by [[Arkham House]], a publisher originally started with the intent of publishing the work of Lovecraft, but which has since published a considerable amount of other literature as well. [[Penguin Classics]] has at present issued three volumes of Lovecraft's works: ''[[The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories]]'', ''The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories'', and most recently ''[[The Dreams in the Witch House and Other Weird Stories]]''. They collect the standard texts as edited by S. T. Joshi, most of which were available in the Arkham House editions, with the exception of the restored text of "The Shadow Out of Time" from ''The Dreams in the Witch House'', which had been previously released by small-press publisher [[Hippocampus Press]]. In 2005 the prestigious [[Library of America]] canonized Lovecraft with a volume of his stories edited by [[Peter Straub]], and Random House's [[Modern Library]] line have issued the "definitive edition" of Lovecraft's ''At the Mountains of Madness'' (also including "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]").

Lovecraft's poetry is collected in ''The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft'' (Night Shade Books, 2001), while much of his juvenilia, various essays on philosophical, political and literary topics, antiquarian travelogues, and other things, can be found in ''Miscellaneous Writings'' (Arkham House, 1989). Lovecraft's essay "Supernatural Horror in Literature", first published in 1927, is a historical survey of horror literature available with endnotes as ''The Annotated Supernatural Horror in Literature''.

===Letters===
Although Lovecraft is known mostly for his works of weird fiction, the bulk of his writing consists of voluminous letters about a variety of topics, from weird fiction and art criticism to politics and history. Lovecraft's biographer [[L. Sprague de Camp]] estimates that Lovecraft wrote 100,000 letters in his lifetime, a fifth of which are believed to survive.

He sometimes dated his letters 200 years before the current date, which would have put the writing back in U.S. colonial times, before the [[American Revolution]] (a war that offended his Anglophilia). He explained that he thought that the 18th and 20th centuries were the "best", the former being a period of noble grace, and the latter a century of science.

Lovecraft was not an active letter-writer in youth. In 1931 he admitted: "In youth I scarcely did any letter-writing&nbsp;— thanking anybody for a present was so much of an ordeal that I would rather have written a two hundred fifty-line pastoral or a twenty-page treatise on the rings of Saturn." (SL 3.369–70). The initial interest in letters stemmed from his correspondence with his cousin Phillips Gamwell but even more important was his involvement in the amateur journalism movement, which was initially responsible for the enormous number of letters Lovecraft produced.

Despite his light letter-writing in youth, in later life his correspondence was so voluminous that it has been estimated that he may have written around 30,000 letters to various correspondents, a figure which places him second only to [[Voltaire]] as an epistolarian. Lovecraft's later correspondence is primarily to fellow weird fiction writers, rather than to the amateur journalist friends of his earlier years.

Lovecraft clearly states that his contact to numerous different people through letter-writing was one of the main factors in broadening his view of the world: "I found myself opened up to dozens of points of view which would otherwise never have occurred to me. My understanding and sympathies were enlarged, and many of my social, political, and economic views were modified as a consequence of increased knowledge." (SL 4.389).

Today there are five publishing houses that have released letters from Lovecraft, most prominently Arkham House with its five-volume edition ''Selected Letters.'' (Those volumes, however, severely abridge the letters they contain). Other publishers are [[Hippocampus Press]] (''Letters to Alfred Galpin'' ''et al.''), [[Night Shade Books]] (''Mysteries of Time and Spirit: The Letters of H. P. Lovecraft and Donald Wandrei'' ''et al.''.), [[Necronomicon Press]] (''Letters to Samuel Loveman and Vincent Starrett'' et al.), and University of Tampa Press (''O Fortunate Floridian: H. P. Lovecraft's Letters to R. H. Barlow''). [[S.T. Joshi]] is supervising an ongoing series of volumes collecting Lovecraft's unabridged letters to particular correspondents.

"Lord of a Visible World: An Autobiography in Letters" was published in 2000, in which his letters are arranged according to themes, such as adolescence and travel.

===Copyright===
Despite several claims to the contrary, there is currently no evidence that any company or individual owns the copyright to any of Lovecraft`s work, and it is generally accepted that it has passed into the public domain.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The H. P. Lovecraft Library |url=http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |date=2003-10-03 |access-date=2016-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003114117/http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2003 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Black Seas of Copyright: Arkham House Publishers and the H.P.

There has been controversy over the [[copyright]] status of many of Lovecraft's works, especially his later works. Lovecraft had specified that the young [[R. H. Barlow]] would serve as executor of his [[literary estate]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Joshi, Schultz|2001|p=16|ref=hplencyclopedia}}</ref> but these instructions had not been incorporated into his will. Nevertheless his surviving aunt carried out his expressed wishes, and Barlow was given charge of the massive and complex literary estate upon Lovecraft's death.

Barlow deposited the bulk of the papers, including the voluminous correspondence, with the [[John Hay Library]], and attempted to organize and maintain Lovecraft's other writing. [[August Derleth]], an older and more established writer than Barlow, vied for control of the literary estate. One result of these conflicts was the legal confusion over who owned what copyrights.

All works published before 1923 are [[public domain]] in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ22.pdf How to Investigate the Copyright Status of a Work- U.S. Copyright Office]</ref> However, there is some disagreement over who exactly owns or owned the copyrights and whether the copyrights apply to the majority of Lovecraft's works published post-1923.

Questions center over whether copyrights for Lovecraft's works were ever renewed under the terms of the United States [[Copyright Act of 1976]] for works created prior to January 1, 1978. The problem comes from the fact that before the Copyright Act of 1976 the number of years a work was copyrighted in the U.S. was based on ''publication'' rather than life of the author plus a certain number of years and that it was good for only 28 years. After that point, a new copyright had to be filed, and any work that did not have its copyright renewed fell into the public domain. The Copyright Act of 1976 retroactively extended this renewal period for all works to a period of 47 years<ref>[ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/law/copyright/faq/part2 Copyright Basics by Terry Carroll 1994]</ref> and the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998 added another 20 years to that, for a total of 95 years from publication. If the works were renewed, the copyrights would still be valid in the United States.

The [[European Union]] [[Copyright Duration Directive]] of 1993 extended the copyrights to 70 years after the author's death. So, all works of Lovecraft published during his lifetime, became public domain in all 27 European Union countries on January 1, 2008. In those [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] countries who have implemented only the minimum copyright period, copyright expires 50 years after the author's death.

Lovecraft protégés and part owners of Arkham House, August Derleth and [[Donald Wandrei]], often claimed copyrights over Lovecraft's works. On October 9, 1947, Derleth purchased all rights to ''Weird Tales''. However, since April 1926 at the latest, Lovecraft had reserved all second printing rights to stories published in ''Weird Tales''. Hence, ''Weird Tales'' may only have owned the rights to at most six of Lovecraft's tales. Again, even if Derleth did obtain the copyrights to Lovecraft's tales, no evidence as yet has been found that the copyrights were renewed.<ref>{{cite web|last=William |first=Johns |title=Copyright |url=http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003114117/http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2003 |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}<!-- Keeping URL of copy on SourceForge.net as reference: http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/Innsmouth/LovecraftCopyright.html --></ref> Following Derleth's death in 1971, his attorney proclaimed that all of Lovecraft's literary material was part of the Derleth estate and that it would be "[protected] to the fullest extent possible."<ref>{{cite web|last=Karr |first=Chris J. |title=The Black Seas of Copyright: Arkham House Publishers and the H.P. Lovecraft Copyrights |url=http://www.aetherial.net/lovecraft/arkham.html#13 |accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>

S. T. Joshi concludes in his biography, ''H. P. Lovecraft: A Life'', that Derleth's claims are "almost certainly fictitious" and that most of Lovecraft's works published in the amateur press are most likely now in the public domain. The copyright for Lovecraft's works would have been inherited by the only surviving heir of his 1912 will: Lovecraft's aunt, Annie Gamwell. Gamwell herself perished in 1941 and the copyrights then passed to her remaining descendants, Ethel Phillips Morrish and Edna Lewis. Morrish and Lewis then signed a document, sometimes referred to as the Morrish-Lewis gift, permitting Arkham House to republish Lovecraft's works but retaining the copyrights for themselves. Searches of the [[Library of Congress]] have failed to find any evidence that these copyrights were then renewed after the 28-year period and hence, it is likely that these works are now in the public domain.

Chaosium, publishers of the ''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing game, have a trademark on the phrase "The Call of Cthulhu" for use in game products. [[TSR, Inc.]], original publisher of the ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' role-playing game, included a section on the Cthulhu Mythos in one of the game's earlier supplements, ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''<ref>http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/literature/cthulhu5.htm</ref> (originally published in 1980 and later renamed to "Legends & Lore"). TSR later agreed to remove this section at Chaosium's request.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 2009, Lovecraft Holdings, LLC, a company based out of Providence, filed trademark claims for clothing graphics of Lovecraft's name and silhouette.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trademarks.justia.com/owners/lovecraft-holdings-llc-2613553/ |title=Lovecraft Holdings, LLC Trademarks |accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>

Regardless of the legal disagreements surrounding Lovecraft's works, Lovecraft himself was extremely generous with his own works and encouraged others to borrow ideas from his stories and build on them, particularly with regard to his Cthulhu Mythos.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} He encouraged other writers to reference his creations, such as the ''[[Necronomicon]]'', Cthulhu and [[Yog-Sothoth]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} After his death, many writers have contributed stories and enriched the shared mythology of the Cthulhu Mythos, as well as making numerous references to his work.

==World Fantasy Award and H. P. Lovecraft controversy==
{{Main|World Fantasy Award#Controversy}}
Lovecraft was long commemorated by the [[World Fantasy Award]]s, established in 1975. The award statue was a caricature bust of Lovecraft designed by [[cartoonist]] [[Gahan Wilson]] in honor of Lovecraft's work and contributions to the world of fantasy. The award had the nickname of "Howard", after Lovecraft's first name. The award's association with Lovecraft's name and visage later became a matter of controversy owing to the author's perceived racism. {{according to whom|date=December 2015}}

In 1984, writer [[Donald Wandrei]] caused some controversy after he was offered a [[World Fantasy Award]] for Life Achievement but refused to accept it because the award was a bust of H. P. Lovecraft that he felt looked more like a caricature of Lovecraft than an actual representation.<ref>{{cite book| last=Sullivan| first=Jack| authorlink=Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)| title=[[The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural]]| location=New York| publisher=[[Viking Press]]| pages=448–449| year=1986| isbn=0-670-80902-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Bob |last=Morrish |title=Wandrei, Donald |editor1-link=John Grant (author) |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Grant |editor2-link=John Clute |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=Clute |encyclopedia=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]] |isbn=0-312-19869-8 |pages=994–5 }}</ref>

In August 2014, author [[Daniel José Older]] started a petition to change the World Fantasy Award statuette from a bust of Lovecraft to one of African-American author [[Octavia Butler]].<ref name="tg">{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/17/world-fantasy-awards-hp-lovecraft-racism-row-statuette |title=World Fantasy awards pressed to drop HP Lovecraft trophy in racism row |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 September 2014 |accessdate=18 September 2014 }}</ref> Kevin J. Maroney, editor of the ''[[The New York Review of Science Fiction]]'', also supported the call for the WFA to be changed from Lovecraft's face, suggesting it be replaced with a symbol representing the fantasy genre. Maroney argued this should be done "not out of disrespect for Lovecraft as a writer or as a central figure in fantasy, but as a courtesy to generations of writers whom the WFA hopes to honor."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nyrsf.com/2014/09/issue-312-august-2014-editorial-chance-of-face-change-of-heart.html |title=Editorial: Chance of Face, Change of Heart |journal=The New York Review of Science Fiction |issue=312 |date=August 2014 }}</ref> In response to the campaign, the board of the World Fantasy Awards announced in September 2014 that it was "in discussion' about the future of the award statuette.,<ref name="tg" /> and in November 2015 it was announced that the World Fantasy Award trophy would no longer be modeled on H.
