'''Idaho''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Idaho.ogg|ˈ|aɪ|d|ə|h|oʊ}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Northwestern United States|northwestern]] region of the [[United States]].  Idaho is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|14th largest]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|39th most populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|7th least densely populated]] of the [[50 United States]].  The state's largest city and capital is [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].  Residents are called "[[List of U.S. state residents names|Idahoans]]". Idaho was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] on July 3, 1890, as the 43rd state.

Idaho is a mountainous state with an area larger than that of all of [[New England]]. It borders the US states of [[Montana]] to the northeast, [[Wyoming]] to the east, [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]] to the south, and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] to the west. To the north, it shares a 45&nbsp;mi (72&nbsp;km) international border with the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]], the shortest such land border of any state. The network of dams and locks on the [[Columbia River]] and [[Snake River]] make the city of [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] the farthest inland seaport on the Pacific coast of the contiguous United States.

Idaho's nickname is the "Gem State", because nearly every known type of [[gemstone]] has been found there.<ref>Just, Rick. "Star Garnet." ''Idaho Snapshots''. Meridian, Idaho: Radio Idaho, 1990. 9.</ref> In addition, Idaho is one of only two places in the world where [[star garnet]]s can be found in any significant quantities, the other being India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/ipnf/rec/activities/garnets/|title=Garnet Digging at the Emerald Creek Garnet Area|publisher=[[United States Forest Service]]|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Star Garnet: The Gem of Life|url=http://www.stargemstones.com/info/star-garnet/|publisher=StarGemstones.com|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref>  Idaho is sometimes called the "Potato State" owing to its popular and widely distributed crop.  The state motto is ''Esto Perpetua'' ([[Latin]] for "Let it be forever" or "Let it endure forever").

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the name remains a mystery.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/details/idahoitsmeaningo00reesrich |title=Idaho – its meaning, origin and application | last = Rees | first = John E | origyear = 1868 | year = 1928 | publisher = Internet Archive |accessdate= July 30, 2010}}</ref> In the early 1860s, when the [[United States Congress]] was considering organizing a new territory in the [[Rocky Mountains]], eccentric lobbyist [[George M. Willing]] suggested the name "Idaho", which he claimed was derived from a [[Shoshone language]] term meaning "the sun comes from the mountains" or "gem of the mountains". Willing later claimed that he had simply invented the name.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Idaho | publisher = MSN | work = Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565515/Idaho.html|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257036681681058 |archivedate=November 1, 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/weblog/comments/did_idaho_get_its_name_as_a_result_of_a_hoax |title = Did Idaho Get Its Name As a Result of a Hoax? |publisher=Museum of hoaxes |date= April 25, 2006 | accessdate = July 30, 2010}}</ref> Congress ultimately decided to name the area [[Colorado Territory]] when it was created in February 1861. Thinking they would get a jump on the name, locals named a community in Colorado "[[Idaho Springs, Colorado|Idaho Springs]]".

However, the name "Idaho" did not fall into obscurity. The same year Congress created Colorado Territory, a county called [[Idaho County, Idaho|Idaho County]] was created in eastern [[Washington Territory]]. The county was named after a [[Steamboat|steamship]] named Idaho, which was launched on the [[Columbia River]] in 1860. It is unclear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was revealed. Regardless, a portion of Washington Territory, including Idaho County, was used to create Idaho Territory in 1863.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = ISU | url = http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/geog/explore/essay.pdf | contribution =Origins of the Name "Idaho" and How Idaho Became a Territory in 1863 | title = Idaho Museum of Natural History | format = [[PDF]]}}.</ref>

Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well into the 20th&nbsp;century repeated as fact Willing's account that the name "Idaho" derived from the Shoshone term "ee-da-how".

The name "Idaho" may be derived from the [[Plains Apache language|Plains Apache]] word "ídaahę́", which means "enemy." The [[Comanche]]s used this word to refer to the [[Idaho Territory]].<ref>{{Citation | type = dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Idaho | contribution = Idaho | title = Online Etymology Dictionary}}.</ref>

A 1956 Idaho history textbook says:
{{bquote|"Idaho" is a [[Shoshoni]] Indian exclamation. The word consists of three parts. The first is "Ee", which in English conveys the idea of "coming down". The second is "dah" which is the Shoshoni stem or root for both "sun" and "mountain".  The third syllable, "how", denotes the exclamation and stands for the same thing in Shoshoni that the exclamation mark (!) does in the English language. The Shoshoni word is "Ee-dah-how", and the Indian thought thus conveyed when translated into English means, "Behold! the sun coming down the mountain.<ref>{{cite book | last1 =Barber | last2 = Martin |title= Idaho in the Pacific Northwest |publisher=Caxton Printers; Library of Congress | id = 55-5192 |year= 1956}}</ref>}}

According to local knowledge{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, the name Idaho originated from the [[Nez Perce language]] and stands for "the Land of many Waters", a kidney-shaped drainage area in north central Idaho in which a multitude of rivers come together. These rivers include the Snake, the Salmon, the Clearwater, [[North Fork Clearwater River]], the Selway, and more.  The famed steamboat was probably named 'Idaho' because it voyaged along the Columbia river to "the Land of many Waters".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Geography==
[[File:National-atlas-idaho.PNG|left|thumb|Map of Idaho.]]
Idaho borders six US states and one Canadian province. The states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] are to the west, [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]] are to the south, and [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]] are to the east. Idaho also shares a short border with the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] to the north.  The landscape is rugged with some of the largest unspoiled natural areas in the United States. For example, at 2.3&nbsp;million acres (930,000&nbsp;ha), the [[Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area]] is the largest contiguous area of protected wilderness in the continental United States. Idaho is a [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain]] state with abundant natural resources and scenic areas. The state has snow-capped mountain ranges, rapids, vast lakes and steep canyons.  The waters of the [[Snake River]] rush through [[Hells Canyon]], the deepest gorge in the United States. [[Shoshone Falls]] plunges down rugged cliffs from a height greater than that of [[Niagara Falls]].  The major rivers in Idaho are the [[Snake River]], the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork]]/[[Pend Oreille River]], the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]], and the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]]. Other significant rivers include the [[Coeur d'Alene River]], the [[Spokane River]], the [[Boise River]], and the [[Payette River]].  The Salmon River empties into the Snake in Hells Canyon and forms the southern boundary of Nez Perce County on its north shore, of which Lewiston is the county seat. The Port of [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], at the confluence of the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater]] and the [[Snake River]]s is the farthest inland [[seaport]] on the West Coast at 465&nbsp;[[river mile]]s from the Pacific at [[Astoria, Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2812.html |title=Port of Lewiston | publisher = US history |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref>

Idaho's highest point is [[Borah Peak]], {{convert|12662|ft|0|abbr=on}}, in the [[Lost River Range]] north of [[Mackay, Idaho|Mackay]]. Idaho's lowest point, {{convert|710|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, is in [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], where the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] joins the [[Snake River]] and continues into [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Range]] is often considered Idaho's most famous mountain range.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.idahoaclimbingguide.com/id27.htm | title= Sawtooth Range | publisher = Idaho climbing guide | accessdate =July 30, 2010}}</ref> Other mountain ranges in Idaho include the [[Bitterroot Range]], the [[White Cloud Mountains]], the [[Lost River Range]], the [[Clearwater Mountains]], and the [[Salmon River Mountains]].

Idaho has two [[Time in the United States|time zones]], with the dividing line approximately midway between Canada and [[Nevada]].  Southern Idaho, including the [[Boise metropolitan area]], [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], and [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], are in the [[Mountain Time Zone]].  A legislative error ({{usctc|15|6}} §264) theoretically placed this region in the [[Central Time Zone]], but this was corrected with a 2007 amendment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C6.txt | id = 264 | title = Part of Idaho in fourth zone | publisher = House of representatives | place = Washington, D.C., U.S. | work = U.S. Code}}</ref>  Areas north of the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], including [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]], [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], and [[Sandpoint, Idaho|Sandpoint]], are in the [[Pacific Time Zone]], which contains less than a quarter of the state's population and land area.

===Climate===
[[File:Autumn_in_Boise.jpg|thumb|Autumn in Boise]]
Idaho has much variation in its climate. Although the state's western border is located about {{convert |350|mi|-1}} from the Pacific Ocean, the maritime influence is still felt in Idaho, especially in the winter when cloud cover, [[humidity]], and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are at their maximum extent. This influence has a moderating effect in the winter where temperatures are not as low as would otherwise be expected for a northern state with predominantly high elevations.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm |title=Climate of Idaho | work =WRCC | publisher = DRI |date = February 20, 1954 | accessdate = July 30, 2010}}</ref> The maritime influence is least prominent in the eastern part of the state where the precipitation patterns are often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences more extreme, showing a more semi-arid [[continental climate]].

[[Climate]] in Idaho can be hot, although extended periods over {{convert|98|°F|°C|abbr=on}} for the maximum temperature are rare, except for the lowest point in elevation, Lewiston, which correspondingly sees very little snow.  Hot summer days are tempered by the low relative humidity and cooler evenings during summer months since, for most of the state, the highest [[Day|diurnal]] difference in temperature is often in the summer. Winters can be cold, although extended periods of bitter cold weather below zero are unusual. This is what led the railroad tycoon Harriman family to develop the famous ski resort, [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]]. Idaho's all-time highest temperature of {{convert|118|F|C}} was recorded at [[Orofino, Idaho|Orofino]] on July 28, 1934; the all-time lowest temperature of {{convert|-60|F|C}} was recorded at [[Island Park Dam]] on January 18, 1943.

==History==
{{Main |History of Idaho}}
Humans may have been present in the Idaho area as long as 14,500 years ago. Excavations at [[Wilson Butte Cave]] near [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America. [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] peoples predominant in the area included the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Percé]] in the north and the Northern and Western [[Shoshone]] in the south.

An early presence of French-Canadian trappers is visible in names and [[toponym]]s that have survived to this day: Nez Percé, Cœur d'Alène, Boisé, Payette, some preexisting the [[Lewis and Clark]] and Astorian expeditions which themselves included significant numbers of French and Métis guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain.

Idaho, as part of the [[Oregon Country]], was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846. From 1843 to 1849, present-day Idaho was under the de&nbsp;facto jurisdiction of the [[Provisional Government of Oregon]]. When Oregon became a state, what is now Idaho was in what remained of the original Oregon Territory not part of the new state, and designated as the Washington Territory.

Between then and the creation of the [[Idaho Territory]] on July 4, 1863, at Lewiston, parts of the present-day state were included in the [[Oregon Territory|Oregon]], [[Washington Territory|Washington]], and [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]] Territories. The new territory included present-day Idaho, [[Montana]], and most of [[Wyoming]]. The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the way to the Pacific and in 1806 on the return, largely following the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] both directions. The first non-indigenous settlement was [[Kullyspell House]], established on the shore of [[Lake Pend Oreille]] for fur trading in 1809 by [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] of the [[North West Company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northamericanforts.com/West/id.html#thompson |title=David Thompson's Trading Post |work=Idaho Forts |publisher=American Forts Network}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Meinig |first=DW |authorlink=D.W.

Idaho was one of the hardest hit of the [[Pacific Northwest]] states during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Schwantes |first=Carlos |year=1991 |title=In Mountain Shadows: a History of Idaho |location=Lincoln |publisher=University of Nebraska Press}}</ref> Prices plummeted for Idaho's major crops: in 1932 a bushel of potatoes brought only $.10 compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers saw their annual income of $686 in 1929 drop to $250 by 1932.<ref>{{cite book |last=Doyle |first=Randall |year=2004 |title=A political dynasty in North Idaho, 1933–1967 |publisher=University Press |isbn=0-7618-2842-7 |page=7}}</ref>

In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a tourism and agricultural state to include science and technology industries. Science and technology have become the largest single economic center (over 25% of the state's total revenue) within the state and are greater than agriculture, forestry and mining combined.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ieda.biz/white.html |title=The Power of Idaho |type=whitepaper |year=2004 |place=ID |publisher=Economic Development Association |accessdate=October 7, 2007}}</ref>

Idaho had an estimated population of 1,654,930 in 2015, which was an increase of 20,466, from the prior year and an increase of 87,348, or 5.57%, since 2010.  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 people (that is 111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to net [[Human migration|migration]] of 75,795 people into the state.  There are large numbers of Americans of English and German ancestry in Idaho. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 61,273 people.

This made Idaho the sixth [[List of U.S. states by population growth rate|fastest-growing state]] after [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Utah]]. From 2004 to 2005, Idaho grew the third-fastest, surpassed only by Nevada and Arizona.

[[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], about {{convert |20|mi|-1}} west of downtown Boise, became the state's second largest city in the late 1990s, passing [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]].<!--, and has experienced particularly strong growth in recent years.-->  Nampa's population was under 29, 000 in 1990 and grew to over 81, 000 by 2010.<!--According to census estimates, Nampa has grown 22.1% to nearly 65,000 residents between 2000 and 2003. As of 2007, the population in [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]] was estimated at 84,000.--> Located between Nampa and Boise, [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]] also experienced high growth, from under 10 000 residents in 1990 to over 75 000 in 2010 and is now Idaho's third largest city. Growth of 5% or more over the same period has also been observed in [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], [[Post Falls, Idaho|Post Falls]], and [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16000.html |title=Idaho | work = QuickFacts | place = US | publisher = Census Bureau |accessdate = July 30, 2010}}</ref>

From 1990 to 2010, Idaho's population increased by over 560 000 (55%).

The [[Boise metropolitan area|Boise Metropolitan Area]] (officially known as the Boise City-Nampa, ID Metropolitan Statistical Area) is Idaho's largest metropolitan area.  Other metropolitan areas in order of size are [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] and [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]].

As of 2006, six official [[United States micropolitan area|micropolitan statistical areas]] are based in Idaho. Twin Falls is the largest of these.

The [[center of population]] of Idaho is located in [[Custer County, Idaho|Custer County]], in the town of [[Stanley, Idaho|Stanley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/cenpop/statecenters.txt| title = Population and Population Centers by State |year=2000 | place = [[United States of America|US]] | publisher = Census Bureau | accessdate = December 4, 2008}}</ref>

Idaho is an important agricultural state, producing nearly one-third of the [[potato]]es grown in the United States. All three varieties of [[wheat]], dark northern spring, hard red, and soft white are grown in the state. [[Nez Perce County]] is considered a premier soft white growing locale.

Important industries in Idaho are food processing, lumber and wood products, machinery, chemical products, paper products, electronics manufacturing, silver and other mining, and tourism. The world's largest factory for barrel cheese, the raw product for [[processed cheese]] is located in [[Gooding, Idaho]]. It has a capacity of 120,000&nbsp;metric tons per year of barrel cheese and belongs to the [[Glanbia]] group.<ref>{{Citation | title = Zuivelzicht | date = April 25, 2007}}.</ref> The [[Idaho National Laboratory]] (INL) is the largest Department of Energy facility in the country, and one of the most contaminated from years of nuclear weapons related processing and haphazard storage of chemical and radioactive waste. It contains every known type of nuclear waste and receives nearly one billion dollars annually from the DOE budget for cleaning up previous contamination, and managing storage of remaining above ground nuclear waste.  INL is an important part of the eastern Idaho economy.  Idaho also is home to three facilities of [[Anheuser-Busch]] which provide a large part of the malt for [[breweries]] located across the nation.

Locally, a variety of industries are important. Outdoor recreation is a common example ranging from numerous [[snowmobile]] and downhill and [[cross-country ski]] areas in winter to the evolution of [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] as a retirement community based on mild winters, dry, year-round climate and one of the lowest median wind velocities anywhere, combined with the rivers for a wide variety of activities. Other examples would be ATK&nbsp;Corporation, which operates three ammunition and ammunition components plants in Lewiston. Two are sporting and one is defense contract. The Lewis-Clark valley has an additional independent ammunition components manufacturer and the Chipmunk rifle factory until it was purchased in 2007 by Keystone Sporting Arms and production was moved to [[Milton, Pennsylvania]]. Four of the world's six welded aluminum jet boat (for running river rapids) manufacturers are in the Lewiston-Clarkston, WAvalley. [[Wine]] grapes were grown between [[Kendrick, Idaho|Kendrick]] and Juliaetta in the [[Idaho Panhandle]] by the French [[Rothschilds]] until [[Prohibition]].  In keeping with this, while there are no large wineries or breweries in Idaho, there are numerous and growing numbers of award winning boutique wineries and microbreweries in the northern part of the state.

Today, the largest industry in Idaho is the science and technology sector.  It accounts for over 25% of the state's total revenue and over 70% of the state's exports.  Idaho's industrial economy is growing, with high-tech products leading the way. Since the late 1970s, [[Boise]] has emerged as a center for [[semiconductor manufacturing]]. Boise is the home of [[Micron Technology]], the only U.S.&nbsp;manufacturer of [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) chips. Micron at one time manufactured desktop computers, but with very limited success. [[Hewlett-Packard]] has operated a large plant in Boise since the 1970s, which is devoted primarily to [[HP LaserJet|LaserJet printers]] production.<ref>{{cite web | place = Washington, D.C., US | url = http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar04.html | title = Today in History: March 4 | work =Memory | publisher = Library of Congress |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> [[Clearwater Analytics]] is another rapidly growing investment accounting and reporting software firm headquartered in Boise, reporting on over $1 trillion in assets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://clearwater-analytics.com/about | title = About Clearwater | date = 2014}}</ref> [[ON Semiconductor]], whose worldwide headquarters in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], is a widely recognized innovator in modern integrated mixed-signal semiconductor products, mixed-signal foundry services, and structured digital products.

[[Sun Microsystems]] (now a part of [[Oracle Corporation]]) has two offices in Boise and a parts depot in Pocatello. Sun brings $4&nbsp;million in annual salaries and over $300&nbsp;million of revenue to the state each year.

A number of [[Fortune 500]] companies started in or trace their roots to Idaho, including [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] in [[American Falls, Idaho|American Falls]], [[Albertsons (SuperValu)|Albertsons]] in Boise, [[JR Simplot]] across southern Idaho, and [[Potlatch Corp.]] in Lewiston. Zimmerly Air Transport in Lewiston-Clarkston was one of the five companies in the merger centered around [[Varney Air Lines]] of [[Pasco, Washington]], which became [[United Airlines]] and subsequently Varney Air Group that became [[Continental Airlines]].

The state personal [[income tax]] ranges from 1.6% to 7.8% in eight income brackets. Idahoans may apply for state [[tax credit]]s for taxes paid to other states, as well as for donations to Idaho state educational entities and some nonprofit youth and rehabilitation facilities.

The state [[sales tax]] is 6% with a very limited, selective local option up to 6.5%. Sales tax applies to the sale, rental or lease of tangible personal property and some services. Food is taxed, but [[prescription drug]]s are not. Hotel, [[motel]], and [[campground]] accommodations are taxed at a higher rate (7% to 11%). Some jurisdictions impose local option sales tax.

The [[sales tax]] was introduced at 3% in 1965, easily approved by voters,<ref name=csrv>{{cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kw0zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rugDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6680%2C2966915 |newspaper = Spokesman-Review |agency=Associated Press|title=Conservatism given credit by Samuelson|date= November 10, 1966|page = 1}}</ref> where it remained until 1983.<ref name=stxhis>{{cite web|url=http://tax.idaho.gov/i-1023.cfm#sub3 | publisher =State of Idaho|title=Sales tax rate history|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref>

==Energy ==
[[File:Average Fuel Mix.png|thumb|Average Fuel Mix (2011-2015)]]

The energy landscape of Idaho is favorable to the development of [[renewable energy]] systems. The state is rich in renewable energy resources but has limited fossil fuel resources. The [[Snake River Plain]] and smaller river basins provide Idaho with some of the best [[hydroelectric power]] resources in the nation and its geologically active mountain areas have significant [[geothermal power]] and [[wind power]] potential. These realities have shaped much of the state's current energy landscape.

Most of the energy consumed in Idaho is imported from other states. Imports account for more than 80% of total energy consumption, including all of Idaho's natural gas and petroleum supplies and more than half of its electricity.  Of the electricity consumed in Idaho in 2005, 48% came from hydroelectricity, 42% was generated by burning coal and 9% was generated by burning natural gas.  The remainder came from other renewable sources such as wind.<ref name="2007 Idaho Energy Plan">{{cite web | title = 2007 Idaho Energy Plan | publisher = Idaho Legislative Council Interim Committee on Energy, Environment and Technology | year = 2007 | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.energy.idaho.gov/informationresources/d/energy_plan_2007.pdf | accessdate = November 30, 2010}}</ref>

The state's numerous river basins allow hydroelectric power plants to provide 556,000&nbsp;MWh, which amounts to about three-fourths of Idaho's electricity generated in the state. Washington State provides most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two major pipeline systems supplying the state. Although the state relies on out-of-state sources for its entire natural gas supply, it uses natural gas-fired plants to generate 127,000&nbsp;MWh, or about ten percent of its output. Coal-fired generation and the state's small array of wind turbines supplies the remainder of the state's electricity output. The state produces 739,000&nbsp;MWh but still needs to import half of its electricity from out-of-state to meet demand.<ref name="Idaho Energy Profile">{{cite web | title = Idaho Energy Profile | publisher = Energy Information Administration | year = 2009 | url = http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=ID | accessdate = June 2, 2007}}</ref>

While Idaho's 515&nbsp;trillion [[BTU]] total energy consumption is low compared with other states and represents just 0.5% of United States consumption, the state also has the nation's 11th smallest population, 1.5&nbsp;million, so its per capita energy consumption of 352&nbsp;million Btu is currently just above the national average of 333&nbsp;million Btu.<ref name= "Idaho Energy Profile" /> As the 13th‑largest state in terms of land area (83,570 sq. mi=53,485,000ac), distance creates the additional problem of "line loss".  When the length of an electrical transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electric current passing through it is also doubled.

In addition, Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States with the population expected to increase by 31% from 2008 to 2030.<ref>{{cite web|title=Idaho Strategic Energy Alliance Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Idaho Strategic Energy Alliance |year=2009 |url=http://www.energy.idaho.gov/idahostrategicenergyalliance/d/isea_faq.pdf |accessdate=June 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090416044506/http://energy.idaho.gov/idahostrategicenergyalliance/d/isea_faq.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2009 }}</ref>  This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, further straining Idaho's finite hydroelectric resources.<ref>{{cite web | title = FAQ | publisher = Idaho Energy Complex | year = 2009 | url = http://idahoenergycomplex.org/faq.htm | accessdate = June 2, 2007}}</ref>

The [[Idaho Transportation Department]] is the [[government agency]] responsible for Idaho's transportation infrastructure, including [[Maintenance, repair and operations|operations and maintenance]] as well as planning for future needs. The agency is also responsible for overseeing the disbursement of [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal]], state, and [[Grant (money)|grant]] [[funding]] for the transportation programs of the state.<ref name="faq">{{Cite journal | title = FAQ | publisher = ITD | year = 2007 | url = http://itd.idaho.gov/NewsAndInfo/faqs.htm | accessdate = April 22, 2007 | quote= The transportation department also oversees federal grants to 15 rural and urban public transportation systems, provides state rail planning and rail-project development and supports bicycle and pedestrian projects. | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Highways===

Idaho is among the few states in the nation without a major freeway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in the south and [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]] in the north. [[U.S. Route 95 in Idaho|U.S. Route&nbsp;95]] (US-95) links the two ends of the state, but like many other highways in Idaho, it is badly in need of repair and upgrade. In 2007, the [[Idaho Transportation Department]] stated that the state's highway infrastructure faces a $200&nbsp;million per year shortfall in maintenance and upgrades. [[Interstate 84 in Idaho|I-84]] is the main highway linking the southeast and southwest portions of the state, along with [[Interstate 86 (Idaho)|I-86]] and [[Interstate 15 in Idaho|I-15]].{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

===Airports===
Major airports include the [[Boise Airport]] serving the southwest region of Idaho, and the [[Spokane International Airport]] (located in [[Spokane, Washington]]), which serves northern Idaho. Other airports with scheduled service are the [[Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport]] serving the [[Palouse]]; the [[Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport]], serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and north central and west central Idaho; The [[Magic Valley Regional Airport]] in Twin Falls; the [[Idaho Falls Regional Airport]]; and the [[Pocatello Regional Airport]].{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

===Railroads===
Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads. The [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] (BNSF) connects the [[Idaho Panhandle]] with [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] to the west, and [[Minneapolis]] and Chicago to the east. The [[BNSF]] travels through [[Kootenai County, Idaho|Kootenai]], [[Bonner County, Idaho|Bonner]], and [[Boundary County, Idaho|Boundary]] counties.  The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] crosses North Idaho entering from Canada through [[Boundary County, Idaho|Boundary]] and [[Bonner County, Idaho|Bonner]], and proceeding to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]. [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] uses [[Union Pacific Railroad]] tracks in North Idaho carrying products from [[Alberta, Canada|Alberta]] to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. [[Amtrak]]'s Empire Builder crosses northern Idaho, with its only stop being in [[Sandpoint, Idaho|Sandpoint]]. [[Montana Rail Link]] also operates between [[Billings, Montana]] and [[Sandpoint, Idaho]].{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] also crosses southern Idaho traveling between Portland, Oregon, Green River, [[Wyoming]], and [[Ogden, Utah]] and serves [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], and [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]].  There has been a recent call to return Amtrak service to southern Idaho.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

===Ports===
The Port of [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] is the farthest inland Pacific port on the west coast. A series of dams and locks on the [[Snake River]] and [[Columbia River]] facilitate barge travel from Lewiston to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], where goods are loaded on ocean-going vessels.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

==Law and government==
[[File:Boise Idaho.jpg|thumb|The [[Idaho State Capitol]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].]]

===State constitution===
The constitution of Idaho is roughly modeled on the national constitution with several additions. The constitution defines the form and functions of the state government, and may be amended through [[plebiscite]]. Notably, the state constitution presently requires the state government to maintain a balanced budget. As result, Idaho has limited debt (construction bonds, etc.).

===Idaho Code===
All of Idaho's state laws are contained in the Idaho Code. The code is amended through the Legislature with the approval of the governor. Idaho still operates under its original (1889) state constitution.

===State government===
The constitution of Idaho provides for three branches of government: the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Idaho has a [[bicameral]] legislature, elected from 35 legislative districts, each represented by one senator and two representatives.

Since 1946, statewide elected constitutional officers have been elected to four-year terms. They include: [[List of Governors of Idaho|Governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Idaho|Lieutenant Governor]], [[Secretary of State of Idaho|Secretary of State]], Controller (Auditor before 1994), Treasurer, Attorney General, and Superintendent of Public Instruction.

Last contested in 1966, Inspector of Mines was an original elected constitutional office. Afterward it was an appointed position and ultimately done away with entirely in 1974.

Idaho's government has an [[Alcoholic beverage control state|alcohol monopoly]].

====Executive branch====
{{Further |List of Governors of Idaho}}
{{Further |Lieutenant Governor of Idaho}}
{{Further |Secretary of State of Idaho}}
The governor of Idaho serves a four-year term, and is elected during what is nationally referred to as midterm elections. As such, the governor is not elected in the same election year as the president of the United States. The current governor is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[C. L. Otter|CL&nbsp;"Butch" Otter]], who was elected in 2006, and re-elected in 2010 and 2014.

====Legislative branch====
{{Main |Idaho Legislature}}
Idaho's [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]] is part-time. However, the session may be extended if necessary, and often is. Because of this, Idaho's legislators are considered "citizen legislators", meaning that their position as a legislator is not their main occupation.

Terms for both the [[Idaho Senate|Senate]] and [[Idaho House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] are two years. Legislative elections occur every even numbered year.

The Idaho Legislature has been continuously controlled by the Republican Party since the late&nbsp;1950s, although Democratic legislators are routinely elected from [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], [[Blaine County, Idaho|Blaine County]] and the northern Panhandle.

''See also [[List of Idaho senators and representatives]]''

====Judicial branch====
{{Main |Courts of Idaho}}
The highest court in Idaho is the [[Idaho Supreme Court]].  There is also an intermediate [[appellate court]], the [[Idaho Court of Appeals]], which hears cases assigned to it from the Supreme Court.  The state's District Courts serve seven judicial districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc.idaho.gov/district.htm |title=Idaho District Court Websites |publisher=ISC | place = ID |accessdate=December 17, 2008}}</ref>

====Counties====
[[File:Idaho map counties.svg|300px|right|Map of all Idaho's counties.]]
Idaho is divided into political jurisdictions designated as ''[[County (United States)|counties]]''.  Since 1919 there are 44&nbsp;counties in the state, ranging in size from 410 to 8 502 square miles (1 062 to 22 020 square kilometers).

Total Counties: 44. Total 2008 Population Est.: 1 523 816. Total Area: {{convert |87530|sqmi|km2}}.

Three counties were first designated as such by the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1861;<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.idahohistory.net/pierce.html |title= Pierce |publisher=Idaho History |date=July 7, 2010 | accessdate =July 30, 2010}}</ref> they were subsequently redesignated as Idaho counties in 1864. The 1861 Nez Percé county has since been broken up into Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai, and Clearwater counties.

Idaho license plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county's name. Where a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number accompanies precedingly in alphabetical order. This reflects an anomalous coincidental situation wherein 10&nbsp;counties begin with B, seven with C and four with L, which is 21 of the 44&nbsp;counties.

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many Midwestern and Southern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] moved to the Idaho Territory. As a result, the early territorial legislatures were solidly Democrat-controlled. In contrast, most of the territorial governors were appointed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidents and were Republicans themselves. This led to sometimes-bitter clashes between the two parties, including a range war with the Democrats backing the sheepherders and the Republicans the cattlemen. That ended with the [[Jack Davis (prospector)|"Diamondfield" Jack Davis]] murder trial. In the 1880s, Republicans became more prominent in local politics.

In 1864, Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and the state constitution from a locked safe, and took them to Boise.  This effectively moved the capital from where they were stored ([[Lewiston, Idaho]]) to the current capital Boise, Idaho.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idahoptv.org/capitoloflight/article-05.cfm|title=Capitol Move or Theft? – Essays – Capitol of Light (Idaho Public Television)|publisher=}}</ref>

Since statehood, the Republican Party has usually been the dominant party in Idaho, as there was a polar shift in social and political stance between the two parties, when the Democrats became more liberal and the Republicans more conservative. At one time, Idaho had two Democratic parties, one being the mainstream and the other called the Anti-Mormon Democrats, lasting into the early 20th century. In the 1890s and early 1900s, the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] enjoyed prominence while the Democratic Party maintained a brief dominance in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]]. Since World War II, most statewide elected officials have been Republicans. The last time the Democratic Party held a majority in either house of the state legislature was the House of Representatives in 1958 by one seat. However, Democrats did hold the governorship from 1971 to 1995, despite the state's Republican tilt.

Idaho Congressional delegations have also been generally Republican since statehood. Several Idaho Democrats have had electoral success in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] over the years, but the [[United States Senate|Senate]] delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades. Several Idaho Republicans, including current Senator [[Mike Crapo]], have won reelection to the Senate, but only [[Frank Church]] has won reelection as a Democrat. Church was the last Idaho Democrat to win a U.S.&nbsp;Senate race, in 1974. [[Walt Minnick]]'s 2008 win in the [[Idaho's 1st congressional district|First Congressional District]] was the state's first Democratic Congressional victory in 16&nbsp;years.

In modern times, Idaho has been a reliably Republican state in presidential politics as well.  It has not supported a Democrat for [[president of the United States|president]] since 1964. Even in that election, [[Lyndon Johnson]] defeated [[Barry Goldwater]] in the state by fewer than two percentage points, compared to a landslide nationally.  In 2004, Republican [[George W. Bush]] carried Idaho by a margin of 38 percentage points and with 68.4% of the vote, winning in 43 of 44 counties. Only [[Blaine County, Idaho|Blaine County]], which contains the [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] ski resort, supported [[John Kerry]], who owns a home in the area. In 2008 [[Barack Obama]]'s 36.1&nbsp;percent<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.idsos.state.id.us/elect/RESULTS/2008/general/tot_stwd.htm | place = ID | publisher = Secretary of State Election Division | date = November 4, 2008 | title = General Election Results}}.</ref> showing was the best for a Democratic presidential candidate in Idaho since 1976. However, Republican margins were narrower in 1992 and 1996.

In the 2006 elections, Republicans, led by gubernatorial candidate [[C. L. Otter|CL&nbsp;"Butch" Otter]], won all the state's constitutional offices and retained both of the state's seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. However, Democrats picked up several seats in the Idaho Legislature, notably in the Boise area.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.ncsl.org/ncsldb/elect98/profile.cfm?yearsel=2006&statesel=ID |publisher=NCSL |title=Elections 1 998 |type=profile |year=2006 |contribution=ID |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130928092721/http://www.ncsl.org/ncsldb/elect98/profile.cfm?yearsel=2006&statesel=ID |archivedate=28 September 2013 }}</ref>

Republicans lost one of the House seats in 2008 to Minnick, but Republican [[Jim Risch]] retained Larry Craig's Senate seat for the GOP by a comfortable margin.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.sos.idaho.gov/ELECT/results/ENR/statewide_total.html |year=2008 |contribution=Statewide totals |title=Election |type=results |place=ID |publisher=State government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20150310134707/http://www.sos.idaho.gov/elect/results/ENR/statewide_total.html |archivedate=10 March 2015 }}</ref> Minnick lost his seat in the 2010 election to Republican State Rep.
