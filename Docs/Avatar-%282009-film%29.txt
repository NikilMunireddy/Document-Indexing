To explore Pandora's [[biosphere]], scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former [[United States Marine|Marine]], replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a [[Pandoran biosphere#Fauna|thanator]] and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.

[[Colonel]] Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's [[private military company|private security force]], promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<ref name="Script25">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxscreenings.com/media/pdf/JamesCameronAVATAR.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5q2mqY36B |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=Avatar |page=25|accessdate=February 9, 2010 |last=Cameron |first=James |work=Avatar Screenings |publisher=Fox and its Related Entities}} [http://www.webcitation.org/5nQAunHrW Archived version {{Nowrap|February 9}}, 2010]</ref> on grounds that it stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an [[wikt:outpost|outpost]]. Over three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<ref name="Script8and15">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxscreenings.com/media/pdf/JamesCameronAVATAR.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5q2mqY36B |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=Avatar |pages=8 and 15|accessdate=February 9, 2010 |last=Cameron |first=James |work=Avatar Screenings |publisher=Fox and its Related Entities}} [http://www.webcitation.org/5nQAunHrW Archived version {{Nowrap|February 9}}, 2010]</ref> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.

Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the [[biological neural network]] native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, carries them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape, Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.

To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred [[Fictional universe in Avatar#The Tree of Souls|Tree of Souls]] and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can complete.

Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, who acts as Jake's translator, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a [[Preemptive war|pre-emptive strike]] against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection to the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.

During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when [[Characters and wildlife in Avatar#Fauna|Pandoran wildlife]] unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Then Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch escapes from his own damaged aircraft, wearing an [[mecha|AMP suit]] and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch then prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.

With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, Max (another scientist), and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is transferred<!-- NOTE: AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION, IT WAS DECIDED ''not'' TO USE THE WORDS "SOUL" OR "CONSCIOUSNESS" HERE, AS BOTH RAISED OBJECTIONS. --> permanently into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.

He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a ''[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]'' cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10&nbsp;million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for ''Avatar'', which he showed to Fox executives in {{Nowrap|October 2005}}.<ref name="businessweek">{{cite news|last=Grover |first=R |author2=Lowry, T. |author3=White, M. |title=King of the World (Again)|date=January 21, 2010|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_05/b4165048396178.htm|pages = 1–4| accessdate = January 26, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125173417/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_05/b4165048396178.htm| archivedate=January 25, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref>

From January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their [[Na'vi language|language]] was created by Dr. [[Paul Frommer]], a linguist at [[University of Southern California|USC]].<ref name="QA" /> The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's [[phoneme]]s include [[ejective consonant]]s (such as the "kx" in "skxawng") that are found in the [[Amharic]] language of [[Ethiopia]], and the initial "ng" that Cameron may have taken from New Zealand [[Māori language|Māori]].<ref name="radionz1" /> Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's [[Scenic design|set designers]] met with Jodie S.

From 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator [[Wayne Barlowe]] and renowned concept artist [[Jordu Schell]], to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://io9.com/5354315/avatar-concept-designer-reveals-the-secrets-of-the-navi|title = Avatar Concept Designer Reveals the Secrets of the Na'vi|work = [[io9]]|accessdate = April 20, 2010}}</ref> often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home.<ref>{{cite news | first1 = Neil | last1 = Kendricks|url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/07/cameron-the-science-geek-who-became-a-movie-titan/|title = Cameron, the Science Geek Who Became a Movie Titan for the Ages|work = [[U-T San Diego]]|date = March 7, 2010|accessdate = April 20, 2010}}</ref> In {{Nowrap|July 2006}}, Cameron announced that he would film ''Avatar'' for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by {{Nowrap|February 2007}}.<ref name="extravaganza">{{cite news|first1=Sheigh | last1=Crabtree|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/columns/film_reporter_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002801137 |title=Cameron comes back with CG extravaganza|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 7, 2006|accessdate=October 18, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060814194411/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/columns/film_reporter_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002801137 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = August 14, 2006}}</ref> The following August, the visual effects studio [[Weta Digital]] signed on to help Cameron produce ''Avatar''.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Lynn | last1 = Smith|title=Special-Effects Giant Signs on for 'Avatar'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 4, 2006}}</ref> [[Stan Winston]], who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined ''Avatar'' to help with the film's designs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Jody|author2=James Cameron|title=The Winston Effect|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|date=October 2006|isbn=1-84576-150-2|accessdate=December 22, 2006}}</ref> [[Production design]] for the film took several years.

While these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to ''Avatar'' because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, ''Titanic'', even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped.<ref name="businessweek" /> Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer [[Jon Landau (film producer)|Jon Landau]]'s office to represent the film's uncertain future.<ref name="businessweek" /> In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron "in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film," so he began shopping it around to other studios, and showed his proof-of-concept to [[Dick Cook]] (then chairman of the [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]).<ref name="businessweek" /> However, when [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] attempted to take over, Fox exercised its [[right of first refusal]].<ref name="businessweek" /> In {{Nowrap|October 2006}}, Fox finally agreed to commit to making ''Avatar'' after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237&nbsp;million budget.<ref name="businessweek" /> After Fox accepted ''Avatar'', one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, "I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you ''can'' do this&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of Avatar |last=Duncan |first=Jody |author2=Lisa Fitzpatrick|year=2010|publisher=[[Abrams Books]]|location=United States |isbn=0-8109-9706-1 |page=52}}</ref>

In December 2006, Cameron described ''Avatar'' as "a futuristic tale set on a planet 200&nbsp;years hence&nbsp;... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling".<ref name="king" /> The {{Nowrap|January 2007}} press release described the film as "an emotional journey of redemption and revolution" and said the story is of "a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in [[biodiversity]], who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of [[wikt:phantasmagoria|phantasmagorical]] plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.<ref name="starts" />

Estimates put the cost of the film at about $280–310&nbsp;million to produce and an estimated $150&nbsp;million for marketing, noting that about $30&nbsp;million in [[tax credit]]s will lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.<ref name="www.nytimes.com" /><ref name="latimes budget" /><ref name="vanityfair">{{cite news |last=Keegan | first = R. |title=How Much Did Avatar Really Cost? |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/12/how-much-did-avatar-really-cost.html |date=December 3, 2009 |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=December 23, 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114015407/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/12/how-much-did-avatar-really-cost.html| archivedate=January 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> A studio spokesperson said that the budget was "$237&nbsp;million, with $150&nbsp;million for promotion, end of story."<ref name="Patten (2009)">{{cite news |last=Patten | first = D. |title='Avatar's' True Cost&nbsp;– and Consequences|url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/true-cost-and-consequences-avatar-11206?page=1 |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher=The Wrap |accessdate=December 12, 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5m4EySibe | archivedate = December 16, 2009 }}</ref>

Cameron said that he wanted to make "something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that" but also have a conscience "that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man".

Cameron acknowledges that ''Avatar'' implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the [[Iraq War]] and the impersonal nature of [[mechanized warfare]] in general.

A scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers.

During filming, Cameron made use of his [[virtual camera system]], a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action.

To film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a "simulcam" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in [[augmented reality]] and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.<ref name="makingofavatar" />

Cameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.<ref name="cnn.com" /> ''Titanic'' capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.<ref name="www.newsweek.com" /> Additionally, ''Avatar'' established itself as a "must-see" event. Gray said, "At this point, people who are going to see ''Avatar'' are going to see ''Avatar'' and would even if the slate was strong."<ref name="www.newsweek.com" /> Marketing the film as a "novelty factor" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. "It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home," stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.<ref name="www.newsweek.com" /> The "[[Academy Award|Oscar]] buzz" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. "Two-thirds of ''Titanic's'' haul was earned overseas, and ''Avatar'' [tracked] similarly&nbsp;...''Avatar'' opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets "such as Russia, where ''Titanic'' saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" with "more screens and moviegoers" than before.<ref name="www.newsweek.com" />

According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', films in 3D accumulated $1.3&nbsp;billion in 2009, "a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross". The increased ticket price&nbsp;– an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets&nbsp;– helped the film.<ref name="www.newsweek.com" /> Likewise, ''Entertainment Weekly'' attributed the film's success to 3D glasses, but also to its "astronomic [[Word of mouth|word-of-mouth]]". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but "the buzz" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.<ref name="hollywoodinsider.ew.com">{{cite news| first=Adam B.|last=Vary|title=Box Office Report: 'Avatar' is No. 1 again, soars past $1&nbsp;billion worldwide|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 2, 2010|accessdate=January 9, 2010|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/01/03/box-office-avatar-soars-past-1-billion-worldwide/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5q2lIbBX4|archivedate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> Gray said ''Avatar'' having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. "The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes," he said, "but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: ''Titanic'' (historical events), the ''Star Wars'' movies (an established film franchise), or ''The Lord of the Rings'' (literature).
