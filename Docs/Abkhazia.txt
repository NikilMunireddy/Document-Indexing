The [[Government of Georgia (country)|Georgian government]], the [[United Nations]] and the majority of the world's governments consider Abkhazia part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], although Georgia has no control over it. Georgia officially considers the area an [[autonomous republic]], the '''[[Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia|Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia]]'''.

The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the [[Georgian–Abkhazian conflict]]. The wider region formed part of the [[Soviet Union]] until 1991. As the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union began to disintegrate]] towards the end of the 1980s, ethnic tensions grew between the [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] and [[Georgian people|Georgians]] over Georgia's moves towards independence. This led to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|1992–1993 War in Abkhazia]] that resulted in a Georgian military defeat, ''de facto'' independence of Abkhazia and the mass exodus and [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population]] from Abkhazia. In spite of the [[Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces|1994 ceasefire agreement]] and years of negotiations, the status dispute has not been resolved, and despite the long-term presence of a [[UNOMIG|United Nations monitoring force]] and a [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) peacekeeping operation, the conflict has flared up on several occasions. In August 2008, the sides again fought during the [[2008 South Ossetia war|South Ossetia War]], which was followed by the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia, the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement and the termination of the UN and [[OSCE]] missions. On 28 August 2008, the [[Parliament of Georgia]] passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia a Russian-occupied territory. A major part of the international community considers Abkhazia to be [[Occupied territories of Georgia|occupied by the Russian military]].

==Name==
The Abkhazians call their state {{lang|ab|Аҧсны}} (''{{transl|ab|Apsny}}'', ''{{transl|ab|Aṗsny}}''), which is [[popular etymology|popularly etymologised]] as "a land/country of the soul",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poli.vub.ac.be/publi/ContBorders/eng/ch0103.htm|title=Contested Borders in the Caucasus : Chapter I (3/4)|author=|date=|work=vub.ac.be}}</ref>

Between 1000 and 550 BC, Greeks established trade colonies along the coast of the [[Black Sea]], in particular at [[Pitsunda|Pitiunt]] and ''[[Sukhumi|Dioscurias]]'', which was to become the capital of modern-day Abkhazia. They encountered local warlike tribes who they called [[Heniochi]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Classical authors described various peoples living in the region and the great multitude of languages they spoke.<ref>Graham Smith, Edward A.

The [[Roman Empire]] conquered Egrisi in the 1st century AD and ruled it until the 4th century, following which it regained a measure of independence, but remained within the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s sphere of influence. Although the exact time when the population of the region of Abkhazia was converted to Christianity has not been determined, it is known that the Metropolitan of [[Pityus]] participated in the First Ecumenical Council in 325 in [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Around the mid 6th century AD, the Byzantines and neighbouring [[Sassanid Persia]] fought for supremacy over Abkhazia for 20 years, known as the [[Lazic War]].

[[File:Caucasus 1124 AC en alt.svg|thumb|The Kingdom of Abkhazia was united through dynastic succession with the newly formed [[Kingdom of Georgia]] in 1008 when Bagrat II of Abkhazia became [[Bagrat III of Georgia]].]]
Abkhazia, or Abasgia in classic sources, formerly part of Colchis and later of Egrisi (Lazica) until the late 690s, was a [[princedom]] under [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] authority. [[Anacopia]] was the princedom's capital. The country was mostly Christian, with the archbishop's seat in Pityus.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1), p. 975</ref> An Arab incursion into Abkhazia led by [[Marwan II]], was repelled by [[Leon I of Abkhazia|Leon I]] jointly with his Egrisian and [[Kartli]]an allies in 736.

During this period the Georgian language replaced Greek as the language of literacy and culture.<ref>Alexei Zverev, ''Ethnic Conflicts in the Caucasus''; Graham Smith, Edward A Allworth, Vivien A Law et al., pages 56–58; ''Abkhaz'' by W.

A period of unrest ensued, which ended as Abkhazia and eastern Georgian states were [[Unified Georgian Kingdom|unified]] under a single [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgian monarchy]], ruled by [[Bagrat III of Georgia|King Bagrat III]] (who was buried in the [[Bedia Cathedral|Monastery of Bedia]] in eastern Abkhazia) at the end of the 10th century and the beginning of the 11th century.

In the 16th century, after the break-up of the Georgian Kingdom into small kingdoms and principalities, [[Principality of Abkhazia]] (nominally a vassal of the [[Kingdom of Imereti]]) emerged, ruled by the [[Shervashidze]] dynasty (also known as Sharvashidze, or Chachba).<ref name="EB"/> Since the 1570s, when the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]] occupied the fort of [[Sukhumi|Tskhumi]], Abkhazia came under the influence of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Islam. Under Ottoman rule, the majority of Abkhaz elite converted to Islam. The principality retained a degree of autonomy under Ottoman rule. Georgia signed a treaty with Russia for protection against the Ottoman Empire in 1773 and was seemingly absorbed, while Abkhazia sought  protection from Russia in 1801, but was declared as "an autonomous principality" by the Russians in 1810.<ref name=":0">Beradze, T., Topuria,K., and Khorava, B.

In the beginning of the 19th century, while the Russians and Ottomans were vying for control of the region, the rulers of Abkhazia shifted back and forth across the religious divide.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The first attempt to enter into relations with Russia was made by [[Kelesh Bey, Prince of Abkhazia|Keilash Bey]] in 1803, shortly after the incorporation of eastern Georgia into the expanding Tsarist empire (1801). However, the pro-[[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman]] orientation prevailed for a short time after his assassination by his son [[Aslan-Bey Shervashidze|Aslan-Bey]] on 2 May 1808.<ref>Mikaberidze, Alexander, "Historical Dictionary of Georgia", Rowman & Littlefield, 2015, p.84</ref> On 2 July 1810, the [[Russian Marines]] [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|stormed Sukhum-Kale]] and had Aslan-Bey replaced with his rival brother, [[Sefer Ali-Bey Shervashidze|Sefer-Bey]] (1810–1821), who had converted to Christianity and assumed the name of [[George (given name)|George]]. Abkhazia joined the Russian Empire as an autonomous principality, in 1810.<ref name=EB/> However, George’s rule, as well as that of his successors, was limited to the neighbourhood of Sukhum-Kale and the Bzyb area.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|next Russo-Turkish war]] strongly enhanced the Russian positions, leading to a further split in the Abkhaz elite, mainly along religious divisions. During the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856), Russian forces had to evacuate Abkhazia and Prince [[Mikheil, Prince of Abkhazia|Michael]] (1822–1864) seemingly switched to the Ottomans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Later on, the Russian presence strengthened and the [[Russo-Circassian War|highlanders of Western Caucasia were finally subjugated]] by Russia in 1864.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The autonomy of Abkhazia, which had functioned as a pro-Russian "buffer zone" in this troublesome region, was no longer needed by the Tsarist government and the rule of the Shervashidze came to an end; in November 1864, Prince Michael was forced to renounce his rights and resettle in [[Voronezh]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Later that same year, Abkhazia was incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]] as a special military province<ref name=EB/> of Sukhum-Kale which was transformed, in 1883, into an ''[[okrug]]'' as part of the [[Kutaisi|Kutais]] ''[[Guberniya]]''. Large numbers of Muslim Abkhazians, said to have constituted as much as 40% of the Abkhazian population, emigrated to the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1864 and 1878 with other Muslim population of Caucasus, a process known as ''[[Muhajir (Caucasus)|Muhajirism]]''.

[[File:Abkhaz and Georgian generals (A).jpg|thumb|Abkhaz and Georgian generals in the [[Imperial Russian Army]], 19th century]]

By official decision of the Russian authorities the residents of Abkhazia and Samurzakano had to study and pray in Russian.

On March 17, 1898 the synodal department of the Russian Orthodox Church of Georgia-Imereti, by order 2771, again prohibited teaching and the conduct of religious services in church schools and churches of the Sukhumi district in Georgian.  Mass protests by the Georgian population of Abkhazia and Samurzakano followed, news of which reached the Russian emperor. On September 3, 1898 the Holy Synod issued order 4880 which decreed that those parishes where the congregation was Mingrelians i.e. Georgians, conduct both church services and church education in Georgian, while Abkhazian parishes use [[Old Church Slavonic|old Slavic]]. In the Sukhumi district, this order was carried out in only three of 42 parishes.<ref name="Tsarism"/>  Tedo Sakhokia demanded the Russian authorities introduce Abkhazian and Georgian languages in church services and education.

===Post-Soviet Georgia===
{{main|Georgian–Abkhaz conflict}}
As the [[Soviet Union]] began to disintegrate at the end of the 1980s, ethnic tensions grew between the Abkhaz and Georgians over Georgia's moves towards independence. Many Abkhaz opposed this, fearing that an independent Georgia would lead to the elimination of their autonomy, and argued instead for the establishment of Abkhazia as a separate Soviet republic in its own right. In June 1988, a manifesto defending Abkhaz distinctiveness (known as the [[Abkhaz Letter]]) was sent to Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

The Georgian–Abkhaz [[1989 Sukhumi riots|dispute turned violent]] on 16 July 1989 in Sukhumi. Sixteen Georgians are said to have been killed and another 137 injured when they tried to enroll in a Georgian university instead of an Abkhaz one. After several days of violence, Soviet troops restored order in the city and blamed rival nationalist paramilitaries for provoking confrontations.

In March 1990, Georgia declared sovereignty, unilaterally nullifying treaties concluded by the Soviet government since 1921 and thereby moving closer to independence. The Republic of Georgia boycotted the 17 March 1991 [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|all-Union referendum]] on the renewal of the Soviet Union called by Gorbachev; however, 52.3% of Abkhazia's population (almost all of the ethnic non-Georgian population) took part in the referendum and voted by an overwhelming majority (98.6%) to preserve the Union.<ref>Conciliation Resources. [http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/georgia-abkhazia/chronology.php Georgia-Abkhazia, Chronology] {{wayback|url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/georgia-abkhazia/chronology.php |date=20061007200548 |df=y }}</ref><ref>Парламентская газета (''Parlamentskaya Gazeta'').

Within weeks, Georgia declared independence on 9 April 1991, under former Soviet dissident [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]]. Under Gamsakhurdia, the situation was relatively calm in Abkhazia and a power-sharing agreement was soon reached between the Abkhaz and Georgian factions, granting to the Abkhaz a certain over-representation in the local legislature.<ref>Coppieters, Bruno ''et al.''(2005), ''Statehood and security: Georgia after the Rose Revolution'', p. 384. American Academy of Arts and Sciences, ISBN 978-0-262-03343-5</ref>

Gamsakhurdia's rule was soon challenged by armed opposition groups, under the command of [[Tengiz Kitovani]], that forced him to flee the country in a military coup in January 1992. Former Soviet foreign minister and architect of the disintegration of the USSR [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] became the country's head of state, inheriting a government dominated by hard-line Georgian nationalists. He was not an ethnic nationalist but did little to avoid being seen as supporting his administration's dominant figures and the leaders of the coup that swept him to power.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

On 21 February 1992, Georgia's ruling Military Council announced that it was abolishing the Soviet-era constitution and restoring the 1921 Constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]]. Many Abkhaz interpreted this as an abolition of their autonomous status, although the 1921 constitution contained a provision for the region's autonomy.<ref>[http://www.rrc.ge/law/konstG_1921_02_21_e.htm?lawid=108&lng_3=en 1921 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Georgia]: Chapter XI, Articles 107–108 (adopted by the [[Constituent Assembly of Georgia]] 21 February 1921): "Abkhasie (district of Soukhoum), ..., which are integral parts of the Georgian Republic, enjoy autonomy in the administration of their affairs. The statute concerning the autonomy of [these] districts ... will be the object of special legislation". Regional Research Centre. Retrieved on 25 November 2008.</ref> On 23 July 1992, the Abkhaz faction in the republic's Supreme Council declared effective independence from Georgia, although the session was boycotted by ethnic Georgian deputies and the gesture went unrecognised by any other country. The Abkhaz leadership launched a campaign of ousting Georgian officials from their offices, a process which was accompanied by violence. In the meantime, the Abkhaz leader [[Vladislav Ardzinba]] intensified his ties with hardline Russian politicians and military elite and declared he was ready for a war with Georgia.<ref name=Svante>[[Svante Cornell|Svante E.

===Abkhazian War===
{{main|War in Abkhazia (1992–93)}}
In August 1992, the Georgian government accused Gamsakhurdia's supporters of kidnapping Georgia's Interior Minister and holding him captive in Abkhazia. The Georgian government dispatched 3,000 soldiers to the region, ostensibly to restore order. The Abkhaz were relatively unarmed at this time and the Georgian troops were able to march into Sukhumi with relatively little resistance<ref name=mirsky1/> and subsequently engaged in ethnically based pillage, looting, assault, and murder.<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/g/georgia/georgia953.pdf Full Report by Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch. Georgia/Abkhazia. Violations of the laws of war and Russia's role in the conflict] Helsinki, March 1995. p. 22</ref> The Abkhaz units were forced to retreat to [[Gudauta]] and [[Tkvarcheli]].

The Abkhaz military defeat was met with a hostile response by the self-styled [[Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus]], an [[umbrella group]] uniting a number of movements in the [[North Caucasus]], including elements of [[Circassians]], [[Abaza people|Abazins]], [[Chechen people|Chechens]], [[Cossacks]], [[Ossetians]] and hundreds of volunteer paramilitaries and mercenaries from Russia, including the then-little-known [[Shamil Basayev]], later a leader of the anti-Moscow Chechen secessionists.  They sided with the Abkhaz separatists to fight against the Georgian government. In the case of Basayev, it has been suggested that when he and the members of his battalion came to Abkhazia, they received training by the Russian Army (though others dispute this), presenting another possible motive.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Chechen's Story: From Unrivaled Guerrilla Leader to the Terror of Russia |date=15 September 2004 |accessdate=6 April 2011 |publisher=New York Times |author=C.J.Shivers |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/international/europe/15chechen.html?pagewanted=1 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> In September, the Abkhaz and Russian paramilitaries mounted a major [[Battle of Gagra|offensive against Gagra]] after breaking a cease-fire, which drove the Georgian forces out of large swathes of the republic. Shevardnadze's government accused Russia of giving covert military support to the rebels with the aim of "detaching from Georgia its native territory and the Georgia-Russian frontier land". 1992 ended with the rebels in control of much of Abkhazia northwest of Sukhumi.

The conflict was in stalemate until July 1993, when Abkhaz separatist militias launched an abortive attack on Georgian-held Sukhumi. They surrounded and heavily shelled the capital, where Shevardnadze was trapped. The warring sides [[Sochi agreement|agreed to a Russian-brokered truce in Sochi]] at the end of July. But the ceasefire broke down again on 16 September 1993. Abkhaz forces, with armed support from outside Abkhazia, launched attacks on Sukhumi and Ochamchira. Notwithstanding UN Security Council's call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and its condemnation of the violation of the ceasefire by the Abkhaz side, fighting continued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unomig/background.html|title=UNOMIG: United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia - Background|author=|date=|work=un.org}}</ref> After ten days of heavy fighting, Sukhumi was taken by Abkhazian forces on 27 September 1993. Shevardnadze narrowly escaped death, after vowing to stay in the city no matter what. He was forced to flee when separatist [[sniper]]s fired on the hotel where he was staying. Abkhaz, North Caucasian militants, and their allies committed numerous atrocities<ref name="hrwreport" /> against the city's remaining ethnic Georgians, in what has been dubbed the [[Sukhumi Massacre]]. The mass killings and destruction continued for two weeks, leaving thousands dead and missing.

The Abkhaz forces quickly overran the rest of Abkhazia as the Georgian government faced a second threat: an uprising by the supporters of the deposed Zviad Gamsakhurdia in the region of Mingrelia (Samegrelo). Only a small region of eastern Abkhazia, the [[Upper Abkhazia|upper Kodori gorge]], remained under Georgian control (until 2008).

During the war, gross human rights violations were reported on both sides (see [[Human Rights Watch]] report).<ref name="hrwreport" /> Georgian troops have been accused of having committed looting<ref name=mirsky1>On Ruins of Empire: Ethnicity and Nationalism in the Former Soviet Union, pg 72, by Georgiy I.

Prior to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)|1992 War]], Georgians made up nearly half of Abkhazia's population, while less than one-fifth of the population was [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]].<ref>[http://www.ethno-kavkaz.narod.ru/rnabkhazia.html Population censuses in Abkhazia: 1886, 1926, 1939, 1959, 1970, 1979, 1989, 2003] {{ru icon}}</ref> As the war progressed, confronted with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians who were unwilling to leave their homes, the Abkhaz separatists implemented the process of [[ethnic cleansing]] in order to expel and eliminate the Georgian ethnic population in Abkhazia.<ref>The Guns of August 2008, Russia's War in Georgia, Svante Cornell & Frederick Starr, p 27</ref><ref>US State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, February 1994, pp. 120</ref> The exact number of those killed during the ethnic cleansing is disputed, however, it ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 people, not including the civilians who were killed in [[War in Abkhazia (1998)|1998]] during the separatist onslaught on [[Gali District, Abkhazia|Gali]] region.<ref>Chervonnaia, Svetlana Mikhailovna.

The campaign ethnic cleansing also included Russians, Armenians, Greeks, moderate Abkhaz and other minor ethnic groups living in Abkhazia.  More than 20,000 houses owned by ethnic Georgians were destroyed. Hundreds of Schools, kindergartens, churches, hospitals, historical monuments were pillaged and destroyed.<ref>Conflict in the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia, and the Russian Shadow by S. A. Chervonnaia and Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaia, pp 12–13</ref>
Following a process of ethnic cleansing and mass expulsion, the population of Abkhazia has been reduced to 216,000, from 525,000 in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreview.info/content/washington-shames-moscow-over-occupied-abkhazia|title=World Review - Washington shames Moscow over 'occupied' Abkhazia|author=|date=|work=http://www.worldreview.info}}</ref>

Of about 250,000 Georgian refugees, some 60,000 Georgian refugees subsequently returned to Abkhazia's [[Gali District, Abkhazia|Gali district]] between 1994 and 1998, but tens of thousands were displaced again when fighting resumed in the Gali district in 1998. Nevertheless, between 40,000 and 60,000 refugees have returned to the Gali district since 1998, including persons commuting daily across the ceasefire line and those migrating seasonally in accordance with agricultural cycles.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/publ/RSDLEGAL/43a6878d4.pdf UN High Commissioner for refugees.

Sporadic acts of violence continued throughout the postwar years. Despite the peacekeeping status of the Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia, Georgian officials routinely claimed that Russian peacekeepers were inciting violence by supplying Abkhaz rebels with arms and financial support. Russian support of Abkhazia became pronounced when the [[Russian ruble]] became the [[de facto currency]] and Russia began issuing passports to the population of Abkhazia.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3261059.stm |work=BBC News | title=Regions and territories: Abkhazia | date=15 December 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420194315/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3261059.stm| archivedate= 20 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Georgia has also accused Russia of violating its airspace by sending helicopters to [[2007 Georgia helicopter attack incident|attack Georgian-controlled towns in the Kodori Gorge]].

Since independence was recognised by Russia, a series of controversial agreements were made between the Abkhazian government and the Russian Federation that leased or sold a number of key state assets and relinquished control over the borders. In May 2009 several opposition parties and war veteran groups protested against these deals complaining that they undermined state sovereignty and risked exchanging one colonial power (Georgia) for another (Russia).<ref name = rfe>{{Citation | url = http://www.rferl.org/content/Abkhaz_Leadership_Opposition_Exchange_Accusations/1738893.html | title = Abkhaz Leadership, Opposition Exchange Accusations | publisher = [[Radio Free Europe]] | newspaper = Caucasus Report | date = 24 May 2009}}.</ref> The Vice President, [[Raul Khadjimba]], resigned on 28 May saying he agreed with the criticism the opposition had made.<ref name="apress0528">{{cite news| url = http://www.apsnypress.info/news2009/May/28.htm |script-title=ru:Вице-Президент Рауль Хаджимба Ушел в Отставку | trans_title = Vice-President Raul Khajimba resigned | date=28 May 2009|publisher=[[Apsnypress]]|language=Russian|accessdate=29 May 2009}}</ref> Subsequently, a conference of opposition parties nominated Raul Khadjimba as their candidate in the December 2009 [[Abkhazian presidential election, 2009|Abkhazian presidential election]] won by [[Sergei Bagapsh]].

{{main|Abkhazian Revolution}}
In the spring of 2014, the opposition submitted an ultimatum to President [[Aleksandr Ankvab]] to dismiss the government and make radical reforms.<ref name="khadzhimba">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27607559 |title=Analysis: Unrest in Abkhazia |publisher=BBC |date=2014-05-28}}</ref> On 27 May 2014, in the centre of [[Sukhumi]], 10,000 supporters of the Abkhaz opposition gathered for a mass demonstration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gordonua.com/news/worldnews/Glava-Abhazii-otpravil-v-otstavku-pravitelstvo-posle-popytki-shturma-oppoziciey-administracii-prezidenta-24617.html |script-title=ru:Глава Абхазии отправил в отставку правительство после попытки штурма оппозицией администрации президента |date=2014-05-27|language=ru}}</ref> On the same day, Ankvab's headquarters in [[Sukhumi]] was stormed by opposition groups led by [[Raul Khadjimba]], forcing him into flight to [[Gudauta]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Georgia Abkhazia: Leader 'flees' protesters in Sukhumi|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27600919|accessdate=28 May 2014|date=28 May 2014|agency=BBC News}}</ref> The opposition claimed that the protests were sparked by poverty, but the main point of contention was President Ankvab's liberal policy towards ethnic Georgians in the [[Gali District, Abkhazia|Gali region]].

After Ankvab fled the capital, on 31 May, the [[People's Assembly of Abkhazia]] appointed parliamentary speaker [[Valery Bganba]] as acting president, declaring Ankvab unable to serve.

On 3 July 2008, the [[OSCE Parliamentary Assembly]] passed a resolution at its annual session in [[Astana]], expressing concern over Russia’s recent moves in breakaway Abkhazia. The resolution calls on the Russian authorities to refrain from maintaining ties with the breakaway regions “in any manner that would constitute a challenge to the sovereignty of Georgia” and also urges Russia “to abide by OSCE standards and generally accepted international norms with respect to the threat or use of force to resolve conflicts in relations with other participating States.”<ref>[http://www.civilgeorgia.ge/eng/article.php?id=18673 OSCE PA Concerned over Russian Moves] Civil Georgia. 3 July 2008. {{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

On 9 July 2012, the [[OSCE Parliamentary Assembly]] passed a resolution at its annual session in [[Monaco]], underlining Georgia’s territorial integrity and referring to breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia as “occupied territories”. The resolution “urges the Government and the Parliament of the Russian Federation, as well as the de facto authorities of Abkhazia, Georgia and South Ossetia, Georgia, to allow the European Union Monitoring Mission unimpeded access to the occupied territories.” It also says that the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly is “concerned about the humanitarian situation of the displaced persons both in Georgia and in the occupied territories of Abkhazia, Georgia and South Ossetia, Georgia, as well as the denial of the right of return to their places of living.” The Assembly is the parliamentary dimension of the OSCE with 320 lawmakers from the organisation’s 57 participating states, including Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscepa.org/publications/all-documents/doc_download/1258-final-declaration-english|title=Soares to visit the Caucasus next week|author=Admin|date=|work=oscepa.org}}</ref>

===Law on Occupied Territories of Georgia===
{{main|Occupied territories of Georgia}}
In late October 2008 President Saakashvili signed into law legislation on the occupied territories passed by the Georgian Parliament. The law covers the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali (territories of former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=19868&search= |title=Bill on Occupied Territories Signed into Law |publisher=Civil.ge |date=2001-07-01 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.smr.gov.ge/docs/doc216.pdf | title=THE LAW OF GEORGIA ON OCCUPIED TERRITORIES | format=PDF | date=2008-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2009/CDL(2009)004-e.asp |title=Law on occupied territories of Georgia (en.) |publisher=Venice.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref> The law spells out restrictions on free movement and economic activity in the territories. In particular, according to the law, foreign citizens should enter the two breakaway regions only through Georgia proper. Entry into Abkhazia should be carried out from the [[Zugdidi District]] and into South Ossetia from the [[Gori District]]. The major road leading to South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia passes through the Gori District.

The legislation, however, also lists "special" cases in which entry into the breakaway regions will not be regarded as illegal. It stipulates that a special permit on entry into the breakaway regions can be issued if the trip there "serves Georgia’s state interests; peaceful resolution of the conflict; de-occupation or humanitarian purposes." The law also bans any type of economic activity – entrepreneurial or non-entrepreneurial, if such activities require permits, licenses or registration in accordance with Georgian legislation. It also bans air, sea and railway communications and international transit via the regions, mineral exploration and money transfers. The provision covering economic activities is retroactive, going back to 1990.

The law says that the Russian Federation – the state which has carried out military occupation – is fully responsible for the violation of human rights in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian Federation, according to the document, is also responsible for compensation of material and moral damage inflicted on Georgian citizens, stateless persons and foreign citizens, who are in Georgia and enter the occupied territories with appropriate permits. The law also says that de facto state agencies and officials operating in the occupied territories are regarded by Georgia as illegal. The law will remain in force until "the full restoration of Georgian jurisdiction" over the breakaway regions is realised.

===Status-neutral passports===
{{see also|Abkhazian passport}}

Currently Georgia considers all residents of Abkhazia its citizens, while they see themselves as Abkhaz citizens.<ref name="Abkhazia Today"/>

In the summer of 2011 the Parliament of Georgia adopted a package of legislative amendments providing for the issuance of neutral identification and travel documents to residents of Abkhazia and the former South Ossetian autonomous province of Georgia. The document allows travelling abroad as well as enjoying social benefits existing in Georgia. The new neutral identification and travel documents were called "neutral passports".<ref name="Neutral Passports">{{cite news| url=http://en.trend.az/news/politics/2146299.html | work=Trend.AZ | title=Romania recognized neutral Georgian passports for Abkhazian and South Ossetian residents | date=2013-05-02}}</ref>

According to Georgian officials, the “neutral passports” lacked any symbols of Georgia and only bore a registration number and an individual number. Moscow argued it was Georgia’s "cunning ploy" because the passports contained Georgia’s code and the Georgian Interior Ministry as the issuing body.

Abkhazia’s Foreign Ministry expressed concerns about some countries recognising the “neutral passports.” The ministry also said an increasing number of Abkhazian residents with Russian passports were being denied [[Schengen Area|Schengen visas]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20120607/173900221.html | work=RIA Novosti | title=Moscow Blasts U.S.-Georgia 'Neutral Passports' | date=2012-06-07}}</ref>

As of May 2013, neutral documents have been recognised by Japan, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, the United States, Bulgaria, Poland, Israel, Estonia and Romania.<ref name="Neutral Passports"/>

According to Russian media, the President of Republic of Abkhazia, [[Alexander Ankvab]] threatened international organisations that accepted neutral passports, saying during a meeting with the leadership of the foreign ministry that “international organizations that suggest the so-called neutral passports, will leave Abkhazia.”<ref>{{cite web|publisher=DFWATCH STAFF |url=http://dfwatch.net/abkhazian-leader-opposed-to-neutral-passports-25286 |title=Abkhazian leader opposed to neutral passports | date=2012-01-19}}</ref>

However, on 16 April 2008, the outgoing Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] instructed his government to establish official ties with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, leading to Georgia's condemnation of what it described as an attempt at "de facto annexation"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7350442.stm Georgia angered by Russian move]. BBC News. 16 April 2008.</ref> and criticism from the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and several Western governments.<ref>[http://www.civil.ge/eng/detail.php?id=17617 In Quotes: International Reaction to Russia’s Abkhaz, S.Ossetian Move].

Later in April 2008, Russia accused Georgia of trying to exploit NATO support in order to control Abkhazia by force and announced it would increase its military presence in the region, pledging to retaliate militarily against Georgia’s efforts. The Georgian Prime Minister [[Lado Gurgenidze]] said Georgia will treat any additional troops in Abkhazia as "aggressors".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7374546.stm Georgia-Russia tensions ramped up.]. [[The BBC News]]. 30 April 2008.</ref>

In response to the Georgian [[2008 South Ossetia War|invasion of South Ossetia]], the [[Federal Assembly of Russia]] called an extraordinary session for 25 August 2008 to discuss recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4572733.ece |title=Russia to recognise breakaway region's independence |work=The Times |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=20 August 2008 |location=London |first=Tony |last=Halpin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904004911/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4572733.ece |archivedate=4 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> Following a unanimous resolution that was passed by both houses of the parliament calling on the Russian president to recognise independence of the breakaway republics,<ref>{{cite web |title=Duma calls for S.

===International involvement===
[[File:Российско-абхазская граница.jpg|thumb|Border checkpoint on the [[Psou River]]]]
The UN has played various roles during the conflict and peace process: a military role through its observer mission ([[UNOMIG]]); dual diplomatic roles through the Security Council and the appointment of a Special Envoy, succeeded by a Special Representative to the Secretary-General; a humanitarian role ([[UNHCR]] and [[UNOCHA]]); a development role ([[UNDP]]); a human rights role ([[UNHCHR]]); and a low-key capacity and confidence-building role ([[United Nations Volunteers|UNV]]). The UN’s position has been that there will be no forcible change in international borders. Any settlement must be freely negotiated and based on autonomy for Abkhazia legitimised by referendum under international observation once the multiethnic population has returned.<ref>Resolutions 849, 854, 858, 876, 881 and 892 adopted by the UN Security Council</ref> According to Western interpretations the intervention did not contravene international law since Georgia, as a sovereign state, had the right to secure order on its territory and protect its territorial integrity.

The OSCE has increasingly engaged in dialogue with officials and civil society representatives in Abkhazia, especially from [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGO)s and the [[Media in Abkhazia|media]], regarding human dimension standards in the region and is considering a presence in Gali. The OSCE expressed concern and condemnation over ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia during the 1994 [[Budapest]] Summit Decision<ref>From the Resolution of the OSCE Budapest Summit, 6 December 1994 [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/oscelisb.htm Lisbon OSCE Summit Declaration]</ref> and later at the Lisbon Summit Declaration in 1996.<ref>Lisbon Summit Declaration of the OSCE, 2–3 December 1996</ref>

The USA rejects the unilateral secession of Abkhazia and urges its integration into Georgia as an autonomous unit. In 1998 the USA announced its readiness to allocate up to $15 million for rehabilitation of infrastructure in the Gali region if substantial progress is made in the peace process. [[USAID]] has already funded some humanitarian initiatives for Abkhazia. The USA has in recent years significantly increased its military support to the Georgian armed forces but has stated that it would not condone any moves towards peace enforcement in Abkhazia.

On 22 August 2006, Senator [[Richard Lugar]], then visiting Georgia's capital Tbilisi, joined Georgian politicians in criticism of the Russian peacekeeping mission, stating that "the U.S. administration supports the Georgian government’s insistence on the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers from the conflict zones in Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali district."<ref>[http://mosnews.com/news/2006/08/22/lugarspeaks.shtml ''U.S. Senator Urges Russian Peacekeepers’ Withdrawal From Georgian Breakaway Republics.'' (MosNews)].</ref>

On 5 October 2006, [[Javier Solana]], the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] of the [[European Union]], ruled out the possibility of replacing the Russian peacekeepers with the EU force.<ref>[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?ID=16756 ''Solana fears Kosovo 'precedent' for Abkhazia, South Ossetia.'' (International Relations and Security Network)].</ref> <!--However, the Georgian parliament prepared for the vote in October 2006 which will demand the complete withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers from Abkhazia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=13827|title=Civil.Ge - Stop 'Hostile Actions,' Kremlin Official Tells Tbilisi|author=Civil Georgia|date=|work=civil.ge}}</ref>--> On 10 October 2006, EU South Caucasus envoy [[Peter Semneby]] noted that "Russia's actions in the [[2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy|Georgia spy row]] have damaged its credibility as a neutral peacekeeper in the EU's Black Sea neighbourhood."<ref>[http://euobserver.com/24/22622 ''Russia 'not neutral' in Black Sea conflict, EU says''], EUobserver, 10 October 2006.</ref>

On 13 October 2006, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution, based on a Group of Friends of the Secretary-General draft, extending the [[UNOMIG]] mission until 15 April 2007. Acknowledging that the "new and tense situation" resulted, at least in part, from the Georgian special forces' operation in the upper Kodori Valley, the resolution urged the country to ensure that no troops unauthorised by the [[agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces|Moscow ceasefire agreement]] were present in that area. It urged the leadership of the Abkhaz side to address seriously the need for a dignified, secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons and to reassure the local population in the Gali district that their residency rights and identity will be respected. The Georgian side is "once again urged to address seriously legitimate Abkhaz security concerns, to avoid steps that could be seen as threatening and to refrain from militant rhetoric and provocative actions, especially in upper Kodori Valley."

Calling on both parties to follow up on dialogue initiatives, it further urged them to comply fully with all previous agreements regarding non-violence and confidence-building, in particular those concerning the separation of forces. Regarding the disputed role of the peacekeepers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Council stressed the importance of close, effective cooperation between UNOMIG and that force and looked to all sides to continue to extend the necessary cooperation to them. At the same time, the document reaffirmed the "commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders."<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2006/sc8851.doc.htm ''Security Council extends Georgia Mission until 15 April 2007''], The UN Department of Public Information, 13 October 2006.</ref>

The [[HALO Trust]], an international non-profit organisation that specialises in the removal of the debris of war, has been active in Abkhazia since 1999 and has completed the removal of landmines in Sukhumi and Gali districts. It declared Abkhazia "mine free" in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halotrust.org/where-we-work/georgia|title=Our work in Georgia, what we do and where - The HALO Trust|author=|date=|work=The HALO Trust}}</ref>

The main NGO working in Abkhazia is the France-based international NGO [[Première-Urgence]] (PU):<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premiere-urgence.org/ |title=Première-Urgence NGO, France |publisher=Premiere-urgence.org |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref> PU has been implementing rehabilitation and economical revival programmes to support the vulnerable populations affected by the frozen conflict for almost 10 years.

Russia does not allow the [[European Union Monitoring Mission]] (EUMM) to enter Abkhazia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommentator.com/article/1272/georgia_and_russia_the_occupation_too_many_have_forgotten |title=Georgia and Russia: The occupation too many have forgotten |author=Luke Coffey |date=2010-06-01}}</ref>

===Recognition===

==Geography and climate==
{{main|Geography and climate of Abkhazia}}
[[File:Ritsa1.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Ritsa]]]]
Abkhazia covers an area of about {{convert|8660|km²|0|abbr=on}} at the western end of Georgia.<ref name=EB/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE61G15O.htm | title = FACTBOX-Key facts on Georgian rebel region Abkhazia | accessdate =7 November 2010 | date = 17 February 2010 | publisher = AlertNet | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101203163944/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE61G15O.htm| archivedate= 3 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1358/Abkhazia | title = Abkhazia | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate =7 November 2010}}</ref> The [[Caucasus Mountains]] to the north and the northeast divide Abkhazia and the Russian Federation. To the east and southeast, Abkhazia is bounded by the Georgian region of [[Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti]]; and on the south and southwest by the Black Sea.

Abkhazia is diverse geographically with lowlands stretching to the extremely mountainous north. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range runs along the region's northern border, with its spurs{{spaced ndash}}the Gagra, [[Bzyb Range|Bzyb]] and Kodori ranges{{spaced ndash}}dividing the area into a number of deep, well-watered valleys. The highest peaks of Abkhazia are in the northeast and east and several exceed {{convert|4000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Abkhazia's landscape ranges from coastal forests and citrus plantations to permanent snows and [[glaciers]] in the north of the region. Although Abkhazia's complex topographic setting has spared most of the territory from significant human development, its cultivated fertile lands produce tea, tobacco, wine and fruits, a mainstay of the local agricultural sector.

Abkhazia is richly irrigated by small rivers originating in the Caucasus Mountains. Chief of these are: [[Kodori River|Kodori]], [[Bzyb River|Bzyb]], [[Ghalidzga River|Ghalidzga]], and [[Gumista River|Gumista]]. The [[Psou River]] separates the region from Russia, and the [[Inguri River|Inguri]] serves as a boundary between Abkhazia and Georgia proper. There are several [[periglacial]] and [[crater lake|crater]] lakes in mountainous Abkhazia. [[Lake Ritsa]] is the most important of them.

[[File:Ridge view from pitsunda cape.jpg|thumb|left|View from [[Pitsunda]] cape]]
The world's deepest known cave, [[Voronya Cave|Krubera (Voronja) Cave]] ("The Crows' Cave"), is located in Abkhazia's western Caucasus mountains. The latest survey (as of September 2006) has measured the vertical extent of this cave system as {{convert|2158|m|ft|0|sp=us}} between its highest and lowest explored points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caverbob.com/wdeep.htm |title=World’s Deepest Caves List from The National Speleological Society |publisher=Caverbob.com |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528153216/http://www.caverbob.com/wdeep.htm |archivedate=28 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Because of Abkhazia's proximity to the Black Sea and the shield of the Caucasus Mountains, the region's climate is very mild. The coastal areas of the republic have a subtropical climate, where the average annual temperature in most regions is around {{convert|15|°C}}, and the average January temperature remains above freezing.<ref name=EB/> The climate at higher elevations varies from maritime mountainous to cold and summerless. Also, due to its position on the windward slopes of the Caucasus, Abkhazia receives high amounts of precipitation,<ref name=EB/> though humidity decreases further inland. The annual precipitation vacillates from {{convert|1200|-|1400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=EB/> along the coast {{convert|1700|-|3500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the higher mountainous areas. The mountains of Abkhazia receive significant amounts of snow.

The lowland regions used to be covered by swaths of [[oak]], [[beech]], and [[hornbeam]], which have since been cleared.<ref name=EB/>

There are two main entrances into Abkhazia. The southern entrance is at the [[Inguri]] bridge, a short distance from the city of [[Zugdidi]]. The northern entrance ("Psou") is in the town of [[Leselidze (town)|Leselidze]]. Owing to the situation with a recognition controversy, many foreign governments advise their citizens against travelling to Abkhazia.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029390590&a=KCountryAdvice&aid=1013618385947 Travel advice by country: Georgia].

==Politics and government==
{{main|Government of the Republic of Abkhazia|Politics of Abkhazia|Elections in Abkhazia}}
Abkhazia is a [[presidential republic]], and the second elected [[President of Abkhazia]] was [[Sergei Bagapsh]]. Bagapsh came to power following the deeply divisive [[Abkhazian presidential election, 2004|October 2004 presidential election]]. The next election was held on 12 December 2009.

The last [[Abkhazian parliamentary election, 2012|parliamentary elections]] were held on 10/24 March 2012. Ethnicities other than Abkhaz (Armenians, Russians and Georgians) are claimed to be under-represented in the Assembly.<ref name="Today" />

According to a 2010 study published by the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], the vast majority of Abkhazia's population supports independence, while a smaller number is in favour of joining the Russian Federation. Support for a reunification with Georgia is very low.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/03/20/how-people-in-south-ossetia-abkhazia-and-transnistria-feel-about-annexation-by-russia/|title=How people in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria feel about annexation by Russia|author=Gerard Toal|date=20 March 2014|work=Washington Post}}</ref> Even among ethnic Georgians, nearly 50% prefer Abkhazia to remain an independent state and less than 20% of them believe returning to Georgia is necessary, as most of them have adjusted to the current situation.

===Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia===
{{main|Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia}}
[[File:Government of Abkhazia.svg|thumb|Logo of the [[Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia]].]]
The Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia is the [[government in exile]] that Georgia recognises as the legal government of Abkhazia. This pro-Georgian government maintained a foothold on Abkhazian territory, in the upper [[Kodori Valley]] from July 2006 until it was forced out by fighting in August 2008. This government is also partly responsible for the affairs of some 250,000 [[Internally displaced persons|IDPs]], forced to leave Abkhazia following the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|War in Abkhazia]] and [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] that followed.<ref>Birgitte Refslund Sørensen, Marc Vincent (2001), ''Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced'', pp. 234–5.

Mirsky, p. 72.</ref> The current Head of the Government is [[Vakhtang Kolbaia]].

During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|War in Abkhazia]], the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia (at the time the Georgian faction of the "Council of Ministers of Abkhazia") left Abkhazia after the Abkhaz separatist forces took control of the region’s capital [[Sukhumi]] and relocated to Georgia’s capital [[Tbilisi]] where it operated as the Government of Abkhazia in exile for almost 13 years. During this period, the Government of Abkhazia in exile, led by [[Tamaz Nadareishvili]], was known for a hard-line stance towards the Abkhaz problem and frequently voiced their opinion that the solution to the conflict can be attained only through Georgia's military response to secessionism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Later, Nadareishvili's administration was implicated in some internal controversies and had not taken an active part in the politics of Abkhazia{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} until a new chairman, [[Irakli Alasania]], was appointed by [[President of Georgia]], [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], his envoy in the peace talks over Abkhazia.

The Republic of Abkhazia is divided into seven [[raion]]s named after their primary cities: [[Gagra district|Gagra]], [[Gudauta district|Gudauta]], [[Sukhumi district|Sukhumi]], [[Ochamchira district|Ochamchira]], [[Gulripshi district|Gulripshi]], [[Tkvarcheli district|Tkvarcheli]] and [[Gali (town)|Gali]]. These districts remain mostly unchanged since the breakup of the Soviet Union, with the exception of the [[Tkvarcheli district]], created in 1995 from parts of the Ochamchira and Gali districts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The President of the Republic appoints districts' heads from those elected to the districts' assemblies. There are elected village assemblies whose heads are appointed by the districts' heads.<ref name="Today"/>

The [[Georgia (country)#Regions, republics, and districts|administrative subdivision of Abkhazia used by Georgia]] is identical to the one outlined above, except for the new Tkvarcheli district.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Military==
{{main|Military of Abkhazia|Abkhazian Air Force}}
The Abkhazian Armed Forces are the military of the "Republic of Abkhazia". The basis of the Abkhazian armed forces was formed by the ethnically Abkhaz National Guard formed early in 1992. Most of the weapons come from the former Russian airborne division base in Gudauta.<ref name=Chervonnaia>Chervonnaia, Svetlana Mikhailovna.

Gothic Image Publications, 1994</ref><ref name=WhiteBookOfAbkhazia>''White Book of Abkhazia. 1992–1993 Documents, Materials, Evidences''.

The Abkhazian Armed Forces are composed of:
* The Abkhazian Land Forces with a permanent force of around 5,000, but with [[reservists]] and paramilitary personnel this may increase to up to 50,000 in times of military conflict. The exact numbers and the type of equipment used remain unverifiable.
* The Abkhazian Navy that consists of three divisions based in [[Sukhumi]], [[Ochamchire]] and [[Pitsunda]], but the Russian coast guard patrols their waters.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/12/mil-091212-rianovosti05.htm |title=Russian patrol boats arrive in Abkhazia to guard border |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref>
* The [[Abkhazian Air Force]], a small unit consisting of a few [[fighter aircraft]] and [[helicopters]].

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Abkhazia}}
The economy of Abkhazia is heavily integrated with Russia and uses the [[Russian ruble]] as its currency. Abkhazia has experienced a modest economic upswing since the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] and Russia's subsequent recognition of Abkhazia's independence. About half of Abkhazia's state budget is financed with aid money from Russia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/no-clear-frontrunner-as-abkhazia-goes-to-poll/442702.html |title=No Clear Frontrunner as Abkhazia Goes to Poll |author=Nikolaus von Twickel |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=26 Aug 2011}}</ref>

Tourism is a key industry and, according to Abkhazia's authorities, almost a million tourists (mainly from Russia) came to Abkhazia in 2007.<ref>[[Kommersant]]-Dengi, [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1020594 Тяжелая экономическая независимость] (''Hard Economical Independence''), 08.09.2008 {{ru icon}}</ref> Abkhazia also enjoys fertile lands and an abundance of agricultural products, including tea, tobacco, wine and fruits (especially [[tangerine]]s and [[hazelnut]]s). Electricity is largely supplied by the [[Inguri Dam|Inguri hydroelectric power station]] located on the Inguri River between Abkhazia and Georgia (proper) and operated jointly by both parties.

In the first half of 2012, the principal trading partners of Abkhazia were Russia (64%) and Turkey (18%).<ref name=apress6859>{{cite news|title=Основными торговыми партнерами Абхазии продолжают оставаться Россия и Турция|url=http://apsnypress.info/news/6859.html|accessdate=28 July 2012|newspaper=Apsnypress|date=27 July 2012}}</ref> The [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] economic sanctions imposed on Abkhazia in 1996 are still formally in force, but Russia announced on 6 March 2008 that it would no longer participate in them, declaring them "outdated, impeding the socio-economic development of the region, and causing unjustified hardship for the people of Abkhazia".

Despite the controversial status of the territory and its damaged infrastructure, [[tourism in Abkhazia]] grew following the Russian recognition of Abkhazian independence in 2008 due to the arrival of Russian tourists. In 2009 the number of Russian tourists in Abkhazia increased by 20% and the total number of Russian tourists reached 1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abkhasia.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/165554/|title=Кавказский Узел - В 2009 году туристический поток в Абхазии увеличился на 20%|author=|date=|work=Кавказский Узел}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chechnya.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/164334/|title=Кавказский Узел - В 2009 году Абхазию посетило около миллиона туристов|author=|date=|work=Кавказский Узел}}</ref> Low prices and an absence of any visa requirements attracts Russian tourists especially those who cannot afford vacations in [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Bulgaria]] and other popular Russian tourist destinations. After the tourist boom many Russian businesses began to invest money in Abkhazian tourist infrastructure. With the main highway of the country being rebuilt in 2014 many damaged hotels in Gagra are either being restored or demolished.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Abkhazia}}
According to the last census in 2011 Abkhazia has 240,705 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apsnypress.info/news/5084.html|title=Новости|author=|date=|work=apsnypress.info}}</ref>

The exact size of Abkhazia's population was unclear.

===Ethnicity===
The ethnic composition of Abkhazia has played a central role in the [[Georgian-Abkhazian conflict]] and is equally contested. The demographics of Abkhazia were very strongly affected by the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|1992–1993 War with Georgia]], which saw the expulsion and flight of over half of the republic's population, measuring 525,061 in the 1989 census.<ref name=censuses/>

The population of Abkhazia remains ethnically very diverse, even after the 1992–1993 War. At present the population of Abkhazia is mainly made up of ethnic [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], [[Georgians]] (mostly [[Mingrelians]]), [[Armenians in Abkhazia|Hemshin Armenians]], and [[Russians]]. Other nationalities include [[Ukrainians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Greeks]], [[Ossetians]], [[Tatars]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], and [[Romani people|Roma]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Human Rights Watch |year=2011 |title=Living in Limbo: The Rights of Ethnic Georgian Returnees to the Gali District of Abkhazia |place= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=1-56432-790-6 |page=9 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

During the Soviet Union, the Russian, Armenian and Georgian population grew faster than the Abkhaz, due to the large-scale migration enforced especially under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Lavrenty Beria]].<ref name=jrl>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/8226.cfm |title=JRL Research & Analytical Supplement ~ JRL 8226, Issue No. 24 • May 2004.

Later, in the 1950s and 1960s, [[Vazgen I]] and the Armenian church encouraged and funded the migration of Armenians to Abkhazia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Currently, Armenians are the second largest minority group in Abkhazia (closely matching the Georgians), although their numbers decreased dramatically from 77,000 in the 1989 census to 45,000 in the 2003 census.

===Diaspora===
Thousands of Abkhaz, known as [[Ethnic Cleansing of Circassians|''muhajirun'']], fled Abkhazia for the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the mid-19th century after resisting the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] conquest of the Caucasus. Today, Turkey is home to the world's largest Abkhaz diaspora community. Size estimates vary – Diaspora leaders say 1 million people; Abkhaz estimates range from 150,000 to 500,000.<ref>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav030909b.shtml Abkhazia's Diaspora: Dreaming of Home].

===Nationality issues===

====Adoption of Russian nationality====
After the breakup of Soviet Union, Abkhazians continued to be the citizens of Soviet Union and kept [[Soviet passport]]s even after a decade.<ref name="Soviet Abkhazians">{{cite web|publisher=Institute for War & Peace Reporting |author=Inal Khashig |url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/abkhaz-rush-russian-passports |title=Abkhaz Rush For Russian Passports | date=2002-06-27}}</ref>

Before 2002, Russian law allowed residents of former Soviet Union to apply for citizenship if they had not become citizens of their newly independent states. The procedure was extremely complex. The new [[citizenship of Russia|citizenship law of Russia]] adopted on 31 May 2002 introduced a simplified procedure of citizenship acquisition for former citizens of the Soviet Union regardless of their place of residence. In Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the application process was simplified even further, and people could apply even without leaving their homes. Russian nationalist non-governmental organisations with close ties to Russian officialdom simply took their papers to a nearby Russian city for processing.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://www.loc.gov/law/help/russian-georgia-war.php |title= Russian Federation: Legal Aspects of War in Georgia | date=}}</ref>

Abkhazians began mass acquisition of Russian passports in 2002. It is reported that the public organisation the Congress of Russian Communities of Abkhazia started collecting Abkhazians’ Soviet-era travel documents. It then sent them to a consular department specially set up by [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] officials in the city of [[Sochi]]. After they were checked, Abkhazian applicants were granted Russian citizenship. By June 25 of 2002, an estimated 150,000 people in Abkhazia had acquired the new passports, joining 50,000 who already possessed Russian citizenship. The Sukhum authorities, although officially not involved in the registration for Russian nationality process, openly encouraged it. Government officials said privately that President Putin’s administration agreed with the passport acquisition during Abkhazia’s prime minister [[Anri Jergenia|Djergenia]]'s visit to Moscow in May 2002.<ref name="Soviet Abkhazians"/>

The [[passportisation]] caused outrage in Tbilisi, worsening its already shaky relations with Russia. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia|Georgian Foreign Ministry]] issued a statement insisting that Abkhazians were citizens of Georgia and calling the passport allocation an 
“unprecedented illegal campaign”. President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] said that he would be asking his Russian counterpart, [[Vladimir Putin]], for an explanation. The speaker of parliament [[Nino Burjanadze]] said that she would raise the matter at the forthcoming OSCE parliamentary assembly.<ref name="Soviet Abkhazians"/>

February 1, 2011 was the last day in the post-Soviet era when a passport of [[USSR]] was valid for crossing the Russian-Abkhaz border. According to the staff of Abkhazia's passport and visa service, there are about 2-3 thousand mostly elderly people left with Soviet passports who had no chance of acquiring new documents. These people were not able to get Russian citizenship. But they can first get an internal Abkhaz passport and then a travelling passport to visit Russia.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=GeorgiaTimes |author=Anton Krivenuk |url=http://www.georgiatimes.info/en/analysis/50360.html |title=Abkhaz Rush For Russian Passports | date=2011-02-01}}</ref>

====Issue of ethnic Georgians====
In 2005, citing the need to integrate ethnic Georgian residents of eastern districts of Abkhazia, the then-leadership of Abkhazia showed signs of a softening stance towards granting of citizenship to the residents of Gali, Ochamchire and Tkvarcheli districts.<ref name="Abkhaz Parliament">{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26487 |title=Abkhaz Decision on Passports Leaves Many Georgians in Gali Worried |publisher=Civil.ge |author=Olesya Vartanyan |date=2013-09-24}}</ref>

According to the Abkhazian law on citizenship, [[Abkhaz people|ethnic Abkhazian]]s, regardless of place of residence, can become Abkhaz citizens. Those who are not ethnic Abkhazians are eligible for citizenship if they lived in Abkhazia for at least five years prior to adoption of act of independence in October, 1999. This provision aimed at creating a legal hurdle in obtaining Abkhaz passports for those ethnic Georgians who fled Abkhazia as a result of 1992-1993 armed conflict and who then returned to the Gali district. Abkhazian legislation forbids citizens of Abkhazia from holding [[dual citizenship]] with any other state apart from Russia.<ref name="Abkhaz Opposition">{{cite web| url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26053 |title=Sokhumi Suspends Issuing Abkhaz Passports to Ethnic Georgians | publisher=Civil.ge |date=2013-05-14}}</ref>

Ethnic Georgians who have returned to the Gali district and want to obtain Abkhaz passports, according to Abkhazian law, should undergo lengthy procedures which also include a requirement to submit documented proof that they renounced their Georgian citizenship.<ref name="Abkhaz Opposition"/> President Bagapsh was inclined to regard Georgians in Gali as "Georgianised Abkhazians." According to Bagapsh, these were actually ethnic Abkhaz people who were "Georgianised" during the long process of the Georgianisation of Abkhazia that culminated during the rule of Joseph Stalin and Lavrenti Beria. So in his official speeches, Bagapsh often added the Gali Georgians to population estimates of the Abkhaz, disregarding the fact that they still thought of themselves as ethnic Georgians rather than Abkhaz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/524e99f14.html |title=Authorities in Abkhazia Plan to Strip Georgians of Citizenship |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |author=Giorgi Menabde |date=2013-10-03}}</ref>

In early 2013 the process of passportisation of ethnic Georgians came under the scrutiny of Abkhaz opposition groups who turned this issue into one of the central topics of the breakaway region’s internal politics, and issuing of passports was suspended in May. Opposition claimed that “massive” passportisation involving granting citizenship to ethnic Georgians in eastern districts was fraught with risk of “losing sovereignty and territorial integrity.” According to Apsnipress, [[Stanislav Lakoba]], secretary of Abkhaz security council, said that “We are facing the process of the total Georgianization of Abkhazia.”<ref name="Abkhaz Opposition"/>

According to reports in mid-2013, the directors of Georgian schools in Gali were ordered by Sukhumi authorities to transfer their schools to Russian-language education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abkhazeti.info/abkhazia/2013/1377048996.php|title=Сухуми требует от директоров грузинских школ перехода на русскоязычное обучение|author=|date=|work=Сухуми требует от директоров грузинских школ перехода на русскоязычное обучение}}</ref>

On September 18, 2013, the Parliament of Republic of Abkhazia adopted a resolution instructing the prosecutor’s office to carry out a “sweeping” probe into passport offices of the interior ministry and where wrongdoings were found in the distribution of passports to refer those violations to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for “annulment of illegally issued passports.” Abkhaz officials announced that a significant number of residents of Gali, Ochamchire and Tkvarcheli districts received Abkhaz passports while at the same time retaining their Georgian citizenship, which constituted a "violation of the law on Abkhaz citizenship". According to the Abkhaz officials, more than 26,000 passports were distributed in Gali, Tkvarcheli and Ochamchire districts, including about 23,000 of which were given out since Russian recognition of Abkhazia's independence in August, 2008. These political debates have caused concerns in the ethnic Georgian population of Abkhazia, who reside mainly in Gali district, that they would be stripped of Abkhazian citizenship and thus forced to leave Abkhazia again.<ref name="Abkhaz Parliament"/>

In October 2013 Alexander Ankvab signed a document ordering the firing Stanislav Lakoba. The document did not state any reason for the decision but Lakoba saw it as related to his political position on granting citizenship to Georgians living in Gali. Lakoba claimed that, according to data from the Abkhaz Security Council, 129 local people in Gali fought against Abkhazia. Local political parties and the coordination council of civil organisations expressed concern about Lakoba’s dismissal. They claimed that, by dismissing him, the president "made an illegal process legal" – giving Abkhazian passports to Georgian citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/top-abkhazian-security-official-dismissed-25881 | title=Top Abkhazian security official dismissed | publisher=DFWATCH STAFF |date=2013-10-30}}</ref>

The written [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] literature appeared relatively recently, in the beginning of the 20th century. However, Abkhaz share the [[Nart saga]]s, a series of tales about mythical heroes, with other Caucasian peoples. The [[Abkhaz alphabet]] was created in the 19th century. The first newspaper in Abkhaz, called ''Abkhazia'' and edited by [[Dmitry Gulia]], appeared in 1917.

Arguably the most famous Abkhaz writers are [[Fazil Iskander]], who wrote mostly in Russian, and [[Bagrat Shinkuba]], a poet.

[[Association football|Football]] remains the most popular [[sport in Abkhazia]]. Other popular sports include basketball, boxing and wrestling.

Abkhazia has had its own amateur Abkhazian football league since 1994 though it has no international football union membership.
