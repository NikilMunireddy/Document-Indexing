The '''Adriatic Sea''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|d|r|i|ˈ|æ|t|ɨ|k}} is a body of water separating the [[Italian Peninsula]] from the [[Balkan peninsula]] and the [[Apennine Mountains]] from the [[Dinaric Alps]] and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], extending from the [[Strait of Otranto]] (where it connects to the [[Ionian Sea]]) to the northwest and the [[Po Valley]]. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are [[Italy]], [[Croatia]], [[Albania]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and [[Slovenia]]. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of {{convert|1233|m}}. The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although [[acqua alta|larger amplitudes]] are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's [[salinity]] is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a [[dilution basin]]. The surface water temperatures generally range from {{convert|30|C|F}} in summer to {{convert|12|C|F}} in winter, significantly moderating the [[Adriatic Basin]]'s climate.

The Adriatic Sea sits on the [[Apulian Plate|Apulian or Adriatic Microplate]], which separated from the [[African Plate]] in the [[Mesozoic]] [[Era (geology)|era]]. The plate's movement contributed to the [[Alpine orogeny|formation of the surrounding mountain chains]] and [[Apennine Mountains#Apennine orogeny|Apennine tectonic uplift]] after its [[continental collision|collision]] with the [[Eurasian plate]]. In the [[Chattian|Late Oligocene]], the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the Adriatic Basin from the rest of the Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is [[Flat coast|alluvial]] or [[Marine terrace|terraced]], while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced [[karst]]ification. There are dozens of [[marine protected area]]s in the Adriatic, designed to protect the sea's karst [[habitat]]s and [[biodiversity]]. The sea is abundant in flora and fauna—more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic, many of them [[Endemism|endemic]], rare and threatened ones.

The Adriatic's shores are populated by more than 3.5&nbsp;million people; the largest cities are [[Bari]], [[Venice]], [[Trieste]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. The earliest settlements on the Adriatic shores were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Illyria]]n, and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]. By the 2nd century BC, the shores were under [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]'s control. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Adriatic shores and the sea itself were controlled, to a varying extent, by a series of states—most notably the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] resulted in the [[First French Empire]] gaining coastal control and the [[Adriatic campaign of 1807–1814|British effort]] to counter the French in the area, ultimately securing most of the eastern Adriatic shore and the Po Valley for [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Following [[Italian unification]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]] started an eastward expansion that lasted until the 20th century. Following [[World War I]] and the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Ottoman Empire, the eastern coast's control passed to [[Yugoslavia]] and Albania. The former [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|disintegrated]] during the 1990s, resulting in four new states on the Adriatic coast. Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on their maritime boundaries by 1975 and this boundary is recognised by Yugoslavia's successor states, but the maritime boundaries between Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian–Herzegovinian and Montenegrin waters are still disputed. Italy and Albania agreed on their maritime boundary in 1992.

[[Fishery|Fisheries]] and [[tourism]] are significant sources of income all along the Adriatic coast. [[NUTS of Croatia|Adriatic Croatia]]'s tourism industry has grown faster economically than the rest of the [[Adriatic Basin]]'s. [[Ship transport|Maritime transport]] is also a significant branch of the area's economy—there are 19 seaports in the Adriatic that each handle more than a million [[tonne]]s of cargo per year. The largest Adriatic seaport by annual cargo turnover is the [[Port of Trieste]], while the [[Port of Split]] is the largest Adriatic seaport by passengers served per year.

The Adriatic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea,{{sfn|Moranta et al.|2008|p=3}} bordered in the southwest by the [[Apennine peninsula|Apennine or Italian Peninsula]], in the northwest by the Italian regions of [[Veneto]] and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], and in the northeast by [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], and [[Albania]]—the [[Balkan peninsula]].

=== Bathymetry ===
[[File:Adriatic Sea Bathymetry.svg|thumb|right|Depth of the Adriatic Sea]]
The Adriatic Sea's average depth is {{convert|259.5|m}}, and its maximum depth is {{convert|1233|m}}; however, the North Adriatic basin rarely exceeds a depth of {{convert|100|m}}.{{sfn|Blake|Topalović|Schofield|1996|pp=1–5}} The North Adriatic basin, extending between Venice and Trieste towards a line connecting [[Ancona]] and [[Zadar]], is only {{convert|15|m}} deep at its northwestern end; it gradually deepens towards the southeast. It is the largest Mediterranean [[continental shelf|shelf]] and is simultaneously a [[dilution basin]] and a site of bottom water formation.{{sfn|Cushman-Roisin|Gačić|Poulain|2001|p=122}} The Middle Adriatic basin is south of the Ancona–Zadar line, with the {{convert|270|m|adj=on}} deep Middle Adriatic Pit (also called the Pomo Depression or the Jabuka Pit). The {{convert|170|m|adj=on}} deep Palagruža Sill is south of the Middle Adriatic Pit, separating it from the {{convert|1200|m|adj=on}} deep South Adriatic Pit and the Middle Adriatic basin from the South Adriatic Basin. Further on to the south, the sea floor rises to {{convert|780|m}} to form the Otranto Sill at the boundary to the Ionian Sea. The South Adriatic Basin is similar in many respects to the Northern Ionian Sea, to which it is connected.{{sfn|Bombace|1992|pp=379–382}} Transversely, the Adriatic Sea is also asymmetric: the Apennine peninsular coast is relatively smooth with very few islands and the [[Monte Conero]] and [[Gargano Promontory|Gargano]] promontories as the only significant protrusions into the sea; in contrast, the Balkan peninsular coast is rugged with numerous islands, especially in Croatia. The coast's ruggedness is exacerbated by the [[Dinaric Alps]]' proximity to the coast, in contrast to the opposite (Italian) coast where the [[Apennine Mountains]] are further away from the shoreline.{{sfn|Cushman-Roisin|Gačić|Poulain|2001|pp=2–6}}

=== Hydrology ===
[[File:Adriatic Sea Currents 2.svg|thumb|250px|left|Schematic layout of Adriatic Sea currents<br />{{legend-line|red solid 2px|surface currents}} {{legend-line|blue solid 2px|benthic currents}}]]
The coastal water dynamics are determined by the asymmetric coasts and the Mediterranean seawater's inflow through the Straits of Otranto and further on along the eastern coast.<ref name="Adriamed" /> The smooth Italian coast (with very few protrusions and no major islands) allows the Western Adriatic Current's smooth flow, which is composed of the surface's relatively freshwater mass and the bottom's cold and dense water mass.{{sfn|Del Negro|2001|p=478}} The coastal currents on the opposite shore are far more complex, due to the jagged shoreline, several large islands and the Dinaric Alps' proximity to the shore. The last produces significant temperature variations between the sea and the hinterland, which leads to the creation of local jets.{{sfn|Cushman-Roisin|Gačić|Poulain|2001|pp=2–6}} The tidal movement is normally slight, usually remaining below {{convert|30|cm}}. The [[amphidromic point]] is at the mid-width east of Ancona.{{sfn|Cushman-Roisin|Gačić|Poulain|2001|p=218}}

The normal tide levels are known to increase significantly in a conducive environment, leading to coastal flooding; this phenomenon is most famously known in Italy—especially Venice—as ''[[acqua alta]]''. Such tides can exceed normal levels by more than {{convert|140|cm}},{{sfn|Valiela|2006|pp=49–56}} with the highest tide level of {{convert|194|cm}} observed on 4 November 1966.{{sfn|Gower|2010|p=11}} Such flooding is caused by a combination of factors, including the alignment of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], meteorological factors such as [[sirocco]] related storm surges,{{sfn|Camuffo|2001|pp=107–108}} and the basin's geometric shape (which amplifies or reduces the astronomical component). Moreover, the Adriatic's long and narrow rectangular shape is the source of an oscillating water motion ({{lang-fr|[[seiche]]}}) along the basin's minor axis.{{sfn|Ferla|2005|p=101}} Finally, Venice is increasingly vulnerable to flooding due to coastal area soil [[subsidence]].{{sfn|Standish|2011|pp=5–6}} Such unusually high tides resulting in flooding have also been observed elsewhere in the Adriatic Sea, and have been recorded in recent years in the towns of [[Koper]], Zadar and [[Šibenik]] as well.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Nova TV (Croatia)]]|language=Croatian|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/svijet/u-zasnijezenoj-sloveniji-raste-vodostaj-rijeka-more-poplavilo-obalu.html|title=U Sloveniji more poplavilo obalu|trans_title=Sea floods shore in Slovenia|date=9 November 2010|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[Nova TV (Croatia)]]|language=Croatian|title=Zadar: Zbog velike plime more poplavilo obalu|trans_title=Zadar: Sea floods shore because of high tide|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/zadar-zbog-plime-more-poplavilo-rivu.html|date=25 December 2009|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[Vijesti]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/jugo-i-niski-tlak-more-poplavilo-sibensku-rivu/526311.aspx|title=Jugo i niski tlak: More poplavilo šibensku rivu|trans_title=Sirocco and low pressure: Sea floods Šibenik quay|date=1 December 2010|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Vrulja kod Omiša.jpg|thumb|right|A [[submarine groundwater discharge|submarine spring]] near [[Omiš]], observed through sea surface rippling]]
It is estimated that the Adriatic's entire volume is exchanged through the Strait of Otranto in 3.4±0.4&nbsp;years, a comparably short period. (For instance, approximately 500&nbsp;years are necessary to exchange all the [[Black Sea]]'s water.) This short period is particularly important as the rivers flowing into the Adriatic [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] up to {{convert|5700|m3/s}}. This rate of discharge amounts to 0.5% of the total Adriatic Sea volume, or a {{convert|1.3|m|adj=on}} layer of water each year. The greatest portion of the discharge from any single river comes from the [[Po (river)|Po]] (28%),<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=Institute for Medical Research and Occupational Health|issn=0004-1254|journal=Archives of Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology|title=Marine Radioecology and Waste Management in the Adriatic|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=7507&lang=en|first1=Zdenko|last1=Franić|first2=Branko |last2=Petrinec|volume=57|issue=3|date=September 2006|pages=347–352|accessdate=4 February 2012|pmid=17121008}}</ref> with an average discharge from it alone of {{convert|1569|m3/s}}.{{sfn|Saliot|2005|p=6}} In terms of the annual total discharge into the entire Mediterranean Sea, the Po is ranked second, followed by the Neretva and [[Drin (river)|Drin]], which rank as third and fourth.{{sfn|Tockner|Uehlinger|Robinson|2009|loc=section 11.6.1.}} Another significant contributor of freshwater to the Adriatic is the [[submarine groundwater discharge]] through submarine springs ({{lang-hr|vrulja}}); it is estimated to comprise 29% of the total water flux into the Adriatic.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jbmartin/website/Classes/Surface_Groundwater/Class%206/Taniguchi%20et%20al.%202002%20Hydrological%20processes%20review.pdf|format=PDF|title=Investigation of submarine groundwater discharge|journal=Hydrological Processes|issn=1099-1085|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2002|pages=2115–2159|volume=16|accessdate=27 January 2012|first1=Makoto |last1=Taniguchi|doi=10.1002/hyp.1145|last2=Burnett|first2=William C|last3=Cable|first3=Jaye E|last4=Turner|first4=Jeffrey V|issue=11}}</ref> The submarine springs include [[thermal springs]], discovered offshore near the town of [[Izola]].

On the Adriatic Sea's coasts and islands, there are numerous small settlements, and a number of larger cities. Among the largest are Bari, Venice, Trieste, and Rimini in Italy, Split, Rijeka and Zadar in Croatia, Durrës and [[Vlorë]] in Albania and Koper in Slovenia. In total, more than 3.5&nbsp;million people live on the Adriatic coasts.<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=Croatian Geographic Society|issn=1331-5854|journal=Hrvatski geografski glasnik|first1=Bogdan |last1=Sekulić|first2=Ivan|last2=Sondi|volume=59|issue=1|date=December 1997|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=95871|accessdate=27 January 2012|title=Koliko je Jadran doista opterećen antropogenim i prirodnim unosom tvari?|language=Croatian|trans_title=To What Extent is the Adriatic Sea Actually Burdened with Man-induced and Natural Inflow of Substances}}</ref> There are also some larger cities that are located very near the coast, such as the Italian cities of [[Ravenna]] and [[Lecce]].

Venice, which was originally built on islands off the coast, is most at risk due to subsidence, but the threat is present in the Po [[river delta|delta]] as well.

=== Seafloor sediment ===
[[File:Spring Runoff in the Adriatic Sea.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Sediment]] billowing out from Italy's shore into the Adriatic|alt=Greenish band around the Adriatic coast of Italy]]
All types of seafloor sediments are found in the Adriatic Sea. The Northern Adriatic's comparatively shallow seabed is characterised by relict sand (from times when the water level was lower and the area was a sandy beach), while a muddy bed is typical at depths below {{convert|100|m}}.<ref name="Adriamed">{{cite web|publisher=FAO AdriaMed|url=http://www.faoadriamed.org/pdf/publications/td13/mmm-td-13.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adriatic Sea Fisheries: outline of some main facts|first1=Piero|last1=Mannini|first2=Fabio|last2=Massa|first3=Nicoletta|accessdate=29 January 2012|last3=Milone}}</ref>{{sfn|Schwartz|2005|p=575}} There are five [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] units in the Adriatic: the Northern Adriatic (up to {{convert|100|m}} deep); the North Adriatic islands area protected against sediments filling it in by outer islands (pre-[[Holocene]] [[karst]] relief); the Middle Adriatic islands area (large Dalmatian islands); the Middle Adriatic (characterized by the Middle Adriatic Depression); and the Southern Adriatic consisting of a coastal [[Continental shelf|shelf]] and the Southern Adriatic Depression. Sediments deposited in the Adriatic Sea today generally come from the northwest coast, being carried by the Po, [[Reno (river)|Reno]], [[Adige]], [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]], [[Tagliamento]], [[Piave (river)|Piave]] and Soča rivers. The volume of sediments carried from the eastern shore by the [[Rječina]], [[Zrmanja]], Krka, [[Cetina]], [[Ombla]], [[Dragonja]], [[Mirna (Croatia)|Mirna]], [[Raša (river)|Raša]] and [[Neretva#Neretva Delta|Neretva]] rivers is negligible, because these sediments are mostly deposited at the river mouths. The Adriatic's western shores are largely either [[Flat coast|alluvial]] or [[Marine terrace|terraced]], whereas the eastern shores are predominantly rocky, except for the southernmost part of the shore located in Albania that consists of sandy coves and rocky capes.<ref name="Juračić" />

=== Coasts ===
The eastern Adriatic shore's Croatian part is the most indented Mediterranean coastline.{{sfn|Randić|2002|pp=155–156}} Most of the eastern coast is characterised by a karst topography, developed from the Adriatic Carbonate Platform's exposure to weathering. Karstification there largely began after the Dinarides' final uplift in the Oligocene and the [[Miocene]], when [[carbonate rock|carbonate deposits]] were exposed to atmospheric effects; this extended to the level of {{convert|120|m}} below the present sea level, exposed during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. It is estimated that some karst formations are from earlier sea level drops, most notably the [[Messinian salinity crisis]].<ref name="Surić" /> Similarly, karst developed in [[Apulia]] from the Apulian Carbonate Platform.<ref>{{cite journal|format=PDF|url=http://carsologica.zrc-sazu.si/downloads/401/Parise.pdf|journal=Acta Carsologica|volume=40|issue=1|pages=73–93|year=2011|first=Mario|last=Parise|title=Surface and subsurface karst geomorphology in the Murge (Apulia, Southern Italy)|accessdate=28 January 2012|issn=0583-6050|publisher=[[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]}}</ref>

There are alternations of maritime and [[alluvial]] [[sediment]]s occurring in the [[Po Valley#Geology|Po Valley]], at the Adriatic's north-west coast, and as far west as [[Piacenza]], dating to the [[Pleistocene]] as the sea advanced and receded over the valley.

== Biogeography and ecology ==
The Adriatic Sea is a unique water body in respect of its overall [[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] physiognomy. It exports inorganic nutrients and imports particulate organic carbon and nitrogen through the Strait of Otranto—acting as a mineralization site. The exchange of the substances is made more complex by bathymetry of the Adriatic Sea—75% of water flowing north through the strait recirculates at the Palagruža Sill and North Adriatic adds no more than 3&nbsp;– 4% of water to the South Adriatic.{{sfn|Gačić|Civitarese|Ursella|1999|p=356}} This is reflected in its [[biogeography]] and [[ecology]], and particularly in the composition and properties of its [[ecosystem]]s.{{sfn|Lipej|Dulčić|2004|pp=291–300}} Its main biogeographic units are the Northern Adriatic, the Central Adriatic, and the Southern Adriatic.{{sfn|Bianchi|2007|p=10}}

=== Flora and fauna ===

The unique nature of the Adriatic gives rise to an abundance of [[endemism|endemic]] flora and fauna. The Croatian National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan identified more than 7,000 animal and plant species in the Adriatic Sea. The Central Adriatic is especially abundant in endemic plant species, with 535 identified species of [[Green algae|green]], [[Brown algae|brown]] and [[red algae]].<ref name="USAID-Bio">{{cite web|publisher=Natural Resources Management & Development Portal|url=http://rmportal.net/library/content/118_croatia/view?searchterm=en|title=Biodiversity assessment for Croatia|date=31 December 2000|author=Chemonics International Inc|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref> Four out of five Mediterranean [[seagrass]] species are found in the Adriatic Sea.

A number of [[Rare species|rare]] and [[threatened species]] are also found along the Adriatic's eastern coast; it is relatively clearer and less polluted than the western Adriatic coast—in part because the sea currents flow through the Adriatic in a counterclockwise direction, thus bringing clearer waters up the eastern coast and returning increasingly polluted water down the western coast. This circulation has significantly contributed to the biodiversity of the countries along the eastern Adriatic coast; the [[common bottlenose dolphin]] is frequent in the eastern coast's waters only, and the Croatian coast provides refuge for the critically endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal|monk seal]] and sea turtles.<ref name="USAID-Bio" /> Recent studies revealed that [[cetacean]]s and other marine [[megafauna]]s, that were once thought to be vagrants to Adriatic Sea, migrate and live in the semi-closed sea on larger scales.<ref name=ebsaws>https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/ebsaws-2014-03/other/ebsaws-2014-03-submission-rac-spa-sr-01-en.pdf</ref> Largest of these live normally is the [[fin whale]],<ref>http://www.tethys.org/tethys/fin-whales-in-the-adriatic/</ref> and [[sperm whale]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4i3ACEANwk Kitovi kod Tijata]</ref> the largest of toothed whales also migrate but less common than fin whales, followed by [[Cuvier's beaked whale]]s.<ref name=ebsaws /> [[Basking shark]]s<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVciA9I2Rbw Incontro ravvicinato nel Mar Adriatico con uno squalo di 8 metri]</ref> and [[manta ray]]s are some of migrant species to the sea.<ref>[https://edesabata.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/cetorino-mancusi-cybium.pdf On the presence of basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus)in the Mediterranean Sea]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0Ce3GLaNPw Morski pas kod Ilovika]</ref><ref>[http://www.jutarnji.hr/jadransko-more-je-puno-morskih-pasa--kitova--kornjaca-i-dupina/880217/?foto=2 Golubi uhani - Jabučka kotlina (južno od otoka Jabuke)]</ref>

The Northern Adriatic in particular is rich in endemic fish fauna.{{sfn|Bombace|1992|pp=379–382}} Around thirty species of fish are found in only one or two countries bordering the Adriatic Sea. These are particularly due to or dependent upon the karst morphology of the coastal or submarine topography; this includes inhabiting subterranean habitats, karst rivers, and areas around freshwater springs.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)]]|first=Ivna|last=Vukšić|format=PDF|url=http://www.min-kulture.hr/userdocsimages/priroda/4th_NR%20to%20CBD.pdf|title=Fourth national report of the Republic of Croatia to the Convention on Biological Diversity|date=18 May 2009|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> There are 45 known [[subspecies]] endemic to the Adriatic's coasts and islands. In the Adriatic, there are at least 410 species and subspecies of fish, representing approximately 70% of Mediterranean taxa, with at least 7 species endemic to the Adriatic. Sixty-four known species are threatened with extinction, largely because of overfishing.<ref name="USAID-Bio" /> Only a small fraction of the fish found in the Adriatic are attributed to recent processes such as [[Lessepsian migration]], and escape from [[mariculture]].{{sfn|Lipej|Dulčić|2004|p=300}}

== Name ==
The [[etymology|origins]] of the name ''Adriatic'' are linked to the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] settlement of [[Adria]], which probably derives its name from the [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] ''adur'' meaning water or sea.{{sfn|Room|2006|p=20}} In [[classical antiquity]], the sea was known as ''Mare Adriaticum'' (''Mare Hadriaticum'', also sometimes simplified to ''Adria'') or, less frequently, as ''Mare Superum'', "[the] upper sea".<ref>{{cite journal|page=504|publisher=F. and C. Rivington|date=November 1812|journal=The British Critic|volume=40|first=James|last=Playfair|title=System of Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQEwAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA504#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> The two terms were not synonymous, however. ''Mare Adriaticum'' generally corresponds to the Adriatic Sea's extent, spanning from the [[Gulf of Venice#Geography|Gulf of Venice]] to the Strait of Otranto. That boundary became more consistently defined by Roman authors—early Greek sources place the boundary between the Adriatic and Ionian seas at various places ranging from adjacent to the [[Gulf of Venice]] to the southern tip of the [[Peloponnese]], eastern shores of [[Sicily]] and western shores of [[Crete]].{{sfn|Calmet|Taylor|1830|pp=53–54}} ''Mare Superum'' on the other hand normally encompassed both the modern Adriatic Sea and the sea off the Apennine peninsula's southern coast, as far as the [[Strait of Sicily]].{{sfn|Anthon|2005|p=20}} Another name used in the period was ''Mare Dalmaticum'', applied to waters off the coast of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] or [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]].{{sfn|Tacitus|1853|p=380}}

Names for the sea in the languages of the surrounding countries include: {{lang-sq|Deti Adriatik}}; {{lang-hr|Jadransko more}}; [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]]: ''marea Adriatică''; {{lang-it|mare Adriatico}}; {{lang-sl|Jadransko morje}}; {{lang-gr|Αδριατική θάλασσα}} ''Adriatiki Thalassa''. In Croatian, Montenegrin and Slovene, the sea is often referred to simply as ''Jadran''.

== History ==
[[File:Pula Arena aerial 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pula Arena]], one of the six largest surviving Roman amphitheatres]]
Settlements along the Adriatic dating to between 6100 and 5900 BC appear in Albania and Dalmatia on the eastern coast, related to the [[Cardium Pottery]] culture.{{sfn|Cunliffe|2008|pp=115–116}} During classical antiquity, [[Illyria]]ns inhabited the eastern Adriatic coast,{{sfn|Wilkes|1995|pp=91–104}} and the western coast was inhabited by the [[Ancient peoples of Italy|peoples of Ancient Italy]], mainly Etruscans, before the [[Roman Republic]]'s rise.{{sfn|Hall|1996|pp=2–14}} [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonisation of the Adriatic dates back to the 7th and 6th centuries BC when [[Epidamnos]] and [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] were founded. The Greeks soon expanded further north establishing several cities, including [[Epidaurus (Dalmatia)|Epidaurus]], [[Black Corcyra]], [[Issa (colony)|Issa]] and Ancona, with trade established as far north as the [[Po (river)#The Po in ancient history|Po]] River delta, where the [[Emporia (ancient Greece)|emporion]] (trading station) of [[Adria]] was founded.{{sfn|Gruen|1986|p=359}}

=== Roman era ===
Roman economic and military influence in the region began to grow with the creation by 246 BC of a major naval base at Brundisium (now [[Brindisi]]), which was established to bar [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] ships from the Adriatic during the [[Punic Wars]]. This led to conflict with the [[Illyrians]], who lived in a collection of semi-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenized]] kingdoms that covered much of the Balkans and controlled the eastern shore of the sea, resulting in the [[Illyrian Wars]] from 229–168 BC. The initial Roman intervention in 229 BC, motivated in part by a desire to suppress Illyrian piracy in the Adriatic, marked the first time that the [[Roman navy]] crossed that sea to launch a military campaign.{{sfn|Grant|1978|pp=131–132}}<ref name="UNRV">{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/provinces/illyricum.php|title=Illyricum&nbsp;– Dalmatia|publisher=UNRV|accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> Those wars ended with the eastern shore becoming a province of the Roman Republic.{{sfn|Cabanes|2008|pp=155–186}} However, resistance to Roman rule continued sporadically and Rome did not completely consolidate control of the region until [[Augustus]]'s general [[Tiberius]] put down the [[Great Illyrian Revolt]], a bitter struggle waged from 6 to 9 AD.<ref name="UNRV" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hungarianheraldry.org/bosnia/|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> Following the repression of the revolt the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was split into [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]]. Most of the eastern shore of the Adriatic was part of Dalmatia, except for the southernmost portion, part of the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], and the peninsula of [[Istria]] on the northern part of the eastern shore; Istria contained the important Roman colony at [[Pula]] and was incorporated into the province of [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/hr-history-istria.htm|title=Istria|publisher=GlobalSecurity|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref>

During the Roman period Brundisium, on the western shore, and Apollonia and Dyrrachium (originally called Epidamnos, now [[Durrës]] in Albania) on the eastern shore became important ports. Brundisium was linked by the [[Appian Way|Via Appia]] road to the city of Rome, and Dyrrachium and Apollonia were both on the [[Via Egnatia]], a road that by about 130 BC the Romans had extended eastward across the Balkans to Byzantium (later [[Constantinople]], now [[Istanbul]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abu.nb.ca/courses/NTIntro/images/Egnatian.htm/|title=Via Egnatia|publisher=Crandall University|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montclair.edu/chss/center-heritage-archaeological-studies/news-and-events/via-egnatia/|title=Via Egnatia: a journey across the lower Balkans through time|publisher= Montclair State: The College of Humanities and Social Sciences|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> This made the sea passage across the Adriatic between Brundisium and Dyrrachium (or Apollonia) a link in the primary route for travelers, trade, and troop movements, between Rome and the East. This route played a major role in some of the military operations that marked the end of the Roman Republic and start of the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]]. [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] used it during the [[First Mithridatic War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/vi-vr/via_egnatia/via_egnatia.html|title=Via Egnatia|publisher=Livius|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> During [[Caesar's Civil War]], there was a three-month delay in [[Julius Caesar|Caesar's]] Balkan campaign against [[Pompey]] caused when winter storms on the Adriatic and a naval blockade held up [[Mark Antony]] from reaching him from Brundisium with reinforcements; after the reinforcements finally arrived Caesar made an unsuccessful [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|attempt to capture Dyrrachium]] before the campaign moved inland.{{sfn|Grant|1978|p=231}}  Marc Antony and Octavian (later Augustus) crossed the Adriatic to Dyrrachium with their armies in their campaign against two of Caesar's assassins, [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], that culminated in the [[Battle of Philippi]].{{sfn|Grant|1978|pp=242–243}} Brundisium and Dyrrachium remained important ports well after the Roman period, but an earthquake in the 3rd century AD changed the path of a river causing Apollonia's harbor to silt up, and the city to decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://albca.com/albania/apollonia.html|title=Apollonia, Illyria|publisher=Albanian Canadian Information Service|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref>

Another city on the Italian coast of the Adriatic that increased in importance during the Roman era was [[Ravenna]]. During the reign of Augustus it became a major naval base as part of his program to re-organize the Roman navy to better protect commerce in the Mediterranean.{{sfn|Grant|1978|pp=263–264}} During the 4th century AD the emperors of the [[Western Roman Empire]] had moved their official residence north from Rome to [[Mediolanum]] (now [[Milan]]) in order to be better able to control the military frontier with the Germanic tribes. In 402 AD, during a period of repeated Germanic invasions of Italy, the capital was shifted to Ravenna because nearby marshes made it more defensible, and the Adriatic provided an easy escape path by sea.{{sfn|Grant|1978|pp= 395–427}} When the Western Empire fell in 476 AD Ravenna became the capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of Italy.{{sfn|Grant|1978|p=464}}

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Korcula City.jpg|thumb|Some biographers suggest that [[Marco Polo]] may have been born in [[Korčula (town)|Korčula]], Croatia]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], after the [[decline of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire's decline]], the Adriatic's coasts were ruled by [[Ostrogoths]], [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombards]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Paul the Deacon|1974|pp=326–328}}{{sfn|Burns|1991|pp=126–130}} The Ostrogothic Kingdom ruled Italy following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. However, during the reign of [[Justinian]] the Byzantine Empire sent an army under the general [[Belisarius]] to regain control of Italy, resulting in the [[Gothic War (535–554)]]. The Byzantines established the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and by 553 AD their viceroy (Exarch) ruled almost the entire Italian peninsula from that city. In 568 AD the Lombards invaded northern Italy, and over the course of the next century or so the importance of the Exarchate declined as the territory under Lombard control expanded and as the Byzantine outpost of [[Venice]] became increasingly independent. In 752 AD the Lombards overthrew the Exarchate, ending the influence of the Byzantine Empire on the western shore of the Adriatic for a few centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsEurope/ItalyRavenna.htm|title=Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna AD 552&nbsp;– 754|publisher=The History Files|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

The [[World War I]] [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|Adriatic Campaign]] was largely limited to blockade attempts by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|effort]] of the [[Central Powers]] to thwart the British, French and Italian moves.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=39}} Italy joined the Allies in April 1915 with the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], which promised Italy the Austrian Littoral, northern Dalmatia, the [[port of Vlorë]], most of the eastern Adriatic islands and Albania as a [[protectorate]].{{sfn|Tucker|1996|p=440}} The treaty provided the basis for all the following divisions between Italy and Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Lipušček|2005|p=446}} In 1918, the Montenegrin national assembly voted to unite with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], giving the latter access to the Adriatic.{{sfn|Palmer|2000|p=298}} Another short-lived, unrecognised state established in 1918 was the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], formed from parts of Austria-Hungary, comprising most of the former monarchy's Adriatic coastline. Later that year, the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs formed the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]—subsequently renamed Yugoslavia. The proponents of the new union in the [[Croatian parliament]] saw the move as a safeguard against Italian expansionism as stipulated in the Treaty of London.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=4–16}} The treaty was largely disregarded by Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]] because of conflicting promises made to Serbia and a perceived lack of Italian contribution to the war effort outside Italy itself.{{sfn|Burgwyn|1997|pp=4–6}} The 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] did transfer the Austrian Littoral and Istria to Italy, but awarded Dalmatia to Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=318}} Following the war, a [[Gabriele d'Annunzio|private force]] of demobilized Italian soldiers seized Rijeka and set up the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]—seen as a harbinger of [[Fascism]]—in order to force the recognition of Italian claims to the city.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2004|pp=127–128}} After sixteen months of the Regency's existence, the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|1920 Treaty of Rapallo]] redefined the Italian–Yugoslav borders, among other things transferring Zadar and the islands of Cres, Lastovo and [[Palagruža]] to Italy, securing the island of Krk for Yugoslavia and establishing the [[Free State of Fiume]]; this new state was abolished in 1924 by the [[Treaty of Rome (1924)|Treaty of Rome]] that awarded Fiume (modern Rijeka) to Italy and [[Sušak, Rijeka|Sušak]] to Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Singleton|1985|pp=135–137}}

=== Late 20th century ===

During [[World War II]], the Adriatic saw only [[Adriatic Campaign of World War II|limited naval action]], starting with the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] and the joint [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]]. The latter led to the annexation of a large part of Dalmatia and nearly all the eastern Adriatic islands by Italy and the establishment of two [[puppet state]]s, the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and the [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941–1944)|Kingdom of Montenegro]], which controlled the remainder of the former Yugoslav Adriatic coast.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=130–139, 233–234}} In 1947, after the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces]] and the war's end, Italy (now a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|republic]]) and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] signed the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]]. The treaty reversed all wartime annexations, guaranteed the independence of Albania, created the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] (FTT) as a city-state, and gave [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist Yugoslavia]] most of the [[Slovenian Littoral]], as well as Istria, the islands of Cres, Lastovo and Palagruža, and the cities of Zadar and Rijeka.{{sfn|Klemenčič|Žagar|2004|pp=198–202}} The FTT was partitioned in 1954: Trieste itself and the area to the North of it were placed under Italian control, while the rest came under Yugoslav control. This arrangement was made permanent in the 1975 [[Treaty of Osimo]].{{sfn|Navone|1996|pp=141–142}}

== Boundaries ==

Italy and Yugoslavia defined their Adriatic continental shelf delimitation in 1968,{{sfn|Blake|Topalović|Schofield|1996|pp=11–13}} with an additional agreement signed in 1975 on the Gulf of Trieste boundary, following the Treaty of Osimo. The boundary agreed in 1968 extends {{convert|353|nmi|km mi}} and consists of 43&nbsp;points connected by straight lines or circular [[Arc (geometry)|arc segments]]. The additional boundary agreed upon in 1975 consists of 5&nbsp;points, extending from an end point of the 1968 line. All successor states of former Yugoslavia accepted the agreements. In the Adriatic's southernmost areas the border was not determined in order to avoid prejudicing the location of the [[tripoint]] with the Albanian continental shelf border, which remains undefined. Before the breakup of Yugoslavia, Albania, Italy and Yugoslavia initially proclaimed {{convert|15|nmi|km mi|adj=on}} [[territorial waters]], subsequently reduced to international-standard {{convert|12|nmi|km mi}} and all sides adopted [[Baseline (sea)|baseline]] systems (mostly in the 1970s).

The maritime boundary between Bosnia–Herzegovina and Croatia was formally settled in 1999, but a few issues are still in dispute—the [[Klek (peninsula)|Klek peninsula]] and two islets in the border area. The Croatia–Montenegro maritime boundary is disputed in the Bay of Kotor, at the [[Prevlaka]] peninsula. This dispute was exacerbated by the peninsula's occupation by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] and later by the (Serbian–Montenegrin) [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslav Army]], which in turn was replaced by a [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|United Nations observer mission]] that lasted until 2002. Croatia took over the area with an agreement that allowed Montenegrin presence in the bay's Croatian waters, and the dispute has become far less contentious since Montenegro's independence in 2006.<ref name="Geoadria-Borders" />

=== Oil and gas ===
[[Natural gas]] is produced through several projects, including a joint venture of the [[Eni]] and [[INA (company)|INA]] companies that operates two platforms—one is in Croatian waters and draws gas from six wells, and the other (which started operating in 2010) is located in Italian waters.
