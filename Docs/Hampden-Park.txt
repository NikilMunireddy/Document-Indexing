'''Hampden Park''' (often referred to as '''Hampden''') is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in the [[Mount Florida]] area of [[Glasgow]], Scotland. The {{SPFL-stadiums|queenspark}}-capacity<ref name="capacity"/> venue serves as the [[national stadium]] of [[football in Scotland]]. It is the normal home venue of the [[Scotland national football team]] and amateur [[Scottish Professional Football League|Scottish league]] club [[Queen's Park F.C.]] and regularly hosts the latter stages of the [[Scottish Cup]] and [[Scottish League Cup]] competitions. It is also used for music concerts and other sporting events, such as when it was reconfigured as a [[track and field|athletics]] stadium for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]].

There were two 19th century stadia called Hampden Park, built on different sites. A stadium on the present site was first opened on 31 October 1903. Hampden was the biggest stadium in the world when it was opened, with a capacity in excess of 100,000. This was increased further between 1927 and 1937, reaching a peak of 150,000. The record attendance of 149,415, for a Scotland v [[England national football team|England]] match in 1937, is the European record for an international football match. Tighter safety regulations meant that the capacity was reduced to 81,000 in 1977. The stadium has been fully renovated since then, with the most recent work being completed in 1999.

The stadium houses the offices of the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) and [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (SPFL). Hampden has hosted prestigious sporting events, including three [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] finals, two [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] finals and a [[UEFA Cup]] final. Hampden is a [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA category four]] stadium and it is served by the nearby [[Mount Florida railway station|Mount Florida]] and [[King's Park railway station|King's Park]] railway stations.

==History==

===Three Hampdens===
Queen's Park, the oldest club in Scottish football, have played at a venue called Hampden Park since October 1873.<ref name = "Inglis461">{{harv|Inglis|1996|p=461}}</ref>{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=24}} The [[Hampden Park (1873–83)|first Hampden Park]] was overlooked by a nearby terrace named after [[England|Englishman]] [[John Hampden]], who fought for the [[roundhead]]s in the [[English Civil War]].<ref name = "Inglis461"/>{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=24}} Queen's Park played at the first Hampden Park for 10 years beginning with a Scottish Cup tie on 25 October 1873.<ref name = "museum">{{cite web|url=http://www.hampdenroar.org.uk/section.cfm?sid=ptyxm2vxnlmo2vl44|title=The Hampden Story|publisher=[[Scottish Football Museum]]|accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> The ground hosted the first [[Scottish Cup Final]], in 1874, and a Scotland v [[England national football team|England]] match in 1878.<ref name = "museum"/>

[[File:Cathkinpark3.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of [[Cathkin Park]], which was the site of the second Hampden Park.]]

The club moved to the second Hampden Park, 150&nbsp;yards from the original, because the [[Cathcart District Railway]] planned a new line through the site of the ground's western terrace.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=24}}<ref name = "sfa">{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?page=139|title=Hampden Park|publisher=[[Scottish Football Association]]|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> A [[lawn bowling]] club at the junction of Queen's Drive and Cathcart Road marks the site of the first Hampden.<ref name = "Inglis461"/> The second Hampden Park opened in October 1884.<ref name = "Inglis461"/>{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=24}} It became a regular home to the [[Scottish Cup Final]], but [[Celtic Park]] shared some of the big matches including the Scotland v England [[1894 British Home Championship|fixture in 1894]].<ref name = "Inglis461"/>

In the late 1890s, Queen's Park requested more land for development of the second Hampden Park.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=24}}<ref name = "museum"/> This was refused by the landlords, which led to the club seeking a new site.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=24}}<ref name = "museum"/> Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land off Somerville Drive to Queen's Park in November 1899.<ref name = "qpfc">{{cite web|url=http://www.queensparkfc.co.uk/about/history/hampden.html|title=A Hampden home fit for football heroes|publisher=[[Queen's Park F.C.]]|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=29}} [[James Miller (architect)|James Miller]] designed twin grandstands along the south side of the ground{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=29}} with a pavilion wedged in between.<ref name = "Inglis461"/> The natural slopes were shaped to form banks of terracing, designed by [[Archibald Leitch]].<ref name = "Inglis461"/> Construction of the new ground took over three years to complete; during construction, a [[1902 Ibrox disaster|disaster]] occurred at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] in which part of the wooden terraces collapsed.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=29}} In response, the terraces at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and innovative techniques were used to control spectators.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=29}}

[[Third Lanark A.C.]] took over the second Hampden Park in 1903 and renamed it [[Cathkin Park]].<ref name = "Inglis461"/> The club rebuilt the ground from scratch due to a failure to agree a fee for the whole stadium.<ref name = "museum"/><ref name = "qpfc"/> Third Lanark went out of business in 1967 and Cathkin Park is now a public park with much of the original terracing still evident.<ref name = "Inglis461"/><ref name = "museum"/>

Hampden Park was the biggest stadium in the world from its opening in 1903 until it was surpassed by the [[Maracanã (stadium)|Maracanã]] in 1950.<ref name = "sfa"/> Along with Celtic Park and Ibrox, the city of Glasgow possessed the three largest football stadia in the world at the time Hampden opened.<ref name = "Inglis461"/> In the stadium's first match, on 31 October 1903, Queen's Park defeated [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] 1–0 in the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish league]].<ref name = "Inglis461"/><ref name = "sfa"/><ref name = "qpfc"/>{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=30}} The first [[Scottish Cup Final]] played at the ground was an [[Old Firm]] match in 1904, attracting a record Scottish crowd of 64,672.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=30}} The first Scotland v England match at the ground was played in April 1906 with 102,741 people in attendance, which established Hampden as the primary home of the Scotland team.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=33}}

===Record attendances===
Attendances continued to increase during the remainder of the 1900s, as 121,452 saw the 1908 Scotland v England match.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=33}} The two [[Old Firm]] matches played for the [[1909 Scottish Cup Final]] attracted a total of 131,000.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=33}} After the second match there was a riot because there was confusion over what would happen next when the second match also ended in a draw.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=34}} The fans believed that the replay would be played to a conclusion and demanded that a period of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] be played.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=34}} The Scottish Cup trophy was withheld as Hampden was not in a fit condition to host a second replay.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=37}} In response to the riot, the [[Scottish Football Association]] decided not to use Hampden as the Scottish Cup Final venue until after the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=38}}

Queen's Park conducted extensive ground improvements after the 1909 riot.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=38}}  A new world record of 127,307 were in attendance to see Scotland play England in 1912.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=39}} A fire in 1914 destroyed the pavilion, which was replaced by a four-storey structure with a [[press box]] on the roof.<ref name = "Inglis461"/> The Scottish Cup Final returned to Hampden in 1920, when a large crowd of 95,000 saw [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] win the cup against [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=47}} Record crowds attended the 1925 Scottish Cup Final, a 5–0 win for Celtic against Rangers,{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=53}} and the 1927 Scotland v England match, England's first win in the stadium.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=57}} Hampden became the sole venue of the Scottish Cup Final after 1925<ref name = "Inglis461"/> except in the 1990s when it was being renovated. Queen's Park purchased more land in 1923 to bring the total to 33 acres.<ref name = "Inglis461"/> 25,000 places were added to the terraces and rigid crush barriers were installed in 1927.<ref name = "Inglis461"/>

World record crowds attended Scotland matches against England in 1931 and 1933.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=66}} In 1933, [[Austria national football team|Austria]], who had beaten Scotland 5–0 in [[Vienna]] in 1931, became the first foreign national side to visit Hampden Park.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=66}} Further ground improvements increased the official capacity of the ground to 183,388 in 1937, but the SFA were only allowed to issue 150,000 tickets for games.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=72}} The 1937 Scotland v England match had an official attendance of 149,415, but at least 20,000 more people entered the ground without tickets.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=72}} A week later the [[1937 Scottish Cup Final]] between Celtic and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] drew an official crowd of 147,365, with 20,000 more people locked outside.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=72}}

===Wartime===

During the [[Second World War]], matches at heavily-attended grounds were initially prohibited due to the fear of aerial bombing by the [[Luftwaffe]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=79}} Scottish national league and cup competitions were suspended for the duration of the war, but regional league and cup competitions were established in their place.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=79}} Attendance was initially restricted to 50 percent of capacity; therefore, when 75,000 attended a wartime cup final in May 1940, it was the maximum permitted.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=81}} The Parashots, a forerunner of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], set up a command post at [[Lesser Hampden]] in 1940.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=81}} A government official presented an order demanding that both the Hampden and Lesser Hampden pitches be ploughed and used to plant vegetables, but the Queen's Park committee chose to ignore the order and the government did not pursue it.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=81}} Wartime internationals were played at Hampden, and 91,000 saw Scotland beat England 5–4 on 18 April 1942.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=81}}

===Post-war===

After the Second World War ended in 1945, Hampden started to host Scotland matches more frequently.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=87}} Before then, Hampden had only hosted 15 matches against England and one match each against Austria and [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=101}} During the post-war attendance boom, Hampden was the only stadium big enough to host the crowds who wanted to see the team.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=87}} Matches that would have ordinarily attracted a crowd of 40,000 were being attended by nearly 100,000.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=91}} The Hampden fixture list was also expanded by the new Scottish League Cup competition.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=91}} In 1947, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] defeated [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in the [[1947 Scottish League Cup Final (April)|first League Cup Final]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=91}}

A fire on 25 December 1945 destroyed the stadium [[press box]] and damaged offices.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=87}} The press box was replaced with a plainer two-storey structure that overhung the pitch.<ref name = "Inglis462">{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=462}}</ref> The capacity of the ground was cut to 135,000 following the [[Burnden Park disaster]] in [[Bolton]].<ref name = "Inglis462"/>

The re-entry of the [[Home Nations]] into [[FIFA]] in 1947 was marked by a match between a [[United Kingdom national football team|Great Britain]] and a Rest of Europe select on 10 May 1947.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=111}} Great Britain won 6–1 and 130,000 people attended.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=111}} Unusually, a league match between [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] and [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] was played immediately afterwards at Hampden because [[Cathkin Park]] was undergoing repair work.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=111}} The first [[FIFA World Cup]] qualification match played at Hampden was a 2–0 win for Scotland against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 9 November 1949; this match was also part of the [[1950 British Home Championship]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=102}} The win appeared to guarantee Scotland qualification for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] because the top two finishers in the Championship were offered places in the tournament, but the SFA decreed that they would only send a team if they were British champions.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=105}} Scotland only needed a draw against England at Hampden to meet that condition but lost 1–0.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=105}}

The [[Coronation Cup (football)|Coronation Cup]], a competition to mark the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]], was held in Glasgow during May 1953.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=112}} Four major clubs from each of Scotland and England were invited, with the [[Old Firm]] clubs playing their matches at Hampden.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=112}} [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and Hibernian progressed to the final, and a crowd of 117,060 saw Celtic win 2–0.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=115}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/jockstein/The-green-shoots-of-recovery.2660234.jp|title=The green shoots of recovery with Hibs|first=Martin|last=Hannan|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|publisher=Johnston Press|date=11 September 2005|accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>

Scotland hosted the [[Golden Team|Magical Magyars]] of [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in December 1954 in front of 113,506 fans.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=105}} The Scots put up a good fight against one of the most outstanding teams in the world at the time, but eventually lost 4–2.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=106}} Scotland qualified for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] by defeating [[Spain national football team|Spain]], including [[Luis Suárez (footballer, born 1935)|Luis Suarez]], [[Ladislao Kubala]] and [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]], at Hampden.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=108}}

After Celtic won the [[1967 European Cup Final]], the home leg of their [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] tie against [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] was held at Hampden.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=124}} Celtic won 1–0 at Hampden, but lost the tie after a play-off in [[Montevideo]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=124}} In 1970, Celtic played in the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] against [[list of English football champions|English league champions]], [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=126}} Celtic chose to move their home leg of the tie from their Celtic Park home to Hampden, which had a far greater capacity.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=126}} A crowd of 136,505, a record for any match in UEFA competition, saw Celtic win 2–1 (3–1 on aggregate) to advance to the [[1970 European Cup Final]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=126}} Celtic also played European Cup ties against [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=161}} and [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]]{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=163}} at Hampden during the 1970s.

==Hampden Roar==

The football match crowd at Hampden were renowned for creating the ''Hampden Roar'' and trying to terrify opposing teams. The stadium's capacity exceeded 100,000 from the early 1900s until the 1980s and the Roar could be heard whenever [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] scored an important goal.<ref name = "roar"/> After the renovation of the stadium and the reduced capacities, the roar has become more muted.<ref name = "roar"/>

The Hampden Roar was first noticed in a game against [[England national football team|England]] in 1929.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=58}} Scotland, who had played the second half with ten players due to an injury to [[Alex Jackson (footballer born 1905)|Alex Jackson]], equalised in the final minute with a goal from [[Alec Cheyne]] direct from a [[corner kick]].{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=58}} The roar that followed the goal was so loud that Jackson, who was a mile away in the [[Glasgow Victoria Infirmary]], could tell that Scotland had scored.{{sfn|Robertson|Ross|p=58}}

The phrase Hampden Roar is also used as rhyming slang.<ref name = "roar">{{cite news|first=Martin|last=Hannan|accessdate=16 July 2011|work=[[New Statesman]]|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/199909200026|title=Sounds of scandal on the terraces|date=20 September 1999}}</ref> People from [[Glasgow]] may ask, "What's the Hampden?", by which they mean "What is the score?" or "How are you?".<ref name = "roar"/>
