'''Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A.''' ({{IPA-it|ˈalfa roˈmɛːo}}) is an Italian [[car manufacturer]].  Founded as A.L.F.A. ("''Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili''", translating to Anonymous Lombard Automobile Factory in English) on June 24, 1910, in [[Milan]],<ref name="autoweb.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_52638/title_Alfa-Romeo-Celebrates-90-Years-Of-Success/newsarticle.html|title=Alfa Romeo Celebrates 90 Years of Success|accessdate=2009-01-09|year=2000|work=autoweb.com}}</ref> the company has been involved in car racing since 1911. It was owned by Italian state holding company [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale]] between 1932 and 1986, when it became a part of the [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat group]].<ref name="fundinguniverse.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Alfa-Romeo-Company-History.html|title=Alfa Romeo |accessdate=2009-01-09|work=fundinguniverse.com}}</ref> In February 2007, the Alfa Romeo brand was transformed into the current Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A., a subsidiary of Fiat Group Automobiles, now [[FCA Italy|Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Italy]].

The company that became Alfa Romeo was founded as Società Anonima Italiana Darracq (SAID) in 1906 by the French automobile firm of [[Alexandre Darracq]], with some Italian investors.  In late 1909, the Italian Darracq cars were selling slowly and the Italian partners of the company hired [[Giuseppe Merosi]] to design new cars. On June 24, 1910, a new company was founded named A.L.F.A., initially still in partnership with Darracq. The first non-Darracq car produced by the company was the 1910 [[A.L.F.A 24 HP|24 HP]], designed by Merosi. A.L.F.A. ventured into [[motor racing]], with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 [[Targa Florio]] with two 24-hp models. In August 1915, the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur [[Nicola Romeo]], who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts. In 1920, the name of the company was changed to Alfa Romeo with the [[Alfa Romeo 20/30 HP|Torpedo 20-30 HP]] the first car to be so badged.

In 1921, the Banca Italiana di Sconto, which backed the Ing. Nicola Romeo & Co, went broke and the government needed to support the industrial companies involved, among which was Alfa Romeo, through the "Consorzio per Sovvenzioni sui Valori Industriali". In 1925, the railway activities were separated from the Romeo company, and in 1928, Nicola Romeo left. In 1933, the state ownership was reorganized under the banner of the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government, which then had effective control. The company struggled to return to profitability after the Second World War, and turned to mass-producing small vehicles rather than hand-building luxury models. In 1954, it developed the [[Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine]], which would remain in production until 1994. During the 1960s and 1970s, Alfa Romeo produced a number of sporty cars, though the Italian government parent company, [[Finmeccanica]], struggled to make a profit, so it sold the marque to the Fiat Group in 1986.

Alfa Romeo has competed successfully in many different categories of motorsport, including [[Grand Prix motor racing]], [[Formula One]], [[sportscar racing]], [[touring car racing]], and [[Rallying|rallies]]. It has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries (usually under the name [[Alfa Corse]] or [[Autodelta]]), and private entries. The first racing car was made in 1913, three years after the foundation of the company, and Alfa Romeo won the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. The company gained a good name in motorsport, which gave a sporty image to the whole marque. [[Enzo Ferrari]] founded the [[Scuderia Ferrari]] racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team, before becoming independent in 1939. It holds the world's title of the most wins of any marque in the world.<ref name="Henry12">

==History==

===Name===

The company's name is a combination of the original name, A.L.F.A. (Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili) and the last name of entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who took control of the company in 1915.

===Foundation and early years===
[[File:Alfa Romeo1906.jpg|upright|thumb|A 1908 Darracq 8/10 HP assembled by Alfa Romeo's predecessor, Darracq Italiana]]
[[File:ALFA-24-HP.jpg|thumb|right|The A.L.F.A 24 hp (this is with [[Carrozzeria Castagna|Castagna]] [[Torpedo (car)|torpedo]] body) was the first car made by Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili (A.L.F.A) in 1910.]]

The company that became Alfa Romeo was founded as '''Società Anonima Italiana Darracq''' (SAID) in 1906 by the French automobile firm of [[Alexandre Darracq]], with some Italian investors. One of them, Cavaliere [[Ugo Stella]], an [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] from [[Milan]], became chairman of the SAID in 1909.<ref name = "Story of the Alfa Romeo factory"/> The firm's initial location was in [[Naples]], but even before the construction of the planned factory had started, Darracq decided late in 1906 that Milan would be more suitable and accordingly a tract of land was acquired in the Milan suburb of [[Portello, Milan|Portello]], where a new factory of {{convert|6700|m2|sqyd}} was erected. Late 1909, the Italian Darracq cars were selling slowly and Stella, with the other Italian co-investors, founded a new company named '''A.L.F.A.''' (Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili), initially still in partnership with Darracq.  The first non-Darracq car produced by the company was the 1910 [[A.L.F.A 24 HP|24 HP]], designed by [[Giuseppe Merosi]], hired in 1909 for designing new cars more suited to the Italian market.  Merosi would go on to design a series of new A.L.F.A. cars, with more powerful engines ([[A.L.F.A 40/60 HP|40-60 HP]]). A.L.F.A. ventured into [[motor racing]], with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 [[Targa Florio]] with two 24-hp models. In 1914, an advanced Grand Prix car was designed and built, the [[Alfa Romeo Grand Prix|GP1914]], with a four-cylinder engine, double overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, and twin ignition.<ref>Fusi, Luigi, ''Le Alfa di Romeo e Merosi'', Edizione Dimensione S, Milan, 1985</ref> However, the onset of the [[First World War]] halted automobile production at A.L.F.A. for three years.

In August 1915, the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur [[Nicola Romeo]], who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts. Munitions, aircraft engines and other components, compressors, and generators based on the company's existing car engines were produced in a vastly enlarged factory during the war. After the war, Romeo invested his war profits in acquiring locomotive and railway carriage plants in Saronno (Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno), Rome (Officine Meccaniche di Roma), and Naples (Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali), which were added to his A.L.F.A. ownership.

Car production had not been considered at first, but resumed in 1919 since parts for the completion of 105 cars had remained at the A.L.F.A. factory since 1915.<ref name="Story of the Alfa Romeo factory">{{cite web|url=http://www.enzociliberto.it/aisastoryauto/news/cronache/docs/16-03-06-Story_of_the_Alfa_Romeo_factory_revised.pdf|format=PDF|title=P.

Giuseppe Merosi continued as head designer, and the company continued to produce solid road cars as well as successful race cars (including the 40-60 HP and the [[Alfa Romeo RL|RL Targa Florio]]).

In 1923 [[Vittorio Jano]] was lured from [[Fiat]], partly thanks to the persuasion of a young Alfa racing driver named [[Enzo Ferrari]], to replace Merosi as chief designer at Alfa Romeo. The first Alfa Romeo under Jano was the [[Alfa Romeo P2|P2 Grand Prix car]], which won Alfa Romeo the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. For road cars Jano developed a series of small-to-medium-displacement 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder inline engines based on the P2 unit that established the architecture of the company's engines, with light alloy construction, [[hemi|hemispherical combustion chambers]], centrally located plugs, two rows of overhead valves per cylinder bank and dual overhead cams. Jano's designs proved both reliable and powerful.

Enzo Ferrari proved a better team manager than driver, and when the factory team was privatised, it became [[Scuderia Ferrari]]. When Ferrari left Alfa Romeo, he went on to build his own cars. [[Tazio Nuvolari]] often drove for Alfa, winning many races before the [[Second World War]].

In 1928 Nicola Romeo left, and in 1933 Alfa Romeo was rescued by the government, which then had effective control. Alfa Romeo became an instrument of Mussolini's Italy, a national emblem. During this period it built bespoke vehicles for the wealthy, with bodies normally by [[Carrozzeria Touring|Touring of Milan]] or [[Pininfarina|Pinin Farina]]. This era peaked with the [[Alfa Romeo 8C|Alfa Romeo 2900B Type 35]] racers.

The Alfa factory (converted during wartime to the production of [[Macchi C.202 Folgore]] engines: the Daimler-Benz 600 series built under license) was bombed during the Second World War, and struggled to return to profitability after the war. The luxury vehicles were out. Smaller, mass-produced vehicles began to be produced beginning with the 1954 model year, with the introduction of the [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (750/101)|Giulietta]] series of ''berline'' (saloons/sedans), coupes and open two-seaters.  All three varieties shared what would become the [[Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine|Alfa Romeo overhead Twin Cam]] four-cylinder engine, initially 1300 cc. This engine would eventually be enlarged to 2000 cc and would remain in production until 1995.

===Post war===
Once motor sports resumed after the Second World War, Alfa Romeo proved to be the car to beat in Grand Prix events.  The introduction of the new formula ([[Formula One]]) for single-seat racing cars provided an ideal setting for Alfa Romeo's Tipo [[Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta|158 Alfetta]], adapted from a pre-war voiturette, and [[Giuseppe Farina]] won the first Formula One World Championship in 1950 in the 158.  [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] secured Alfa's second consecutive championship in 1951.

In 1952, Alfa Romeo experimented with its first front-wheel drive compact car, "Project 13-61".<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Rauen |url=http://alfasud.alfisti.net/ase.htm |title=Tim's Alfa Romeo Page - Alfasud |publisher=Alfasud.alfisti.net |date= |accessdate=2009-11-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091023094215/http://alfasud.alfisti.net/ase.htm| archivedate= 23 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  It had the same transverse-mounted, forward-motor layout as the modern front-wheel drive automobile. Alfa Romeo made a second attempt toward the late 1950s based on Project 13-61. It was to be called Tipo 103 and resembled the smaller version of its popular Alfa Romeo Giulia. However, due to the financial difficulties in post-war Italy, the Tipo 103 never saw production. Had Alfa Romeo produced it, it would have preceded the Mini as the first "modern" front-wheel drive compact car. In the mid-fifties, Alfa Romeo entered into an agreement with [[Brazil]]'s Matarazzo Group to create a company called Fabral (''Fábrica Brasileira de Automóveis Alfa'', "the Brazilian Alfa automobile factory") to build the [[Alfa Romeo 2000]] there. After having received government approval, Matarazzo pulled out and under pressure from Brazil's President [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] the state-owned [[Fábrica Nacional de Motores|FNM]] company instead commenced building the car as the "FNM 2000" there in 1960.<ref name=shapiro>{{cite journal | title = Determinants of Firm Entry into the Brazilian Automobile Manufacturing Industry, 1956-1968 | ref = HShap | first = Helen | last = Shapiro | volume = 65 | journal = The Business History Review | number = 4, The Automobile Industry |date=Winter 1991 | pages = 897, 907 }}</ref>

During the 1960s, Alfa Romeo concentrated on competition using production-based cars, including the [[Alfa Romeo GTA|GTA]] (standing for Gran Turismo Allegerita), an aluminium-bodied version of the [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]-designed coupe with a powerful twin-plug engine.  Among other victories, the GTA won the inaugural [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] championship in 1966.  In the 1970s, Alfa Romeo concentrated on prototype sports car racing with the [[Alfa Romeo Tipo 33|Tipo 33]], with early victories in 1971. Eventually the Tipo 33TT12 gained the [[1975 World Sportscar Championship season|World Championship for Makes]] for Alfa Romeo in 1975 and the Tipo 33SC12 won the [[1977 World Sportscar Championship season|World Championship for Sports Cars]] in 1977.<ref name="wspr-racing.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/wscc/tablemsmakes.html#1975-|title=1975 World Championship for Makes|accessdate=2010-08-17|work=wspr-racing.com}}</ref><ref name="www.wspr-racing.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/wscc/tablemsmakes.html#1977SP|title=1977 - SP World Sports Car Championship|accessdate=2010-08-17|work=www.wspr-racing.com}}</ref>

By the 1970s, Alfa Romeo was again in financial trouble and creative measures were attempted to shore it up, including an ultimately unsuccessful [[Alfa Romeo Arna|joint venture with Nissan]] endorsed by Ettore Massacesi of Alfa Romeo's parent company, the Italian-government owned Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) and Prime Minister [[Francesco Cossiga]]. By 1986, IRI was suffering heavy losses, and IRI president [[Romano Prodi]] put Alfa Romeo up for sale. Finmeccanica, the mechanical holdings arm of IRI and its predecessors owned Alfa Romeo since 1932. Prodi first approached fellow Italian manufacturer Fiat, which offered to start a joint venture with Alfa. Prodi was initially unsupportive, citing the strained industrial relations between Northern and Southern Italy, with Fiat being based in Turin and Alfa being based in Milan.{{Dubious|date=July 2013}}<!-- What has north/south got to do with Turin/Milan? -->

Fiat withdrew its plan for a joint venture when [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] put in an offer to acquire part of Alfa Romeo and restructure the company, while increasing its stake over time. However, Fiat put in a bid to acquire the entirety of Alfa Romeo and offer job guarantees to Italian workers, an offer that Ford was unwilling to match.

It also did not hurt any of the parties involved that an acquisition by Fiat would keep Alfa Romeo in Italian hands. In 1986, the deal was concluded with Alfa Romeo merged with traditional rival [[Lancia]] into Fiat's Alfa Lancia Industriale S.p.A.

Models produced from the 1990s combined Alfa's traditional virtues of avant-garde styling and sporting panache with the economic benefits of product rationalisation, and include a "GTA" version of the [[Alfa Romeo 147|147]] hatchback, the [[Giugiaro]]-designed [[Alfa Romeo Brera|Brera]], and a high-performance exotic called the [[Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione|8C Competizione]] (named after one of Alfa's most successful prewar sports and racing cars, the [[Alfa Romeo 8C|8C]] of the 1930s).

In 2005 [[Maserati]] was bought back from [[Ferrari]] and under Fiat's full control. The Fiat Group plans to create a sports and luxury division from Maserati and Alfa Romeo.<ref name="italiaspeed.com.">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2005/cars/maserati/07/future/1207.html|title=News 12.07.2005|accessdate=2012-06-11|work=italiaspeed.com.}}</ref> There is a planned strategic relationship between these two; engines, platforms and possibly dealers will be shared in some markets.<ref name="fiatgroup.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatspa.com/en-US/media_center/FiatDocuments/2005/APRILE/04-01-2005_nuova%20Maserati_eng.pdf|title=Press release 1 April 2005|accessdate=2012-06-11|work=fiatgroup.com}}</ref>

In the beginning of 2007, Fiat Auto S.p.A. was reorganized and four new automobile companies were created; Fiat Automobiles S.p.A., Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A., Lancia Automobiles S.p.A. and Fiat Light Commercial Vehicles S.p.A.

===Carabinieri and Italian government===

In the 1960s Alfa Romeo became famous for its small cars and models specifically designed for the [[Italian State Police|Italian police]] and [[Carabinieri]]; among them the "Giulia Super" and the 2600 Sprint GT. The colours of the Alfa Romeos used by the Polizia were/are green/blue with white stripes and writing, known as "Pantera" (Panther), enhancing the aggressive look of the Alfa (particularly the Giulia series), while the Carabinieri Alfas are dark blue with white roofs and red stripes, known as the "Gazzella" (Gazelle) denoting the speed and agility of these "Pattuglie" (patrol cars). However, the term "Pantera" became used interchangeably and the image helped create a no-nonsense, determined and respected perception by the general public of the men that drove these cars, true to their history.
[[File:It police alfa giulia 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Italian State Police]] [[Reparto volanti|Flying Squad]] "Panther" 1971 Alfa Giulia Super]]
Since then, Alfas remain the chosen mount of the [[Carabinieri]] (arm of the Italian armed forces seconded only partly for civilian policing purposes), Polizia Autostradale (highway police), [[Guardia di Finanza]] (fiscal law enforcement) and the conventional police service (Polizia). Successively, the following Alfa Romeo Berlinas have found favour for Italian police and government employment<ref name="poliziadistato.it">{{cite web|url=http://poliziadistato.it/articolo/1453-Le_Alfa_Romeo_con_il_Centauro|title=Le Alfa Romeo con il Centauro|accessdate=2010-09-12|work=poliziadistato.it|language=it}}</ref>

Since the 1960s, the Italian Prime Minister has used Alfa Romeos (and lately the new [[Maserati Quattroporte]]) as preferred government limousines. The 164 and 166 have found particular employment in the last two decades.

===Recent developments===
Alfa Romeo has been suffering from falling sales. Some analysts concluded that the automaker suffered large operating losses in the mid-2000s - estimated to be about 15 percent to 20 percent of annual revenues, or about 300 million to 500 million euros a year. For the year of 2010, it sold a total of about 112,000 units which was significantly lower than Fiat CEO Marchionne's global sales target of 300,000. Alfa then wanted to achieve 170,000 sales in 2011, including 100,000 Giulietta and 60,000 MiTo, but it actually sold 130,000 units that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatspa.com/en-US/investor_relations/financial_reports/FiatDocuments/Bilanci/2011/Fiat_AnnualReport_2011_ENG.pdf|title=FIAT S.p.A.

Since that time, rumours of a return culminated with a website announcement stating "The long-awaited return of Alfa Romeo to the United States market should take place by 2007, with a range of new models." In fact, Alfa Romeo's return to United States was officially confirmed on 5 May 2006 by Fiat CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]].

The next significant milestones in Alfa Romeo's North American return occurred in 2014, with the launch of the more affordable two-seater 4C coupe. That year, Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. confirmed that its original agreement with Mazda Motor Corporation, for the speculated manufacturing of a new Alfa Romeo Spider based on the Mazda Miata, had been terminated mutually in December 2014 (with this joint-venture's Miata-based car, becoming the new 2015 Fiat 124 convertible). In 2015, Alfa Romeo's return to this market was further bolstered by the automaker's display of the new [[Alfa Romeo Giulia (952)|Giulia]] at the Los Angeles Auto Show.

==Design and technology==
[[File:Alfa Romeo badge.jpg|thumb|Badge on [[Alfa Romeo 4C]]]]

===Technological development===
Alfa Romeo has introduced many technological innovations over the years, and the company has often been among the first users of new technologies. Its trademark [[double overhead cam]] engine was used for the first time in the 1914 [[Alfa Romeo Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] car,<ref name="europeancarweb.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.europeancarweb.com/features/0209ec_twin_cam_analysis/index.html|title=Tech Analysis: An Echo of the Past: The history and evolution of twin-cam engines|accessdate=2010-08-17|work=europeancarweb.com}}</ref> the first road car with such an engine, the [[Alfa Romeo 6C|6C 1500 Sport]], appeared in 1928.

Alfa Romeo tested one of the very first electric injection systems ([[Caproni]]-Fuscaldo) in the [[Alfa Romeo 6C|Alfa Romeo 6C 2500]] with "Ala spessa" body in 1940 [[Mille Miglia]]. The engine had six electrically operated injectors, fed by a semi-high pressure circulating fuel pump system.<ref name="digilander.libero.it">{{cite web|url=http://digilander.libero.it/spideralfaromeo/1940b.htm|title=1940 6C 2500 Touring "Ala Spessa"|accessdate=2009-04-11|work= digilander.libero.it|language=it}}</ref>

Mechanical [[Variable Valve Timing]] was introduced in the [[Alfa Romeo Spider]], sold in the U.S. in 1980.<ref name="alfaspiderfaq.org">{{cite web|url=http://alfaspiderfaq.org/spdrfaq_v3.pdf|title=Alfa Romeo Spider FAQ|accessdate=2010-08-17|work=alfaspiderfaq.org|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100917033438/http://alfaspiderfaq.org/spdrfaq_v3.pdf| archivedate= 17 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Electronic Variable Valve Timing was introduced in the (Alfetta){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

===Body design===
Many famous automotive design houses in Italy have accepted commissions to produce concepts and production vehicle shapes for Alfa Romeo. These include:

*[[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]
*[[Italdesign|Giorgetto Giugiaro / Italdesign]]
*[[Pininfarina]]
*[[Zagato]]
*Centro Stile Alfa Romeo

The last mentioned, the Centro Stile, has rapidly gained international credibility{{Vague|date=July 2013}}<!-- What does this mean (if anything)? --> with its work. The 8C Competizione super-coupé, and the MiTo hatchback are the results.

Construction techniques used by Alfa Romeo have become imitated by other car makers, and in this way Alfa Romeo body design has often been very influential. The following is a list of innovations, and where appropriate, examples of imitation by other car manufacturers:
[[File:Alfa 6C2500S.JPG|thumb|Alfa 6C 2500 S]]
*1950s: Monocoque body design in the Giulia:{{Dubious|date=July 2013}}<!-- A first? --> While not an imitation per se, this construction technique became extremely widespread, and remains so to the present day.
*1960s: Aerodynamics: The 116-series Giulia had a very low Cd. Toyota in particular sought to produce a similarly shaped series of vehicles at this time.
*1970s: Fairing of bumpers: In order to meet American crash standards, Alfa formulated design styling techniques to incorporate bumpers into the overall bodywork design of vehicles so as to not ruin their lines. The culmination of this design technique was the 1980s Alfa Romeo 75. The process was widely copied, particularly in Germany and Japan.
*1980s: The Alfa 164: The design process and influence of this car is almost completely out of all proportion to previous Alfas. The 164 introduced complete CAD/CAM in the manufacturing cycle, with very little directly made by hand in the vehicle. In addition, the 164's styling influence continues into the present day line of modern Alfas. Most manufacturers incorporated design ideas first expressed in the 164 into their own designs, including greater reliance on on-board computers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
*1990s: The pseudo-coupé: The Alfa 156 and 147, while four-door vehicles, represented themselves as two-doors with prominent front door handles, and less visible rear door-handle flaps. Honda has used this design style in the latest Civic hatchback, and a somewhat similar idea is also seen in the most recent Mazda RX-8 four-seat coupé.
*2000s: The Brera and 159: These vehicles' design, by Giorgetto Giugiaro, have proven influential in sedan and coupé styling, demonstrating that concept vehicles are often immediately translatable into road car form, providing that initial design takes place using CAD systems.

Alfa Romeo models have also inspired some very interesting and often beautiful concept cars. Here follows a short list of concept cars, and their impact on car design:

;1950s - The B.A.T. cars
The ''[[Alfa Romeo BAT|Berlina Aerodinamica Tecnica]]'' prototype cars were designed by Bertone as an exercise in determining whether streamlining and wind-tunnel driven designs would result in high performance on a standard chassis, and whether the resulting vehicles would be palatable to public. Alfa 1900 Sprint were the basis of the B.A.T. 5, 7 and 9.<ref name="conceptcarz.com/vehicle">{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z4824/Alfa-Romeo-BAT-7.aspx|title=1954 Alfa Romeo B.A.T. 7|accessdate=2009-06-11|work=conceptcarz.com/vehicle}}</ref> The later B.A.T. 11 was based on the 8C Competizione.

;1960s and 1970s - Descendants of the Tipo 33
The Tipo 33 racing car, with its high-revving 2000 cc V8 engine became the basis for a number of different concept cars during the 1960s and 1970s, two of which ultimately resulted in production vehicles. Most made their appearances at the Auto Salon Genève. Here is a brief list:
*Gandini/Bertone Carabo (1968) - Marcello Gandini expressed ideas that would come to fruition in the Lamborghini Countach.
*Tipo 33.2 (1969)- Designed by Pininfarina to the design already known from Ferrari concept car.
*Gandini/Bertone Montreal Concept (1967) - making its appearance at the 1967 Montreal Expo, this Giulia-based concept resulted in the production [[Alfa Romeo Montreal]] road car with a variant of the Tipo 33 V8 engine.
*Bertone/Giugiaro Navajo (1976)- A fully fibreglassed vehicle, and in some ways the epitome of Giugiaro's 'Origami' style of flat planes.

;1980s-today - Modern ideas
In general, concept cars for Alfa Romeo have generally become production vehicles, after some modification to make them suitable for manufacture, and to provide driver and passenger safety. The Zagato SZ, GTV and Spider, Brera and 159 are all good examples of Alfa Romeo's stylistic commitment in this direction.

;The future
Alfa Romeo concept cars have mostly emphasized performance in combination with historical tradition. The Nuvola Concept, and the independently designed Diva Concept cars have demonstrated that this ''ethos'' is the centre of Alfa conceptualisation. The Centro Stile website also gives designers very good direction in terms of the combination of line and form Alfa prefers to see in the design process of its cars' bodywork.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===The badge===

[[File:Paris - Retromobile 2014 - Alfa Romeo RL SS - 1925 - 003 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Laurel-wreathed 1925–1945 badges on a 1925 [[Alfa Romeo RL|Alfa Romeo RL SS]]]]

Alfa Romeo's badge incorporates two [[Heraldry|heraldic devices]] traditionally associated with its birthplace, the city of [[Milan]]. These are a red cross, from the [[Flag of Milan|emblem of Milan]], and the ''[[biscione]]'', a crowned viper swallowing a [[Moors|Moor]]—emblem of the [[House of Visconti]], rulers of the city in the 14th century.<ref name="AutoBadge">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TUBWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Romano+Cattaneo%22&dq=%22Romano+Cattaneo%22 |title=Autocar & Motor |volume=185 |page=67 |publisher=Haymarket |year=1990 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref><ref name="ultimateitaly.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateitaly.com/culture-antropology/visconti-family.html |title=The Visconti Family |accessdate=2010-08-17 |website=ultimateitaly.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100731015820/http://www.ultimateitaly.com/culture-antropology/visconti-family.html |archivedate=31 July 2010<!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no}}</ref>
The badge was originally designed in 1910 by a young Italian [[Technical drawing|draughtsman]] from the A.L.F.A technical office, Romano Cattaneo.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=807–808}}

====Origin====
In June 1910 the Società Anonima Darracq became Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili, and was readying its first model, the [[A.L.F.A 24 HP|24 HP]]. The [[Board of directors|board]] asked chief engineer [[Giuseppe Merosi]] to devise a badge for the radiator shell of the new car; Merosi turned to his collaborators.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=807–808}}
One of them, Cattaneo, was inspired by the [[coat of arms]] he had seen on the gates of [[Castello Sforzesco]] to include the ''biscione'' in the logo.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=807–808}} Merosi liked the idea, and together with Cattaneo came up with a sketch, then approved by managing director Ugo Stella; Cattaneo was entrusted with doing the final design.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=807–808}}

The original badge was round, of enamelled [[brass]], measuring {{convert|65|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and carried already all the present day accoutrements: the red cross on a white field of Milan on the left, a green ''biscione'' on a light blue field on the left, all surrounded by a blue ring inscribed with the words "ALFA" at the top and "MILANO" at the bottom.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=809–810}} In honour of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|King of Italy]], the two words were separated by two [[figure-eight knot]]s—named Savoy knots in Italian, and symbols of the then-reigning [[House of Savoy]]. Originally solid brass, the lettering was changed to white enamel in 1913.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=811–812}} In 1918, after the company had been bought by [[Nicola Romeo]], the wording "ALFA" was replaced with "ALFA-ROMEO".
In 1925, to commemorate the victory of the [[Alfa Romeo P2]] in the inaugural [[World Manufacturers' Championship]] of [[1925 Grand Prix season|1925]], a silver metal [[laurel wreath]] was added around the badge.<ref name="AutoBadge"/>{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=112}} The addition of the wreath had enlarged to badge {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter; in 1930 it was reduced back to {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=809–810}}

====Post war evolution====
In 1946, after the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|abolition of the monarchy]] and proclamation of the [[Italian Republic]], the figure-eight knots of the Savoy were replaced with two curvy lines.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=419}} Concurrently the badge was completely redesigned, and further reduced in size to {{convert|54|mm|in|abbr=on}}, a diameter unchanged ever since.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=809–810}} Made of stamped steel, the new badge bore the traditional elements—the scripts, the cross, a newly stylized ''biscione'' and a thin laurel wreath—embossed in antique silver, over a uniform [[Rosso corsa|Alfa Red]] background, which had replaced the blue, white and light blue fields.
This red-and-metal badge was used until 1950, when the company switched back to a traditionally enamelled and coloured one; in 1960 the badge was changed from brass to plastic, without substantial differences in design.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=419}}

At the beginning of the 1970s the all-new [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco plant]] (near [[Naples]]) was completed. When in 1972 the [[Alfa Romeo Alfasud|Alfasud]] produced there became the first Alfa Romeo passenger car manufactured outside Milan, the word "Milano", the curved lines and the hyphen between "Alfa" and "Romeo" were eliminated from the badge on all Alfa Romeos.{{sfnp|Fusi|1978|page=419}} At the same time it was redesigned, most notably acquiring a modernised ''biscione'' and [[type face]].
After a mild restyling in 1982, which deleted the wreath and changed lettering and all chrome details to gold, this iteration of the badge remained in use until 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omniauto.it/magazine/31227/alfa-romeo-nuovo-marchio-logo |title=Alfa Romeo, il nuovo logo nel segno della tradizione |first=Adriano |last=Tosi |website=omniauto.it |date=24 June 2015 |language=it |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>

====2015 redesign====
On 24 June 2015, 105th anniversary of the company, a completely new logo was unveiled at a press event at the [[Alfa Romeo Museum]]; together with the [[Alfa Romeo Giulia (2015)|Alfa Romeo Giulia]] that was introduced alongside it, is part of the brand's relaunch plan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/motori/sezioni/prodotto/2015/06/24/news/alfa_romeo_giulia-117607664/ |title=Alfa Romeo, ecco la nuova Giulia |first=Valerio |last=Berruti |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |date=24 June 2015 |language=it |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref> The redesign was carried out by Robilant Associati, who had previously reworked several other [[FCA Italy|Fiat Group]] logos—including [[Fiat Automobiles]]' and [[Lancia]]'s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alfa Romeo 2015 |url=http://www.robilant.it/it/clienti/cliente/alfa-romeo-2015/ |website=robilant.it |publisher=Robilant Associati |date=26 June 2015 |language=it |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> The colours have been reduced to three: the green of the ''biscione'', the red of the cross, and the dark blue of the surrounding ring. Other notable changes are new type face, and the disappearance of the split white and light blue fields, replaced by a single silver textured background.

===The ''Quadrifoglio''===
The ''quadrifoglio'' emblem (also called the 'cloverleaf') has been the symbol of Alfa Romeo racing cars since 1923. Following WWII, it has also been used to designate the higher trim models of the range. The ''quadrifoglio'' is usually placed on the side panels of the car, above or behind the front wheels—on the [[Fender (vehicle)|front wings]] in the case of modern vehicles. The symbol consists of a green [[clover]]leaf with four leaves, contained with a white triangle.

====History of the emblem====
[[File:Alfa-Romeo-P1-GP-byMerosi.jpg|thumb|[[Ugo Sivocci]] at the wheel of 1923 Alfa Romeo P1]]
The ''quadrifoglio'' has been used on Alfa Romeo cars since the death of [[Ugo Sivocci]] in 1923. As a friend of [[Enzo Ferrari]], Sivocci was hired by Alfa Romeo in 1920 to drive in the three-man works team—[[Alfa Corse]]—with [[Antonio Ascari]] and Enzo Ferrari. Sivocci was thought to have enormous experience, but often hampered by bad luck and considered the eternal second-placer. To banish his bad luck, when the [[Targa Florio]] came around, the driver painted a white square with a green four-leaf clover (the ''quadrifoglio'') in the centre of the grille of his car. Sivocci had immediate success, crossing the finish line first. The ''quadrifoglio'' subsequently became the symbol of the racing Alfa Romeos with the victory at the Targa Florio. Almost as if to prove the magic effects of this symbol, Sivocci was killed while testing [[Giuseppe Merosi|Merosi]]'s new [[Alfa Romeo P1|P1]] at [[Monza]], a few months after winning the Targa Florio. The [[Salerno]] driver's P1, which went off the track on a bend, did not have the ''quadrifoglio''. Since this period in 1923, the bodies of Alfa Romeo racing cars have been adorned with the ''quadrifoglio'' as a lucky charm. The white square was replaced with a triangle in memory of Uvo Sivocci.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio History|url=http://www.alfaromeo.com/com/#/models/quadrifoglio-verde/history|work=Alfa Romeo Automobillismo Storico, Centre Documentazione|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Alfetta 159.jpg|thumb|''Quadrifoglio'' badge on the Alfetta 159]]

====Modern usage====
The first road car to bear the ''quadrifoglio'' was the 1963 [[Alfa Romeo Giulia|Alfa Romeo Giulia TI Super]], a variant of the Giulia saloon car devised for competition but put regularly on sale; it had green four-leaf clovers on its front wings, without the triangle.
In the 1970s "Quadrifoglio Verde" or "Green Cloverleaf" became the trim level for each model's sportiest variant, equipped with the most powerful engine. The [[Alfa Romeo Alfasud|Alfasud]], [[Alfa Romeo Sprint|Sprint]], [[Alfa Romeo 33|33]], [[Alfa Romeo 75|75]], [[Alfa Romeo 164|164]] and [[Alfa Romeo 145 and 146|145]] all had Quadrifoglio Verde versions.
Also in the 1970s and through the 1980s golden four-leaf clover badges were used to denote the most luxurious and well-equipped variants of Alfa Romeo cars, named "Quadrifoglio Oro" or "Gold Cloverleaf".
The [[Alfa Romeo Alfasud|Alfasud]], [[Alfa Romeo Alfetta|Alfetta]], [[Alfa Romeo Alfa 6|Alfa 6]], [[Alfa Romeo 90|90]] and [[Alfa Romeo 33|33]] had Quadrifoglio Oro versions.
In recent times the ''quadrifoglio'' was revived on the 2007 [[Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione|Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and Spider]] eight-cylinder [[sports car]]s. With the current [[Alfa Romeo MiTo]] and [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (940)|Giulietta]] the Quadrifoglio Verde was reinstated as the sportiest trim level in the range, and green four-leaf clovers on the front wings are once again the hallmark of high-performance Alfa Romeos.
Alfa Romeo's 2016 sport sedan, the all-new [[Alfa Romeo Giulia (952)|Giulia]], will be launched first in Quadrifoglio trim before the release of the base models. Starting with the high-end model wearing that historic signature emblem, Alfa Romeo strives to reconquer the North American market after decades of absence.

==Motorsport==
[[File:AlfaRomeo 33TT12 Redman 19740519Spu.jpg|thumb|Brian Redman driving with Alfa Romeo 33 TT 12]]
{{Main|Alfa Romeo in motorsport}}

Alfa Romeo has been involved with motor racing since 1911, when it entered two [[A.L.F.A 24 HP|24 HP]] models on Targa Florio competition. In the 1920s and 30s it scored wins at many races and motoring events such as [[Targa Florio]], [[Mille Miglia]] and [[Le Mans 24 Hours|Le Mans]]. Great success continued with [[Formula One]], [[Prototypes]], Touring and Fast Touring. Private drivers also entered some [[rally (sports)|rally]] competitions, with fine results. Alfa Romeo has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries [[Alfa Corse]], [[Autodelta]] and private entries. Alfa Romeo's factory racing team was outsourced to Enzo Ferrari's [[Scuderia Ferrari]] between 1933 and 1938. Drivers included Tazio Nuvolari, who won the 1935 [[German Grand Prix]] at the Nürburgring.

==Production==

According to the current Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne, in order to reap [[economy of scale|economies of scale]], all new Alfa Romeo models will be made from the same basic platform. Even [[Maserati]] will share components with some Alfas.<ref>"Saving Fiat", ''The Economist,'' 3 December 2005, p. 64, vol. 377.</ref>

During the 1990s, Alfa Romeo moved car production to other districts in Italy. The [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d’Arco plant]] produced the 155, followed by the 145 and the 146, while the [[Alfa Romeo Arese Plant|Arese plant]] manufactured the 164 and new Spider and GTV. The 156 was launched in 1997, and became quite successful for Alfa Romeo; in 1998 it was voted “Car of the Year”. The same year a new flagship, the 166 (assembled in Rivalta, near Turin) was launched. At the beginning of the third millennium, the 147 was released, which won the prestigious title of “Car of the Year 2001”. In 2003 the Arese factory was closed.

The [[Alfa Romeo Arese Plant|Arese factory]] today hosts almost nothing and is nearly abandoned. What remains are some offices and the great [[Alfa Romeo Museum|Alfa Romeo Historical Museum]], a must-see for Alfa Romeo fans.

In the 60s, the main Alfa Romeo seat was moved from inside Milan to a very large and nearby area extending over the municipalities of [[Arese]], [[Lainate]] and [[Garbagnate Milanese]]. However, since then the Alfa seat is known to be in Arese, since the offices and the main entrance of the area are there.

In the late 1960s, a number of European automobile manufacturers established facilities in South Africa to assemble right hand drive vehicles. [[Fiat]] and other Italian manufacturers established factories along with these other manufacturers, Alfa-Romeos were assembled in [[Brits, North West|Brits]], outside [[Pretoria]] in the [[Transvaal Province]] of South Africa. With the imposition of sanctions by western powers in the 1970s and 1980s, South Africa became self-sufficient, and in car production came to rely more and more on the products from local factories. This led to a remarkable set of circumstances where between 1972 and 1989, South Africa had the greatest number of Alfa Romeos on the road outside of Italy. Even stranger, Alfa Romeos Brits plant was used from March 1983<ref name=TAM85>{{Cite book | title = Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 | editor = Mastrostefano, Raffaele | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A | ref = TAM85 | year = 1985 | pages = 30–31 | language = Italian | location = Milano | isbn = 88-7212-012-8 }}</ref> until 1985 to build [[Daihatsu Charade]]s for local consumption, but also for export to Italy in order to skirt Italian limits on Japanese imports.<ref>{{Citation

In late 1985, with the impending Fiat takeover and an international boycott of the South African [[Apartheid]] government, Alfa Romeo withdrew from the market and closed the plant. Tons of valuable parts were then bulldozed into the ground to escape paying import duties.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Trucks and light commercial vehicles===

In 1930 Alfa Romeo presented a light truck in addition to heavy LCVs based to [[Büssing]] constructions.<ref name="newedgeconcept.com ">{{cite web|url=http://newedgeconcept.com/host33/KB104/ALFA+TROLLEY5.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070605150251/http://newedgeconcept.com/host33/KB104/ALFA+TROLLEY5.pdf|archivedate=2007-06-05|format=PDF|title=Alfa Romeo trolleybusses |accessdate=2009-07-16|work=newedgeconcept.com via web.archive.org}}</ref> In the Second World War Alfa Romeo also built trucks for the Italian army ("35 tons anywhere") and later also for the German [[Wehrmacht]]. After the war, commercial motor vehicle production was resumed.

In co-operation with [[FIAT]] and [[Saviem]] starting from the 60s different light truck models were developed.

The production of heavy LCVs was terminated in 1967. In [[Brazil]] the heavy trucks were built still few years by Alfa Romeo subsidiary [[Fábrica Nacional de Motores]] under the name FNM. The last Alfa Romeo vans were the Alfa Romeo AR6 and AR8, rebadged versions of Iveco Daily and Fiat Ducato. The company also produced [[trolleybus]]es for many systems in Italy, Latin America,<ref name="tramz.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tramz.com/tb/i.html|title=Latin American Trolleybus Installations|accessdate=2009-06-17|work=tramz.com}}</ref> Sweden,<ref name="sparvagssallskapet.se">{{cite web|url=http://www.sparvagssallskapet.se/atlas/pdf/stockholm_trolley.pdf?PHPSESSID=5c5c5e86fc8bed850540ff764b28528f|title=Stockholm Trådbuss 20/1-1941 -- 31/8-1964|accessdate=2009-06-17|work=sparvagssallskapet.se}}</ref> Greece,<ref name="sptc.spb.ru">{{cite web|url=http://www.sptc.spb.ru/trol_rus.htm|title=Europe - Soviet Union & Exported ZIU Trolleybuses|accessdate=2009-06-17|work=sptc.spb.ru}}</ref> Germany, Turkey and South Africa.

===Concepts===
{{Main|Alfa Romeo concept cars}}

Design has always played a large role in the history of Alfa Romeo. There have been many Alfa Romeo concept cars, often made by famous design houses and designers. The [[Alfa Romeo BAT|BAT series]] of concepts from the 1950s was a collaboration with the Italian design house Bertone. Other famous Italian coachbuilders and design houses like [[Pininfarina]], [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]], [[Zagato]] and [[ItalDesign]]-Giugiaro have also played a great role in Alfa Romeo's history, and even today some of models are designed and constructed by them.

==Marketing and sponsorship==
[[File:Alfa-Romeo-2-First-Sail.jpg|thumb|upright|Alfa Romeo II on its first sail]]

During the years Alfa Romeo has been marketed with different slogans like: "The family car that wins races" used in the 1950s in Alfa Romeo 1900 marketing campaign, "racing since 1911" used on most 1960s Alfa advertisements,<ref name="ranwhenparked 1960s">{{cite web|url=http://ranwhenparked.net/2010/09/11/alfa-romeo-advertisements-the-1960s/|title=Alfa Romeo advertising: the 1960s.|accessdate=2011-08-19|work=ranwhenparked }}</ref> In the 1970s the Alfa Romeo 1750 GTV was marketed as "if this kind of handling is good enough for our racing cars, it’s good enough for you."<ref name="ranwhenparked 1970s">{{cite web|url=http://ranwhenparked.net/2010/09/19/alfa-romeo-advertising-the-1970s/|title=Alfa Romeo advertising: the 1970s.|accessdate=2011-08-19|work=ranwhenparked }}</ref> The Giulia Sprint GTA was marketed as "The car you drive to work is a champion".<ref name="autointell.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.autointell.com/european_companies/fiat/alfa-romeo/alfa-147-gta-03/alfa_147-gta-03.htm|title=Alfa Romeo : Alfa 147 GTA|accessdate=2011-08-19|work=autointell.com}}</ref>
More recent slogans used are "Mediocrity is a sin", "Driven by Passion", "Cuore Sportivo", "Beauty is not enough" and present day "Without heart we would be mere machines". Also other more recent ones are: "It's not a car, it's an Alfa Romeo.", one of them after a couple argue in Italian. Another instance where a female colleague tells her male colleague that she didn't get a car she got an Alfa Romeo.

As part of its marketing policy, Alfa Romeo sponsors a number of sporting events, such as the [[Mille Miglia]] rally.<ref name="1000miglia.eu">{{cite web|url=http://www.1000miglia.eu/inglese/home.html?http://www.1000miglia.eu/inglese/partecipare/informazioni/disposizioni_generali.html#|title=sponsors|accessdate=2009-07-09|work=1000miglia.eu}}</ref> It has sponsored the SBK [[Superbike World Championship]] and [[Ducati]] Corse since 2007, and the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] for many years, and was one of the featured brands in 2010 when Alfa Romeo celebrated its 100th anniversary.<ref name="www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/alfa_romeo">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/alfa_romeo/11/goodwood/2111.html|title=21.11.2009 Centenary celebrating Alfa Romeo to take centre stage at Festival Of Speed|accessdate=2009-11-21|work=www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/alfa_romeo| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091125161938/http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/alfa_romeo/11/goodwood/2111.html| archivedate= 25 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="goodwood.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwood.co.uk/site/content/festivalofspeed/Sponsors.aspx|title=Goodwood Festival of Speed - Sponsors |accessdate=2009-07-09|work=goodwood.co.uk| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090614023534/http://www.goodwood.co.uk/Site/Content/FestivalOfSpeed/Sponsors.aspx| archivedate= 14 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (2010)|Alfa Romeo Giulietta]] has been used since Monza 2010 race as the safety car in Superbike World Championship events.<ref name="worldsbk.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsbk.com/en/news/latest-news/3354-alfa-romeo-present-new-giulietta-safety-car.html|title=Alfa Romeo present new Giulietta Safety Car|accessdate=2010-05-15|work=worldsbk.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100618033307/http://www.worldsbk.com/en/news/latest-news/3354-alfa-romeo-present-new-giulietta-safety-car.html| archivedate= 18 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Alfa Romeo has been also sponsor of [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] football club since 2013.
