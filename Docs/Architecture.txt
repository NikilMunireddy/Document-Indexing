'''Architecture''' (Latin ''[[wikt:architectura#Latin|architectura]]'', from the Greek [[wikt:ἀρχιτέκτων|ἀρχιτέκτων]] ''arkhitekton'' "architect", from [[wikt:ἀρχι-|ἀρχι-]] "chief" and [[wikt:τέκτων|τέκτων]] "builder") is both the process and the product of [[planning]], [[design]]ing, and [[construction|constructing]] buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of [[building]]s, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as [[work of art|works of art]]. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.

"Architecture" can mean:
*A general term to describe buildings and other physical structures.<ref name=OED/>
*The art and science of [[design]]ing [[building]]s and (some) [[nonbuilding structure]]s.<ref name=OED/>
*The style of design and method of construction of [[building]]s and other physical structures.<ref name=OED/>
*The knowledge of art, science & technology and humanity.<ref name=OED/>
*The practice of the [[architect]], where architecture means offering or rendering professional services in connection with the design and construction of buildings, or built environments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm |title=Gov.ns.ca |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date= |accessdate=2 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721200353/http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm| archivedate= 21 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>
*The design activity of the architect,<ref name=OED/> from the macro-level ([[urban design]], [[landscape architecture]]) to the micro-level (construction details and furniture).

Architecture has to do with planning and designing form, space and ambience to reflect functional, technical, social, environmental and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of materials and technology, and of light and shadow. Often, conflicting requirements must be resolved. The practice of Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimation and construction administration. Documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, defines the [[structure]] and/or [[behavior]] of a building or other kind of [[system]] that is to be or has been constructed.

The word "architecture" has also been adopted to describe other designed systems, especially in [[information technology]].<ref name=OED>''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993), Oxford, ISBN 0 19 860575 7</ref>

===Historic treatises===
[[File:O Partenon de Atenas adj.JPG|thumb|alt=The Parthenon is a rectangular building of white marble with eight columns supporting a pediment at the front, and a long line of columns visible at the side|The [[Parthenon]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]], "the supreme example among architectural sites." [[Banister Fletcher|(Fletcher)]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''</ref>]]
The earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is ''[[De architectura]]'', by the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] in the early 1st century AD.<ref name="Vitruvius">D. Rowland – T.N. Howe: Vitruvius. Ten Books on Architecture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1999, ISBN 0-521-00292-3</ref> According to Vitruvius, a good building should satisfy the three principles of ''firmitas, utilitas, venustas'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenvisit.com/landscape/LIH/history/vitruvius.htm#ch1-3|title=Vitruvius Ten Books on Architecture, with regard to landscape and garden design|work=gardenvisit.com}}</ref><ref name="elements">{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/home.html |title=Vitruvius |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> commonly known by the original translation – ''firmness, commodity and delight''. An equivalent in modern English would be:
* Durability – a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition.
* Utility – it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used.
* Beauty – it should be aesthetically pleasing.
According to Vitruvius, the architect should strive to fulfill each of these three attributes as well as possible.
[[Leon Battista Alberti]], who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, [[De Re Aedificatoria]], saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the [[Golden ratio|Golden mean]].
The most important aspect of beauty was therefore an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially; and was based on universal, recognisable truths. The notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th century, with the writing of [[Vasari]]:<ref>Françoise Choay, ''Alberti and Vitruvius'', editor, Joseph Rykwert, Profile 21, Architectural Design, Vol 49 No 5-6</ref> by the 18th century, his [[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]] had been translated into Italian, French, Spanish and English. 
[[File:Palace of Westminster.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Houses of Parliament in London, seen across the river, are a large Victorian Gothic building with two big towers and many pinnacles|The [[Houses of Parliament]], Westminster, master-planned by [[Charles Barry]], with interiors and details by A.W.N. Pugin]]
In the early 19th century, [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin]] wrote ''Contrasts'' (1836) that, as the titled suggested, contrasted the modern, industrial world, which he disparaged, with an idealized image of neo-medieval world. [[Gothic architecture]], Pugin believed, was the only "true Christian form of architecture."

The 19th-century English art critic, [[John Ruskin]], in his ''[[Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'', published 1849, was much narrower in his view of what constituted architecture. Architecture was the "art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by men ... that the sight of them" contributes "to his mental health, power, and pleasure".<ref name=Ruskin>John Ruskin, ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'', G. Allen (1880), reprinted Dover, (1989) ISBN 0-486-26145-X</ref>

For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance. His work goes on to state that a building is not truly a work of architecture unless it is in some way "adorned". For Ruskin, a well-constructed, well-proportioned, functional building needed string [[Course (architecture)|courses]] or [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]], at the very least.<ref name=Ruskin/>

On the difference between the ideals of ''architecture'' and mere ''[[construction]]'', the renowned 20th-century architect [[Le Corbusier]] wrote: "You employ stone, wood, and concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say: This is beautiful. That is Architecture".<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Towards a New Architecture'', Dover Publications(1985). ISBN 0-486-25023-7</ref>

Le Corbusier's contemporary [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] said "Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/ludwigmies116040.html|title=Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins. - Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at BrainyQuote|work=BrainyQuote}}</ref>

===Modern concepts of architecture===
The notable 19th-century architect of skyscrapers, [[Louis Sullivan]], promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: "[[Form follows function]]".

While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of "function" in place of [[Vitruvius]]' "utility". "Function" came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception and enjoyment of a [[building]], not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural.

[[File:Sydney Opera House Sails edit02 adj.JPG|left|thumb|alt=The Sydney Opera House appears to float on the harbour. It has numerous roof-sections which are shaped like huge shining white sails|[[Sydney Opera House]], [[Australia]] designed by [[Jørn Utzon]]]]

Nunzia Rondanini stated, "Through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other human sciences. Through its own particular way of expressing [[Architectural design values|values]], architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that, in and of itself, it will promote social development.'

To restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art's sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality".<ref>Rondanini, Nunzia ''Architecture and Social Change'' Heresies II, Vol. 3, No. 3, New York, Neresies Collective Inc., 1981.</ref>

Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are [[rationalism]], [[empiricism]], [[structuralism]], [[poststructuralism]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

In the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of [[sustainability]], hence [[sustainable architecture]]. To satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable power sources for heating, cooling, water and waste management and [[lighting]].

==History==
{{Main|History of architecture}}

===Origins and vernacular architecture===
{{main|Vernacular architecture}}
[[File:Stærnes Søndre Loft, Rollag.jpg|thumb|alt=A small hut composed entirely of split logs, and raised above the ground on stout upright stumps.|Vernacular architecture in [[Norway]]]]Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (shelter, security, worship, etc.) and means (available [[building material]]s and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a [[craft]], and "architecture" is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft.
It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed [[vernacular architecture]] continues to be produced in many parts of the world. Indeed, vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day.
Early human settlements were mostly [[rural]]. Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating [[urban area]]s which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases, such as that of [[Çatal Höyük]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day [[Pakistan]].

[[File:All Gizah Pyramids-3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The three main Pyramids at Gizeh shown rising from the desert sands with three smaller pyramids in front of them|The Pyramids at [[Giza Plateau|Giza]] in [[Egypt]]]]

===Ancient architecture===
In many ancient civilizations, such as those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, architecture and urbanism reflected the constant engagement with the divine and the [[supernatural]], and many ancient cultures resorted to monumentality in architecture to represent symbolically the political power of the ruler, the ruling elite, or the state itself.

The architecture and [[urbanism]] of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical civilizations]] such as the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or empirical ones and new building types emerged. Architectural "style" developed in the form of the [[Classical orders]].

Texts on architecture have been written since ancient time. These texts provided both general advice and specific formal prescriptions or canons. Some examples of canons are found in the writings of the 1st-century BCE Roman Architect [[Vitruvius]]. Some of the most important early examples of canonic architecture are religious.

[[File:Kinkaku3411.jpg|thumb|alt= The Golden Pavilion is a building of three storeys with encircling balconies and curving roofs, overlooking a tranquil lake and woods|[[Kinkaku-ji]] (Golden Pavilion), [[Kyoto]], Japan]]

===Asian architecture===
Early Asian writings on architecture include the ''Kao Gong Ji'' of [[China]] from the 7th–5th centuries BCE; the [[Shilpa Shastras]] of ancient [[India]] and [[Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra]] of [[Sri Lanka]].

The architecture of different parts of [[Asia]] developed along different lines from that of Europe; Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh architecture each having different characteristics. Buddhist architecture, in particular, showed great regional diversity. Hindu temple architecture, which developed around the 3rd century BCE, is governed by concepts laid down in the Shastras, and is concerned with expressing the macrocosm and the microcosm. In many [[Asia]]n countries, pantheistic religion led to architectural forms that were designed specifically to enhance the [[natural landscape]].

===Islamic architecture===
{{Main|Islamic architecture}}
Islamic architecture began in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]], incorporating architectural forms from the ancient [[Middle East]] and [[Byzantium]], but also developing features to suit the religious and social needs of the society. Examples can be found throughout the Middle East, North Africa, Spain and the Indian Sub-continent. The widespread application of the pointed arch was to influence European architecture of the Medieval period.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Notredame Paris.JPG|thumb|alt=Notre Dame, Paris, is a grand Gothic cathedral with Towers at one end and a small spire rising from the centre of the roof.|[[Notre Dame de Paris]], [[France]]]]
In [[Europe]] during the [[Medieval]] period, [[guild]]s were formed by craftsmen to organise their trades and written contracts have survived, particularly in relation to ecclesiastical buildings. The role of architect was usually one with that of master mason, or ''Magister lathomorum'' as they are sometimes described in contemporary documents.

The major architectural undertakings were the buildings of abbeys and [[cathedral]]s. From about 900 CE onwards, the movements of both clerics and tradesmen carried architectural knowledge across Europe, resulting in the pan-European styles [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]].

[[File:VillaCapra 2007 07 18 3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=La Rotunda is a domed domestic building of which two sides can be seen, with identical classical porticos, indicating that it is the same on all sides.|''[[La Rotonda]]'' (1567), [[Italy]] by [[Palladio]]]]

===Renaissance and the architect===
{{Main|Renaissance architecture}}
In [[Renaissance]] Europe, from about 1400 onwards, there was a revival of Classical learning accompanied by the development of [[Renaissance Humanism]] which placed greater emphasis on the role of the individual in society than had been the case during the Medieval period. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects – [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Palladio]] – and the cult of the individual had begun. There was still no dividing line between [[artist]], [[architect]] and [[engineer]], or any of the related vocations, and the appellation was often one of regional preference.

A revival of the Classical style in architecture was accompanied by a burgeoning of science and engineering which affected the proportions and structure of buildings. At this stage, it was still possible for an artist to design a bridge as the level of structural calculations involved was within the scope of the generalist.

===Early modern and the industrial age===
[[File:Paris Opera full frontal architecture, May 2009 sky.JPG|thumb|alt=The Opera House in Paris is an ornate 19th century building decorated with much sculptured detail.|[[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]] by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] (1875), France]]
With the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology, architecture and [[engineering]] began to separate, and the architect began to concentrate on [[aesthetics]] and the humanist aspects, often at the expense of technical aspects of building design. There was also the rise of the "gentleman architect" who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes, typified by the many country houses of Great Britain that were created in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo Gothic]] or [[Scottish Baronial]] styles.
Formal architectural training in the 19th century, for example at [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[France]], gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility. Effective architects generally received their training in the offices of other architects, graduating to the role from draughtsmen or clerks.

Meanwhile, the [[Industrial Revolution]] laid open the door for mass production and consumption. Aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products, once within the province of expensive craftsmanship, became cheaper under machine production.

[[Vernacular architecture]] became increasingly ornamental. House builders could use current architectural design in their work by combining features found in pattern books and architectural journals.

===Modernism===
{{Main|Modern architecture}}
[[File:Bauhaus.JPG|thumb|right|The Bauhaus is a Moderne building of massed rectangular shapes, with the name as a significant decorative element|The [[Bauhaus]] Dessau architecture department from 1925 by [[Walter Gropius]]]]

Around the beginning of the 20th century, a general dissatisfaction with the emphasis on revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern Architecture. Notable among these is the [[Deutscher Werkbund]], formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine made objects. The rise of the profession of industrial design is usually placed here. Following this lead, the [[Bauhaus]] school, founded in [[Weimar]], Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis—the apex—of art, craft, and technology.

When [[modern architecture]] was first practiced, it was an [[avant-garde]] movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after [[World War I]], pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order. The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms. 
[[File:Fallingwater, also known as the Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr., residence, Pennsylvania, by Carol M. Highsmith.jpg|thumb|left|"Fallingwater" is a house built of horizontal rectangular shapes arranged in a seemingly haphazard way in a natural setting, right over a small waterfall|''[[Fallingwater]]'', [[organic architecture]] by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]]]
Architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] developed [[Organic architecture]], in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose, with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being [[Robie House]] and [[Fallingwater]].

[[File:Crys-ext.jpg|thumb|alt=The Crystal Cathedral is a built in a modern style with panels of glass set in metal frames making both the walls and roof. A tall tower of the same materials rises beside it|The [[Crystal Cathedral]], [[California]], by [[Philip Johnson]] (1980)]]
Architects such as [[Mies van der Rohe]], [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the [[Industrial Revolution]], including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] designed by [[Minoru Yamasaki]].

===Postmodernism===

Many architects resisted [[modernism]], finding it devoid of the decorative richness of historical styles. As the first generation of modernists began to die after [[WWII]], a second generation of architects including [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and [[Eero Saarinen]] tried to expand the aesthetics of modernism with [[Brutalism]], buildings with expressive sculptural façades made of unfinished concrete. But an even new younger postwar generation critiqued modernism and Brutalism for being too austere, standardized, monotone, and not taking into account the richness of human experience offered in historical buildings across time and in different places and cultures.

One such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and Brutalism is the school of [[metaphoric architecture]], which includes such things as [[biomorphism]] and [[zoomorphic architecture]], both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design.  While it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of [[postmodernism]], others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of [[expressionist architecture]].<ref name=metaphor>

Beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s, [[architectural phenomenology]] emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism, with architects like [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]] in the [[USA]],  [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] in [[Norway]], and [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]] and [[Vittorio Gregotti]] in [[Italy]], who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture's Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = Minneapolis| pages =  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn&source=gbs_book_other_versions  | isbn=9780816666041}}</ref> Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials, with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles, from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles. [[Robert Venturi]] famously defined postmodern architecture as a "decorated shed" (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside), and upheld it against modernist and brutalist "ducks" (buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms).<ref>{{cite book  | last =Venturi  | first =Robert  | title =Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture  | publisher =Museum of Modern Art| year =1966 | location = New York| pages =| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=0c1OQwAACAAJ&dq=complexity+and+contradiction+in+architecture&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMI6IXR7M6RyQIViuMmCh3XoQJu | isbn=}}</ref>

===Architecture today===
[[File:Oriente Station Lisboa roof.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Railway station in Lisbon has a fibreglass roof supported on piers with radiating arms resembling Gothic columns, arches and vaults|Postmodern design at [[Gare do Oriente]], [[Lisbon]], Portugal, by [[Santiago Calatrava]]]]

Since the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect <ref group="Notes">A design architect is one who is responsible for the design.</ref> from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.<ref group="Notes">A project architect is one who is responsible for ensuring the design is built correctly and who administers building contracts – in non-specialist architectural practices the project architect is also the design architect and the term refers to the differing roles the architect plays at differing stages of the process.</ref> The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. 
[[Modern architecture|Modernism]] and [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]] have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences. 
[[File:Green Roof at Vendée Historial, les Lucs.jpg|thumb|alt= A low building has a roof completely covered with soil and grass. It appears to be built into a hillside|[[Green roof]] planted with native species at L'Historial de la Vendée, a new [[Museum architecture|museum]] in western [[France]]]] 
Environmental [[sustainability]] has become a mainstream issue, with profound effect on the architectural profession. Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in [[Passive solar building design]], [[Green roof|greener roof designs]], [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], in the 1960s by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and in the 1970s by architects such as [[Ian McHarg]] and [[Sim Van der Ryn]] in the US and [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] in the UK and New Zealand. <!---STOP! Every architecture student on the planet NOW has a teacher or knows an architect who supports ecological sustainability. Don't put ALL the names in here.---> There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet [[green building]] [[sustainable design]] principles.
