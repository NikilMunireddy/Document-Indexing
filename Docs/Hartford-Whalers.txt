The '''Hartford Whalers''' were an [[United States|American]] professional [[ice hockey]] team based for most of its existence in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]. The club played in the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) from [[1972–73 WHA season|1972]] until [[1978–79 WHA season|1979]], and in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) from [[1979–80 NHL season|1979]] to [[1996–97 NHL season|1997]]. Originally based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the team joined the WHA in the League's inaugural 1972 season, and was known as the '''New England Whalers''' throughout their time in the WHA. The Whalers moved to Hartford in 1974 and joined the NHL in the [[NHL–WHA merger]] of 1979.

In 1997, the Whalers franchise relocated to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], where they became the '''[[Carolina Hurricanes]]''' (now based in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]).

==WHA history==

===Early seasons in Boston (1971–1974)===

The Whalers franchise was born in November 1971 when the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) awarded a franchise to [[New England]] businessmen [[Howard Baldwin]], John Coburn, [[W. Godfrey Wood]] and [[William Edward Barnes]] to begin play in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The team began auspiciously, signing former [[Detroit Red Wings]] star [[Tom Webster (ice hockey)|Tom Webster]], hard rock [[Boston Bruins]]' [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenseman]] [[Ted Green]] (the team's inaugural [[Captain (hockey)|captain]]), [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]' defensemen [[Rick Ley]], [[Jim Dorey]] and [[Brad Selwood]], and former [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]' [[goaltender]] [[Al Smith (hockey)|Al Smith]].

New England also signed an unusually large number of American players, including Massachusetts natives and former [[United States men's national ice hockey team|U.S. Olympic hockey team]] members [[Larry Pleau]] (who had been a regular with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] the previous season), [[Kevin Ahearn]], [[John Cunniff]] and [[Paul Hurley]]. Two other ex-U.S. Olympians on the Whalers' roster ([[Minnesota]]ns [[Timothy Sheehy (ice hockey)|Timothy Sheehy]] and [[Tom Williams (ice hockey b. 1940)|Tommy Williams]]) had spent a significant part of their careers in Boston with [[Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey|Boston College]] and the Bruins, respectively.[[Image:NewEnglandWhalers.png|thumb|left|New England Whalers logo 1972-1979|180x180px]]

The Whalers would have the WHA's best regular-season record in the [[1972–73 WHA season|1972–73 season]], with Webster leading the team in scoring and rampaging through the playoffs, and behind legendary ex-[[Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey|Boston University]] Head Coach [[Jack Kelley (ice hockey)|Jack Kelley]], would defeat the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]] to win the inaugural [[Avco World Trophy]], the WHA championship.

===Relocation to Hartford (1974)===

The club played its first season at [[Boston Arena]], moving to [[Boston Garden]] in 1973. However, the Garden was owned by the rival NHL Bruins, and the Whalers found themselves fourth in priority for dates behind the Bruins, [[Boston Celtics]] and even the [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Boston Braves (AHL)|Boston Braves]]. Fed up with the situation, Baldwin decided to move elsewhere.

In a stroke of luck, Hartford was about to open a new, modern downtown arena and convention center, the [[XL Center|Hartford Civic Center]]. The city had initially hoped to get an [[American Basketball Association]] team as the main tenant, but when that fell through, city leaders got in touch with the Whalers. The area, aside from various minor league teams in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], had been largely bereft of professional hockey until the Whalers' arrival. The Civic Center was still being finished when the 1974–75 season began, so the Whalers played the first part of the 1974–75 season at [[The Big E Coliseum]] in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], Massachusetts.

On January 11, [[1974–75 WHA season|1975]], the team played its first game in front of a sellout crowd at the Hartford Civic Center. The franchise remained in Hartford until it relocated to North Carolina for the [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98 season]], save for a temporary relocation to the nearby [[Springfield Civic Center]] in the late 1970s while their Hartford arena was being rebuilt after heavy snow followed by heavy rain caused the roof to collapse, which suffered from several engineering and construction shortcomings.<ref>[http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Hartford%20Civic%20Center/hartford.htm Hartford Civic Center Arena Roof Collapse]</ref>

Though they never again won the WHA championship, the New England Whalers were a successful team, never missing the playoffs in League history, and finishing first in its division three times. They had a more stable roster than most WHA teams—Ley, Webster, Selwood, Pleau, and [[Tommy Earl]] would all play over 350 games with the club—and scored a major coup when they signed legend [[Gordie Howe]] and his sons [[Mark Howe|Mark]] and [[Marty Howe|Marty]] from the [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston Aeros]] in 1977.

While the first two full seasons in Hartford were not glittering (the Whalers recorded losing records both years), the final two WHA seasons saw more success. They went to the finals again in [[1977–78 WHA season|1978]], with a veteran team spearheaded by the Howes—50-year-old Gordie led the team in scoring—future NHL stars [[Gordie Roberts]] and [[Mike Rogers (ice hockey)|Mike Rogers]], All-Star defenseman [[Ron Plumb]], and forwards [[John McKenzie (ice hockey)|John McKenzie]], [[Dave Keon]] and [[Mike Antonovich (ice hockey)|Mike Antonovich]], and possessed of the League's best defense. The next season was not so fine, however, but while age finally caught up with Gordie Howe, the slack was picked up by [[André Lacroix (ice hockey)|Andre Lacroix]], the WHA's all-time leading scorer, acquired from the Aeros.

===Admission to the NHL===

As the Whalers were one of the most stable WHA teams, it was one of the four franchises admitted to the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) when the rival leagues [[NHL–WHA merger|merged]] in 1979. Following lobbying from the Boston Bruins, one of the conditions of the merger stipulated that the Whalers were to drop "New England" from their name. The Howes, Rogers, Ley, Keon, Smith, Roberts and Lacroix would go on to wear the uniform of the Hartford Whalers. The team also changed its colors to blue and green, a combination which was unused in the NHL at the time.

Unlike the other former WHA teams, the Whalers were not stripped of most of their players. Only Selwood, [[George Lyle (hockey)|George Lyle]] and [[Warren Miller (ice hockey)|Warren Miller]] were reclaimed by their former NHL teams.

[[File:Hartford Whalers Logo-79-92.svg|right|thumb|The original Hartford Whalers logo (1979–1992), designed by Peter Good, a Connecticut-based graphic designer. The logo combines a green "W" with a blue whale's tail to create the letter "H" in the negative (white) space. This logo was updated in 1992, the most noticeable change being the darkening of the colors and the addition of a silver background. Subtle changes to the shape of the whale's tail were also made, resulting in the logo seen at the top right of this page.]]

The Whalers were never as successful in the NHL as they had been in the WHA, yet they attracted a decent fan base over the years. They recorded three winning seasons in their 18 years in the NHL, made the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] eight times and won one playoff series, earning the nickname "Forever .500s" in mocking jest of their winning percentage. Whenever they did make the playoffs, they faced the near-certainty of having to get past the Boston Bruins or Montreal Canadiens to make it to the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] Finals. The team developed a heated rivalry with the Bruins, who were based just two hours northeast of Hartford, because of the fact that they used to play in the same building. These games usually attracted the Whalers' largest crowds, as many Bruins fans followed their team to Hartford. The Whalers an all-time, head-to-head record of 37–69–12 against Boston.

The Whalers were hampered by numerous off-ice factors. Hartford was the smallest American market in the NHL and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for Boston and the two [[New York]] teams, the [[New York Rangers|Rangers]] and [[New York Islanders|Islanders]]. This limited the team's marketability. Additionally, for most of the Whalers' tenure as an NHL team, the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the League. At its maximum, it seated just 15,635 for hockey. The team only averaged over 14,000 fans twice in their 15 years at the Civic Center. They averaged only 13,867 from 1980 to 1997. Most of their sellouts came when the Bruins or New York Rangers played in Hartford, which brought thousands of their fans with them.

===Inaugural NHL season===
The Whalers' first NHL season in [[1979–80 Hartford Whalers season|1979–80]] looked somewhat promising. They were led by [[Mike Rogers (ice hockey)|Mike Rogers]], [[Blaine Stoughton]], [[Dave Keon]], [[Mark Howe]], [[Rick Ley]], NHL legend [[Gordie Howe]] and the all-time WHA leading scorer, [[André Lacroix (ice hockey)|Andre Lacroix]], along with the franchise's first starting goaltender, [[Al Smith (ice hockey)|Al Smith]]. The Whalers also acquired another NHL legend, [[Bobby Hull]], near the [[NHL trade deadline]] in 1980. They finished the season with 73 points and a playoff berth and had the best record of the four former WHA franchises that entered the NHL in 1979–80. Along with the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the Whalers are the most recent first year expansion franchise to make the playoffs in their inaugural season in the NHL. In the first round of the playoffs, the Whalers were swept by the [[Montreal Canadiens]] three games to none. Following this season, Gordie Howe, Bobby Hull and Andre Lacroix all announced their retirements from professional hockey.

===The early 1980s===
Following the 1979–80 season, the Whalers had many aging veterans left over from their WHA days. To make matters worse, the Whalers reputation of making disastrous trades began to unfold, as the team began to trade away stars for mediocre players in an attempt to gain depth. For instance, they traded star defenseman Mark Howe and their first NHL scoring leader, Mike Rogers, in separate deals for players and draft picks which never panned out, and also swapped defensive-defenseman [[Gordie Roberts]], who would go on to play 15 remaining professional seasons, for the remaining half-season of [[Mike Fidler]]'s NHL career. The Whalers bottomed out in the [[1982–83 Hartford Whalers season|1982–83 season]] with a record of 19–54–7 (45 points), ranked 20th out of 21 teams in the NHL standings. On May 2, 1983, the Whalers hired [[Emile Francis]] as their new general manager to rebuild the team. About two months later, on July 7, Francis hired [[Jack Evans (ice hockey)|Jack Evans]] to be the Whalers' new head coach. By the end of the [[1986–87 Hartford Whalers season|1986–87 season]], Francis had cut or traded away every player from the 1982–83 Whalers' roster save for [[Ron Francis]] and [[Paul MacDermid]].

===Success in the mid-1980s===
The team had a brief moment of success in the [[1985–86 Hartford Whalers season|1985–86]] and [[1986–87 Hartford Whalers season|1986–87]] seasons. The Whalers began 1985–86 looking like a playoff contender. By the end of January, they had a record of 26–20–1 for 53 points after 47 games. At this time, however, the Whalers began to struggle when they lost their franchise player Ron Francis and star goal scorer [[Kevin Dineen]] to injuries. As a result, the Whalers struggled through February, winning just two games in the month and in danger of missing the playoffs for the sixth year in a row. In March, Francis and Dineen returned from their injuries and the Whalers put up a record of 12–4–2 in the months of March and April. The Whalers finished fourth in the [[Adams Division]] in the 1985–86 regular season, earning themselves a playoff berth for the first time since 1980. The Whalers went on to eliminate the first-place [[Quebec Nordiques]] in a three-game sweep in the first round, winning their first, and only, NHL playoff series in Hartford. The Whalers then pushed the division finals to seven games, losing the final game 2–1 in overtime to the eventual [[Stanley Cup]] champions, the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. The Canadiens disposed of both the Rangers and [[Calgary Flames]] in five games in the Conference Finals and Stanley Cup Finals, respectively.

The following season, 1986–87, the Whalers won their lone division championship, led by centers Ron Francis and [[Ray Ferraro]], emerging winger Kevin Dineen, defenseman [[Ulf Samuelsson]], superstar goaltender [[Mike Liut]] and troubled scorer [[Sylvain Turgeon]]. The 93 points earned that season were the most they would earn as an NHL team in Hartford; however, they were quickly eliminated in the first round by the Nordiques. The Whalers started the series strongly, winning the first two games at home, but, beginning in Game 3, the Nordiques were able to successfully take the Whalers off their game by playing a tough, chippy style of hockey. As a result, both teams broke NHL records in penalty minutes for an individual playoff game and a whole playoff series. The Nordiques won the next four games and thus the series, four games to two. While Hartford would make the playoffs for the next five seasons in a row, they never came close to duplicating their previous success, with one exception in the [[1989–90 NHL season|1989–90 season]].

===The 1989–1990 season===
In 1989–90, the Whalers finished seventh overall in the NHL standings and fourth overall in the Wales Conference, with 85 points. This was the franchise's second-highest point total in the NHL whilst located in Hartford. The regular season was highlighted by captain Ron Francis putting up career highs in goals (32), assists (69) and points (101). Later in his career, Francis was only able to exceed 101 points once (in 1995–96) and never again exceeded 32 goals in a single season. At the trade deadline, the Whalers first year General Manager [[Eddie Johnston]] made the first in a series of destructive trades by sending franchise goaltender Mike Liut to the [[Washington Capitals]] in exchange for center [[Yvon Corriveau]]. Liut was having a career year during the 1989–90 season and this trade left the Whalers with sophomore goaltender [[Peter Sidorkiewicz]] as their starter, with rookie [[Kay Whitmore]] as the backup.

The Whalers went on to face the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs. In Game 4, the Whalers were in front of their home crowd with a two games to one series lead and a 5–2 lead in the game entering the third period. Bruins starting goaltender [[Reggie Lemelin]] was struggling throughout the series and was replaced by backup [[Andy Moog]] in the third period. At the same time, Peter Sidorkiewicz began struggling in goal for the Whalers, and the Bruins scored four unanswered goals in the third period, winning the game 6–5. Sidorkiewicz struggled for the rest of the series and Moog was spectacular for the Bruins. Without Liut, the Whalers had to either stick with Sidorkiewicz, which they did, or use the unproven rookie, Kay Whitmore, in goal. Goaltending turned out to be one of the big differences in this series and the Bruins won it in seven games. The Bruins went on to dispose of the Canadiens in five games, then sweep the Capitals in the Wales Conference Finals before losing in the Stanley Cup finals to the Edmonton Oilers.

===The Ron Francis trade===
On March 4, 1991, Francis was traded to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], along with Ulf Samuelsson and [[Grant Jennings]], in exchange for [[John Cullen]], [[Zarley Zalapski]] and [[Jeff Parker (ice hockey)|Jeff Parker]]. Francis was one of the most popular players on the team, and held nearly every significant offensive record in the franchise's history, both in the WHA and NHL. The trade was savagely condemned by Whalers fans, most of whom were not willing to believe ''[[The Hockey News]]'' assessment that the Whalers had actually received the better end of the bargain. Less than two weeks after the trade, Parker suffered a career-ending knee injury. The Francis trade was made all the more painful when Francis and Samuelsson promptly helped lead the Penguins to two consecutive Stanley Cup titles. Coincidentally, Eddie Johnston, the Hartford general manager who had orchestrated the Francis trade, would follow him to Pittsburgh as the Penguins' head coach two years later.

The trades that Johnston made, particularly the Ron Francis trade, proved to be disastrous for the Whalers, since the players acquired did not meet the team's expectations, leaving the Whalers depleted of talent and costing them substantial goodwill in Hartford. The links below show all of the trades and transactions Ed Johnston made as the General Manager of the Whalers.

===The 1992 playoffs===
The Whalers went to the playoffs for the final time in [[1991–92 Hartford Whalers season|1992]] behind [[Jim Roberts (ice hockey, born 1940)|Jimmy Roberts]]' coaching, but faced the heavily-favored Montreal Canadiens in the Adams Division Semi-finals. The Whalers lost Game 1 by a score of 2–0 and Game 2 by a score of 5–2, creating the expectation that the Canadiens would sweep the Whalers out of the first round, as they did in the 1989 playoffs. However, the Whalers came back home to win Games 3 and 4 by scores of 5–2 and 3–1, respectively. The main turning point in the series came in the second period of Game 5 — the Whalers had a 3–1 lead midway through the second period, where the Canadiens began rushing the crease and getting in the face of Whalers goaltender [[Frank Pietrangelo]] to distract him. The strategy worked, as the Canadiens scored four unanswered goals in the final five minutes of the second period. These goals were not called back, since this was before the time when the NHL began strictly enforcing crease infractions on goals. The Whalers lost Game 5 by a score of 7–4. The Whalers came back to win Game 6 by a score of 2–1 just 24 seconds into overtime on a goal by [[Yvon Corriveau]]. The series went back to Montreal for game 7 and the Whalers lost a dramatic double [[Overtime (hockey)|overtime]] game by a score of 3–2, as [[Russ Courtnall]] scored on a turn-around shot against Pietrangelo. Corriveau had an excellent chance for a second consecutive overtime winner in the first overtime period on a breakaway, but his shot missed the net.

Roberts was fired thereafter, along with General Manager Eddie Johnston. At the end of the three-year Johnston era, only seven players remained from the Whalers' active roster prior to Johnston taking over as general manager. Those players were forwards [[Ed Kastelic]] and [[Terry Yake]]; defensemen [[Randy Ladouceur]], [[Brad Shaw]] and [[Adam Burt]]; and goaltenders Peter Sidorkiewicz and Kay Whitmore. During the summer of 1992, following Johnston's departure, Shaw and Whitmore were traded away, Kastelic left via free agency and Sidorkiewicz was lost to the [[Ottawa Senators]] in the expansion draft.

===The Brian Burke and Paul Holmgren years===
In the summer of 1992, the Whalers hired [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] to replace Eddie Johnston as general manager to rebuild the Whalers. Burke previously worked for the [[Vancouver Canucks]], helping them build the team that eventually went to the Stanley Cup Finals in [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]]. Burke hired [[Paul Holmgren]] to be the Whalers' new head coach. Holmgren previously was the head coach of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. Holmgren immediately named [[Pat Verbeek]] the new captain and he ended up playing on a line with young stars [[Andrew Cassels]] and [[Geoff Sanderson]]. The Whalers also acquired goaltender [[Sean Burke]] in exchange for former first-round draft pick [[Bobby Holík|Bobby Holik]]. Cassels, Sanderson and Sean Burke remained star players for the Whalers through their final season in Hartford. In addition, future NHL star [[Michael Nylander]] began his NHL career with the Whalers during the [[1992–93 Hartford Whalers season|1992–93 season]]. Since the 1992–93 season was a rebuilding year for the Whalers, they finished the season with only 58 points, the second-worst point total in franchise history, and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1985.

The Whalers entered the [[1993–94 Hartford Whalers season|1993–94 season]] with high hopes from a core of young talented players. The Whalers were also able to draft defenseman [[Chris Pronger]], who began his career with the Whalers, playing alongside veteran defenseman [[Brad McCrimmon]], and later became an NHL star. However, problems began at the management level when General Manager Brian Burke announced he would resign when the season began to take an executive position with the NHL. In addition, Burke had some disagreements with Whalers Owner Richard Gordon. After Burke left, Holmgren took over as both the head coach and general manager. The Whalers started off the season poorly. Holmgren felt he was unable to handle the job of GM and head coach, so he made [[Pierre McGuire]] the new head coach. The coaching change did not help the Whalers, however, since McGuire was not popular with the players; the Whalers continued to struggle. The Whalers reached a low point in the season when six players and two assistant coaches were arrested in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, after being involved in a bar room brawl. Pronger was one of the players arrested; he was 19 years of age at the time, two years below than the legal drinking age in the State of New York. Around this same time, Paul Holmgren checked himself into rehab for [[alcoholism|alcohol addiction]]. The Whalers finished the season with 63 points, only a five-point improvement from the previous season. One bright spot for the Whalers was the emergence of Sean Burke as their franchise and star goaltender. Another highlight of the 1993–94 season was when [[Brian Propp]] scored his 1,000th career NHL point with the Whalers. Propp announced his retirement after the season.

===New ownership===
In the summer of 1994, the Whalers were purchased, in a deal brokered by the Connecticut Development Authority, by [[Compuware]] CEO [[Peter Karmanos]], along with partners [[Thomas Thewes]] and [[Jim Rutherford]]. Rutherford became the team’s new general manager and Holmgren returned as the head coach. The new ownership wanted to turn the team into a winner for the [[1994–95 Hartford Whalers season|1994–95 season]], so Rutherford went out to the free agent market and signed [[Jimmy Carson]] and [[Steven Rice]]. On draft day, the Whalers selected the highly rated [[Jeff O'Neill]] in the first round. Rutherford also acquired defenseman [[Glen Wesley]] from the Boston Bruins in exchange for three first-round draft picks ([[Kyle McLaren]], [[Johnathan Aitken]] and [[Sergei Samsonov]]). Despite these acquisitions, the Whalers struggled at the beginning of the season, starting off with a record of 2–7–2. In mid-February, the Whalers began improving, led by their top line of Sanderson, Cassels and Verbeek, along with franchise goaltender Sean Burke. For the next 30 games, the Whalers put up a record of 16–11–3 and it appeared as if the Whalers were on their way to their first playoff berth since 1992. Unfortunately, the Whalers played poorly down the stretch, winning only one game in the last seven and missed the playoffs by four points.

Before the beginning of the [[1995–96 Hartford Whalers season|1995–96 season]], the Whalers management became frustrated with the slow development of highly rated prospect Chris Pronger. As a result, Pronger was sent to the [[St. Louis Blues]] in exchange for [[Brendan Shanahan]]. Shanahan was not happy with the trade even before playing a single game in Hartford. However, he was immediately made the team's new captain. The Whalers won their first four games of the season, but then struggled for the rest of the calendar year of 1995. As a result, [[Paul Maurice]] replaced Holmgren as head coach in November. On December 28, 1995, the Whalers received a morale boost when they reacquired one of their most popular players from the 1980s, Kevin Dineen. His skills and leadership had an immediate impact on the team, as the Whalers began playing significantly better in January. Despite the strong finish in the second half of the season, the Whalers were unable to recover from their poor start and they missed the playoffs for the fourth year in a row.

Before the beginning of the [[1996–97 Hartford Whalers season|1996–97 season]], Brendan Shanahan ended his silence about his displeasure about playing in Hartford. He demanded a trade out of Hartford because he claimed he did not want to play in a small market for a team with an uncertain future about its location. Whalers fans and local media condemned Shanahan for his comments and he was immediately stripped of his captaincy; Kevin Dineen took over the role. After the second game of the season, Shanahan was traded (along with [[Brian Glynn (ice hockey)|Brian Glynn]]) to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] for [[Keith Primeau]], [[Paul Coffey]] and a first-round draft pick. Despite these problems, the Whalers got off to a very good start, with a 14–7–6 record after the first 27 games, sitting in first in their division. They were led by a strong first line of Sanderson, Cassels and Dineen along with a solid second line of Primeau, O'Neill and [[Sami Kapanen]]. During the calendar year of 1996, the Whalers achieved a record of 41–30–10 in 81 games. In 1997, following the good start, the Whalers' season began to slip away. This included a nine-game losing streak in January and a six-game losing streak in March. Despite the poor performance down the stretch, the Whalers still had an opportunity to make the playoffs in the final week of the season. However, the Whalers lost two games on the road to Ottawa and the New York Islanders, which eliminated them from the playoffs before their final regular season game against the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]].

===Departure from Hartford===
Owner Peter Karmanos pledged to keep the Whalers in the city of Hartford for four years when he purchased the team in 1994. However, two years later, frustrated with lackluster attendance and little corporate support, he announced that if the Whalers were unable to sell at least 11,000 season tickets for the [[1996–97 Hartford Whalers season|1996–97 season]], he would likely move the team.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hanley |first=Christine |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=xMoPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=V44DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2526,2867991 |title=Hartford rally to save the Whale a so-so event |work=Boca Raton News |date=1996-04-10 |page=1B}}</ref> Furthermore, ownership only made season tickets available in full-season (41-game) packages, eliminating the popular six-, 10- and 20-game mini-plans in a strategy largely designed to spur purchases from corporations and wealthier individuals. Sales were underwhelming at the beginning of the campaign, and at the end of the [[1995–96 Hartford Whalers season|1995–96 season]], it was still unknown whether the Whalers would stay in Connecticut past 1998 or move elsewhere. However, thanks to an aggressive civic campaign and the efforts of many fans, the Whalers announced that they would stay in Connecticut through at least 1997. The "Save the Whale" campaign netted season ticket sales totaling 8,563 in less than a 45-day span, despite the Whalers raising ticket prices by an average of 20 percent, eliminating partial ticket plans and increasing the deposit amount for season tickets by 750 percent. This represented an expansion of over 3,500 tickets from the existing base.<ref>[http://www.whalernation.tv/2010/05/this-date-in-whalers-history-may-3-1996-save-the-whale-season-ticket-sales-drive-is-extended-for-11-.html ] {{wayback|url=http://www.whalernation.tv/2010/05/this-date-in-whalers-history-may-3-1996-save-the-whale-season-ticket-sales-drive-is-extended-for-11-.html |date=20120323121850 }}</ref>

In early 1997, [[Governor of Connecticut|Connecticut Governor]] [[John G. Rowland]] stated that he did not want to spend Connecticut taxpayer dollars to fund a new arena in Hartford. Despite this, negotiations between the Whalers and Rowland to build a new $147.5 million arena seemed to be going well. After a near-complete agreement, talks fell apart at the last minute when Karmanos wanted an additional $45 million to cover losses during the three years the new arena was to be built. The Whalers ultimately announced that they would be leaving Hartford after the 1996–97 season. This marks one of the few times that a team announced it would leave its current city without having already announced an agreement with a new one. Karmanos had previously discussed relocating the Whalers to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] (which would have been the first major sports team for that market) as the [[Hampton Roads Rhinos]], but the failure of a season-ticket drive in Norfolk, coupled with a lack of an adequate arena, led to those plans being canceled. Karmanos stated that Rowland had no intention making a serious offer to keep the Whalers in Connecticut since Rowland harbored hopes to bring a [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise to the State. Rowland went on to negotiate a tentative deal that would bring the [[New England Patriots]] to Connecticut, but those talks also fell apart after the State and Patriots ownership failed to reach an agreement on a new stadium.<ref>[http://sophia.smith.edu/~jeue/John/pete4.html How's It Goin', Pete?

===Post-departure===
On April 13, 1997, the Whalers played their last game in Hartford, defeating the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] 2–1. Team [[Captain (hockey)|captain]] [[Kevin Dineen]], who had returned to Hartford midway through the 1995–96 season after a brief stint with the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], scored the final goal in Whalers history. On May 6, 1997, Karmanos announced the team would move to [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]], to become the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], playing its first two seasons in North Carolina at the [[Greensboro Coliseum]] while awaiting arena construction in Raleigh, a year earlier than planned.

The following summer in 1997, the [[Binghamton Rangers]], the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate of the [[New York Rangers]], relocated to the Hartford market to take the place of the Whalers, renaming themselves the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]].<ref>http://www.hartfordwolfpack.com/default.asp?wolfpack=55&urlkeyword=wolf-pack-history</ref> Fromer Whalers owner Howard Baldwin acquired the team in 2010 and announced that the Wolf Pack were changing their name to the Connecticut Whale in the middle of the 2010–11 season adopting the Whalers' old green-blue-white palette; The team changed back to the Wolfpack after Baldwin sold the team following the 2010-2011 season.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Jacobs|title=Wolf Pack's Name Changing To Whale|url=http://www.courant.com/sports/hockey/hc-baldwin-wolf-pack-0920-20100920-5,0,4627592.story|publisher=''[[Hartford Courant]]''|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> 

Goaltender [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère]] was the final former Hartford Whalers player still playing in the NHL; he retired after the end of the [[2013–14 NHL season|2013–14 season]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Knabenbauer|first=Ron|title=Jean-Sebastien Giguere Announces Retirement|url=http://avalanche.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=728903|publisher=Colorado Avalanche|date=August 21, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}</ref> One other former Whalers player, [[Róbert Petrovický|Robert Petrovicky]], is still active in European leagues.

[[Glen Wesley]] was the last Whaler still active with the Hartford/Carolina franchise, upon his retirement on June 5, 2008, though his stint was not continuous, playing seven games for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in [[2002–03 NHL season|2003]] after a deadline deal before re-signing in Carolina in the 2003 off-season.<ref>http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=117341</ref> [[Craig Adams (ice hockey)|Craig Adams]] was the last player drafted in Whalers' history. However, Adams did not become a member of the team until 2000, when the team had already moved to Carolina.<ref>[http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ06_30.shtmlHockeyHallOfFame.com: Stanley Cup Journals (Craig Adams)]</ref>

The Hurricanes continued to use the old goal horn from the Hartford Civic Center when they moved to Greensboro, and it is still used at their current arena, [[PNC Arena]].

===Theme song===
The Hartford Whalers' official theme song was "Brass Bonanza," a tune composed by an aspiring composer/musician Jack Say.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Jacobs|title=The Beat Turned Into A Bonanza|url=http://www.courant.com/sports/hockey/hc-jacobs-column-1127-20101127,0,2148780.column|publisher=''Hartford Courant''|date=November 27, 2010|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> The song became a big hit after it was introduced in the mid-1970s. However, then-General Manager Brian Burke cancelled the use of the song in 1992 because he said "there were players who were embarrassed by it," and replaced the song with a goal horn and the song "[[Rock and Roll Part 2]]" by [[Gary Glitter]]. After he left, it was quickly reintroduced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weiner|first=Evan|title=The legacy of Brass Bonanza|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=370957|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref> The song is still very popular with Hartford crowds, and continues to occasionally be played at XL Center events, including games of the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]]/Connecticut Whale until 2013, and at the [[University of Connecticut]]'s XL Center basketball & men's hockey games. It was also used by the [[Danbury Whalers]] of the [[Federal Hockey League]] (FHL). It has also been played at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]] during [[Boston Red Sox]] games in between innings for several years. "Brass Bonanza" was also the team's goal song whenever they had scored a goal. It is currently the goal song for the [[University of Connecticut]]'s XL Center hockey games.

The retirement of McKenzie's number was notable, in so far as it was one of the only three instances in NHL history (the others being the NHL [[Quebec Nordiques]] retiring [[J. C. Tremblay]]'s number and the [[Ottawa Senators]] retiring [[Frank Finnigan]]'s number) that a NHL franchise retired the number of a player who had never played for it while the franchise was in the NHL.

After the move to North Carolina, the Hurricanes returned number 2 and 19 to circulation; [[Glen Wesley]] was the only player to wear number 2 in Carolina before that number was re-retired in 2009 in his honor. Howe's number 9 remained officially retired by Carolina, and has never been issued since the relocation to North Carolina, but there is no banner to acknowledge it.<ref name="Kaiton's Korner, Feb. 26 2011">{{cite web|url=http://hurricanes.nhl.com/club/podcastplayer.htm?pid=9&iid=29516|title=Kation's Korner, Feb. 26 2011|accessdate=2011-05-24|publisher=hurricanes.nhl.com|year=2011}}</ref>
