The '''House of Representatives of the Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Kapulungan ng mga Kinatawan ng Pilipinas}} and {{lang-es|Cámara de Representantes de Filipinas}}) is the [[lower house]] of the [[Congress of the Philippines]]. (The [[Senate of the Philippines]] is the [[upper house]]). It is often informally called ''Congress''. Members of the House are officially styled as ''Representative'' (''Kinatawan'') and sometimes informally called ''Congressmen'' (''mga konggresista'') and are elected to a three-year term. They can be re-elected, but cannot serve more than three consecutive terms. Around eighty percent of congressmen are district representatives, representing a particular geographical area. There are 234 [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|legislative districts]] in the country, each composed of about 250,000 people. There are also [[Party-list representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines|party-list representatives]] elected through the party-list system who constitute not more than twenty percent of the total number of representatives.

Aside from having its concurrence on every bill in order to be passed for the [[President of the Philippines|President]]'s signature to become a law, the House of Representatives has the power to impeach certain officials, and all [[money bill]]s must originate from the lower house.

The House of Representatives is headed by the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]], currently [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] of [[Quezon City]]. The official headquarters of the House of Representatives is at the ''[[Batasang Pambansa Complex|Batasang Pambansa]]'' (literally, ''national legislature'') located in the [[Batasan Hills, Quezon City|Batasan Hills]] in [[Quezon City]] in [[Metro Manila]]. The building is often simply called ''Batasan'' and the word has also become a [[metonym]] to refer to the House of Representatives.

==History==
[[File:Joint session of Philippine Legislature.jpg|left|thumbnail|Joint session of the Philippine Legislature, Manila. November 15, 1916]]
[[File:Philippine Legislature before 1924.jpg|left|thumbnail|Philippine legislature before 1924]]

[[File:Philippine House of Representatives party-control.png|thumb|260px|Party control of the lower house. Notice the one-party dominance of the [[Nacionalista Party|Nacionalistas]] from 1907 to 1941, the two-party system with the emergence of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in 1946, the return of one-party dominance by the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan|KBL]] from 1978 to 1984, and the multiparty system from 1987 to the present.]]

===Philippine Assembly===
{{Main|Philippine Assembly}}

At the beginning of [[United States|American]] colonial rule, from March 16, 1900, the sole national [[legislative body]] was the [[Philippine Commission]] with all members appointed by the [[President of the United States]].  Headed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] the body exercised all legislative authority given to it by the President and the [[United States Congress]] until October 1907 when it was joined by the Philippine Assembly.  [[William Howard Taft]] was chosen to be the first American civilian Governor-General and the first leader of this Philippine Commission, which subsequently became known as the Taft Commission.

The [[Philippine Bill of 1902]], a basic law, or [[organic act]], of the [[Insular Government]], mandated that once certain conditions were met a [[bicameral]], or two-chamber, [[Philippine Legislature]] would be created with the previously existing, all-appointed Philippine Commission as the [[upper house]] and the [[Philippine Assembly]] as the [[lower house]].  This bicameral legislature was inaugurated in October 1907.  Under the leadership of Speaker [[Sergio Osmeña]] and Floor Leader [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the Rules of the [[59th United States Congress]] was substantially adopted as the Rules of the Philippine Legislature. Osmeña and Quezon led the [[Nacionalista Party]], with a platform of independence from the United States, into successive electoral victories against the [[Progresista Party]] and later the [[Democrata Party]], which first advocated United States statehood, then opposed immediate independence.

It is this body, founded as the Philippine Assembly, that would continue in one form or another, and with a few different names, up until the present day.

===Jones Act of 1916===
{{Main|Jones Law (Philippines)}}

In 1916, the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Act]], officially the Philippine Autonomy Act, changed the legislative system.  The Philippine Commission was abolished and a new fully elected, bicameral Philippine Legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] was established. The Nacionalistas continued their electoral dominance at this point, although they were split into two factions led by Osmeña and Quezon; the two reconciled in 1924, and controlled the Assembly via a virtual [[dominant-party system]].

===Commonwealth and the Third Republic===
{{Main|National Assembly of the Philippines}}

The legislative system was changed again in 1935.  The 1935 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]] established a [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]]. But in 1940, through an amendment to the 1935 Constitution, a bicameral Congress of the Philippines consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was adopted.

Upon the inauguration of the Republic of the Philippines in 1946, Republic Act No. 6 was enacted providing that on the date of the proclamation of the Republic of the Philippines, the existing Congress would be known as the First Congress of the Republic. The "Liberal bloc" of the Nacionalistas permanently split from their ranks, creating the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]. These two will contest all of the elections in what appeared to be a [[two-party system]]. The party of the ruling president wins the elections in the House of Representatives; in cases where the party of the president and the majority of the members of the House of Representatives are different, a sufficient enough number will break away and join the party of the president, thereby ensuring that the president will have control of the House of Representatives.

===Martial Law===
{{Main|Batasang Pambansa}}
This set up continued until President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared martial law and abolished Congress. He would rule by decree even after the 1973 Constitution abolished the bicameral Congress and created a unicameral ''Batasang Pambansa'' parliamentary system of government, as parliamentary election would not occur in [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1978|1978]]. Marcos' [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (KBL; New Society Movement) won all of the seats except those from the [[Central Visayas]] ushering in an era of KBL dominance, which will continue until the [[People Power Revolution]] overthrew Marcos in 1986.

===1987 Constitution===
The 1987 Constitution restored the presidential system of government together with a bicameral Congress of the Philippines. One deviation from the previous setup was the introduction of the mid-term election; however, the dynamics of the House of Representatives resumed its pre-1972 state, with the party of the president controlling the chamber, although political pluralism ensued that prevented the restoration of the old Nacionalista-Liberal two-party system. Instead, a [[multi-party system]] evolved.

[[Corazon Aquino]] who nominally had no party, supported the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of the Democratic Filipinos). With the victory of [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in the [[Philippine presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], many representatives defected to his [[Lakas-NUCD]] party; the same would happen with [[Joseph Estrada]]'s victory in [[Philippine presidential election, 1998|1998]], but he lost support when he was ousted after the [[2001 EDSA Revolution]] that brought his vice president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to power. This also meant the restoration of Lakas-NUCD as the top party in the chamber. The same would happen when [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno Aquino]] [[Philippine presidential election, 2010|won in 2010]], which returned the Liberals into power.

The presiding officer is the [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Unlike the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], the Speaker usually serves the entire term of Congress, although there had been instances when the Speaker left office due to conflict with the president: examples include [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]]'s resignation as speaker in 2008 when his son [[Joey de Venecia]] exposed alleged corrupt practices by First Gentleman [[Mike Arroyo]], and [[Manny Villar]]'s ouster occurred after he allowed the impeachment of President Estrada in 2000.

==Officers==
The members of the House of Representatives who are also its officers are also ''[[ex officio]]'' members of all of the [[List of Philippine House of Representatives committees|committees]] and has a vote.

===Speaker===
{{main|Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}
The Speaker is the head of the House of Representatives. He presides over the session; decides on all questions of order, subject to appeal by any member; signs all acts, resolutions, memorials, writs, warrants and subpoenas issued by or upon order of the House; appoints, suspends, dismisses or disciplines House personnel; and exercise administrative functions.

The speaker is elected by majority of all the members of the house, including vacant seats. The speaker is traditionally elected at the convening of each Congress. Before a speaker is elected, the House's sergeant-at-arms sits as the "Presiding Officer" until a speaker is elected. Compared to the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], the unseating of an incumbent speaker is rarer.

{{As of|2016|April}} The incumbent speaker is [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]) of [[Quezon City]]'s [[Legislative districts of Quezon City#4th District|4th congressional district]].

===Deputy Speakers===
{{main|Deputy Speakers of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}
There was a position of speaker ''pro tempore'' for congresses prior the reorganization of the officers of the House of Representatives during the [[10th Congress of the Philippines|10th Congress]] in 1995. The speaker pro tempore was the next highest position in the House after the speaker.

The position was replaced by the deputy speakers in 1995. Originally, there was one Deputy Speaker for each [[island groups of the Philippines|island group]] of [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]]. Then, in 2001 during the [[12th Congress of the Philippines|12th Congress]], a Deputy Speaker "at large" was created. On the next Congress, another "at large" deputy speakership was created, along with a Deputy Speaker for women. In the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]] starting in 2010, all six deputy speakers are "at large".

The deputy speakers perform the speaker's role when the speaker is absent. Currently in the 16th Congress, the deputy speakers represent the chamber at-large.

The Deputy Speakers are:
*[[Henedina Abad]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]) of the [[Legislative district of Batanes|Lone District of Batanes]] 
*[[Giorgidi Aggabao]] ([[Nationalist People's Coalition|NPC]]) of the [[Legislative districts of Isabela#4th District|Fourth District of Isabela]]
*[[Sergio Apostol]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]) of the [[Legislative districts of Leyte#2nd District|Second District of Leyte]]
*[[Pangalian Balindong]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]) of the [[Legislative districts of Lanao del Sur#2nd District|Second District of Lanao del Sur]]
*[[Carlos M. Padilla]] ([[Nacionalista Party|Nacionalista]]) of the [[Legislative district of Nueva Vizcaya|Lone District of Nueva Vizcaya]]
*[[Roberto Puno]] ([[National Unity Party (Philippines)|NUP]]) of the [[Legislative districts of Antipolo City#2nd District|Second District of Antipolo City, Rizal]]

===Majority Floor Leader===
{{main|Majority Floor Leader of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}
The majority leader, aside from being the spokesman of the majority party, is to direct the deliberations on the floor. The Majority Leader is also concurrently the Chairman of the Committee on Rules. The majority leader is elected in a party caucus of the ruling majority party.

The incumbent majority floor leader is [[Neptali M. Gonzales, Jr.]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]]) of [[Mandaluyong]]'s [[Legislative district of Mandaluyong City|Lone congressional district]].

===Minority Floor Leader===
{{main|Minority Floor Leader of the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}
The minority leader is the spokesman of the minority party in the House and is an ''[[ex-officio]]'' member of all standing Committees. The minority leader is elected in party caucus of all Members of the House in the minority party, although by tradition, the losing candidate for speaker is named the minority leader.

The incumbent minority floor leader is [[Ronaldo Zamora]] ([[Partido Magdiwang|Magdiwang]]/[[United Nationalist Alliance|UNA]]) of [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]'s [[Legislative district of San Juan, Metro Manila|Lone District]].

===Secretary General===
The secretary general enforces orders and decisions of the House; keeps the Journal of each session; notes all questions of order, among other things. The secretary general presides over the chamber at the first legislative session after an election, and is elected by a majority of the members.

Marilyn Barua-Yap is the Secretary General of the House of Representatives.

===Sergeant-at-Arms===
The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for the maintenance of order in the House of Representatives, among other things. Like the secretary general, the sergeant-at-arms is elected by a majority of the members.

Retired Brigadier General Nicasio J. Radovan, Jr. is the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives.

==District representation==
{{main|Legislative districts of the Philippines}}
[[File:Philippine legislative districts.png|thumb|280px|Congressional districts]]
There are two types of representatives in the chamber: representatives from congressional districts and party-list representatives. Eighty percent of representatives shall come from congressional districts, with each district returning one representative. Although each district should have a population of at least 250,000 people, all [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] have at least one legislative district, regardless of population, whose residents vote for their own congressman; several [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] have representation of their own, independent of provinces, although they should have at least a population of 250,000. For provinces that have more than one legislative district, the provincial districts are identical to the corresponding legislative district, with the exclusion of cities that do not vote for provincial officials.

The representatives from the districts comprise at most 80% of the members of the House; therefore, for a party to have a majority of seats in the House, the party needs to win at least 60% of the district seats. No party since the approval of the 1987 constitution has been able to win a majority of seats, hence coalitions are not uncommon.

===Legislative districts in provinces===
Note: Some independent cities are grouped with provinces for purposes of representation to the House of Representatives.

==Party-list representation==
{{main|Party-list representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines}}
The party-list system is the name designated for party-list representation. Under the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], the electorate can vote for certain party-list organizations in order to give voice to significant minorities of society that would otherwise not be adequately represented through geographical district. From 1987-1998, party-list representatives were appointed by the President.

Since 1998, each voter votes for a single party-list organization. Organizations that garner at least 2% of the total number of votes are awarded one representative for every 2% up to a maximum of three representatives. Thus, there can be at most 50 party-list representatives in Congress, though usually no more than 20 are elected because many organizations do not reach the required 2% minimum number of votes.

After the [[Philippine House of Representatives elections, 2007|2007 election]], in a controversial decision, the Supreme Court ordered the COMELEC to change how it allocates the party-list seats. Under the new formula only one party will have the maximum 3 seats.  It based its decision on a formula contained in the ''VFP vs. COMELEC'' decision. In 2009, in the ''BANAT vs. COMELEC'' decision, it was changed anew in which parties with less than 2% of the vote were given seats to fulfill the 20% quota as set forth in the constitution.

Aside from determining which party won and allocating the number of seats won per party, another point of contention was whether the nominees should be a member of the marginalized group they are supposed to represent; in the ''Ang Bagong Bayani vs. COMELEC'' decision, the Supreme Court not only ruled that the nominees should be a member of the marginalized sector, but it also disallowed major political parties from participating in the party-list election. However, on the ''BANAT'' decision, the court ruled hat since the law didn't specify who belongs to a marginalized sector, the court allowed anyone to be a nominee as long as the nominee as a member of the ''party'' (not necessarily the marginalized group the party is supposed to represent).

==Redistricting==

The apportionment of congressional districts is not dependent upon a specially-mandated independent government body, but rather through [[Republic Act]]s which are drafted by members of Congress. Therefore, apportionment often can be influenced by political motivations. Incumbent representatives who are not permitted by law to serve after three consecutive terms sometimes resort to dividing their district, or even creating a new province which will be guaranteed a seat, just so that they will be able to run and serve terms in a technically different district. Likewise, politicians whose political fortunes are likely to be jeopardized by any change in district boundaries may delay or even ignore the need for reapportionment.

Since 1987, the creation of some new congressional districts have been met with controversy, especially due to incumbent political clans and their allies benefiting from the new district arrangements. Some of these new congressional districts are tied to the creation of a new province, because such an act necessarily entails the creation of a new congressional district.
* '''Creation of [[Davao Occidental]], 2013:''' The rival Cagas and Bautista clans dominate politics in the province of [[Davao del Sur]]; their members have been elected as congressional representatives for the [[Legislative districts of Davao del Sur#1st District|first]] and [[Legislative districts of Davao del Sur#2nd District|second districts]] of the province since 1987. However, the province's governorship has been in contest between the two clans in recent years: Claude Bautista, the current governor, was elected in 2013; before that Douglas Cagas served as governor from 2007 to 2013, after succeeding Benjamin Bautista Jr. who served from 2002 to 2007.<ref>[http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2013/10/27/davao-occidental-mindanaos-27th-province/ Davao Occidental: Mindanao's 27th Province].

* '''Reapportionment of [[Camarines Sur]], 2009:''' A [[Legislative districts of Camarines Sur#2nd District|new congressional district]] was created within Camarines Sur under [http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/ra_14/RA09716.pdf Republic Act No. 9716], which resulted in the reduction of the population of the province's [[Legislative districts of Camarines Sur#1st District|first district]] to below the Constitutional ideal of 250,000 inhabitants. The move was seen as a form of political accommodation that would (and ultimately did) prevent two allies of then-[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] from running in the same district. Rolando Andaya, who was on his third term as congressman for the first district, was appointed [[Department of Budget and Management (Philippines)|Budget Secretary]] in 2006; his plans to run as representative of the same district in 2010 put him in direct competition with [[Diosdado Macapagal-Arroyo]], the president's youngest son, who was also seeking re-election. Then-[[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Noynoy Aquino]] challenged the constitutionality of the law but the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] ultimately ruled that the creation of the new district was constitutional.<ref>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/175711/news/nation/noynoy-asks-sc-to-strike-down-law-on-new-camsur-district Noynoy asks SC to strike down law on new CamSur district].

===Most populous legislative districts===
Currently the district with the lowest population is the [[Legislative district of Batanes|lone district of Batanes]], with only 16,604 inhabitants in 2010. The most populous congressional district, the [[Legislative districts of Caloocan City#1st District|1st District of Caloocan City]], has around 66 times more inhabitants.

===Underrepresentation===
[[File:Philippine HOR population per representative.png|thumb|250px|Persons per representative per province or city in the House of Representatives: Provinces (blue) and cities (red) are arranged in descending order of population from Cavite to Batanes (provinces) and from Quezon City to San Juan (cities).]]

Because of the lack of a nationwide reapportionment after the publication of every census since the Constitution was promulgated in 1987, many populous provinces and cities have become severely underrepresented. Each legislative district is ideally supposed to encompass a population of 250,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/08/31/09/rp-popn-calls-350-congress-seats |title= RP pop'n calls for 350 Congress seats |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref> The following jurisdictions currently have a deficit in their congressional representations if the constitutional ideal of 250,000 population count per district is considered:

==Powers==
The House of Representatives is modeled after the [[United States House of Representatives]]; the two chambers of Congress have roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president's signature. Once a bill is defeated in the House of Representatives, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the House of Representatives on third reading, the bill is passed to the Senate, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the Senate is different from the one passed by the House of Representatives, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber's version.

Just like most lower houses, [[money bill]]s, originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may still propose or concur with amendments, same with bills of local application and private bills. The House of Representatives has the sole power to initiate [[impeachment in the Philippines|impeachment]] proceedings, and may impeach an official by a vote of one-third of its members. Once an official is impeached, the Senate tries that official.

==Seat==
[[File:Taft Addressing First Philippine Assembly 1907.jpg|thumb|[[William Howard Taft]] address the [[1st Philippine Legislature]] at the [[Manila Grand Opera House]] in 1907.]]
[[File:MansionHouseBaguio.jpg|thumb|The [[2nd Philippine Legislature]] convened at the [[The Mansion, Baguio|The Mansion]] in [[Baguio]] in 1921.]]

The [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]] (National Legislature) at [[Quezon City]] is the seat of the House of Representatives since its restoration in 1987; it took its name from the [[Batasang Pambansa]], the national parliament which convened there from 1978 to 1986.

The [[Philippine Legislature]] was inaugurated at the [[Manila Grand Opera House]] at 1907, then it conducted business at the Ayuntamiento in [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]], across the [[University of Santo Tomas]]. Governor-General [[Leonard Wood]] summoned the [[2nd Philippine Legislature]] at [[Baguio]] and convened at the [[The Mansion, Baguio|The Mansion]] in [[Baguio]] for three weeks. The legislature returned to the Ayutamiento, as the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Legislative Building]] was being constructed; it first convened there on July 26, 1926. The House of Representatives continued to occupy the second floor until 1945 when the area was shelled during the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]]. The building was damaged beyond repair and Congress convened at the Old Japanese Schoolhouse at Manila until the Legislative Building can be occupied again in 1949. Congress stayed at the Legislative Building, by now called the Congress Building, until President Marcos shut Congress and ruled by decree starting in 1972.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/about/index.php?about=buildings_ancestral |title=The Official Buildings of the House of Representatives: The Ancestral Quarters |work=Congress.gov.ph |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>

Marcos then oversaw the construction of the new home of parliament at [[Quezon City]], which convened in 1978. The parliament, called the Batasang Pambansa continued to sit there until the passage of the [[Constitution of the Philippines#"Freedom Constitution" (1986)|1986 Freedom Constitution]]. The House of Representatives inherited the Batasang Pambansa Complex in 1987.

===Batasang Pambansa Complex===
The Batasang Pambansa Complex, now officially called the House of Representatives Building Complex, is at the National Government Center, Constitution Hills, Quezon City. Accessible via [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]], the complex consists of four buildings. The Main Building hosts the session hall; the North and South wings, inaugurated on December 1977, are attached to it. The newest building, the Ramon Mitra, Jr. Building, was completed in 2001. It houses the Legislative Library, the Committee offices, the Reference and Research Bureau, and the Conference Rooms.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/about/index.php?about=buildings |title=The Official Buildings of the House of Representatives: The Present Legislative Building |work=Congress.gov.ph |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>

==Current composition==
{{main|16th Congress of the Philippines}}
The members of the House of Representatives, aside from being grouped into political parties, are also grouped into the "majority bloc," "minority bloc" and "independents" (different from the independent in the sense that they are not affiliated into a political party). Originally, members who voted for the winning Speaker belong to the majority and members who voted for the opponent are the minority. The majority and minority bloc are to elect amongst themselves a floor leader. While members are allowed to switch blocs, they must do so in writing. Also, the bloc where they intend to transfer shall accept their application through writing. When the bloc the member ought to transfer refuses to accept the transferring member, or a member does not want to be a member of either bloc, that member becomes an independent member. A member that transfers to a new bloc forfeits one's committee chairmanships and memberships, until the bloc the member transfers to elects the member to committees.

The membership in each committee should be in proportion to the size of each bloc, with each bloc deciding who amongst them who will go to each committee, upon a motion by the floor leader concerned to the House of Representatives in plenary. The Speaker, Deputy Speakers, floor leaders, deputy floor leaders and the chairperson of the Committee on Accounts can vote in committees; the committee chairperson can only vote to break a tie.

To ensure that the representatives each get their pork barrel, most of them will join the majority bloc, or even to the president's party, as basis of [[patronage politics]] (known as the [[Padrino System]] locally); thus, the House of Representatives always aligns itself with the party of the sitting president.

The majority bloc sits to the right side of the speaker, facing the House of Representatives.
