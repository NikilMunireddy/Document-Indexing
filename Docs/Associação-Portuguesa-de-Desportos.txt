'''Associação Portuguesa de Desportos''', usually called '''Portuguesa''' or '''Lusa''', is a [[sports club]], and a [[Brazilian Football League Teams|Brazilian football team]] from [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]], founded on August 14, 1920 by the [[Portuguese-Brazilian|Portuguese population of the city]]. Portuguesa is the fifth most popular team in the city of São Paulo  (behind Corinthians, Palmeiras, São Paulo and Santos) and the fourth located within the city proper.

==History==

===Foundation===
On August 14, 1920 (the same day of the 1385 [[Battle of Aljubarrota]]), the five Paulista clubs representing the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] community of São Paulo (Lusíadas Futebol Club, Portugal Marinhense, Associação Cinco de Outubro, Associação Atlética Marquês de Pombal and Esporte Club Lusitano) met at Salão da Câmara Portuguesa de Comércio to merge, and founded Associação Portuguesa de Esportes. They chose the colors of Portugal: green and red. The club merged with [[Associação Atlética Mackenzie College|Mackenzie College]] in 1920, and was then renamed  Mackenzie-Portuguesa.<ref name="rsssf">{{cite web | title =Associação Portuguesa de Desportos | url=http://www.rsssbrasil.com/miscellaneous/hport.htm| date =July 7, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2010 |publisher=RSSSF Brasil |language=Portuguese }}</ref>

===The 1940s and the 1950s===
In 1940, the club changed its name to Associação Portuguesa de Desportos, its current name. In 1956, Portuguesa bought from [[São Paulo Futebol Clube|São Paulo]] a big piece of land located in the limits between the northeast and center of the city. In the land, the [[Estádio do Canindé|Canindé]] stadium was built, as well as the official headquarters, offices and social club.

===2011 Série B===
In the 2011 season Portuguesa participated on the São Paulo State Championship Série A1 (first division) when they were eliminated in the Quarterfinals by [[São Paulo Futebol Clube|São Paulo]], in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B (second division) and in the Copa do Brasil (Brazilian Cup), when they were eliminated in the First Round by [[Bangu Atlético Clube|Bangu]].

After a comeback victory against [[Americana Futebol|Americana]], on October 22, 2011, the club achieved promotion to [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/campeonatos/brasileiro/serie-b/ultimas-noticias/2011/10/22/portuguesa-vira-sobre-o-americana-e-ajudada-por-reves-do-sport-e-sela-acesso.htm|title=Portuguesa vira sobre o Americana, é ajudada por revés do Sport e sela acesso|trans_title=Portuguesa completes the comeback against Americana, is helped by Sport defeat and achieves promotion|date=October 22, 2011|accessdate=October 23, 2011|work=UOL|language=Portuguese}}</ref> On November 8, 2011, after a 2–2 draw against [[Sport Club do Recife|Sport Recife]], the club won the [[2011 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|2011 Série B]], the first national title won by the club. The title crowned a strong campaign by the Lusa side, with 23 Wins, 12 Draws and only 3 losses. The offensive and fast-paced style of play implemented by the team's coach, Jorginho, and the great amount of 82 goals scored led to the nickname of "Barcelusa", referring to FC Barcelona's style of playing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2011/11/11/futbol/futbol_internacional/america/1320967386.html?a=563f1dff04dd9fe9802d76a5e903c63e&t=1323107527|title=Barça, espejo del 'Barcelusa'|trans_title=Barça, mirror of 'Barcelusa'|date= November 11, 2011|accessdate=December 5, 2011|work=MARCA|language=Spanish}}</ref> Lusa ended the 2011 Season with a 2–0 win over [[Associação Desportiva Recreativa e Cultural Icasa|Icasa]], finishing 21 straight games undefeated.

===2012: Awful start, relegation and Nelson Dida===

In 2012, the "Barcelusa" squad struggled in the [[Campeonato Paulista]] following the losses of players Marco Antonio and [[Edno Roberto Cunha|Edno]], which led to the relegation to the [[Campeonato Paulista Série A2]] <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lancenet.com.br/portuguesa/Portuguesa-Barcelusa-rebaixamento_0_682731861.html|title=Portuguesa: de 'Barcelusa' ao rebaixamento no Estadual|trans_title=Portuguesa: from 'Barcelusa' to relegation |date= April 15, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2012|work=LANCE!|language=Portuguese}}</ref> after a 4–2 loss to Mirassol and combined results on other games. The chairman disappointment with the awful campaign in a much considered easy tournament led to the dismissal of the team's coach, Jorginho, after 14 months working for the Lusa side.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/portuguesa/noticias/0,,OI5730821-EI19397,00-Tecnico+Jorginho+volta+atras+e+pede+demissao+da+Portuguesa.html|title=Jorginho volta atrás e pede demissão da Portuguesa|trans_title= Jorginho takes step back and is out of Portuguesa |date= April 20, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2012|work=Terra|language=Portuguese}}</ref>

The team then turned sights on [[Eugênio Machado Souto|Geninho]], and confirmed the former Brazilian champion as their new manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/portuguesa/noticias/0,,OI5731145-EI19397,00-Portuguesa+anuncia+Geninho+como+substituto+de+Jorginho.html|title=Portuguesa anuncia Geninho como substituto de Jorginho|trans_title= Portuguesa announces Geninho as Jorginho's substitute |date= April 20, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2012|work=Terra|language=Portuguese}}</ref> The team mounted a good campaign in the [[Copa do Brasil]], but fell through at the Round of 16 after a 2–0 defeat to [[Esporte Clube Bahia|Bahia]].

Lusa started the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] with their goalkeeper [[Wéverton Pereira da Silva]] negotiating with his departure to play for [[Clube Atlético Paranaense|Atlético Paranaense]]. Without a good replacement at the Youth Squad nor the recently added [[Glédson Ribeiro dos Santos|Glédson]], Lusa then started negotiating with the two-time [[UEFA Champions League]] champion and former [[AC Milan]] goalkeeper [[Dida (footballer born 1973)|Dida]], and signed the 38-year-old keeper to wear their colors until the end of the "Brasileirão" tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/portuguesa/noticia/2012/05/portuguesa-acerta-contratacao-do-ex-aposentado-dida.html|title=Portuguesa anuncia acordo com Dida e tira goleiro da aposentadoria|trans_title= Portuguesa inks Dida and lure goalkeeper out of retirement |date= May 24, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2012|work=Globo Esporte|language=Portuguese}}</ref> The keeper started for the first time for Lusa in a match against [[São Paulo Futebol Clube|São Paulo]], and had a good showing in a 1–0 win for the Lusa side.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/jogo/brasileirao2012/23-06-2012/portuguesa-sao-paulo.html|title=Na estréia de Dida, Lusa vence no Canindé e aumenta crise no Tricolor|trans_title=In Dida's first start, Lusa wins at home and raises worries on Tricolor |date= June 26, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2012|work=Globo Esporte|language=Portuguese}}</ref> Lusa then played against [[Neymar]]'s [[Santos Futebol Clube|Santos]], again at home, and with amazing saves by the veteran goalkeeper and losing several clear scoring chances at the first half, the game ended 0–0,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2012/07/portuguesa-pressiona-mas-so-empata-sem-gols-com-o-santos.html|title=Portuguesa encurrala o Santos, mas clássico no Canindé termina zerado|trans_title=Portuguesa harasses Santos, but the rivalry game at Canindé ends scoreless |date= July 1, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2012|work=Globo Esporte|language=Portuguese}}</ref> with Lusa mounting two wins, three losses and two draws starting the tournament.

Lusa then pulled off a trade with [[Clube Atlético Paranaense]], bringing aboard striker [[Bruno Mineiro]]. The negotiation proved to be extremely positive, since the new number 9 started scoring goals at will: in 12 games, he scored 11 times, becoming one of the top scorers in the league, pursuing closely the likes of [[Vagner Love]], [[Fred (footballer)|Fred]] and [[Luís Fabiano]].

After twenty-seven games in the Brasileirão, Lusa survived a series of difficult games to maintain its spot out of the relegation zone. Playing against [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras]] and [[Coritiba Football Club]], Lusa won both games by three goals to none at home. Playing [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]], [[São Paulo Futebol Clube|São Paulo]], [[Santos Futebol Clube|Santos]] and [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]], Lusa lost the first two games, but benefited from the absence of superstar [[Neymar]] to beat Santos away by 3–1 <ref>{{cite news|url=http://globotv.globo.com/globocom/brasileirao/v/portuguesa-3-x-1-santos-pela-26a-rodada-do-campeonato-brasileiro/2157903/|title=Os gols de Portuguesa 3 x 1 Santos pelo Campeonato Brasileiro|trans_title=The recap of Portuguesa 3 x 1 Santos |date= September 22, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2012|work=Globo Esporte|language=Portuguese}}</ref> and then allowed Atlético Mineiro to escape out of Canindé with a draw.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/jogo/brasileirao2012/29-09-2012/portuguesa-atletico-mg.html|title=Portuguesa e Atlético não atingem objetivos e ficam no empate no Canindé|trans_title=Portuguesa and Atlético can't accomplish missions and end up with a draw |date= September 29, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2012|work=Globo Esporte|language=Portuguese}}</ref> Despite having Brazilian international and former [[Ballon d'Or]] winner [[Ronaldinho]], the Atlético side struggled to get out of the strong midfield pressure and ball possession imposed by Lusa, which had played the majority of the second half with a one-man advantage after defender Leonardo Silva was sent off.

Playing against [[Sport Club do Recife]], Bruno Mineiro scored a hat-trick in a turnaround win by 5–1,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2012/10/bruno-mineiro-faz-tres-vira-artilheiro-e-lusa-goleia-o-desesperado-sport.html |trans_title=Bruno Mineiro scores three, becomes the new scoring leader and Lusa thrashes the desperate Sport |date=October 4, 2012 |work=Globo Esporte |language=Portuguese |title=Bruno Mineiro faz três, vira artilheiro, e Lusa goleia o desesperado Sport |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}</ref> becoming the new league scoring leader, trespassing Fred.

===2013: Promotion back to A1, STJD issues and relegation to Série B===
In December 2012, [[Péricles Chamusca]] was announced as the new manager, with a one-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lancenet.com.br/portuguesa/Pericles-Chamusca-tecnico-Portuguesa_0_827917350.html |title=Péricles Chamusca é o novo técnico da Portuguesa |trans_title=Péricles Chamusca is new Portuguesa's manager |publisher=Lance |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> He was fired in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/portuguesa/noticia/2013/04/demitido-chamusca-usa-numeros-para-provar-bom-trabalho-na-lusa.html |title=Demitido, Chamusca usa números para provar bom trabalho na Lusa |trans_title=Fired, Chamusca use numbers to prove good work in Lusa |publisher=Globo Esporte |date=April 15, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> A day after Chamusca's dimissal, the club announced a Colonel, Edson Pimenta, as new coach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/portuguesa/noticia/2013/04/portuguesa-efetiva-coronel-como-tecnico-ate-o-fim-do-paulista.html |title=Portuguesa efetiva Coronel como técnico até o fim da Série A2 |trans_title=Portuguesa hire Colonel as coach until Série A2's end |publisher=Globo Esporte |date=April 16, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |language=Portuguese }}</ref>

On April 16, 2013, Portuguesa was eliminated by [[Clube Esportivo Naviraiense|Naviraiense]] (the same club which suffered in 2010 a 10–0 routing by [[Santos FC|Santos]]) in [[2013 Copa do Brasil]]'s first round.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/copa-do-brasil/noticia/2013/04/rumo-toquio-2025-naviraiense-surpreende-e-mata-lusa-no-caninde.html |title='Rumo a Tóquio 2025', Naviraiense surpreende e elimina a Portuguesa |trans_title='Towards Tokyo 2025', Naviraiense raises eyebrows and eliminates Portuguesa |date=April 16, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2013|work=Globo Esporte |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Only nine days later, Lusa won promotion to [[Campeonato Paulista|Campeonato Paulista Série A1]], after a 2–1 victory against [[Capivariano Futebol Clube|Capivariano]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/portuguesa/noticia/2013/04/jogadores-da-lusa-festejam-acesso-missao-dada-e-missao-cumprida.html |title=Jogadores da Lusa festejam acesso: ‘Missão dada é missão cumprida’ |trans_title=Lusa's players celebrate promotion: 'Mission given is accomplished mission' |date=April 25, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2013 |work=Globo Esporte |language=Portuguese}}</ref>

Although Portuguesa finished the championship just above the relegation positions (precisely in 12th), it was punished by the Superior Court of Sport Justice for irregularly calling in a player during a match against [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]]&nbsp;– [[Héverton Durães Coutinho Alves|Héverton]], who was suspended for a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]] received at his previous [[2013 Copa do Brasil|Copa do Brasil]] match.<ref name=STJD>{{cite news|last=Rodrigues|first=Renan|title=STJD pune Portuguesa e mantém Fluminense na Série A; ainda cabe recurso|url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/campeonatos/brasileiro/serie-a/ultimas-noticias/2013/12/16/stjd-decide-por-queda-de-lusa-e-mantem-flu-na-primeira-divisao-cabe-recurso.htm|trans_title=STJD punishes Portuguesa and mantains Fluminense in Série A; still subject to appeal|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=[[Universo Online|UOL Esportes]]|date=16 December 2013|author2=Paradella, Rodrigo|location=Rio de Janeiro|language=Portuguese}}</ref> With the punishment, the team lost four points&nbsp;– three for the irregular usage of a player and a fourth one which the team won due to the game resulting in a tie&nbsp;– and ended up being relegated.<ref name=STJD/> This way, Fluminense managed to finish the championship above the relegation positions and was spared from having to compete in the next year's second division for the third time on the last 2 decades.<ref name=STJD/>

===2014: Late reaction in Paulistão, another relegation===
On 10 January 2014, a supporter from the club won a lawsuit in São Paulo's courts, which determines the points would be returned to Portuguesa, relegating Fluminense.<ref>[http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/portuguesa/noticia/2014/01/torcedor-da-lusa-obtem-liminar-na-justica-comum-contra-cbf.html Justiça de SP determina que CBF devolva os quatro pontos à Lusa (SP's court determines that CBF give back four points to ''Lusa'')]; Globo Esporte, 10 January 2014 {{pt icon}}</ref> However, CBF refused to accept the lawsuit, and published the 2014 Série A table without ''Lusa'', placing the club in Série B instead.

In [[2014 Campeonato Paulista]], ''Lusa'' was placed in the Group C, with Santos, [[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta|Ponte Preta]], [[São Bernardo Futebol Clube|São Bernardo]] and [[Paulista Futebol Clube|Paulista]]. The club failed to win in their first five games, and saw [[Guto Ferreira]]'s resignation as manager. Under [[Argel Fucks]], the club fared better and finished fourth in the group, only four points behind second-placed Ponte.

In April, the club was again knocked out of Copa do Brasil, this time by lowly [[Associação Cultural e Desportiva Potiguar|Potiguar Mossoró]]; also in the same month, the club left the pitch in the 16th minute of a match against [[Joinville Esporte Clube|Joinville]], and was later punished by STJD due to disbandment.

Argel left Lusa in the following month, and after short-reign terms of Marcelo Veiga and [[Paulo Silas|Silas]], the club announced the arrival of [[Vágner Benazzi]] in mid-September, highly-known for his abilities to guide a team out of the relegation places. However, he was also dimissed in the following month, after failing to achieve a single win. During that time, the club also saw a host of players coming and going out, with the squad surpassing the 40 players mark.

Portuguesa was relegated to [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série C|Série C]] (first time in the club's history) on 28 October, after losing 0–3 to [[Oeste Futebol Clube|Oeste]].

===2015: Série C and second relegation to Série A2===
Portuguesa started [[2015 Campeonato Paulista|the year]]'s ''Paulistão'' well, defeating Ponte Preta by 3–2. On 4 March 2015 the club finally reached the second stage of Copa do Brasil, after a 3–1 away win against [[Santos Futebol Clube (AP)|Santos-AP]].

On 20 March, after being highly pressured, president [[Ilídio Lico]] resigned as a president, being replaced by [[Jorge Manuel Marques Gonçalves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/portuguesa/noticia/2015/03/ilidio-lico-entrega-carta-e-renuncia-ao-cargo-de-presidente-da-portuguesa.html|title=Ilídio Lico entrega carta e renuncia ao cargo de presidente da Portuguesa|trans_title=Ilídio Lico delivers letter and resigns to Portuguesa's president role|publisher=Globo Esporte|language=pt|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref> Two weeks later, the club was again relegated to Série A2, after a 0–3 away loss against [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]].

==Logo history==
[[File:portuguesa football.png|100px|thumb|1923–2005, 2015– logo]]

The club's first logo, introduced on August 14, 1920 during the club's foundation, was a Portuguese shield. This logo was chosen to honor Portugal.

The club's second logo, introduced in 1923, had a Cross of Avis bordered by a red outline. The Cross of Avis represents Portuguese independence from the [[Crown of Castile|Kingdom of Castille]], which happened after the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]] on August 14, 1385.

In 2005, the club's logo design was modernized, and golden trim was added around the red outline.

In 2015, Portuguesa returned to the badge used between 1923 and 2005.

Portuguesa's first kit, introduced on September 20, 1920, was an all-red shirt, white shorts, and red socks with two horizontal green lines. The goalkeeper kit was completely white.

On March 26, 1923, the club's kit was changed to red and green vertically striped shirts.

The team kit was later changed again, with the red and green stripes changed to horizontal ones, and the away kit became an all-white shirt, red shorts and red socks.

==Mascots==

Portuguesa's first mascot was a Portuguese girl named Severa. She was named after the 1930s [[fado]] singer Dima Tereza who was nicknamed ''A Severa'', after the Portuguese fado singer [[Maria Severa Onofriana]].

In 1994, Portuguesa changed its mascot. The club's unique original mascot was replaced by a lion wearing the club's home kit. The lion is one of the most common Brazilian football club's mascots.

==Anthems==

There are two club's anthems. The first anthem, called '''Hino Rubro-verde''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Red and Green Anthem'') is the old one, and was composed by Archimedes Messina and Carlos Leite Guerra.

The second anthem, called '''Campeões''' (Portuguese for ''Champions'') is the current club's anthem, and was composed by [[Roberto Leal]] and Márcia Lúcia.
