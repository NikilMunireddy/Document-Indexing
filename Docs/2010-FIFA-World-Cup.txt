The '''2010 FIFA World Cup''' was the 19th [[FIFA World Cup]], the world championship for [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national]] [[association football]] teams. It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2010 FIFA World Cup|bidding process]] for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations; in 2004, the international football federation, [[FIFA]], selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals.

The matches were played in [[#Venues|10 stadiums]] in nine host cities around the country, with the final played at the [[Soccer City]] stadium in South Africa's largest city, [[Johannesburg]]. Thirty-two teams were selected for participation via a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|worldwide qualification tournament]] that began in August 2007. In the [[#Group stage|first round]] of the tournament finals, the teams competed in [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These 16 teams advanced to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]], where three rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|final]].

In the final, [[Spain national football team|Spain]], the [[UEFA Euro 2008|European champions]], defeated third-time finalists the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 1–0 [[after extra time]], with [[Andrés Iniesta]]'s goal in the 116th minute giving Spain their first world title, becoming the eighth nation to win the tournament, and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent; all World Cups not held in Europe at that point in time had all been won by South American nations. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Host nation [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and 2006 runners-up [[France national football team|France]] were all eliminated in the first round of the tournament. It was the first time that the hosts were eliminated in the first round. [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] with their three draws were the only undefeated team in the tournament, but were also eliminated in the first round.

==Host selection==
{{Main|FIFA World Cup hosts#2010 FIFA World Cup}}

Africa was chosen as the host for the 2010 World Cup as part of a short-lived policy, abandoned in 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://za.mg.co.za/article/2007-10-29-fifa-end-world-cup-rotation-policy|title=FIFA end World Cup Rotation|publisher=Mail & Guardian Online|date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100720070353/http://za.mg.co.za/article/2007-10-29-fifa-end-world-cup-rotation-policy| archivedate= 20 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> to rotate the event among football confederations. Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and a joint bid from Libya and Tunisia.

Following the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process. The committee also decided not to consider Libya's solo bid as it no longer met all the stipulations laid down in the official ''List of Requirements''.

The winning bid was announced by FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]] at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in [[Zürich]]; in the first round of voting South Africa received 14 votes, Morocco received 10 votes and Egypt no votes. South Africa, which had narrowly [[2006 FIFA World Cup#Host selection|failed to win the right to host the 2006 event]], was thus awarded the right to host the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/germany2006/news/newsid=25395.html |title=Host nation of 2010 FIFA World Cup – South Africa |date=15 May 2004 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=8 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20150427041816/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/germany2006/news/newsid=25395.html |archivedate=27 April 2015 }}</ref> Having successfully campaigned for South Africa to be granted host status, an emotional [[Nelson Mandela]] raised the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]].<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/president/news/newsid=881662/ "Blatter presents Mandela with a special FIFA World Cup Trophy"].

During 2006 and 2007, rumours circulated in various news sources that the 2010 World Cup could be moved to another country.<ref name="harding">{{cite news |first=Luke |last=Harding |title=Doubt over South Africa 2010 |date=12 June 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1818166,00.html |accessdate=29 August 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jermaine |last=Craig |title=Fifa denies SA may lose 2010 World Cup |date=3 July 2006 |publisher=[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]] |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=19&art_id=vn20060703014312923C258638&set_id= |accessdate=30 August 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060827152341/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=19&art_id=vn20060703014312923C258638&set_id=| archivedate= 27 August 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Franz Beckenbauer]], [[Horst R.

===Bribery and corruption===
On 28 May 2015, media covering the [[2015 FIFA corruption case]] reported that high-ranking officials from the South African bid committee had secured the right to host the World Cup by paying US $10 million in bribes to then-FIFA Vice President [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] and to other FIFA Executive Committee members.<ref>[http://touch.latimes.com/#section/3/article/p2p-83654104/?related=true "South Africa is shaken by FIFA corruption probe"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 28 May 2015.</ref><br>
On 4 June 2015, FIFA executive [[Chuck Blazer]], having co-operated with the [[FBI]] and the Swiss authorities, confirmed that he and the other members of FIFA's executive committee were bribed in order to promote the South African 1998 and 2010 World Cups. Blazer stated, "I and others on the Fifa executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup."<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/sepp-blatter/11647665/Sepp-Blatter-FBI-investigation-live.html Vicki Hodges, Giles Mole, JJ Bull, Luke Brown and Rob Crilly, "Fifa whistleblower Chuck Blazer - bribes accepted for 1998 and 2010 World Cups: as it happened", ''The Telegraph'', 3 June 2015].

Retrieved 4 June 2015</ref>

On 6 June 2015, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that [[Morocco]] had actually won the vote, but [[South Africa]] was awarded the tournament instead.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/fifa/11657442/Fifa-in-crisis-Morocco-won-2010-World-Cup-vote-not-South-Africa.html | title=Fifa in crisis: 'Morocco won 2010 World Cup vote - not South Africa' | work=The Telegraph | date=6 June 2015 | accessdate=7 June 2015 | location=London}}</ref>

==Qualification==
{{Main|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification}}
The qualification draw for the 2010 World Cup was held in [[Durban]] on 25 November 2007. As the host nation, [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] qualified automatically for the tournament. As happened in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|previous tournament]], the defending champions were not given an automatic berth, and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] had to participate in qualification. With a pool of entrants comprising 204 of the 208 [[List of men's national association football teams|FIFA national teams]] at the time, the 2010 World Cup shares with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] the record for most competing nations in a sporting event.

Some controversies took place during the qualifications. In the second leg of the [[France vs Republic of Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup play-off|play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland]], French captain [[Thierry Henry]], unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread controversy and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the [[Football Association of Ireland]] to replay the match,<ref name=FIFA20Nov09FIFAStatementOnFAIRequest>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1137489.html |title=FIFA statement on FAI request |publisher=FIFA |date=20 November 2009|accessdate=20 November 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lQk0CY2L |archivedate=20 November 2009}}</ref> and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant.<ref name=UKPA02Dec09BlatterApologisesOverComments>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hMVC1s6Pr6WoHBrceHOFXYf4HZRw |title=Blatter apologises over comments |publisher=Press Association |date=2 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lkd3iCqc |archivedate=3 December 2009}}</ref><ref name=IrishTimes02Dec09FAISetsRecordStraight>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2009/1202/1224259931744.html |title=FAI tries to set record straight |work=The Irish Times |date=2 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lkeAwkE8 |archivedate=3 December 2009}}</ref> As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South African tournament.<ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jO_FwfnIayPK8z-g_2K2KxWTfpPA |title=FIFA reject extra referees proposal |publisher=Press Association |date=2 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lkKZdcQw |archivedate=3 December 2009}}</ref>

On the subject of fair play, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:

Slovakia was making their first appearance as an independent nation but had previously been represented as part of the Czechoslovakia team that had last played in the 1990 tournament. North Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; Honduras and New Zealand were both making their first appearances since 1982, and Algeria were at the finals for the first time since the 1986 competition.

Teams that failed to qualify for this tournament included [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], all of whom had qualified for the previous three finals; [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], who had qualified for the previous two editions; and [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] semi-finalists [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]].

==Preparations==

Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and five of the existing venues were upgraded. Construction costs were expected to be [[South African rand|R]]8.4&nbsp;billion (just over US$1&nbsp;billion or €950&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite news | title=SA faces R8.4bn stadium bill | date=1 October 2006 | work=[[News24]] | url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/Soccer/0,,2-9-840_2006517,00.html | accessdate=13 October 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022131341/http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/Soccer/0,,2-9-840_2006517,00.html| archivedate = 22 October 2006}}</ref>

In a first for the World Cup, FIFA made payments to the domestic clubs of the players representing their national teams at the tournament. This saw a total of US$40&nbsp;million paid to domestic clubs. This was the result of an agreement reached in 2008 between FIFA and European clubs to disband the [[G-14]] group and drop their claims for compensation dating back to 2005 over the financial cost of injuries sustained to their players while on international duty, such as that from Belgian club [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi S.C.]] for injury to Morocco's [[Abdelmajid Oulmers]] in a friendly game in 2004, and from English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for an injury to England's [[Michael Owen]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].<ref name="Journal1Mar2007">{{cite news |title=Fifa are adding insult to injury |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/nufc/newcastle-united-news/2007/03/01/fifa-are-adding-insult-to-injury-61634-18690847/ |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2009 }}</ref><ref name=BBC06Sep2005G14FightFifa>{{cite news |title=G14 starts legal fight with Fifa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/4219244.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=31 December 2009 }}</ref><ref name=BBC15Feb2008G14Disbanded>{{cite news |title=G-14 football group is disbanded |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7247791.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=31 December 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091203172619/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7247791.stm| archivedate= 3 December 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

As with the [[2006 FIFA World Cup squads|2006 tournament]], each team's squad for the 2010 World Cup consisted of 23 players. Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player [[2010 FIFA World Cup squads|squad]] by 1 June 2010. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/WorldCup/67/17/65/671765_DOWNLOAD.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[UEFA]] |title=2010 FIFA World Cup Regulations |author=FIFA| accessdate= 1 December 2011 }}</ref>

Of the 736 players participating in the tournament, over half played their club football in five European domestic leagues; those in England (117 players), Germany (84), Italy (80), Spain (59) and France (46).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theglobalherald.com/fifa-world-cup-2010-where-the-players-are-based/4339/ |title=Where the players are based |work=The Global Herald |date=8 June 2010| accessdate= 1 December 2011 }}</ref> The English, German and Italian squads were made up of entirely home based players, while only Nigeria had no players from clubs in their own league. In all, players from 52 national leagues entered the tournament. [[FC Barcelona]] of Spain was the club contributing the most players to the tournament, with 13 players of their side travelling, 7 with the Spanish team, while another 7 clubs contributed 10 players or more.

In another first for South Africa 2010, one squad included three siblings. [[Jerry Palacios|Jerry]], [[Johnny Palacios|Johnny]] and [[Wilson Palacios]] made history thanks to their inclusion in Honduras's 23-man list.<ref name="South Africa 2010 in numbers">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/news/newsid=1273493/index.html |title=South Africa 2010 in numbers |publisher=FIFA |work=FIFA.com |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=18 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100716182542/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/news/newsid=1273493/index.html?| archivedate= 16 July 2010 | deadurl= yes|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Results==

===Group stage===
The first round, or group stage, saw the thirty-two teams divided into eight groups of four teams. Each group was a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] of six games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams finishing first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16.

The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the knockout stages (four as group winners), and four made the quarter-finals (the only team from South America to not make it this far was [[Chile national football team|Chile]], who lost to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]); but only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.

The overall performance of African teams on the first occasion that the continent hosted the event was judged disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great [[Roger Milla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccer365.com/world_cup/story_9710195414.php |title=Milla Disappointed With Africa |date=9 July 2010 |publisher=Soccer365.com |accessdate=1 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110831043805/http://soccer365.com/world_cup/story_9710195414.php |archivedate=31 August 2011 }}</ref> Of the six African nations only three won any matches (Ghana, South Africa and Ivory Coast), and only one (Ghana) progressed out of the first round. South Africa became the first host in FIFA World Cup history to not make it out of the group stage, finishing third in Group A behind [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], but ahead of [[France national football team|France]].

Only six out of 13 [[UEFA]] teams progressed to the last 16, a record low since the round of 16 was adopted in 1986. Still, the final was played by two European teams.<ref name="South Africa 2010 in numbers"/> Both of the finalists from the preceding tournament, France and Italy, were eliminated in the initial stage of the competition, the first time this has happened at a World Cup.

===Knockout stage===
{{Main|2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage}}
''All times listed are [[South African Standard Time]] ([[UTC+02]])''

The [[single-elimination tournament|knockout stage]] comprised the 16 teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of [[extra time]]; if scores were still level, there was a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] to determine who progressed to the next round.<ref name=regulations>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/56/42/69/fifawcsouthafrica2010inhalt%5fe.pdf |format=PDF |title=Regulations 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa |publisher=FIFA |year=2010| accessdate= 1 December 2011 }}</ref>
{{2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage bracket}}

====Round of 16====
In this round, each group winner (A-H) was paired against the runner-up from another group.
* South American teams again performed strongly in the round of 16, with four teams advancing to the quarter-finals including [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] who defeated fellow South American team [[Chile national football team|Chile]].
* England's 4–1 loss to Germany was their biggest ever margin of defeat at a World Cup finals.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/10430974.stm |title=England's World Cup exit dominates papers |publisher=BBC News |date=28 June 2010| accessdate= 1 December 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-jones-20100628,0,2663952.column |title=There's no disputing that England deserved its loss to Germany |work=Los Angeles Times |date=27 June 2010 | first=Grahame L. | last=Jones| accessdate= 1 December 2011 }}</ref> It was also the first time that a World Cup finals match between these two traditional rivals had a decisive result in regulation time, their [[England–Germany football rivalry|four previous meetings]] all being tied at 90 minutes, with two settled in extra time and one in a penalty shootout.
* Ghana defeated the United States to become the third African team to reach the last eight (after [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]), and the only African team to have achieved both a top 8 finish and a separate top 16 finish (in 2006).
* Paraguay and Ghana reached the quarter-finals for the first time.

The round was marked by some [[List of 2010 FIFA World Cup controversies|controversial referees' decisions]], including:
* A disallowed goal by [[Germany v England (2010)|England in their 4–1 loss against Germany]], where the shot by [[Frank Lampard]] was seen to cross the goal line when shown on television broadcast replays.
* An allowed goal by [[Argentina v Mexico (2010)|Argentina in their 3–1 win over Mexico]], where Argentine striker [[Carlos Tevez]] was seen to be offside when shown on television broadcast replays, which were shown inside the stadium shortly after the incident.

FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] took the unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the decisions that went against them, saying: "Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it."<ref name=Blatter_apology>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8771294.stm |title=World Cup 2010: Blatter apologises for disallowed goal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=29 June 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629184921/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8771294.stm| archivedate= 29 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: "We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting."<ref name=Blatter_apology/> Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary [[Jérôme Valcke]] said the door was closed on [[goal-line technology]] and video replays after a vote by the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]].<ref name=Blatter_apology/>

The final was held on 11 July 2010 at [[Soccer City]], [[Johannesburg]]. [[Spain national football team|Spain]] defeated the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 1–0, with an extra time goal from [[Andrés Iniesta]]. Iniesta scored the latest winning goal in a FIFA World Cup final (116').<ref name="FIFA">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/news/newsid=1273020/index.html |title=Roja, Oranje provide numbers aplenty |publisher=FIFA |work=FIFA.com |date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=18 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100715054402/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/news/newsid=1273020/index.html?| archivedate= 15 July 2010 | deadurl= no|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

A large number of fouls were committed in the final match.

The Netherlands had chances to score, most notably in the 60th minute when Arjen Robben was released by [[Wesley Sneijder]] to be one-on-one with Spain's goalkeeper [[Iker Casillas]], only for Casillas to save the shot with an outstretched leg. For Spain, [[Sergio Ramos]] missed a free header from a corner kick when he was unmarked.<ref name="bbc_report">{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Fletcher |title=Netherlands 0–1 Spain (aet) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_64/default.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 July 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2014 }}</ref> Iniesta finally broke the deadlock in extra time, scoring a volleyed shot from a pass by [[Cesc Fàbregas]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iXcHDxnCEyTeb4JLg1sf2BGNprDQ|title=Spain beat Holland 1–0 to win World Cup|date=11 July 2010|agency=AFP|accessdate=11 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714034940/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iXcHDxnCEyTeb4JLg1sf2BGNprDQ| archivedate= 14 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

This result marked the first time that two different teams from the same continent had won successive World Cups (following Italy in 2006), and saw Europe reaching 10 World Cup titles, surpassing South America's nine titles. Spain became the first team since West Germany in 1974 to win the World Cup as [[UEFA European Football Championship|European champions]]. The result also marked the first time that a European nation had won a World Cup Finals that was not hosted on European soil.

A closing ceremony was held before the final, featuring singer [[Shakira]].

During the tournament, group ticket-holders who did not utilise all their allotted tickets led to some early-round matches having as many as 11,000 unoccupied seats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://af.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFJOE65E0NJ20100615?feedType=RSS&feedName=sportsNews&sp=true |title=Empty seats concern FIFA but attendances stay high |publisher=Reuters Africa |date=15 June 2010| accessdate= 1 December 2011 }}</ref>

While the event did help to boost the image of South Africa, financially it turned out to be a major disappointment.<ref name=tele>{{cite news |first=Rupert |last=Neate |title=South Africa recoups just a tenth of the £3bn cost of staging World Cup 2010 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/leisure/8192484/South-Africa-recoups-just-a-tenth-of-the-3bn-cost-of-staging-World-Cup-2010.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110123100551/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/leisure/8192484/South-Africa-recoups-just-a-tenth-of-the-3bn-cost-of-staging-World-Cup-2010.html| archivedate= 23 January 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Construction costs for venues and infrastructure amounted to £3&nbsp;billion (€3.6&nbsp;billion), and the government expected that increased tourism would help to offset these costs to the amount of £570&nbsp;million (€680&nbsp;million). However, only £323&nbsp;million (€385&nbsp;million) were actually taken in as 309,000 foreign fans came to South Africa, well below the expected number of 450,000.<ref name=tele/>

Local vendors were prohibited from selling food and merchandise within a 1.5&nbsp;kilometre radius of any stadium hosting a World Cup match. For a vendor to operate within the radius, a registration fee of [[South African rand|R]]60,000 (approximately to US$7,888 or €6,200), had to be paid to [[FIFA]]. This fee was out of most local vendors' reach, as they are simple one-man-operated vendors. This prevented international visitors from experiencing local South African food. Some local vendors felt cheated out of an opportunity for financial gain and spreading South African culture, in favour of multinational corporations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csr-asia.com/upload/cover/307059103144.pdf |title=Corporate Social Responsibility in Asia |format=PDF |accessdate=16 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111006161524/http://csr-asia.com/upload/cover/307059103144.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2011 }}</ref>

FIFA president Sepp Blatter declared the event "a huge financial success for everybody, for Africa, for South Africa and for FIFA," with revenue to FIFA of £2.24&nbsp;billion (€2&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/628/other-top-stories/2011/03/04/2378109/sepp-blatter-2010-world-cup-a-stunning-financial-success-for |title=Sepp Blatter: 2010 World Cup A Stunning Financial Success For South Africa & FIFA |publisher=Goal.com |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref>

===Quality===
In a December 2010 ''Quality Progress'', FIFA President Blatter rated South Africa's organisational efforts a nine out of 10 scale, declaring that South Africa could be considered a plan B for all future competitions. The South African Quality Institute (SAQI) assisted in facility construction, event promotion, and organisations. The main issue listed in the article was transportation.<ref>Harding, Paul.
