The '''Internal Revenue Service''' ('''IRS''') is the [[revenue service]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]]. The government agency is a bureau of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], and is under the immediate direction of the [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]]. The IRS is responsible for [[Tax collection|collecting taxes]] and the administration of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. It has also overseen various benefit programs, and enforces portions of the [[Affordable Care Act]].<ref>[https://www.irs.gov/Affordable-Care-Act/Affordable-Care-Act-Tax-Provisions IRS: Affordable Care Act Tax Provisions]</ref>

The first [[income tax]] was assessed in 1862 to raise funds for the [[American Civil War]], with a rate of 3%. Today the IRS collects over $2.4 trillion each tax year. It processes around 234 million tax returns annually.

==History==
{{see also|Taxation history of the United States}}

===American Civil War (1861–65)===
[[File:George S. Boutwell, the first Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service.jpg|thumb|[[George S. Boutwell]] was the first [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]].]]
In July 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Revenue Act of 1862]], creating the office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue and enacting a temporary [[income tax]] to pay war expenses.

The Revenue Act of 1862 was passed as an emergency and temporary war-time tax. It copied a relatively new British system of income taxation, instead of trade and property taxation. The first income tax was passed in 1862:
* The initial rate was 3% on income over $800, which exempted most wage-earners.
* In 1862 the rate was 3% on income between $600 and $10,000, and 5% on income over $10,000.
* In 1864 the rate was 5% on income between $600 and $5,000; 7.5% on income $5,000–10,000; and 10% on income $10,000 and above.
By the end of the war, 10% of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] households had paid some form of income tax, and the Union raised 21% of its war revenue through income taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.org/Museum/1861-1865.htm |title=1861-1865: The Civil War |publisher=Tax.org |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref>

===Post Civil War, Reconstruction, and popular tax reform (1866–1900)===
After the Civil War, [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], railroads, and transforming the North and South war machines towards peacetime required public funding. However, in 1872, seven years after the war, lawmakers allowed the temporary Civil War income tax to expire.

Income taxes evolved, but in 1894 the Supreme Court declared the Income Tax of 1894 unconstitutional in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]''. The federal government scrambled to raise money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.org/Museum/1866-1900.htm |title=1866-1900: Reconstruction to the Spanish-American War |publisher=Tax.org |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref>

In 1906, with the election of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and later his successor [[William Howard Taft]], the United States saw a [[Populism|populist]] movement for tax reform. This movement culminated during then candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s election of 1912 and in February 1913, the ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]:
{{cquote|The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.}}

This granted Congress the specific power to impose an income tax without regard to apportionment among the states by population. By February 1913, 36 states had ratified the change to the Constitution. It was further ratified by six more states by March. Of the 48 states at the time, 42 ratified it. Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Utah rejected the amendment; Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida did not take up the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/constamnotes.html |title=Notes on the Amendments - The U.S. Constitution Online |publisher=USConstitution.net |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref>

A copy of the very first IRS 1040 form, dated 1913, can be found at the IRS website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/1913.pdf |title=The first 1040 with instructions |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref> showing that only those with incomes of $3,000 (adjusted for inflation, the equivalent of $68,612 in 2011) or more were instructed to file.

[[File:1920 tax forms IRS.jpg|thumb|left|People filing tax forms in 1920.]]

In the first year after ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], no taxes were collected—instead, taxpayers simply completed the form and the IRS checked it for accuracy. The IRS's workload jumped by ten-fold, triggering a massive restructuring. Professional tax collectors began to replace a system of "patronage" appointments. The IRS doubled its staff, but was still processing 1917 returns in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.org/Museum/1901-1932.htm |title=1901-1932: The Income Tax Arrives |publisher=Tax.org |date=April 14, 1906 |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref>

===Presidential tax returns (1973)===
From the 1950s through the 1970s, the IRS began using technology such as microfilm to keep and organize records. Access to this information proved controversial, when [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]]'s tax returns were leaked to the public. His tax advisor, Edward L. Morgan, became the fourth law-enforcement official to be charged with a crime during [[Watergate]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945108,00.html | work=Time | title=Investigations: Fraud in Nixon's Taxes | date=November 18, 1974 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

John Requard. Jr., accused of leaking the documents, collected delinquent taxes in the slums of Washington. In his words:
{{quote|We went after people for nickels and dimes, many of them poor and in many cases illiterate people who didn't know how to deal with a government agency.}}

He admits he saw the returns, but denies he leaked them. When asked if he ''would'' have leaked the documents, he said: "I probably would have said, 'Yes, I'm in.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-12-21/business/0312210282_1_nixon-requard-tax-liability/3 |title=How an IRS leak changed history altered history - Page 3 - Baltimore Sun |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=December 21, 2003 |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref>

Reporter [[Jack White (reporter)|Jack White]] of ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for reporting about Nixon's tax returns. Nixon, with a salary of $200,000, paid $792.81 in federal income tax in 1970 and $878.03 in 1971, with deductions of $571,000 for donating "vice-presidential papers".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-12-21/business/0312210282_1_nixon-requard-tax-liability |title=How an IRS leak changed historyaltered history - Baltimore Sun |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=December 21, 2003 |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref> This was one of the reasons for his famous statement: "Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got."

So controversial was this leak, that most later US Presidents released their tax returns (though sometimes only partially). These returns can be found online at the Tax History Project.<ref>[http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/PresidentialTaxReturns/ Tax History Project - Presidential Tax Returns]. Taxhistory.org. Retrieved on August 10, 2013.</ref>

===Computerization (1959–present)===
By the end of the Second World War, the IRS was handling sixty million tax returns each year, using a combination of mechanical desk calculators, [[accounting machine]]s and pencil and paper forms. In 1948 [[punch card]] equipment was used. The first trial of a computer system for income tax processing was in 1955, when an [[IBM 650]] installed at [[Kansas City]] processed 1.1 million returns. The IRS was authorized to proceed with computerization in 1959,  and purchased [[IBM 1401]] and [[IBM 7070]] systems for local and regional data processing centers. The [[Social Security Number]] was used for taxpayer identification starting in 1965. By 1967, all returns were processed by computer and punched card data entry was phased out.<ref name=PC03>Paul Cenuzi, ''A History of Modern Computing'',MIT Press, 2003 ISBN 0262532034 pp. 119-122</ref>

Information processing in the IRS systems of the late 1960s was in batch mode; microfilm records were updated weekly and distributed to regional centers for handling tax inquiries. A project to implement an interactive, realtime system, the "Tax Administration System" was launched, that would provide thousands of local interactive terminals at IRS offices. However, the [[General Accounting Office]] prepared a report critical of the lack of protection of privacy in TAS, and the project was abandoned in 1978.<ref name=PC03/>

In 1995, the IRS began to use the public Internet for electronic filing. Since the introduction of e-filing, self-paced online tax services have flourished, augmenting the work of tax accountants, who were sometimes replaced.

In 2003, the IRS struck a deal with tax software vendors: The IRS would not develop online filing software and, in return, software vendors would provide free e-filing to most Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free |title=Free File: Do Your Federal Taxes for Free |publisher=Irs.gov |date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> In 2009, 70% of filers qualified for free electronic filing of federal returns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/02/as_e-filing_turns_20_irs_tryin.html |title=As e-filing turns 20, IRS trying to win over remaining third of taxpayers from paper returns |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref>

According to an inspector general's report, released in November 2013, identity theft in the United States is blamed for US$4 billion worth of fraudulent 2012 tax refunds by the IRS. Fraudulent claims were made with the use of stolen taxpayer identification and Social Security numbers, with returns sent to addresses both in the US and internationally. Following the release of the findings, the IRS stated that it resolved most of the identity theft cases of 2013 within 120 days, while the average time to resolve cases from the 2011/2012 tax period was 312 days.<ref>{{cite news|title=IRS refunded $4 billion to identity thieves last year, inspector general's report says|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57611384/irs-refunded-$4-billion-to-identity-thieves-last-year-inspector-generals-report-says/|accessdate=November 10, 2013|newspaper=CBS News|date=November 7, 2013}}</ref><ref name="foxnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/15/irs-chief-warns-refund-delays-poor-customer-service-this-tax-year/|title=IRS chief warns of refund delays, poor customer service this tax year|work=Fox News}}</ref>

In September 2014, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen expressed concern over the organization's ability to handle Obamacare and administer [[premium tax credit]]s that help people pay for health plans from the health law’s insurance exchanges. It will also enforce the law’s [[Individual Shared Responsibility Provision|individual mandate]], which requires most Americans to hold health insurance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howell|first1=Tom|title=Bipartisan doubts emerge on IRS ability to handle Obamacare|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/10/irs-cant-escape-lerner-scandals-obamacare-hearing/|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}</ref>  In January 2015 [[Fox News]] obtained an email which predicted a messy tax season on several fronts. The email was sent by  IRS Commissioner Koskinen to workers. Koskinen predicted the IRS will  shut down operations for two days later this year which will  result in unpaid [[furlough]]s for employees and [[service cut]]s for [[taxpayer]]s. Koskinen also said delays to [[IT]] investments of more than $200 million may delay new taxpayer protections against [[Identity theft in the United States|identity theft]].<ref name="foxnews.com"/>  In January 2015  the editorial board of the [[NYtimes]] called the IRS budget cuts penny-wise-and-pound-foolish, where for every dollar of cuts in the budget, $6 were lost in  tax revenue.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/opinion/sunday/irs-already-hobbled-likely-to-be-further-damaged.html</ref>

===History of the IRS name===
[[File:Department of Treasury retirement reception of Beth Tucker 01.JPG|thumb|right|IRS and Department of the Treasury seal on lectern]]
As early as the year 1918, the Bureau of Internal Revenue began using the name "Internal Revenue Service" on at least one tax form.<ref>Form 1040, Individual Income Tax Return for year 1918, as republished in historical documents section of Publication 1796 (Rev. February 2007), Internal Revenue Service, [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]]. Form 1040s for years 1918, 1919, and 1920 bore the name "Internal Revenue Service". For the 1921 tax year, the name was dropped, then was re-added for the 1929 tax year.</ref> In 1953, the name change to the "Internal Revenue Service" was formalized in Treasury Decision 6038.<ref>1953-2 C.B. 657 (August 21, 1953), filed with Division of the Federal Register on August 26, 1967, 18 Fed. Reg. 5120. Compare Treas. Department Order 150-29 (July 9, 1953).</ref>

==Current organization==
The 1980s saw a reorganization of the IRS. A bipartisan commission was created with several mandates, among them to increase customer service and improve collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/natcommirs/main.htm |title=Official web site of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service |publisher=House.gov |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref> Congress later enacted the ''[[Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998]]''.<ref>Pub. L. No. 105-206, 112 Stat. 685 (July 22, 1998).</ref>

As a result of that Act, the IRS now functions under four major operating divisions: Large Business and International division (LB&I), the Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE) division, the Wage and Investment (W&I) division, and Tax Exempt & Government Entities (TE/GE) division. Effective October 1, 2010, the name of the Large and Mid-Size Business division changed to the Large Business & International (LB&I) division.<ref>IR-2010-88, August 4, 2010, "IRS Realigns and Renames Large Business Division, Enhances Focus on International Tax Administration," Internal Revenue Service, at [http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=226284,00.html IRS.gov].</ref> The IRS also includes a criminal law enforcement division ([[IRS Criminal Investigation Division]]). While there is some evidence that customer service has improved, lost tax revenues in 2001 were over $323 billion.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/otptaxgapstrategy%20final.pdf|format=PDF|title=U.S. Department of the Treasury, Press Release|date= September 26, 2006}}</ref>

The IRS has its headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]], and does most of its [[computer programming]] in Maryland. It currently operates ten service centers around the country (in Andover, MA; Holtsville, NY; Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta, GA; Memphis, TN; Austin, TX; Covington, KY; Fresno, CA; Kansas City, MO; and Ogden, UT), at which [[Tax return (United States)|returns]] sent by [[United States Postal Service|mail]] are received. These centers do the actual tax processing; different types of returns are processed at the various centers (with some centers processing individual returns and others processing business returns). The IRS also operates three computer centers around the country (in Detroit, Michigan; Martinsburg, West Virginia; and Memphis, Tennessee).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11308.pdf |title=GAO-11-308 Information Security: IRS Needs to Enhance Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Taxpayer Data |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>

===Commissioner===
{{main|Commissioner of Internal Revenue}}
There have been 47 previous commissioners of Internal Revenue and 26 acting commissioners since the agency was created in 1862.<ref name=commish>{{cite web|title=The Commissioner's Section|url=http://www.irs.gov/uac/The-Commissioner%27s-Section|publisher=IRS.gov}}</ref>

No IRS commissioner has served more than five years and one month since Guy Helvering, who served 10 years until 1943.<ref name=bloomberg1>{{cite web|title=IRS Commissioner Says He Doesn’t Want Second Term|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-05/irs-commissioner-says-he-doesn-t-want-second-term.html|publisher=Bloomberg}}</ref> The most recent commissioner to serve the longest term was Doug Shulman, who was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] and served for five years.<ref name="bloomberg1"/>

===Taxpayer Advocates===
The [[Office of the Taxpayer Advocate]], also called the Taxpayer Advocate Service, is an independent office within the IRS responsible for assisting taxpayers in resolving their problems with the IRS, as well as identifying systemic problems that exist within the IRS. The current [[United States Taxpayer Advocate]], also known as the National Taxpayer Advocate, is [[Nina E. Olson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/alumnae/bulletin/olson.htm |title=Profile of Nina Olson |publisher=Brynmawr.edu |date=November 16, 2003 |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Programs===
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) are volunteer programs that the IRS runs to train volunteers and provide tax assistance and counseling to taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/app/vita/index.jsp?level= |title=Link & Learn Taxes, linking volunteers to quality e-learning |publisher=Irs.gov |date= |accessdate=December 22, 2012}}</ref>  Volunteers can study e-course material, take tests, and practice using tax-preparation software.

For fiscal year 2009, the U.S. Congress appropriated spending of approximately $12.624 billion of "discretionary budget authority" to operate the Department of the Treasury, of which $11.522 billion was allocated to the IRS. The projected estimate of the budget for the IRS for fiscal year 2011 was $12.633 billion.<ref>See Table, p. 115, ''Budget of the U.S. Government: Fiscal Year 2011'', Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President of the United States (U.S. Gov't Printing Office, Washington, 2010), at [http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/budget.pdf Whitehouse.gov] (PDF)</ref> By contrast, during Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, the IRS collected more than $2.2 trillion in tax (net of refunds), about 44 percent of which was attributable to the individual income tax. This is partially due to the nature of the individual income tax category, containing taxes collected from working class, small business, self-employed, and capital gains. The top 5% of income earners pay 38.284% of the federal tax collected.<ref>[http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/indtaxstats/article/0,,id=129270,00.html#_mti 'SOI Tax Stats - Individual Income Tax Rates and Tax Shares'].

As of 2007, the agency estimates that the United States Treasury is owed $354 billion more than the amount the IRS collects.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9031439 IRS Commissioner Assailed on 'Tax Gap'] by Jack Speer.

In 2011, 234 million tax returns were filed allowing the IRS to collect $2.4 trillion out of which $384 billion were attributed to mistake or [[tax evasion|fraud]].<ref>USA today page 1B/2B published April 12, 2012 "complex tax code raises problems for taxpayers and IRS"</ref>

===Outsourcing collection and tax-assistance===
In September 2006, the IRS started to outsource the collection of taxpayers debts to private debt collection agencies. Opponents to this change note that the IRS will be handing over personal information to these debt collection agencies, who are being paid between 29% and 39% of the amount collected. Opponents are also worried about the agencies' being paid on percent collected, because it will encourage the collectors to use pressure tactics to collect the maximum amount. IRS spokesman Terry Lemons responds to these critics saying the new system "is a sound, balanced program that respects taxpayers' rights and taxpayer privacy." Other state and local agencies also use private collection agencies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20060823/news_1b23irs.html |title=IRS plan for private debt collection draws criticism |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=Aug 23, 2006 |accessdate=Apr 30, 2016}}</ref>

In March 2009, the IRS announced that it would no longer outsource the collection of taxpayers debts to private debt collection agencies. The IRS decided not to renew contracts to private debt collection agencies, and began a hiring program at its call sites and processing centers across the country to bring on more personnel to process collections internally from taxpayers.<ref>[http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Conducts-Extensive-Review,-Decides-Not-to-Renew-Private-Debt-Collection-Contracts "IRS Conducts Extensive Review, Decides Not to Renew Private Debt Collection Contracts"].</ref>  As of October 2009, the IRS has ceased using private debt collection agencies.

In September 2009, after [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy|undercover exposé videos]] of questionable activities by staff of one of the IRS's volunteer tax-assistance organizations were made public, the IRS removed [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]] from its volunteer tax-assistance program.<ref>Wheaton, Sarah (September 23, 2008).

==Administrative functions==
The IRS publishes [[IRS tax forms|tax forms]] which taxpayers are required to choose from and use for calculating and reporting their federal tax obligations. The IRS also publishes a number of forms for its own internal operations, such as Forms 3471 and 4228 (which are used during the initial processing of income tax returns).

In addition to collection of revenue and pursuing tax cheaters, the IRS issues administrative rulings such as [[revenue ruling]]s and [[private letter ruling]]s. In addition, the Service publishes the [[Internal Revenue Bulletin]] containing the various IRS pronouncements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Internal Revenue Bulletin:  2012-23|url=http://www.irs.gov/irb/2012-23_IRB/ar08.html|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=June 7, 2012|date=June 4, 2012}}</ref> The controlling authority of regulations and revenue rulings allows taxpayers to rely on them. A private letter ruling is good for the taxpayer to whom it is issued, and gives some explanation of the Service's position on a particular tax issue.<ref name="irs.gov">[http://www.irs.gov/irm/part3/irm_03-028-003.html Internal Revenue Manual Section 3.28.3].</ref>  Additionally, a private letter ruling reasonably relied upon by a taxpayer allows for the waiver of penalties for underpayment of tax.

As is the case with all administrative pronouncements, taxpayers sometimes litigate the validity of the pronouncements, and courts sometimes determine a particular rule to be invalid where the agency has exceeded its grant of authority. The IRS also issues formal pronouncements called [[Revenue Procedures]], that among other things tell taxpayers how to correct prior tax errors. The IRS's own internal operations manual is the [[Internal Revenue Manual]], which describes the clerical procedures for processing and auditing tax returns in excruciating detail. For example, the Internal Revenue Manual contains a special procedure for processing the tax returns of the President and [[Vice President of the United States]].<ref name="irs.gov"/>

More formal rulemaking to give the Service's interpretation of a statute, or when the statute itself directs that the [[Secretary of the Treasury]] shall provide, IRS undergoes the formal regulation process with a [[Notice of proposed rulemaking]] (NPRM) published in the [[Federal Register]] announcing the proposed regulation, the date of the in-person hearing, and the process for interested parties to have their views heard either in person at the hearing in Washington, D.C., or by mail. Following the statutory period provided in the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] the Service decides on the final regulations "as is," or as reflecting changes, or sometimes withdraws the proposed regulations. Generally, taxpayers may rely on proposed regulations until final regulations become effective. For example, human resource professionals are relying on the October 4, 2005 Proposed Regulations<ref>[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20051800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/05-19379.pdf A257.g.akamaitech.net] (PDF)</ref> (citation 70 [[Federal Register|F.R.]] 57930-57984)<ref>[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20051800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/05-19379.htm Federal Register (Volume 70, Number 191)], ''October 4, 2005''</ref> for the Section 409A on deferred compensation (the so-called [[Enron]] rules on deferred compensation to add teeth to the old rules) because regulations have not been finalized.

The IRS oversaw the Homebuyer Credit and First Time Homebuyer Credit programs instituted by the federal government from 2008-2010. Those programs provided United States citizens with money toward the purchase of homes, regardless of income tax filings.<ref>[http://www.irs.gov/uac/First-Time-Homebuyer-Credit-1]</ref>

Congress passed the [[Taxpayer Bill of Rights III]] on July 22, 1998, which shifted the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from the taxpayer to the IRS in certain limited situations. The IRS retains the legal authority to enforce liens and seize assets without obtaining judgment in court.<ref>See {{usc|26|6331}}. For case law on section 6331, see ''Brian v. Gugin'', 853 F. Supp. 358, 94-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,278 (D. Idaho 1994), ''aff’d'', 95-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,067 (9th Cir. 1995).</ref>

Michael Minns was the defense lawyer in a case against the IRS on behalf of James and Pamela Moran, after an initial indictment in what Minns asserts was an IRS [[smear campaign]] that virtually canvassed the taxpayers' own hometown and surrounding area.<ref>Katharhynn Heidelberg, "Attorney: IRS should apologize", ''Montrose Daily Press'' (Montrose, Colorado), December 28, 2007, at [http://www.montrosepress.com/articles/2007/12/29/news/doc4775c5d33b9e9073750758.txt ''Montrose Daily Press'']</ref> The original indictment was associated with the Morans' involvement with a [[tax shelter]] provider, Anderson's Ark & Associates. The Morans were eventually acquitted in the case.<ref>Katharhynn Heidelberg, "Morans Acquitted on All Counts", ''Montrose Daily Press'' (Montrose, Colorado), December 21, 2007, at [http://www.montrosepress.com/articles/2007/12/22/news/doc476c93hd9246d741646059.txt ''Montrose Daily Press'']</ref>

Minns also had previously asserted that the behavior of two IRS [[attorney at law|attorneys at law]], Kenneth McWade and William A. Sims, constituted legal misconduct and recommended them for disbarment. Following an investigation, the law licenses of the IRS attorneys were duly suspended for a two-year period after a federal court ruling found that the two had indeed defrauded the courts in connection with 1,300 tax shelter cases. In 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] concluded that the IRS lawyers had corruptly agreed with certain taxpayers that no tax collection actions would be taken against them—in return for testimony against other taxpayers. The court also asked why the IRS had not punished the two.<ref>[[David Cay Johnston]], August 21, 2004, "2 Ex-IRS Lawyers' Licenses Suspended for Misconduct", ''The New York Times'', at [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/21/business/21tax.html The New York Times]</ref>

In 2013, the IRS became embroiled in a [[2013 IRS scandal|political scandal]] in which it was discovered that the agency subjected [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or conservative-sounding groups filing for tax-exempt status to extra scrutiny.<ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-denounces-reported-irs-targeting-of-conservative-groups/2013/05/13/a0185644-bbdf-11e2-97d4-a479289a31f9_print.html |title=IRS officials in Washington were involved in targeting of conservative groups |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}</ref>

On September 5, 16 months after the scandal first erupted, a Senate Subcommittee released a report that confirmed that Internal Revenue Service used inappropriate criteria to target Tea Party groups, but found no evidence of political bias.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|title=Senate subcommittee: No political bias in IRS targeting|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/05/senate-subcommittee-report-on-irs-tea-party-targeting/15130715/|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref> The chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations confirmed that while the actions were "inappropriate, intrusive, and burdensome," the Democrats have often experienced similar treatment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=The Permanent Subcommittee On Investigations|title=RS and TIGTA Management Failures Related to 501(c)(4) Applicants Engaged in Campaign Activity|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283995-report-irs-amp-tigta-mgmt-failures-related-to.html|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref> Republicans noted that 83% of the groups being held up by the IRS were right-leaning; and the Subcommittee Minority staff, which did not join the Majority staff report, filed a dissenting report entitled, “IRS Targeting Tea Party Groups.” <ref>{{cite web|last1=The Subcommittee Minority|title=IRS Targeting Tea Party Groups|url=http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/8dd561cf-d44b-469d-9657-ddf428778cf5/psi-report---irs-tigta-mgmt-failures-related-to-501-c-4---minority-dissenting-views.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref>

On May 25, 2015, the agency announced that criminals had illegally accessed the private tax information of over 100,000 taxpayers over a period of several months. By providing Social Security Numbers and other information obtained from prior computer crimes, the criminals were able to use the IRS's online "Get Transcript" function to have the IRS provide them with the tax returns and other private information of American tax filers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Steinberg|title=IRS Leaked Over 100,000 Taxpayers' Private Info To Criminals: What You Need |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2015/05/26/irs-leaked-over-100000-taxpayers-info-to-criminals-what-you-need-to-know/|accessdate=May 27, 2015|work=[[Forbes]]|location=[[New York, NY]]}}</ref> On August 17, 2015, IRS disclosed that the breach had compromised an additional 220,000 taxpayer records.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weise |first=Elizabeth |title=IRS hack far larger than first thought |URL=http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/17/irs-hack-get-transcript/31864171/ |publisher=USA Today |accessdate=August 17, 2015 |date=August 17, 2015 }}</ref> On February 27, 2016, the IRS disclosed that more than 700,000 social security numbers and other sensitive information had been stolen.<ref>{{cite news|last=CBS News |title=Massive IRS data breach much bigger than first thought |URL=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/irs-identity-theft-online-hackers-social-security-number-get-transcript/ |publisher=CBS News Interactive |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |date=April 18, 2016 }}</ref>
