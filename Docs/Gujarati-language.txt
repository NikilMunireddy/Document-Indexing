'''Gujarati''' {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ʊ|dʒ|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|t|i}}<ref>Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh</ref> ({{lang|gu|ગુજરાતી}} {{IAST|Gujarātī}} {{IPA-gu|ɡudʒəˈɾɑːt̪i|}}) is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] native to the [[India]]n state of [[Gujarat]]. It is part of the greater [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]]. Gujarati is descended from [[Old Gujarati]] (''circa'' 1100–1500&nbsp;AD). In India, it is the chief language in the state of [[Gujarat]], as well as an official language in the [[union territory|union territories]] of [[Daman and Diu]] and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. Gujarati is the language of the [[Gujjars]], who had ruled [[Rajputana]] and [[Punjab]].

According to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), 4.5% of the Indian population (1.21&nbsp;billion according to the 2011 census) speaks Gujarati, which amounts to 54.6&nbsp;million speakers in India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwt-services.co.uk/translations/languages/gujarati-translation-216|title=Translation from Gujarati to English and from English to Gujarati – Translation Services|author=Sandra Küng|date=6 June 2013|work=wwt-services.co.uk|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> There are about 65.5&nbsp;million speakers of Gujarati worldwide, making it the 26th-[[List of languages by number of native speakers|most-spoken native language]] in the world. Gujarati was the [[first language]] of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]].

The traditional practice is to differentiate the IA languages on the basis of three historical stages:<ref name="Mistry2001p274"/>
#Old IA ([[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] and [[Sanskrit|Classical]] Sanskrit)
#Middle IA (various [[Prakrit]]s and [[Apabhramsha]]s)
#New IA (modern languages such as [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Et cetera|etc.]])
Another view postulates successive family tree splits, in which Gujarati is assumed to have separated from other IA languages in four stages:<ref name="M2">{{Harvnb|Mistry|2003|p=115}}</ref>
#IA languages split into Northern, Eastern, and Western divisions based on the innovate characteristics such as [[plosive]]s becoming [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] in the Northern (Skt. ''danta'' "[[tooth]]" > Punj. ''dānd'') and [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] [[sibilant]]s merging with the [[palatal]] in the Eastern (Skt. ''sandhya''  "[[evening]]" > Beng. ''śājh'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Mistry|1997|pp=654–655}}</ref>
#Western, into Central and Southern.
#Central, in Gujarati/[[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]], [[Western Hindi]], and Punjabi/Lahanda/Sindhi, on the basis of innovation of [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[postpositions]] in Gujarati/Rajasthani.<ref name="Mistry2001p274"/>
#Gujarati/Rajasthani into Gujarati and Rajasthani through development of such characteristics as auxiliary ''ch''- and the [[Possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[Marker (linguistics)|marker]] -''n''- during the 15th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mistry|1997|p=655}}</ref>

The principal changes from Sanskrit are the following:<ref name="M2"/>
*[[Phonology|Phonological]]
**Loss of original [[phoneme|phonemic]] [[Vowel length|length]] for [[vowel]]s

== Demographics and distribution ==
[[Image:Administrative map of Gujarat.png|thumb|right|Map of Gujarat|275px]]
[[File:India Square JC jeh.JPG|thumb| [[India Square]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], USA. Gujarati has achieved high linguistic prominence in many urban districts worldwide, particularly in the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]].]]
Of the approximately 46&nbsp;million speakers of Gujarati in 1997, roughly 45.5&nbsp;million resided in India, 150,000 in Uganda, 50,000 in [[Tanzania]], 50,000 in Kenya and roughly 100,000 in Karachi, Pakistan, excluding several hundreds of thousands of Memonis who do not self-identify as Gujarati, but hail from a region within the state of Gujarat.<ref name="e16">{{e16|guj}}</ref>  There is a certain amount of Mauritian population and a large amount of [[Réunion]] Island people who are from Gujarati descent among which some of them still speak Gujarati.

A considerable Gujarati-speaking population exists in [[North America]], most particularly in the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]] and in the [[Greater Toronto Area]], which have over 100,000 speakers and over 75,000 speakers, respectively, but also throughout the major metropolitan areas of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. According to the 2011 census, Gujarati is the seventeenth most spoken language in the Greater Toronto Area, and the fourth most spoken South Asian language after [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The UK has 200,000 speakers, many of them situated in the [[London]] area, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]]  [[Warrington]] and in [[Leicester]], [[Coventry]], [[Bradford]] and the former mill towns within [[Lancashire]] and [[Wembley]]. A portion of these numbers consists of [[East Africa]]n Gujaratis who, under increasing discrimination and policies of Africanisation in their newly independent resident countries (especially [[Uganda]], where [[Idi Amin]] expelled 50,000 Asians), were left with uncertain futures and [[citizenship]]s. Most, with British [[passport]]s, settled in the UK.<ref name="Dalby"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|1995|p=273}}</ref> Gujarati is offered as a [[GCSE]] subject for students in the UK.

Besides being spoken by the [[Gujarati people]], non-Gujarati residents of and migrants to the state of [[Gujarat]] also count as speakers, among them the [[Kutch]]is (as a [[literary language]]),<ref name="Dalby"/> the [[Parsi people|Parsis]] (adopted as a [[First language|mother tongue]]), and [[Hindu]] [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] [[refugees]] from Pakistan.
A distribution of the geographical area can be found in  '[[Linguistic Survey of India]]' by [[George A. Grierson]].

=== Official status ===
Gujarati is one of the twenty-two [[official language]]s and fourteen [[regional language]]s of India. It is officially recognized in the state of Gujarat, India.

=== Dialects ===
In [https://archive.org/details/simplifiedgramma00tisdiala A simplified grammar of the Gujarati language (1892)] by [[William St. Clair Tisdall|William Tisdall]], two major dialects of Gujarati are mentioned: a standard 'Hindu' dialect and a '[[Parsi]]' dialect. However, Gujarati has undergone contemporary reclassification with respect to the widespread regional differences in vocabulary and phrasing; notwithstanding the number of poorly attested, dubiously cited dialects.
* Standard Gujarati: primarily spoken in the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region, this forms something of a standardised variant of Gujarati across news, education and government.
* Gamadia: spoken primarily in [[Ahmedabad]] and the surrounding regions.
* Parsi: the aforementioned variety spoken by the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Parsi minority. This highly distinctive variety has been subject to considerable lexical influence by [[Avestan]], the [[Liturgy|liturgical]] Zoroastrian language.
* Khatiawari: spoken primarily in the [[Kathiawar]] region.
* Kharwa, Kakari and Tarimuki are also often cited as additional vareties of Gujarati by ''[https://www.ethnologue.com/ Ethnologue].''<ref name="e16" />
[[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] is often referred to as a dialect of Gujarati, but most linguists consider it closer to [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. In addition, a mixture between Sindhi, Gujarati, and Kutchi called [[Memoni language|Memoni]] is related to Gujarati, albeit distantly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. 

Furthermore, words used by the native languages of areas where the [[Gujarati people]] have become a diaspora community, such as [[East Africa]] ([[Swahili Coast|Swahili]]), have become loanwords in local dialects of Gujarati.<ref>{{Citation |last=Ogilvie |first=Sarah |editor=Keith Brown |encyclopedia=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World |year=2009 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam, Netherlands |isbn=9780080877754 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&pg=PA469#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World}}</ref>

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Gujarati alphabet|Gujarati braille}}
Similar to other [[Nagari|Nāgarī]] writing systems, the Gujarati script is an [[abugida]]. It is used to write the Gujarati and [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] languages. It is a variant of [[Devanāgarī]] script differentiated by the loss of the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a small number of modifications in the remaining characters.

Gujarati and closely related languages, including [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], can be written in the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] or [[Persian script]]s. This is traditionally done by many in Gujarat's [[Kutch]] district.

==Vocabulary==

===Categorisation and sources===
These are the three general categories of words in modern Indo-Aryan: ''tatsam'', ''tadbhav'', and loanwords.<ref>Snell, R. (2000) ''Teach Yourself Beginner's Hindi Script.'' Hodder & Stoughton. pp. 83–86.</ref>

====Tadbhav====
તદ્ભવ ''tadbhava'', "of the nature of that". Gujarati is a modern Indo-Aryan language descended from [[Sanskrit]] (old Indo-Aryan), and this category pertains exactly to that: words of Sanskritic origin that have demonstratively undergone change over the ages, ending up characteristic of modern Indo-Aryan languages specifically as well as in general. Thus the "that" in "of the nature of that" refers to Sanskrit. They tend to be non-technical, everyday, crucial words; part of the spoken vernacular. Below is a table of a few Gujarati ''tadbhav'' words and their Old Indo-Aryan sources:

|}

====Tatsam====
તત્સમ ''tatsama'', "same as that". While Sanskrit eventually stopped being spoken vernacularly, in that it changed into [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan]], it was nonetheless standardized and retained as a literary and [[liturgical language]] for long after. This category consists of these borrowed words of (more or less) pure Sanskrit character. They serve to enrich Gujarati and modern Indo-Aryan in its formal, technical, and religious vocabulary. They are recognizable by their Sanskrit inflections and markings; they are thus often treated as a separate grammatical category unto themselves.

{| class="wikitable"
!Tatsam
!English
!Gujarati
|-
||''lekhak''||[[wikt:writer|writer]]||''lakhnār''
|-
||''vijetā''||[[wikt:winner|winner]]||''jītnār''
|-
||''vikǎsit''||[[wikt:developed|developed]]||''vikǎselũ''
|-
||''jāgǎraṇ''||[[wikt:awakening|awakening]]||''jāgvānũ''
|}

Many old tatsam words have changed their meanings or have had their meanings adopted for modern times. પ્રસારણ ''prasāraṇ'' means "spreading", but now it is used for "[[wikt:broadcasting|broadcasting]]". In addition to this are [[neologism]]s, often being [[calque]]s. An example is ''[[wikt:telephone|telephone]]'', which is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "far talk", translated as દુરભાષ ''durbhāṣ''. Though most people just use ફોન ''phon'' and thus neo-Sanskrit has varying degrees of acceptance.

So, while having unique ''tadbhav'' sets, modern IA languages have a common, higher ''tatsam'' pool. Also, ''tatsam''s and their derived ''tadbhav''s can also co-exist in a language; sometimes of no consequence and at other times with differences in meaning:
{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="2"|Tatsam
!colspan="2"|Tadbhav
|-
||''[[karma]]''||Work — [[Dharmic]] religious concept of works or deeds whose divine consequences are experienced in this life or the next.||''kām''||work [without any religious connotations].
|-
||''kṣetra''||Field — Abstract sense, such as a field of knowledge or activity; ''khāngī kṣetra'' → private sector. Physical sense, but of higher or special importance; ''raṇǎkṣetra'' → battlefield.||''khetar''||field [in agricultural sense].
|}

What remains are words of foreign origin (''videśī''), as well as words of local origin that cannot be pegged as belonging to any of the three prior categories (''deśaj''). The former consists mainly of [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], and English, with trace elements of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkish]]. While the phenomenon of English [[loanword]]s is relatively new, Perso-Arabic has a longer history behind it. Both English and Perso-Arabic influences are quite nationwide phenomena, in a way paralleling ''tatsam'' as a common vocabulary set or bank. What's more is how, beyond a transposition into general Indo-Aryan, the Perso-Arabic set has also been assimilated in a manner characteristic and relevant to the specific Indo-Aryan language it is being used in, bringing to mind ''tadbhav''.

====Perso-Arabic====
India was ruled for many a century by Persian-speaking [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslims]], amongst the most notable being the [[Turkic peoples|Turko]]-[[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the [[Turco-Mongol]] [[Mughal dynasty]]. As a consequence Indian languages were changed greatly, with the large scale entry of Persian and its many Arabic loans into the Gujarati lexicon. One fundamental adoption was Persian's conjunction "that", ''ke''. Also, while ''tatsam'' or Sanskrit is etymologically continuous to Gujarati, it is essentially of a differing grammar (or language), and that in comparison while Perso-Arabic is etymologically foreign, it has been in certain instances and to varying degrees grammatically indigenized. Owing to centuries of situation and the end of Persian education and power, (1) Perso-Arabic loans are quite unlikely to be thought of or known as loans, and (2) more importantly, these loans have often been Gujarati-ized. ''dāvo'' – claim, ''fāydo'' – benefit, ''natījo'' – result, and ''hamlo'' – attack, all carry Gujarati's masculine gender marker, ''o''. ''khānũ'' – compartment, has the neuter ''ũ''. Aside from easy slotting with the auxiliary ''karvũ'', a few words have made a complete transition of verbification: ''kabūlvũ'' – to admit (fault), ''kharīdvũ'' – to buy, ''kharǎcvũ'' – to spend (money), ''gujarvũ'' – to pass. The last three are definite part and parcel.

Below is a table displaying a number of these loans. Currently some of the etymologies are being referenced to an Urdu [[dictionary]], so it should be noted that Gujarati's singular masculine ''o'' corresponds to Urdu ''ā'', neuter ''ũ'' groups into ''ā'' as Urdu has no neuter gender, and Urdu's Persian ''z'' is not upheld in Gujarati and corresponds to ''j'' or ''jh''. In contrast to modern Persian, the pronunciation of these loans into Gujarati and other Indo-Aryan languages, as well as that of Indian-recited Persian, seems to be in line with Persian spoken in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Central Asia]], perhaps 500&nbsp;years ago.<ref name="Masica75">{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|p=75}}</ref>

====English====
[[Image:Fruit juice shop in Navsari.jpg|thumb|right|280px|test|''śrī sarasvatī fruṭ jyuś sɛnṭar'' – "[[Sri|Shri]] [[Saraswati]] [[wikt:fruit|fruit]] [[wikt:juice|juice]] Centre". Note that "Fruit Juice Centre" is in English. A Gujarati alternative would be ''phaḷnā ras nu kendra''. It (''kendra'' in particular) would however sound quite [[pedantic]] and out of place.]]
With the end of Perso-Arabic inflow, English became the current foreign source of new vocabulary. English had and continues to have a considerable influence over Indian languages. Loanwords include new innovations and concepts, first introduced directly through [[British Empire|British colonialism]], and then streaming in on the basis of continued [[Anglosphere]] dominance in the post-colonial period. Besides the category of new ideas is the category of English words that already have Gujarati counterparts which end up replaced or existed alongside with. The major driving force behind this latter category has to be the continuing role of English in modern India as a language of education, prestige, and mobility. In this way, Indian speech can be sprinkled with English words and expressions, even switches to whole sentences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|pp=49–50}}</ref> ''See [[Hinglish]], [[Code-switching]]''.

In matters of sound, English [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] consonants map as [[Retroflex consonant|retroflexes]] rather than [[Dental consonant|dentals]]. Two new characters were created in Gujarati to represent English /æ/'s and /ɔ/'s. Levels of Gujarati-ization in sound vary. Some words don't go far beyond this basic transpositional rule, and sound much like their English source, while others differ in ways, one of those ways being the carrying of dentals. ''See [[Indian English]]''.

As English loanwards are a relatively new phenomenon, they adhere to English grammar, as ''tatsam'' words adhere to Sanskrit. Though that isn't to say that the most basic changes have been underway: many English words are pluralized with Gujarati ''o'' over English "s". Also, with Gujarati having 3 genders, genderless English words must take one. Though often inexplicable, gender assignment may follow the same basis as it is expressed in Gujarati: vowel type, and the nature of word meaning.

====Portuguese====
The smaller foothold the Portuguese had in wider India had linguistic effects. Gujarati took up a number of words, while elsewhere the influence was great enough to the extent that creole languages came to be (''see [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese-based creole languages#India and Sri Lanka|Portuguese-based creole languages in India and Sri Lanka]]''). Comparatively, the impact of Portuguese has been greater on coastal languages<ref>{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|p=49}}</ref> and their loans tend to be closer to the Portuguese originals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Masica|1991|p=73}}</ref> The source dialect of these loans imparts an earlier pronunciation of ''ch'' as an affricate instead of the current standard of [ʃ].<ref name="Masica75"/>

Gujarati is a head-final, or left-[[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] language. [[Adjective]]s precede [[noun]]s, [[direct object]]s come before [[verb]]s, and there are [[postposition]]s. The [[word order]] of Gujarati is [[subject–object–verb|SOV]], and there are three [[grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[grammatical number|numbers]]. There are no [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s. A verb is expressed with its [[Root (linguistics)|verbal root]] followed by [[suffix]]es marking [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] in what is called a main form, with a possible proceeding [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] form derived from ''to be'', marking [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical mood|mood]], and also showing agreement.

:Gandhiji's hut-Karadi

:After the world-famous [[Salt Satyagraha|Dandi March]] Gandhiji resided here in a [[date palm]] [[bark]] hut underneath a/the [[mango tree]], from 14-4-1930 to 4-5-1930. From here he gave speed to and spread country-wide the anti-Salt Law struggle, started in Dandi on 6 April. From ''here'', writing in a letter, he notified the British Viceroy of his resolve of marching towards the [[salt]] [[mound]]s of Dharasana.

'''Translation''' (provided at location) —

:Gandhiji's hut-Karadi

:Here under the mango tree in the hut made of palm leaves (khajoori) Gandhiji stayed from 14-4-1930 to 4-5-1930 after the world famous Dandi march. From here he gave impetus to the civil disobedience movement for breaking the salt act started on 6 April at Dandi and turned it into a nationwide movement. It was also from this place that he wrote a letter to the British viceroy expressing his firm resolve to march to the salt works at Dharasana.
