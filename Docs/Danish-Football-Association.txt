The '''Danish Football Association''' ({{lang-da|Dansk Boldspil-Union;}} '''DBU''') is the governing body of [[football in Denmark]]. It is the organization of the [[List of football clubs in Denmark|Danish football clubs]] and runs the professional Danish football leagues and the [[Denmark national football team|men's]] and [[Denmark women's national football team|women's]] national teams. It is based in the city of [[Brøndby]] and is a founding member of both [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]]. The DBU has also been the governing body of [[futsal]] in Denmark since 2008.

==Beginnings==
The DBU was founded in 1889 and was the first Football Association outside of Great Britain and Ireland.<ref>http://www.uefa.org/member-associations/association=den/index.html</ref> However, it did not register games officially before the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], meaning that the win in the [[Football at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Intercalated Olympics]] tournament was not officially recorded by the DBU.

==Yearly honours==
{{main|Danish Football Player of the Year}}
The DBU awards the best [[Denmark national football team|national team]] players each year, with an award to the best senior team player, as well as the best player in three of the DBU's six national youth teams.

;Player of the Year
Since 1963, the DBU has awarded the Danish ''Player of the Year'' in a vote amongst the Danish players. In the time of amateur football, only players in the domestic league could achieve the prize, and even after the emergence of paid football in 1978, no players in foreign clubs were eligible for the award. When the award was finally opened to all Danish players, domestic and abroad, in 1983, national team captain [[Morten Olsen]] was the first player to win the ''Player of the Year'' award taking all Danish players into consideration. The record number of award wins is four, by [[Brian Laudrup]] (1989, 1992, 1995, and 1997).

;Young Players of the Year
The Young Players of the Year Awards on the other hand are sponsored by [[Arla Foods]], the awards were initially known as ''Mælkens talentpriser'' (the milk's talent awards) in order to promote the line of [[dairy product]]s of the company then known as "MD Foods". DBU found new sponsor [[DONG Energy|DONG]] (later DONG Energy), an oil company, in 2004 but Arla went on to sponsor the prize which was renamed ''Arla's talentpriser'' (Arla's talent awards) in 2005.[http://www.dbu.dk/page.aspx?id=318][http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=235766][http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=242463]
