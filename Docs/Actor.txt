An '''actor''' (or '''actress''' for female) is one who portrays a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a performance. The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the [[theatre]], and/or in modern mediums such as [[film]], [[radio]], and [[television]]. The analogous Greek term is {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὑποκριτής|ὑποκριτής]]}} ''(hypokrites)'', literally "one who interprets".<ref name="hypocrite">{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/actor?q=actor|title=Definition of actor}}''Hypokrites'' (related to our word for [[Hypocrisy|hypocrite]]) also means, less often, "to answer" the [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. See Weimann (1978, 2); see also Csapo and Slater, who offer translations of classical source material using the term ''hypocrisis'' ([[acting]]) (1994, 257, 265–267).</ref> The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental [[performance art]], or, more commonly; to act, is to create,  a character in performance.<ref>"The dramatic world can be extended to include the 'author', the 'audience' and even the 'theatre'; but these remain 'possible' surrogates, not the 'actual' referents as such" (Elam 1980, 110).</ref>

Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys.<ref name="Neziroski 2003">{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/narrativelyricdrama.htm|title=narrative, lyric, drama|last=Neziroski |first=Lirim|year=2003|work=Theories of Media :: Keywords Glossary :: multimedia|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=For example, until the late 1600s, audiences were opposed to seeing women on stage, because of the belief stage performance reduced them to the status of showgirls and prostitutes.

==Terminology==
After 1660 in England, when women first started to appear on stage, the terms ''actor'' or ''actress'' were initially used interchangeably for female performers, but later, influenced by the French ''[[:wikt:actrice|actrice]]'', ''actress'' became the commonly used term for women in theatre and film. The etymology is a simple derivation from ''actor'' with ''ess'' added.<ref name="OED2010">{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=3|date=November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=actress, n.|quote=Although ''actor'' refers to a person who acts regardless of gender, where this term "is increasingly preferred", actress remains in general use; actor is increasingly preferred for performers of both sexes as a gender-neutral term.}}</ref> However, when referring to more than one performer, of both sexes, ''actor'' is preferred as a gender-specific term for male performers. ''Actor'' is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender-specific term. Within the profession, the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the 1950–1960s, the [[post-war]] period when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed.<ref name="De GayGoodman1998">{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Lizbeth|authorlink1=Lizbeth Goodman|last2=Holledge|first2=Julie|title=The Routledge reader in gender and performance|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-16583-0|pages=8; 93}}</ref> "When the ''Observer'' and the ''Guardian'' published their new joint style guide in 2010, it stated "Use ["actor"] for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actress." <ref name="theguardian.com">http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/sep/25/readers-editor-actor-or-actress</ref> The authors of the style guide stated that "actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men). As [[Whoopi Goldberg]] put it in an interview with the paper: 'An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor – I can play anything.'"<ref name="theguardian.com"/> The U.K. performers' union Equity has no policy on the use of "actor" or "actress". An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the "...subject divides the profession." <ref name="theguardian.com"/> In 2009, the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated that "Actress" remains the common term used in major [[acting]] awards given to female recipients<ref name="latimes">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/18/entertainment/ca-actress18|title=From actor to actress and back again|last=Linden|first=Sheri|date=18 January 2009 |work=Entertainment|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=It would be several decades before the word "actress" appeared – 1700, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, more than a century after the word "actor" was first used to denote a theatrical performer, supplanting the less professional-sounding "player."}}</ref> (e.g., [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]).

With regards to the [[cinema of the United States]], the gender-neutral term "player" was common in film in the [[silent film]] era and the early days of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], but in the 2000s in a film context, it is generally deemed [[archaism|archaic]]. However, "player" remains in use in the [[theatre]], often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company, such as the [[American Players Theatre|American Players]], the [[East West Players]] and so on.  Also, actors in [[improvisational theatre]] may be referred to as "players".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spolin|first1=Viola|title=Improvisation for the Theater: A Handbook of Teaching and Directing Techniques|date=1999|publisher=Northwestern Univ Press|location=Evanston, Ill|ISBN=0810140004|pages=Introduction to the 3rd Edition|edition=3rd|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/improvisation-for-the-theater-a-handbook-of-teaching-and-directing-techniques/oclc/41176682}}</ref>

==History==
The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the [[Greece|Greek]] performer [[Thespis]] stepped on to the stage at the ''Theatre Dionysus'' to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in [[song]], dance, and in [[Perspective (storytelling)|third person]] narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called ''Thespians''. To this day, theatrical legend maintains Thespis is a mischievous spirit; disasters in the theatre are sometimes blamed on his [[ghost]]ly intervention. Actors in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] acted in three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].<ref>Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).</ref> Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]].

As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience, there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes.<ref>Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)</ref> Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the [[Early Middle Ages]] traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral and [[pagan]]. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a Christian burial, which left an actor forever condemned.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], churches in [[Europe]] began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. The [[Feast of Fools]] encouraged the development of comedy. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] often contained [[comedy]], with actors playing [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s and [[clown]]s.<ref>Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)</ref> The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers.

There were a number of secular performances staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folk culture|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The plays utilised [[stock character]]s. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid by taking a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the size of their role.

[[File:The Swan cropped.png|thumb|A 1596 sketch of a performance in progress on the [[thrust stage]] of [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]], a typical [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] open-roof playhouse.]]

Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as the mystery plays, "[[morality play]]s" and the "university drama" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as the elaborate [[masque]]s frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre. Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, [[Playing company|companies of players]] were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan stage]].

The development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when [[Puritan]] opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London. Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral. The re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama.  English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called "Restoration comedy".  Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness. At this point, women were allowed the play the parts of women and not men.  This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the negative perception of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Wilmeth, Don B. |author2=Bigsby, C.W.E. | title=The Cambridge history of American theatre | year=1998 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, U.K. | isbn=978-0-521-65179-0 | pages=449–450}}</ref>

==Techniques==
{{Main|List of acting techniques}}
* [[Classical acting]] is an umbrella term for a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Michel Saint-Denis]]. 
* In [[Stanislavski's system]], also known as Stanislavski's method, actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the "truth" of the character they are portraying. The actor puts himself or herself in the mindset of the character finding things in common in order to give a more genuine portrayal of the character.
* [[Method acting]] is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play, as formulated by [[Lee Strasberg]]. Strasberg's method is based upon the idea that in order to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters. It is based on aspects of Stanislavski's system. Other acting techniques are also based off Stanislavski's ideas, such as those of [[Stella Adler]] and [[Sanford Meisner]], but these are not considered "method acting".<ref>Guerrasio, Jason. (2014-12-19) [https://tribecafilminstitute.org/blog/detail/what_it_means_to_be_method What It Means To Be ‘Method’]. Tribecafilminstitute.org. Retrieved on 2016-02-10.</ref>
* [[Meisner technique]] requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment. This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience. It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people's response to other people and circumstances. Is it based on Stanislavski's system.

==As opposite sex==
[[File:Lely margret hughes.jpg|thumb|Actress [[Margaret Hughes]] c. 1670]]
Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]]<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2002_52_fri_04.shtml Women Actors in Ancient Rome] 27 December 2002, BBC</ref> and the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage; this belief persisted until the 17th century in [[Venice]]. In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], women's roles were generally played by men or boys.<ref name="Neziroski 2003"/>

When an eighteen-year [[Puritan]] prohibition of [[Restoration drama|drama]] was lifted after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. [[Margaret Hughes]] is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1534673,00.html|title=Smallweed|last=Smallweed|date=23 July 2005|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote="Whereas women's parts in plays have hitherto been acted by men in the habits of women ... we do permit and give leave for the time to come that all women's parts be acted by women," Charles II ordained in 1662.

Despite these prejudices, the 19th century also so the first female acting "stars", most notably [[Sarah Bernhardt]].<ref>‘Studies in hysteria’: actress and courtesan, Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs Patrick Campbell</ref>

In [[Japan]], ''[[onnagata]]'', men taking on female roles, were used in ''[[kabuki]]'' theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the [[Edo period]]. This convention continues. By contrast, some forms of [[Culture of China|Chinese]] drama involve women playing all roles.

In modern times, women occasionally played the roles of [[prepubescent]] boys.  For example, the stage role of [[Peter Pan]] is traditionally played by a woman, as are most [[principal boy]]s in British [[pantomime]]. [[Opera]] has several "[[breeches role]]s" traditionally sung by women, usually [[mezzo-soprano]]s. Examples are Hansel in ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', [[The Marriage of Figaro#Characters|Cherubino]] in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.

Women playing male roles are uncommon in film, with notable exceptions. In 1982, [[Stina Ekblad]] played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'', and [[Linda Hunt]] received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Billy Kwan in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. In 2007, [[Cate Blanchett]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Jude Quinn, a fictionalized representation of [[Bob Dylan]] in the 1960s, in ''[[I'm Not There]]''.

In the 2000s, women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays, such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in [[comic theatre]] and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt [[cross-dressing]], such as [[Francis Flute]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The movie ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' stars [[Jack Gilford]] dressing as a young bride. [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the thirty [[Carry On films]]. [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robin Williams]] have each appeared in a hit comedy film (''[[Tootsie]]'' and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', respectively) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman.

Occasionally, the issue is further complicated, for example, by a woman playing a woman acting as a man—who then pretends to be a woman, such as [[Julie Andrews]] in ''[[Victor/Victoria]]'', or [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] in ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''. In ''[[It's Pat: The Movie]]'', filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]] and Chris (played by [[Julia Sweeney]] and [[Dave Foley]]).  Similarly, in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro, there is a scene in which Cherubino (a male character portrayed by a woman) dresses up and acts as a woman; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation, while the audience is aware of two levels.

A few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role. Edna Turnblad in ''Hairspray'' was played by [[Divine (actor)|Divine]] in the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 original film]], [[Harvey Fierstein]] in the [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical]], and [[John Travolta]] in the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|2007 movie musical]]. [[Felicity Huffman]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for playing Bree Osbourne (a [[male-to-female transsexual]]) in 2005's ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]''.

==Types==
Actors working in theatre, film, television and radio have to learn specific skills. Techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting.

===In theatre===
To act on stage, actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the  script, such as "Stage Left" and "Stage Right". These directions are based on the actor's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience. Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions "Upstage" (away from the audience) and "Downstage" (towards the audience)<ref name="sft.edu">{{cite web |title= Industry Tips |url=http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |accessdate=April 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140326100456/http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014}}</ref> Theatre actors need to learn blocking, which is "...where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play". Most scripts specify some blocking. The Director will also give instructions on blocking, such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop.<ref name="sft.edu"/>

Some theater actors need to learn [[stage combat]], which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate "hand-to-hand [fighting] or with sword[-fighting]". Actors are coached by [[fight director]]s, who help them to learn the [[choreography|choreographed sequence]] of fight actions.
<ref name="sft.edu"/>

===In film===
====Silent films====
From 1894 to the late 1920s, movies were [[silent film]]s. Silent film actors emphasized [[body language]] and [[facial expression]], so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or [[camp (style)|campy]]. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. [[Vaudeville]] theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors.<ref name=textbook>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=John|title=American Film: A History|date=2008|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-97922-0|edition=First}}</ref> The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director [[Marshall Neilan]] in 1917: "The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures."  In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.{{sfn|brownlow|1968|pages=344-353}}

Pioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s. Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as  [[D W Griffith]], cinematography became less stage-like, and the then-revolutionary [[close up]] shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting. In America, D.W. Griffith's company [[Biograph Studios]], would become known for its innovative direction and its acting which suited the cinema rather than the stage. Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training.<ref name="infoplease.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/cig/movies-flicks-film/film-acting-vs-theater-acting.html|title=Movies and Film|publisher=infoplease.com}}</ref> 

[[Lillian Gish]] has been called film's "first true actress" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting. Directors such as [[Albert Capellani]] and [[Maurice Tourneur]] began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', were still being released. {{sfn|Brownlow|1968|pages=344–353}} Greta Garbo, who made her debut in 1926, would become known for her naturalistic acting.

According to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the [[Weimar Republic]], "including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses".<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Silent Cinema|last = Kaes|first = Anton|date = 1990|journal = Monatshefte|doi = |pmid = }}</ref>

====Sound movies:late 1920s onward====
Film actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/auditions-for-film.html|title=Auditions for Film: Movie Acting Tips and Techniques|publisher=}}</ref>
Film actors need to learn to find and stay on their "mark." This is a position on the floor marked with tape. This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized. Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on [[screen test]]s. Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script.

"Unlike the theater actor, who gets to develop a character during...a two- or three-hour performance, the film actor lacks continuity, forcing him or her to come to all the scenes (often shot in reverse order in which they'll ultimately appear) with a character already fully developed."<ref name="infoplease.com"/>

"Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it..., cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater." "The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master: ...the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks, quivers, and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character."<ref name="infoplease.com"/> Some theatre stars "...have made the theater-to-cinema transition quite successfully ([[Laurence Olivier]], [[Glenn Close]], and [[Julie Andrews]], for instance), others have not..."<ref name="infoplease.com"/>

Radio drama is a dramatized, purely acoustic [[performance]], broadcast on [[radio]] or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio [[drama]] depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: "It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension."<ref>Tim Crook: [http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf ''Radio drama. Theory and practice'']. London; New York: Routledge, 1999, p. 8.</ref>

Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR ([[old-time radio]]) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as [[Internet Archive]].

As of 2011, radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or [[podcast]]s of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the [[BBC]] produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|Radio 4 Extra]]. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.

The terms "audio drama"<ref>Compare the entry to ''Hörspiel'' e.g. in: [http://www.dict.cc/deutsch-englisch/H%C3%B6rspiel.html dict.cc – Deutsch-Englisch-Wörterbuch]</ref> or "audio theatre" are sometimes used synonymously with "radio drama" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on [[CD]]s, [[cassette tape]]s, [[podcast]]s, [[webcast]]s and conventional broadcast radio.

Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news | author = Newman, Barry |date = 2010-02-25 | title = Return With Us to the Thrilling Days Of Yesteryear — Via the Internet  | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704240004575085313479028540.html?mod=rss_Arts_and_Entertainment | publisher = Wall Street Journal}}</ref>
