'''Hyderabad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|ər|ə|ˌ|b|ae|d |audio = Hyderabad.ogg}} {{respell|HY|dər-ə-bad}}; often {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|ə|ˌ|b|ae|d}}) is the capital of the southern [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Telangana]] and ''[[de jure]]'' capital of [[Andhra Pradesh]].{{refn|According to the [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014]] part 2 Section 5:(1) On and from the appointed day, Hyderabad in the existing State of [[Andhra Pradesh]], shall be the common capital of the State of [[Telangana]] and the State of Andhra Pradesh for such period not exceeding ten years.<br/>(2) After expiry of the period referred to in sub-section (1), Hyderabad shall be the capital of the State of Telangana and there shall be a new capital for the State of Andhra Pradesh.<br/>The common capital is defined as the existing area notified as the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation under the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955. Though Andhra Pradesh uses facilities in Hyderabad during the transition period, Telangana state is responsible for day-to-day administration of the city. City MLAs are members of the [[Legislature of Telangana]] (§ 3 and 18(1) of the Act).|group=upper-alpha}} Occupying {{convert|650|km2|sqmi}} along the banks of the [[Musi River (India)|Musi River]], it has a population of about {{nowrap|6.7 million}} and a [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] population of about {{nowrap|7.75 million}}, making it the [[List of most populous cities in India|fourth most populous city]] and [[List of million-plus urban agglomerations in India|sixth most populous urban agglomeration]] in India. At an average altitude of {{convert|542|m|ft}}, much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including [[Hussain Sagar]]—predating the city's founding—north of the city centre.

Established in 1591 by [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]], Hyderabad remained under the rule of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] for nearly a century before the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Asif Jah I]] declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizams of Hyderabad]]. The [[Hyderabad State|Nizam's dominions]] became a [[princely state]] during the [[British Raj]], and remained so for {{nowrap|150 years}}, with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the capital of [[Hyderabad State (1948–56)|Hyderabad State]] after it was brought into the [[Indian Union]] in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]. Since 1956, [[Rashtrapati Nilayam]] in the city has been the winter office of the [[President of India]]. In 2014, the newly formed state of Telangana [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014|split from Andhra Pradesh]] and the city became joint capital of the two states, a transitional arrangement scheduled to end by 2025.

Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today, with the [[Charminar]]—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—coming to symbolise Hyderabad. [[Golconda]] fort is another major landmark. The influence of [[Indo-Persian culture|Mughlai culture]] is also evident in the city's [[Hyderabadi cuisine|distinctive cuisine]], which includes [[Hyderabadi biryani]] and [[Hyderabadi haleem]]. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters from different parts of the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city from the rest of the Indian subcontinent. While Hyderabad is losing its cultural pre-eminence, it is today, due to the [[Telugu film industry]], the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures.

Hyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre, and it continues to be known as the City of Pearls. Many of the city's traditional [[bazaar]]s, including [[Laad Bazaar]], [[Begum Bazaar]] and [[Sultan Bazaar]], have remained open for centuries. However, industrialisation throughout the {{nowrap|20th century}} attracted major Indian manufacturing, research and financial institutions, including [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]], the [[National Geophysical Research Institute]] and the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]]. [[Special economic zone]]s dedicated to [[information technology]] have encouraged companies from across India and around the world to set up operations and the emergence of [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] industries in the 1990s led to the area's naming as India's "[[Genome Valley]]". With an output of {{US$}}74&nbsp;billion, Hyderabad is the fifth-largest contributor to India's overall [[gross domestic product]].

Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad.

===Literature===
In the past, Qutb Shahi rulers and Nizams attracted artists, architects and men of letters from different parts of the world through patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as ''[[mushaira]]s'' (poetic symposia).<ref name="Int Mushaira">{{cite news|title=Anjuman Muhibban-e-Urdu to hold international mushaira|url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/anjuman-muhibban-e-urdu-hold-international-mushaira|newspaper=The Siasat Daily|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani Urdu literature leading to works such as the ''[[Deccani Masnavi]]'' and ''[[Diwan (poetry)|Diwan poetry]]'', which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu.<ref name="Masud">{{cite book|title=Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|pages=50–77|year=1996|isbn=81-260-0233-6|last=Hussain Khan|first=Masud}}</ref> ''[[Lazzat Un Nisa]]'', a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts.<ref name="Lizzat-un-nisa">{{cite book|title=Scent in the Islamic Garden: A Study of Deccani Urdu Literary Sources|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=40|year=2001|isbn=978-0-19-579334-5|first=Ali Alber|last=Husain}}</ref> The reign of the Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education.<ref name="Datta">{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian literature: Devraj to Jyoti, Volume 2|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=1260, 1746–1748|year=2005|isbn=81-260-1194-7|last=Datta|first=Amaresh}}</ref> In 1824, a collection of Urdu ''[[Ghazal]]'' poetry, named ''Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa'', authored by [[Mah Laqa Bai]]—the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad.<ref name="Mah laqa bai">{{cite book|title=Women writing in India volume 1, 600 BC to the early twentieth century|publisher=[[The Feminist Press]]| pages=120–122|year=1991|isbn=1-55861-027-8|first1=Susie J.|last1=Tharu|first2=K.|last2=Lalita}}</ref>

===Music and films===
[[South Indian music]] and dances such as the [[Kuchipudi]] and [[Bharatanatyam]] styles are popular in the Deccan region.
