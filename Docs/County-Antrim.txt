'''County Antrim''' (named after the town of [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]) is one of six [[Counties of Northern Ireland|counties]] that form [[Northern Ireland]], situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Adjoined to the north-east shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of {{convert|3046|km2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28893/Antrim|title=Antrim|work=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> and has a population of about 618,000. It is one of six traditional [[counties of Northern Ireland]] and is within the historic [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]]. County Antrim has a population density of 203 people per square kilometer / 526 people per square mile.<ref>Divide the population of County Antrim (618,108) by the area (3046 km2)</ref>

The [[Glens of Antrim]] offer isolated rugged landscapes, the [[Giant's Causeway]] is a unique landscape and a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], [[Bushmills]] produces whiskey, and [[Portrush]] is a popular seaside resort and night-life area. The majority of [[Belfast]], the capital city of Northern Ireland, is in County Antrim, with the remainder being in [[County Down]].

==Geography==
[[File:Glendun - geograph.org.uk - 465779.jpg|250px|thumbnail|The famed Glens of Antrim at Glendun]]
[[Image:Fairhead.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fair Head seen from Ballycastle]]

[[Image:Larne Harbour from Inver.jpg|250px|thumb|Larne Harbour]]

A large portion of Antrim is hilly, especially in the east, where the highest elevations are attained. The range runs north and south, and, following this direction, the highest points are Knocklayd {{Convert|514|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, [[Slieveanorra Forest|Slieveanorra]] {{Convert|508|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, Trostan {{Convert|550|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, [[Slemish]] {{Convert|437|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, Agnew's Hill {{Convert|474|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and Divis {{Convert|478|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Mountain Views  | publisher = Simon Stewart  | url = http://mountainviews.ie/mv/index.php?ids=summit_view&mtnindex=361  | accessdate = 30 August 2010}}</ref> The inland slope is gradual, but on the northern shore the range terminates in abrupt and almost perpendicular declivities, and here, consequently, some of the finest coast scenery in the world is found, widely differing, with its unbroken lines of cliffs, from the indented coast-line of the west. The most remarkable cliffs are those formed of perpendicular basaltic columns, extending for many miles, and most strikingly displayed in [[Fair Head]] and the celebrated [[Giant's Causeway]]. From the eastern coast the hills rise instantly but less abruptly, and the indentations are wider and deeper. On both coasts there are several resort towns, including [[Portrush]] (with well-known golf links), [[Portballintrae]] and [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]]; on the east [[Cushendun]], [[Cushendall]] and [[Waterfoot, County Antrim|Waterfoot]] on Red Bay, [[Carnlough]] and [[Glenarm]], [[Larne]] on the [[Sea of Moyle]], and [[Whitehead, County Antrim|Whitehead]] on Belfast Lough. All are somewhat exposed to the easterly winds prevalent in spring. The only island of size is the L-shaped [[Rathlin Island]], off Ballycastle, {{Convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} in total length by {{Convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} maximum breadth, {{Convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast, and of similar basaltic and limestone formation to that of the mainland. It is partially arable, and supports a small population. [[Islandmagee]] is a peninsula separating [[Larne Lough]] from the [[North Channel (British Isles)|North Channel]].

The valleys of the [[River Bann|Bann]] and [[River Lagan|Lagan]], with the intervening shores of Lough Neagh, form the fertile lowlands. These two rivers, both rising in County Down, are the only ones of importance. The latter flows to Belfast Lough, the former drains Lough Neagh, which is fed by a number of smaller streams. The fisheries of the Bann and of Lough Neagh (especially for [[salmon]] and [[eel]]s) are of value both commercially and to sportsmen, the small town of [[Toome]], at the outflow of the river, being the centre. Immediately below this point lies Lough Beg, the "Small Lake", about {{Convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} lower than Lough Neagh.

==Transport==
County Antrim has a number of air, rail and sea links.

===Air===
Northern Ireland's main airport, [[Belfast International Airport]], at Aldergrove is in County Antrim. Belfast International shares its runways with the [[Royal Air Force]] base [[RAF Aldergrove]], which otherwise has its own facilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} It is the fifth-largest regional air cargo centre in the UK. There are regular services to Great Britain, Europe and North America.

The region is also served by [[George Best Belfast City Airport]], a mile east of Belfast [[Belfast City Centre|city centre]] on the County Down side of the city, which was renamed in 2006 in honour of [[Association football|footballer]] [[George Best]].

===Rail===
{{See also|:Category:Railway stations in County Antrim}}

The main [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] [[Northern Ireland Railways]] routes are the major line between Belfast, Antrim, [[Ballymena]], [[Coleraine]] and [[Derry|Londonderry]], Belfast to [[Carrickfergus]] and [[Larne]], the port for [[Stranraer]] in Scotland and Coleraine to [[Portrush]].

===Sea===
Two of Northern Ireland's main ports are in County Antrim, [[Larne]] and [[Belfast]].

Ferries sail from Larne Harbour to destinations including [[Cairnryan]] and [[Troon]] in Scotland, and [[Fleetwood]] in England.

The [[Port of Belfast]] is Northern Ireland's principal maritime gateway, serving the Northern Ireland economy and increasingly that of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is a major centre of industry and commerce and has become established as the focus of logistics activity for Northern Ireland. Around two-thirds of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade, and a quarter of that for Ireland as a whole, is handled at the port, which receives over 6,000 vessels each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfast-harbour.co.uk/about-us.htm|title=About Us|work=Belfast Harbour}}</ref>

==Population==
The population of County Antrim was 615,384 according to recent <!--date?-->census information, making it the most populous county in Northern Ireland.

==Irish language==
Statistics for 2009–2010 show 1,832 students attending the 12 [[Gaelscoil]]eanna (Irish language primary schools) and 1 [[Gaelcholáiste]] (Irish language secondary school).<ref>[http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Oid-Tr%C3%AD-Mhe%C3%A1n-na-Gaeilge-in-%C3%89irinn-sa-Ghalltacht-09_101.doc Statistics from the national Gaelscoil management body, accessed at http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Oid-Tr%C3%AD-Mhe%C3%A1n-na-Gaeilge-in-%C3%89irinn-sa-Ghalltacht-09_101.doc, January 2012]</ref>

==Religion==
The [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] is the largest religious denomination, followed by the [[Catholic Church]] and the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]]. County Antrim is one of two [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] in Ireland in which the majority of people are [[Protestant]], according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], the other being [[County Down|Down]]. The strong Presbyterian presence in the county is due largely to the county's historical links with [[lowland Scotland]], which supplied many immigrants to Ireland.

==Administration==
The traditional county town is [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]. More recently, [[Ballymena]] was the seat of county government. The counties of Northern Ireland ceased to be administrative entities in 1973, with the reorganization of local government.

In Northern Ireland the county structure is no longer used in local government. Northern Ireland is split into [[Districts of Northern Ireland|districts]]. The majority of County Antrim residents are administered by the following nine councils:
* [[Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council]]
* [[Ballymena (borough)|Ballymena Borough Council]]
* [[Ballymoney (borough)|Ballymoney Borough Council]]
* [[Belfast City Council]]
* [[Carrickfergus Borough Council]]
* [[Larne Borough Council]]
* [[Lisburn City Council]]
* [[Moyle District Council]]

Small portions of the county are administered by councils that are based in neighbouring counties, notably the village of [[Aghagallon]] in the [[Craigavon Borough Council|Craigavon Borough]] and the town of [[Portrush]] in the [[Coleraine Borough Council|Coleraine Borough]].

The county contains within it the whole of five [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] [[constituencies]]:
* [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast North]]
* [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]]
* [[East Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|East Antrim]]
* [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|North Antrim]]
* [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|South Antrim]]

* [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast South]]
* [[East Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|East Londonderry]]
* [[Lagan Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Lagan Valley]]
* [[Upper Bann (UK Parliament constituency)|Upper Bann]]

==History==
[[File:Royal Avenue Belfast2.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Avenue, [[Belfast]].  [[Photochrom]] print circa 1890–1900.]]
At what date the county of Antrim was formed is not known, but it appears that a certain district bore this name before the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] (early 14th century), and when the shiring of Ulster was undertaken by Sir [[John Perrot]] in the 16th century, Antrim and Down were already recognised divisions, in contradistinction to the remainder of the province. The earliest known inhabitants were [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s of pre-[[Celt]]ic origin,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Prehistoric Archaeology of Ireland |last=Waddell |first=John |year=1998 |publisher=Galway University Press Limited |location=Galway |pages=11–24}}</ref> but the names of the [[townland]]s or subdivisions, supposed to have been made in the 13th century, are all of Gaelic derivation.{{Dubious|date=June 2010}}

In ancient times, Antrim was inhabited by a Celtic people called the [[Darini]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Early Irish History and Mythology |last=O'Rahilly |first=Thomas F. |authorlink=Thomas F. O'Rahilly |year=1946 |publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies |location=Dublin |page=7}}</ref> In the early Middle Ages, southern County Antrim was part of the Kingdom of [[Ulster|Ulidia]], ruled by the [[Dál Fiatach]] clans Keenan and MacDonlevy/McDunlavey; the north was part of [[Dál Riada]], which stretched into what is now western Scotland over the Irish Sea. Dál Riada was ruled by the O'Lynch clan, who were [[vassals]] of the Ulidians. Besides the Ulidians and Dál Riada, there were the [[Dál nAraide]] of lower County Antrim, and the [[Cruthin]], who were pre-Gaelic Celts and probably related to the Picts of Britain.<ref>{{cite book |title=Early Irish History and Mythology |last=O'Rahilly |first=Thomas F. |authorlink=Thomas F. O'Rahilly |year=1946 |publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies |location=Dublin |pages=341–352}}</ref> Between the 8th and 11th centuries Antrim was exposed to the inroads of the [[Vikings]].

In the late 12th century Antrim became part of the [[Earldom of Ulster]], conquered by [[Anglo-Norman]] invaders. A revival of Gaelic power followed the campaign of [[Edward Bruce]] in 1315, leaving [[Carrickfergus]] as the only significant English stronghold. In the late Middle Ages, Antrim was divided into three parts: northern Clandeboye, the Glynnes and the Route. The [[Cambro-Norman]] [[MacQuillan]]s were powerful in the Route. A branch of the O'Neills of Tyrone migrated to Clandeboye in the 14th century, and ruled it for a time. Their family was called O'Neill Clannaboy. A [[Gallowglass]] sept, the MacDonnells, became the most powerful in the Glynnes in the 15th century.

During the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor era]] (16th century) numerous adventurers from Britain attempted to colonise the region; many Scots settled in Antrim around this time.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Town of Belfast |last=Benn |first=George |authorlink=George Benn |year=1877 |publisher=Marcus Ward & Company |location=Belfast |pages=21 ff.}}; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (14th edition), '''Antrim'''.</ref> In 1588 the Antrim coast was the scene of one of the 24 wrecks of the [[Spanish Armada in Ireland]]. The Spanish vessel ''[[Girona (ship)|La Girona]]'' was wrecked off Lacana Point, Giant's Causeway in 1588 with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.<ref name="girona">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/ACHWS_annual_report_2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=La Girona|work=# Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Historic Wrecks, 2005|publisher=Advisory Committee on Historic Wreck Sites|pages=35|accessdate=1 November 2008}}</ref>

Antrim is divided into sixteen baronies. Lower Antrim, part of Lower Clandeboye, was settled by the sept O'Flynn/O'Lynn. Upper Antrim, part of Lower Clandeboye, was the home of the O'Keevans. Belfast was part of Lower Clandeboye and was held by the O'Neill-Clannaboys. Lower Belfast, Upper Belfast, and Carrickfergus were also part of Lower Clandeboye. Cary was part of the Glynnes; ruled originally by the O'Quinn sept, the MacDonnell galloglasses from Scotland took power here in the late Middle Ages and some of the O'Haras also migrated from [[Connacht|Connaught]]. Upper and Lower [[Dunluce, County Antrim|Dunluce]] were part of the Route, and were ruled by the MacQuillans. Upper and Lower [[Glenarm]] was ruled by the O'Flynn/O'Lynn sept, considered part of the Glynns. In addition to that sept and that of O'Quinn, both of which were native, the Scottish [[Gallowglass]] septs of MacKeown, MacAlister, and MacGee, are found there. Kilconway was originally O'Flynn/O'Lynn territory, but was held by the MacQuillans as part of the Route, and later by the [[gallowglass]] sept of MacNeill. Lower Massereene was part of Lower Clandeboye and was ruled by the O'Flynns and the O'Heircs. Upper Massereene was part of Lower Clandeboye, ruled by the O'Heircs. Upper and Lower Toome, part of the Route, were O'Flynn/O'Lynn territory. Misc was first ruled by the MacQuillans. Later, the Scottish Gallowglass MacDonnells and MacAlisters invaded. The MacDonnells were a branch of the Scottish Clan MacDonald; the MacAlisters traced their origin back to the Irish Colla Uais, eldest of the Three Collas.

[[Islandmagee]] had, besides antiquarian remains, a notoriety as a home of witchcraft, and during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] was the scene of an act of reprisal (for the massacre of [[Protestants]]) against the Catholic population by the Scottish [[Covenanter]] soldiery of [[Carrickfergus]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}<!--For the witchcraft and the massacre -->

In 1689 during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], County Antrim was a centre of Protestant resistance against the rule of the Catholic [[James II of Ireland|James II]]. During the developing crisis James' garrison at [[Carrickfergus]] successfully repulsed an attempt by local Protestants to storm it. After the advance of the [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] under [[Richard Hamilton (officer)|Richard Hamilton]], all of County Antrim was brought under [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] control. Later in the year a major expedition from England under [[Marshal Schomberg]] landed in [[Belfast Lough]] and successfully [[Siege of Carrickfergus|laid siege to Carrickfergus]]. Having captured most of the largest towns of the area, they then marched southwards towards [[Dundalk Camp|Dundalk]].

===Historic monuments===
[[Image:Dunluce Castle.jpg|thumb|250px|Dunluce Castle.]]
[[Image:Carrickferguscastle.jpg|thumb|250px|Carrickfergus Castle (1177)]]
{{See also|:Category:Castles in County Antrim|l1=Castles in County Antrim}}

The antiquities of the county consist of [[cairn]]s, mounts or forts, remains of ecclesiastical and military structures, and [[Irish round tower|round tower]]s.

There are three round towers: one at Antrim, one at [[Armoy]], and one on [[Ram's Island, Northern Ireland|Ram's Island]] in Lough Neagh, only that at Antrim being perfect. There are some remains of the ecclesiastic establishments at [[Bonamargy]], where the earls of Antrim are buried, [[Kells, County Antrim|Kells]], Glenarm, [[Glynn]], [[Muckamore]] and Whiteabbey.

The castle at [[Carrickfergus Castle|Carrickfergus]], dating from the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], is one of the best preserved medieval structures in Ireland. There are, however, remains of other ancient castles, as [[Olderfleet]], Cam's, [[Shane's Castle|Shane's]], Glenarm, Garron Tower, Red Bay, and [[Dunluce Castle]], notable for its dramatic location on a rocky outcrop.

The principal cairns are: one on Colin mountain, near Lisburn; one on [[Slieve True]], near Carrickfergus; and two on Colinward. The [[cromlech]]s most worthy of notice are: one near [[Cairngrainey]], to the north-east of the old road from Belfast to [[Templepatrick]]; the large cromlech at [[Mount Druid]], near [[Ballintoy]]; and one at the northern extremity of Islandmagee. The mounts, forts and entrenchments are very numerous.

The natural rock formations of [[Giant's Causeway]] on the Antrim coast are now designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

===Saint Patrick===
[[Slemish]], about eight miles (13&nbsp;km) east of Ballymena, is notable as being the scene of St Patrick's early life. According to tradition [[Saint Patrick]] was a slave for seven years, near the hill of Slemish, until he escaped back to Great Britain.

===Linen===
[[Irish linen|Linen]] manufacturing was previously an important industry in the County. At the time Ireland produced a large amount of [[flax]]. Cotton-spinning by [[Spinning jenny|jennies]] was first introduced to Belfast by industrialists Robert Joy and Thomas M'Cabe in 1777; and twenty-three years later it was estimated that more than 27,000 people were employed in the industry within ten miles (16&nbsp;km) of Belfast. Women were employed in the working of patterns on [[muslin]].
