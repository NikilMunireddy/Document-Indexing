'''Air France''' ({{IPA-fr|ɛːʁ fʁɑ̃s}}; formally ''Société Air France, S.A.''), stylized as '''AIRFRANCE''', is the French [[flag carrier]] headquartered in [[Tremblay-en-France]],<!--See citations below at "Head office"--> (north of Paris). It is a subsidiary of the [[Air France–KLM]] Group and a founding member of the [[SkyTeam]] global airline alliance. As of 2013 Air France serves 36 destinations in France and operates worldwide scheduled passenger and cargo services to 168 destinations in 93 countries (including [[overseas departments and territories of France]]) and also carried 46,803,000 passengers in 2015. The airline's global [[airline hub|hub]] is at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], with [[Orly Airport]], [[Lyon–Saint Exupéry Airport]], [[Marseille Provence Airport]], [[Toulouse Blagnac Airport]], and [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport]] serving as secondary hubs.<ref name="FI">{{cite news|title=Directory: World Airlines|work=[[Flight International]]|pages=56–57|date=27 March 2007}}</ref> Air France's [[corporate headquarters]], previously in [[Montparnasse]], Paris,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/business/air-france-s-big-challenge.html|title=Air France's Big Challenge|work=The New York Times|accessdate=31 May 2009|last=Salpukas|first=Agis|date=27 December 1992| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090618144013/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/business/air-france-s-big-challenge.html| archivedate= 18 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> are located on the grounds of [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], north of Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/air-france/--ID__43290--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml|title=Air France – Company Overview|work=[[Hoover's]]|accessdate=31 May 2009|year=2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090427190353/http://www.hoovers.com/air-france/--ID__43290--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml| archivedate= 27 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Air France was formed on 7 October 1933 from a merger of [[Air Orient]], [[Air Union]], [[Compagnie Générale Aéropostale]], [[Compagnie Internationale de Navigation Aérienne|Compagnie Internationale de Navigation Aérienne (CIDNA)]], and [[Société Générale des Transports Aériens|Société Générale de Transport Aérien (SGTA)]]. During the [[Cold War]], from 1950 until 1990, it was one of the three main [[Allied Control Council|Allied]] scheduled airlines operating in Germany at [[West Berlin]]'s [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport#Postwar commercial use|Tempelhof]] and [[Berlin Tegel Airport#Air France|Tegel]] airports. In 1990, it acquired the operations of French domestic carrier [[Air Inter]] and international rival UTA – [[Union de Transports Aériens]]. It served as France's primary national [[flag carrier]] for seven decades prior to its 2003 [[merger]] with [[KLM]].

Between April 2001 and March 2002, the airline carried 43.3&nbsp;million passengers and had a total [[revenue]] of [[Euro (currency)|€]]12.53bn. In November 2004, Air France ranked as the largest European airline with 25.5% total market share, and was the largest airline in the world in terms of operating revenue.

Air France operates a mixed fleet of [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] [[wide-body|widebody]] [[jet aircraft|jets]] on long-haul routes, and uses [[Airbus A320 family]] aircraft on short-haul routes. Air France introduced the [[Airbus A380|A380]] on 20 November 2009 with service to New York's JFK Airport from Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport. The carrier's [[regional airline]] subsidiary, [[HOP!]], operates the majority of its regional domestic and European scheduled services with a fleet of [[regional jet]] aircraft.<ref>[http://www.regional.com/data_e/compagnie/index.html Régional (Compagnie Aérienne Européenne), Company Profile] {{wayback|url=http://www.regional.com/data_e/compagnie/index.html |date=20061019143222 |df=y }}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early years===
[[File:Inauguration-aérogare-Invalides.JPG|thumb|left|The inauguration of the Aérogare des Invalides on 21 August 1951]]

Air France was formed on 7 October 1933, from a merger of [[Air Orient]], [[Air Union]], [[Compagnie Générale Aéropostale]], [[Compagnie Internationale de Navigation Aérienne]] (CIDNA) and [[Société Générale des Transports Aériens]] (SGTA).  Of these airlines, SGTA was the first commercial airline company in France, having been founded as Lignes Aériennes Farman in 1919.  The constituent members of Air France had already built extensive networks across Europe, to [[French colonies]] in North Africa and farther afield. During World War II, Air France moved its operations to [[Casablanca]] (Morocco).

On 26 June 1945 all of France's [[air transport]] companies were [[nationalization|nationalised]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000339693&fastPos=3&fastReqId=559500528&categorieLien=id&oldAction=rechTexte |title=Ordonnance n°45-1403 du 26 juin 1945 portant nationalisation des transports aériens |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |accessdate=31 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110605000113/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000339693&fastPos=3&fastReqId=559500528&categorieLien=id&oldAction=rechTexte| archivedate= 5 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref> On 29 December 1945, a decree of the [[French Government]] granted Air France the management of the entire French air transport network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.airfrance.com/en/the-airline/history/ |title=Air France: History |publisher=Air France |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref> Air France appointed its first [[flight attendant]]s in 1946. The same year the airline opened its first air terminal at [[Les Invalides]] in central Paris. It was linked to [[Paris Le Bourget Airport]], Air France's first operations and engineering base, by coach. At that time the network covered 160,000&nbsp;km, claimed to be the longest in the world.<ref name="AF_History">{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/fr$hfair.html |title=Air France (Airline, France) |publisher=Fotw.net |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref> Société Nationale Air France was set up on 1 January 1946.

[[File:Douglas C-47A F-BAXP AF RWY 06.07.52 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Air France [[Douglas DC-3]] at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1952]]
European schedules were initially operated by a fleet of [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft. On 1 July 1946, Air France started direct flights between Paris and New York via refuelling stops at [[Shannon International Airport|Shannon]] and [[Gander International Airport|Gander]]. [[Douglas DC-4]] [[piston|piston-engine]] [[airliner]]s covered the route in just under 20 hours.<ref name="AF_History" /> In September 1947 Air France's network stretched east from New York, Fort de France and Buenos Aires to Shanghai.

By 1948 Air France operated 130 aircraft, one of the largest fleets in the world.<ref name="AF_History" /> Between 1947 and 1965 the airline operated [[Lockheed Constellation]]s on passenger and cargo services worldwide.<ref>Marson, Peter, "The Lockheed Constellation Series", Air-Britain (Historians) Ltd, 1982, ISBN 0-85130-100-2, pages 137–141</ref> In 1946 and 1948, respectively, the French government authorised the creation of two private airlines: [[Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux|Transports Aériens Internationaux]] – later [[Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux]] – (TAI) and SATI. In 1949 the latter became part of [[Union Aéromaritime de Transport|Union Aéromaritime de Transport (UAT)]], a private French international airline.<ref name="AF_History" /><ref>''Aeroplane – Airline of the Month: UTA – Five-star independent'', Vol. 109, No. 2798, p. 4, Temple Press, London, 3 June 1965</ref>

Compagnie Nationale Air France was created by [[act of parliament]] on 16 June 1948. Initially, the government held 70%. In subsequent years the [[French Government|French state]]'s direct and indirect shareholdings reached almost 100%. In mid-2002 the state held 54%.<ref name="AF_History" /><ref name="Dirigisme">{{cite web|url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~mrg217/MA.pdf |title=The Changing Nature of French Dirigisme |format=PDF |accessdate=31 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606234042/http://homepages.nyu.edu/~mrg217/MA.pdf| archivedate= 6 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

On 4 August 1948 [[Max Hymans]] was appointed president. During his 13-year [[tenure]] he would implement modernisation practices centred on the introduction of [[jet aircraft]]. In 1949 the company became a co-founder of [[SITA (IT company)|Société Internationale de Télécommunications Aéronautiques (SITA)]], an airline telecommunications services company.<ref name="AF_History" />

===Jet age re-organisation===
[[File:Lockheed Constellation, Air France.jpg|thumb|Passengers disembarking from a Sud-Est SE-161]]

In 1952 Air France moved its operations and engineering base to the new [[Paris Orly Airport]] South terminal. By then the network covered 250,000&nbsp;km.<ref name="AF_History" /> Air France entered the jet age in 1953 with the original, short-lived [[de Havilland Comet]] series 1, the world's first [[jet airliner|jetliner]].

During the mid-1950s it also operated the [[Vickers Viscount]] turboprop, with twelve entering service between May 1953 and August 1954 on the European routes. On 26 September 1953 the government instructed Air France to share long-distance routes with new private airlines. This was followed by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport's imposition of an [[Contract|accord]] on Air France, [[Aigle Azur]], [[TACA International Airlines|TAI]] and [[Union Aéromaritime de Transport|UAT]], under which some routes to Africa, Asia and the Pacific region were transferred to private carriers.<ref name="AF_History" />

On 23 February 1960 the Ministry of Public Works and Transport transferred Air France's domestic monopoly to Air Inter. To compensate for the loss of its domestic network Air France was given a stake in Air Inter. The following day Air France was instructed to share African routes with [[Air Afrique]] and [[Union Aéromaritime de Transport|UAT]].<ref name="AF_History" /><ref name="Dirigisme" />

The airline started uninterrupted [[jet aircraft|jet]] operations in 1960 with the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] and the [[Boeing 707]];<ref name="AF_History" /> jet airliners cut travel times in half and improved comfort.<ref name="AF_History" /> Air France later became an early [[Boeing 747]] operator and eventually had one of the world's largest 747 fleets.

[[File:Air France Caravelle Gilliand.jpg|thumb|left|Air France Caravelle jetliner in 1977]]
On 1 February 1963 the government formalised division of routes between Air France and its [[private sector]] rivals. Air France was to withdraw services to West Africa (except [[Senegal]]), Central Africa (except [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]]), Southern Africa (including [[Republic of South Africa|South Africa]]), [[Libya]] in North Africa, [[Bahrain]] and [[Oman]] in the Middle East, Sri Lanka (then known as [[Ceylon]]) in South Asia, Indonesia, [[Malaysia]] and Singapore in Southeast Asia, Australia, [[New Zealand]] as well as [[New Caledonia]] and [[Tahiti]]. These routes were allocated to the new [[Union de Transports Aériens]] (UTA), a new private airline resulting from the merger of TAI and UAT. UTA also got exclusive rights between Japan, [[New Caledonia]] and [[New Zealand]], South Africa and [[Réunion]] island in the Indian Ocean, as well as Los Angeles and Tahiti.<ref name="AF_History" /><ref name="Dirigisme" /><ref>''Aeroplane – Airline of the Month: UTA – Five-star independent'', Vol. 109, No. 2798, pp. 4–6, Temple Press, London, 3 June 1965</ref>

From 1974, Air France began shifting the bulk of operations to the new Charles de Gaulle Airport north of Paris. By the early 1980s, only [[Corsica]], Martinique, [[Guadeloupe]], most services to [[French Guyana]], Réunion, the [[Maghreb]] region, Eastern Europe (except the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]), Southern Europe (except [[Greece]] and Italy), and one daily service to New York (JFK) remained at Orly. In 1974, Air France also became the world's first operator of the [[Airbus A300]] twin-engine [[wide-body|widebody]] plane, [[Airbus Industrie]]'s first commercial airliner for which it was a launch customer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.key.aero/view_feature.asp?ID=37&thisSection=commercial |title=Airliner Classic: Airbus A300 – the beginning for a giant: key.Aero, Commercial Aviation |publisher=Key.aero |accessdate=31 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110428232437/http://key.aero/view_feature.asp?ID=37&thisSection=commercial| archivedate= 28 April 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Concorde service and rivalry===
[[File:Air France Concorde Jonsson.jpg|thumb|Air France [[Concorde]] at [[CDG Airport]] in 2003]]

On 21 January 1976, Air France operated its inaugural [[supersonic|supersonic transport (SST)]] service on the Paris (Charles de Gaulle) to [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] (via [[Dakar]]) route with [[France–United Kingdom relations|Anglo-French]] [[Concorde|BAC-Aérospatiale Concorde]] F-BVFA. Supersonic services from Paris (CDG) to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] began on 24 May 1976, also with F-BVFA. Service to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York]] (JFK) – the only remaining Concorde service until its end – commenced on 22 November 1977. Paris to New York was flown in 3 hours 23 minutes, at about twice the [[speed of sound]]. Approval for flights to the United States was initially withheld due to noise protests. Eventually, services to [[Mexico City]] via Washington, D.C. were started. Air France became one of only two airlines – [[British Airways]] being the other – to regularly operate supersonic services, and continued daily transatlantic Concorde service until late May 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63686234.html |title=Decades of safe flying come to an end |work=The Birmingham Post |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=26 July 2000 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref>

By 1983, Air France's [[golden jubilee]], the workforce numbered more than 34,000, its fleet about 100 [[jet aircraft]] (including 33 [[Boeing 747]]s) and its 634,400&nbsp;km network served 150 destinations in 73 countries. This made Air France the fourth-largest scheduled passenger airline in the world, as well as the second-largest scheduled freight carrier.<ref name="AF_History" /> Air France also codeshared with regional French airlines, [[TAT (French airline)|TAT]] being the most prominent. TAT would later operate several regional international routes on behalf of Air France.<ref name="AplinMontchamp1999">{{cite book|author1=Richard Aplin|author2=Joseph Montchamp|title=A dictionary of contemporary France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQ-c6BnUUcgC&pg=PA453|accessdate=4 August 2010|date=1 April 1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-57958-115-2|page=453}}</ref> In 1983 Air France began passenger flights to [[South Korea]], being the first European airline to do so.<ref>Rahn, Kim. "[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/06/119_31638.html Air France Celebrates 25th Years in Korea]." ''[[The Korea Times]]''. 25 September 2008. Retrieved on 29 June 2010.</ref>

In 1986 the government relaxed its policy of dividing traffic rights for scheduled services between Air France, Air Inter and UTA, without route overlaps between them. The decision opened some of Air France's most lucrative routes on which it had enjoyed a government-sanctioned monopoly since 1963 and which were within its exclusive sphere of influence, to rival airlines, notably UTA. The changes enabled UTA to launch scheduled services to new destinations within Air France's sphere, in competition with that airline.

[[File:Air France Boeing 747-100 Gilliand.jpg|thumb|right|Air France operated 33 [[Boeing 747]]s by 1983. Here, a 747-100 is seen at [[CDG Airport]] in 1978.]]
Paris-San Francisco became the first route UTA served in competition with Air France non-stop from Paris. Air France responded by extending some non-stop Paris-Los Angeles services to [[Papeete]], Tahiti, which competed with UTA on Los Angeles-Papeete. UTA's ability to secure traffic rights outside its traditional sphere in competition with Air France was the result of a campaign to [[lobbying|lobby]] the government to enable it to grow faster, becoming more dynamic and more [[profit (accounting)|profitable]]. This infuriated Air France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/chargeurs-international?cat=biz-fin |title=Chargeurs International |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=31 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110628181420/http://www.answers.com/topic/chargeurs-international?cat=biz-fin| archivedate= 28 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1987 Air France together with [[Lufthansa]], [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] and [[SAS Group|SAS]] founded [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]], an IT company (also known as a [[Computer reservations system|GDS]]) that would enable travel agencies to sell the founders and other airlines' products from a single system.

In 1988, Air France was a launch customer for the [[fly-by-wire|fly-by-wire (FBW)]] A320 [[narrow-body|narrowbody]] twin, along with Air Inter and [[British Caledonian]]. It became the first airline to take delivery of the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] in March 1988, and along with Air Inter became the first airlines to introduce Airbus A320 service on short-haul routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroweb-fr.net/histoire/1988 |title=Evènements aéronautiques de l'année 1988 |publisher=Aeroweb-fr.net |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref>

===Acquisitions and privatisation===
[[File:Air Inter Dassault Mercure 100 Alain Durand.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dassault Mercure]] of [[Air Inter]] which became part of Air France in 1990]]

On 12 January 1990, the operations of government-owned Air France, semi-public Air Inter and wholly private [[Union de Transports Aériens]] (UTA) were merged into an enlarged Air France.<ref name="AF_History" /> Air France's acquisition of UTA and Air Inter was part of an early 1990s government plan to create a unified, [[national carrier|national air carrier]] with the [[economies of scale]] and global reach to counter potential threats from the [[liberalisation]] of the EU's internal air transport market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e6c07ce8-6de8-11dc-b8ab-0000779fd2ac,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2Fe6c07ce8-6de8-11dc-b8ab-0000779fd2ac.html&_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2Fsearch%3Fhl%3Den |title=Pilot who found the right trajectory |work=Financial Times |date=30 September 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609044937/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e6c07ce8-6de8-11dc-b8ab-0000779fd2ac,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http:%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2Fe6c07ce8-6de8-11dc-b8ab-0000779fd2ac.html&_i_referer=http:%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2Fsearch%3Fhl=en| archivedate= 9 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

On 25 July 1994, a new holding company, Groupe Air France, was set up by decree. Groupe Air France became operational on 1 September 1994. It acquired the Air France group's majority shareholdings in Air France and Air Inter (subsequently renamed Air Inter Europe). On 31 August 1994, [[Stephen Wolf]], a former [[United Airlines]] CEO, was appointed adviser to the Air France group's chairman [[Christian Blanc]]. Wolf was credited with the introduction of Air France's [[hub and spoke]] operation at Paris Charles de Gaulle. (Wolf resigned in 1996 to take over as CEO at [[US Airways]].)<ref>{{cite web|last=Leonhardt |first=David |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/stephen_m_wolf/index.html?query=APPOINTMENTS%20AND%20EXECUTIVE%20CHANGES&field=des&match=exact |work=The New York Times |date=31 August 1994 |title=Air France's New Adviser |accessdate=31 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110520022215/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/stephen_m_wolf/index.html?query=APPOINTMENTS%20AND%20EXECUTIVE%20CHANGES&field=des&match=exact| archivedate= 20 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_Jan_16/ai_17793707 Statement from Air France Group Chairman regarding Stephen M.

In 1997, Air France Europe was absorbed into Air France. On 19 February 1999, French Prime Minister [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[Plural Left]] government approved Air France's partial [[privatisation]]. Its [[ownership equity|shares]] were listed on the Paris [[stock exchange]] on 22 February 1999. In June 1999, Air France and [[Delta Air Lines]] formed a bilateral [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] [[Articles of Partnership|partnership]]. On 22 June 2000, this expanded into the [[SkyTeam]] global [[airline alliance]].<ref name="FI" /><ref name="AF_History" />

===Air France-KLM merger===
[[File:Air France & KLM vertical stabilizers.jpg|thumb|The merger of Air France and KLM occurred in 2004]]

On 30 September 2003, Air France and [[Netherlands]]-based [[KLM|KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] announced the merger of the two airlines, the new company to be known as Air France-KLM. The merger became reality on 5 May 2004. At that point former Air France shareholders owned 81% of the new firm (44% owned by the French state, 37% by private shareholders), former KLM shareholders the rest. The decision of the [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] government to reduce the French state's shareholding in the former Air France group from 54.4% to 44% of the newly created Air France-KLM Group effectively privatised the new airline. In December 2004 the state sold 18.4% of its equity in Air France-KLM. The state's shareholding in Air France-KLM subsequently fell to just under 20%.<ref name="FI" />

Air France-KLM became the largest airline in the world in terms of operating [[revenue]]s, and third-largest (largest in Europe) in passenger kilometres.<ref name="FI" /> Although owned by a single company, Air France and KLM continued to fly under their own [[brand name]]s. Air France-KLM remained part of the SkyTeam alliance, which then included [[Aeroflot]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Aeroméxico]], [[Korean Air]], [[Czech Airlines]], [[Alitalia]], [[Northwest Airlines]], [[China Southern Airlines]], [[Air Europa]], [[Continental Airlines]], and [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]]. As of March 2004, Air France employed 71,654 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=AIRF.PA |title=AIR FRANCE – KLM Company Profile |publisher=Yahoo!

===Open Skies venture===
On 17 October 2007, the creation of a profit and revenue-sharing transatlantic joint venture between Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines was announced during a press conference at Air France-KLM's headquarters.  The venture became effective on 29 March 2008. It aimed to exploit transatlantic opportunities to capture a major share of long-haul business traffic from [[London Heathrow Airport]], which opened to unrestricted competition on that day as a result of the "[[Open Skies]]" [[Treaty|pact]] between the EU and US.  It was envisaged that Air France and [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] would begin nine daily round trips between London-Heathrow and destinations in the USA, including a daily London (Heathrow) to Los Angeles service by Air France.  Once the new Air France-Delta venture received [[United States antitrust law|antitrust immunity]], it was to be extended to the other two transatlantic SkyTeam partners, enabling all four partners to codeshare flights as well as to share revenue and profit.<ref name="FT_London_target">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/853cb266-7c3e-11dc-be7e-0000779fd2ac.html |title=Air France and Delta target London |work=Financial Times |date=17 October 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609054447/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/853cb266-7c3e-11dc-be7e-0000779fd2ac.html| archivedate= 9 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.airwise.com/story/view/1192611010.html |title=Air France And Delta Set Transatlantic Venture |publisher=Airwise |date=17 October 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110516104348/http://news.airwise.com/story/view/1192611010.html| archivedate= 16 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>
The new transatlantic joint venture marks the Air France-KLM Group's second major expansion in the London market, following the launch of [[CityJet]]-operated short-haul services from [[London City Airport]] that have been aimed at business travellers in the [[City of London|City]]'s [[financial services]] industry.<ref name="FT_London_target" /> However, the daily London (Heathrow) to Los Angeles service was not as successful as hoped, and was discontinued in November 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.latimes.com/daily-deal-blog/index.php/air-france-will-refu-2984/|title=Air France will refund or reroute LAX-Heathrow fliers|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=9 May 2009|last=Engle|first=Jane}}</ref>

===2010s===
On 12 January 2012, Air France-KLM announced their three-year transformation plan, called Transform 2015, to restore profitability. This plan works by restoring competitiveness through cost-cutting, restructuring the short- and medium-haul operations and rapidly reducing debt. The main objective of this plan is to turn Air France-KLM back into a world player by 2015. Air France has been losing 700 million euros a year. As the financial results of recent quarters demonstrate, the long-haul operations, also subject to increasing competition, cannot alone offset these losses. On 22 February 2012, Air France released their plan for summer schedule. Because of the uncertain economic environment, Air France-KLM has set a limit of 1.4% maximum increase in capacity from 25 March 2012 – 28 October 2012.

On 21 June 2012, Air France-KLM had announced its decision to cut just under 10% of the total 53,000 workforce (about 5,000 jobs) by the end of next year in an attempt to restore profitability by 1,700 jobs natural turnover and the rest by voluntary redundancies, so hopefully no compulsory redundancies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18532668 |title=Air France to cut 5,000 jobs by the end of 2013 |date=21 June 2012 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> As of August 2012, the Transform 2015 plan was accepted by ground staff and pilot unions but rejected by cabin crew unions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capital.fr/bourse/actualites/air-france-klm-les-pilotes-approuvent-le-plan-transform-2015-749210 |title=AIR FRANCE-KLM : les pilotes approuvent le plan Transform 2015 |language=fr |publisher=Capital.fr |date=26 February 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref>

At the beginning of July 2012, it was announced that Air France-KLM found partners for the new African start-up airline [[Air Cemac]], which was co-founded by six countries in Central Africa to replace the former [[Air Afrique]]. But several problems and two partners, who decided to back out, delayed the implementation of the project. Following its launch, Air Cemac announced it would commence operations in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=N.

Owing to the [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|disputed status]] of [[Taiwan]], Air France could not operate flights to the island under its own name. In 1993, its subsidiary, [[Air Charter International|Air Charter]], began operating flights between Paris and [[Taipei]] via Hong Kong,<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/article/43219/french-plans-taipei French plans for Taipei], ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', 8 September 1993</ref> but after Air Charter ceased operations in 1998, a subsidiary called '''Air France Asie''' was established.<ref>[http://www.sciencespo.fr/ceri/sites/sciencespo.fr.ceri/files/jpcabest.pdf FRANCE'S TAIWAN POLICY: A CASE OF SHOPKEEPER DIPLOMACY], Jean Pierre Cabestan, 2001</ref> The airline was one of a number of airline subsidiaries flying under the "Asia" name with the purpose of flying to Taiwan, which included [[Japan Asia Airways]] (a [[Japan Airlines]] subsidiary), [[KLM Asia]], [[British Asia Airways]], [[Swissair#Swissair Asia|Swissair Asia]], and [[Australia Asia Airlines]] (a [[Qantas]] subsidiary).

The livery of Air France Asie differed from that of Air France by having a design in blue and white on tailfin, rather than one in blue, white and red, representing the [[Flag of France|French Tricolour]]. Air France Asie used two Airbus A340-200 aircraft, F-GLZD and F-GLZE, and two Boeing 747-428Ms, F-GISA et F-GISC. Similarly, '''Air France Cargo Asie''' used a 747-200 Combi (for passengers and freight), F-GCBH) or the all-cargo (F-GCBL, F-GPAN et F-GBOX). Air France Asie ceased operations in 2004 while Air France Cargo Asie ceased operations in 2007.

===Outsourcing===
In 2010 Air France migrated from an internally managed [[Passenger service system]] (Alpha3) that manages reservation, inventory and pricing to an external system (Altéa) managed by [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]]. In rail ventures, Air France and [[Veolia]] are looking into jointly operating [[high-speed rail]] services in Europe. Routes have become available to operators in accordance with European rail liberalisation on 1 January 2010.<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL814254520080908 Air France, Veolia plan high-speed rail venture] Reuters, 8 September 2008</ref>

===Livery===

[[File:AirFrance-Boeing777-300ER-YUL-2009.jpg|thumb|Air France [[Boeing 777-300ER]] in the new livery landing at Montreal-Trudeau.]]
Air France's present livery is a "Eurowhite" scheme, comprising a white fuselage with the blue Air France title and design. The tail is white with a series of parallel red and blue lines across the it at an angle, and a small European flag at the top. This livery has been in use since the late 1970s. Prior to the "Eurowhite" livery, Air France aircraft had a bare-metal underside, extending up to a blue cheat-line that ran across the cabin windows. Above the cheat-line the fuselage was again white, with Air France titles and a French flag. The tail was white with two thick blue lines, which tapered from the rear of the tail and met at point towards the front bottom. This basic livery, with minor variations, would appear on all post-war Air France aircraft until the late 1970s.

On January 2009, to coincide with Air France's new logo, a new livery was unveiled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/02/11/322387/picture-air-frances-new-livery-retains-much-of-current-scheme.html|title=Air France's new livery retains much of current scheme|work=Flight International|accessdate=11 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090212215724/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/02/11/322387/picture-air-frances-new-livery-retains-much-of-current-scheme.html| archivedate= 12 February 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Air France rolled out their new livery on 11 February 2009. The 2009 livery saw the tail slightly changed; there are now 3 blue bars running down instead of 4 previously. The bars also now curve at the bottom, reflecting the design of the logo.

===Marketing===
The new official song played before and after Air France flights (during boarding and after landing) is 'The World Can Be Yours' by [[Telepopmusik]]. Air France has used different popular music groups for its marketing and on-board ambience, ranging from [[The Chemical Brothers]] in 1999 to [[Telepopmusik]] in 2010.<ref>{{Cite press release| title="Air France Music" takes off| publisher=Air France| date=16 March 2010| url=http://corporate.airfrance.com/en/press/press-releases/article/item/lunivers-musical-dair-france-senvole-sur-air-france-music/back/61/browse/5/| accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>

Air France launched a new ad campaign in 2015 designed by [[BETC]] and directed by We Are From LA, focusing on French culture. Along with the ad campaign and print ads, Air France also introduced a similarly themed safety video. The music is a customised version of [[Glass Candy]]'s song ''Warm in the Winter''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Air France Bring A Bit of Parisian Flair To Our Screens|url=http://thedesignair.net/2015/03/06/air-france-bring-a-bit-of-parisian-flair-to-our-screens/|website=The Design Air|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>

===Uniforms===
Air France uniforms denote the ranks for the flight attendants. Two silver sleeve stripes denote a Chief Purser. One silver sleeve stripe denote a Purser. Flight attendants do not have any sleeve stripes. The female cabin crew uniforms feature the stripes on the breast pocket rather than the sleeve for their male counterparts. Air France's current uniforms were created by French fashion designer [[Christian Lacroix]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=Air France presents new uniforms designed by Lacroix|work=USA Today | date=4 April 2005| url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2005-04-04-airfrance-uniform_x.htm| accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>

===Branding===
Upon its formation, Air France adopted the [[seahorse]] logo of its predecessor Air Orient, known as the ''hippocampe ailé'' (sometimes derisively called "la crevette" – or shrimp – by its employees), as its insignia.<ref>{{cite news| title=AVIATION: Pegasus a la Francaise|work=Time | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861947,00.html| accessdate=3 August 2010 | date=23 January 1956| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100709122916/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861947,00.html| archivedate= 9 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Air France's Hippocampe and BOAC's Speedbird: the semiotic status of logos| publisher=French Cultural Studies| url=http://frc.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/4/11/107}}</ref> Prior to the Air France-KLM merger, the ''hippocampe ailé'' was used on the nose section of aircraft next to the Groupe Air France title; after the merger, the Air France-KLM logo was substituted at the nose area, and the ''hippocampe ailé'' was relocated to engine nacelles. The acronym "AF" has also featured prominently on the airline's flag and its signage. On 7 January 2009, Air France officially changed its logo to a red stripe.

====Concorde====
The five Air France Concordes were retired on 31 May 2003, as a result of insufficient demand following the [[Air France Flight 4590|25 July 2000 crash of AF Concorde F-BTSC]], at Gonesse (near Charles de Gaulle Airport), as well as higher fuel and maintenance costs. British Airways flew its last Concorde service on 24 October 2003. Concorde F-BVFA was transferred to the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]]. F-BVFB was given to the [[Sinsheim Auto & Technik Museum]] in Germany, F-BTSD to the [[Paris|Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace]] at Le Bourget Airport in Paris, while F-BVFC returned to its place of manufacture in [[Toulouse]], at the Airbus factory. F-BVFF is the only example to remain at Charles de Gaulle Airport.
