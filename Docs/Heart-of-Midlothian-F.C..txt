'''Heart of Midlothian Football Club''', commonly known as '''Hearts''', is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Gorgie]] in the west of [[Edinburgh]]. It is the only [[Scottish Premiership]] club in the city, with [[Edinburgh derby]] rivals [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] playing in the [[Scottish Championship]] and [[Edinburgh City F.C.|Edinburgh City]] playing in [[Scottish League Two]]. Hearts is the oldest football club in the Scottish capital,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} having formed in 1874 by a group of friends from the Heart of Midlothian Dancing Club. The modern club crest is based on the [[Heart of Midlothian (Royal Mile)|Heart of Midlothian mosaic]] on the city's [[Royal Mile]] and the team's colours are predominantly maroon and white.<ref name="1874-1884"/> Hearts play at [[Tynecastle Stadium]], where home matches have been played since 1886.<ref name = "Inglis447">{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=447}}</ref> After renovating the ground into an all-seater stadium following the findings of the [[Taylor Report]] in 1990, the all-seated stadium originally had a capacity of 18,008, but over the years this has been reduced to roughly 17,000 to comply with [[UEFA]] regulations.

Hearts have won the [[List of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championship]] four times, most recently in [[1959–60 Scottish First Division|1959–60]], where they also retained the [[1959 Scottish League Cup Final|Scottish League Cup]] to complete a [[Double (association football)#League & League Cup Double|League and League Cup double]] – the only club outside of the [[Old Firm]] to achieve such a feat. The club's [[1957–58 Scottish First Division|1957–58]] league winning side, led up front by [[Jimmy Wardhaugh]], [[Willie Bauld]] and [[Alfie Conn, Sr.]], who were affectionately known as ''The Terrible Trio'', set the record for the number of goals scored in a league campaign (132) and became the only side to finish a season with a goal difference exceeding 100 (+103). Hearts have won the [[Scottish Cup]] eight times, most recently in [[2012 Scottish Cup Final|2012]] after a 5–1 win over city-rivals Hibernian<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18044372|title=Hibernian 1 Hearts 5|date=19 May 2012|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 May 2012 }}</ref> and the [[Scottish League Cup]] a total of four times, most recently in [[1962 Scottish League Cup Final|1962]] after a 1–0 victory against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]]. The most recent Scottish League Cup Final appearance was in [[2012–13 Scottish League Cup|2013]], when they lost to St Mirren 3–2, despite a double from Ryan Stevenson.

In 1958, Heart of Midlothian became the third [[Football in Scotland|Scottish]] and fifth [[Football in the United Kingdom|British]] team to compete in [[UEFA#Competitions|European competition]] at the time. The club reached the quarter-finals of the [[1988–89 UEFA Cup]], narrowly losing out to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2–1 on aggregate. More recently, Hearts were the first non-Old Firm team to achieve qualification to the [[UEFA Champions League]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=2006–07 UEFA Champions League – Heart of Midlothian F.C. |author=UEFA |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2006/clubs/club=50120/matches/index.html |accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|List of Heart of Midlothian F.C. seasons}}

=== Early years ===
The club was formed by a group of friends from the Heart of Midlothian Dancing Club.<ref name="1874-1884" /> The group of friends bought a ball before playing local rules football at the Tron from where they were directed by a local policeman to the meadows to play. Local rules football was a mix of rugby and football as we know it.<ref name="1874-1884" /> In December 1873 a match was held between [[Queens Park F.C.|Queens Park]] and [[Clydesdale F.C.|Clydesdale]] at Raimes Park in [[Bonnington, Edinburgh|Bonnington]].<ref name="P56">{{cite book | title=McCrae's Battalion | accessdate=10 October 2011 | last=Alexander | first=Jack | authorlink= | page=56 | isbn=1-84018-707-7}}</ref> This was the first time that Association rules had been seen in Edinburgh. Members from the dance hall viewed the match and in 1874 decided to adopt the association rules.<ref name="p24">{{cite book | url=http://www.londonhearts.com/images/mack02/pages/p024.htm | title=The Hearts | publisher=London Hearts | work=Albert Mackie | accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref> The new side was Heart of Mid-Lothian Football Club.<ref name="1874-1884" /> The exact date of the club's formation was never recorded; however, 1874 is regarded as the year of formation as it was when association rules were taken on,<ref name="1874-1884" /> although [[Tom Purdie]] claimed the club was formed in 1873.<ref name="P27">{{cite web | url=http://www.londonhearts.com/images/mack02/pages/p027.htm | title=The Hearts | publisher=London Hearts | work=Albert Mackie | accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref> The earliest mention of ''Heart of Midlothian'' in a sporting context is a report in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper from 20 July 1864 of ''The Scotsman'' vs Heart of Mid-Lothian at cricket. It is not known if this was the same club who went on to form the football club, but it was common for football clubs in those days to play other sports as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/images/1864/1864072001.jpg |title=From 20 July 1864 of the Scotsman| publisher= London Hearts Supporter Club|accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Hearts team 1875.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Original Hearts strip]]Led by captain Tom Purdie the club played its matches in the East Meadows<ref name="P56" /> and in 1875 Hearts became members of the [[Scottish Football Association]] and were founder members of the Edinburgh Football Association.<ref name="1874-1884" /> By becoming members of the Scottish Association Hearts were able to play in the [[Scottish Cup]] for the first time. Hearts played against [[St Bernard's F.C.|3rd Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers]] on October 1875 at Craigmount Park<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/187510161.html|title=Games: Sat 16 Oct 1875   |publisher= Hearts of London Supporter Club|accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref> in Edinburgh. The game ended in a scoreless draw. A replay was held at the Meadows which again finished 0&nbsp;– 0. Under rules at the time both clubs progressed to the next round with Hearts losing out to Drumpellier in the next round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scotcuphistfull.html#1876|title=Scotland&nbsp;– Cup Results 1873/74-1877/78 and 1889/90-1995/96|accessdate= 13 June 2012|first= Dinant|last= Abbink|date=  2 May 2007}}</ref>

In the [[1884–85 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season|1884–85]] season, clubs in Scotland struggled to attract players, who were attracted to play in England, due to the games professional status there.<ref name="1874-1884" /> After an 11–1 win in the [[Scottish Cup]] over Dunfermline<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/188410041.html | title=Sat 04 Oct 1884 Scottish Cup Dunfermline 1 Hearts 11 | publisher=London Hearts | accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref> a protest was raised against the club for fielding two professional players.<ref name="1874-1884" /> Hearts were suspended by the SFA for two years as this was against the rules at the time. This was the first suspension of an SFA club.<ref name="P20">{{cite book | url=http://www.londonhearts.com/images/reid1924/pages/docu0011.htm | title=The Hearts 1874 to 1924 | publisher=London Hearts | work=William Reid | accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref> After a change of the clubs' committee the club was readmitted.<ref name="1874-1884" />

=== Early success ===
Hearts had considerable success in the early years of the [[Scottish Football League]], winning the league championship in [[1894–95 in Scottish football|1895]] and [[1895–96 in Scottish football|1896]]. They also won four [[Scottish Cup]]s in a 15-year period from 1891 to 1906. The team played against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[1895 World Championship (football)|1894–95 World Championship]], but lost with s 5–3 score. Hearts did win the World Championship title in 1902, beating [[Tottenham Hotspur]] 3–1 in [[Tynecastle Park]], after a 0–0 in London few month earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/190201021.html|title=1902-01-02 Thu Hearts 3 Tottenham Hotspur 1|publisher=}}</ref>

{{cquote|''Do not ask where Hearts are playing and then look at me askance. If it's football that you're wanting, you must come with us to France!''
[[George McCrae (MP)|Sir George McCrae]]}}
In November 1914, Heart of Midlothian comfortably led the First Division,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heartsfc.co.uk/articles/20101026/contalmaison-and-a-tribute-to-mccraes_2241384_2190827 |title=Contalmaison and a tribute to McCrae's |publisher=Heart of Midlothian F.C. |work=Hearts News |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20101029204725/http://www.heartsfc.co.uk:80/articles/20101026/contalmaison-and-a-tribute-to-mccraes_2241384_2190827 |archivedate=29 October 2010 }}</ref> having started the [[1914–15 in Scottish football|1914–15 season]] with eight straight victories, including a 2–0 defeat of reigning champions [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/191408151.html | title=Sat 15 Aug 1914 Division 1 Hearts 2 Celtic 0 | publisher=London Hearts | accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>

This streak coincided with the start of the First World War and the beginnings of a public debate upon the morality of continuing professional football while young soldiers were dying on the front-line. A motion was placed before the [[Scottish Football Association]] to postpone the season, with one of its backers, [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]] chairman Thomas Forsyth declaring that ''"playing football while our men are fighting is repugnant"''.<ref name="ballot">''McCrae's Battalion'', 15</ref> While this motion was defeated at the [[ballot box]], with the SFA opting to wait for War Office advice, the noted East London philanthropist [[Frederick Charrington]] was orchestrating a public campaign to have professional football in Britain suspended, and achieving great popular support for his cause.<ref name="Charrington">''McCrae's Battalion'', 21–24</ref> The prime tactic of Charrington's campaign was to shame football players and officials into action through public and private denouncement. In response, sixteen players from Hearts enlisted in [[George McCrae (MP)|Sir George McCrae]]'s new volunteer battalion, joining en masse on 25 November 1914. The battalion was to become the 16th Royal Scots and was the first to earn the "footballer's battalion" sobriquet. The group of volunteers also contained some 500 Hearts supporters and ticket-holders, 150 followers of Hibernian and a number of professionals footballers from Raith Rovers, Falkirk and Dunfermline.<ref name="Museum">{{cite web|title=Soccer Soldiers: Footballers go to war| work=The National Army Museum| url=http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/football/page2.shtml | accessdate=19 March 2007}}</ref> Military training was thus added to the Hearts players football training regime, and the side had a 20-game unbeaten run between October and February.<ref name="Season">{{cite web|title=Scotland 1914–15| work=The RSSSF| url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot15.html | accessdate=19 March 2007}}</ref> However, exhaustion from their army exertions, twice including 10-hour nocturnal-marches the night before a league game,<ref name="training">''McCrae's Battalion'', 95–99</ref> eventually led to a drop in form, as several enlisted players missed key games. Defeats to [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and Morton allowed Celtic to usurp the ''Maroons'' and eventually claim the league title by 4 points.<ref name="Season"/>

The war claimed the lives of seven first team players: Duncan Currie, John Allan, James Boyd, [[Tom Gracie]], [[Ernest Ellis]], [[James Speedie]] and Harry Wattie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heartsfc.co.uk/page/WarMemorial/0,,10289,00.html |title=The Proudest Moment of a Proud Club |publisher=Heart of Midlothian F.C. |work=Hearts News |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110921151637/http://www.heartsfc.co.uk:80/page/WarMemorial/0,,10289,00.html |archivedate=21 September 2011 }}</ref>

There are two war memorials to mark this period. The [[McCrae's Battalion Great War Memorial]] in [[Contalmaison]] and the Heart of Midlothian War Memorial in [[Haymarket, Edinburgh]] donated to the city by the club in 1922.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/heart-of-midlothian-war-memorial-moved-for-edinburgh-trams-1.909193 | title=Heart of Midlothian war memorial moved for Edinburgh trams | publisher=The Herald | work=Herald Scotland | date=4 May 2009 | accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref> The latter was placed in storage due to the [[Edinburgh Trams]] work<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8008214.stm | title=War memorial moved for tram works | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News | date=20 April 2009 | accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref> but has now been replaced a little to the east of its previous position.

=== The Tommy Walker era ===
The club went from 1906 to 1954 without winning a major trophy before enjoying a decade of success between 1954 and 1963. Under the management of [[Tommy Walker (footballer born 1915)|Tommy Walker]], Hearts won the League twice, in [[1957–58 in Scottish football|1958]], with a record 62 points and 132 goals scored (Still the Scottish 'Top' League Record) and only 29 against in 34 matches, and in [[1959–60 in Scottish football|1960]]. Hearts also won the Scottish Cup in [[1955–56 in Scottish football|1956]] and the [[Scottish League Cup]] four times, in [[1954–55 in Scottish football|1954]], [[1958–59 in Scottish football|1958]], 1959 and [[1962–63 in Scottish football|1962]]. This glorious period for the club contained many top, now legendary, names such as [[Alfie Conn, Sr.]], [[Willie Bauld]], [[Jimmy Wardhaugh]] (the Terrible Trio), [[John Cumming (footballer)|John Cumming]], [[Dave Mackay (footballer born 1934)|Dave Mackay]] and [[Alex Young (footballer born 1937)|Alex Young]]. In [[1964–65 in Scottish football|1964–65]] Hearts lost 2–0 to Kilmarnock on the last day of the season to lose the league title to them on goal average. Subsequently Hearts were instrumental in pushing through a change to use goal difference to separate teams level on points, which ironically was to disadvantage the club in 1985–86.

=== Latter 20th century ===
From the mid-1960s, Hearts went into decline. The players of greatest note in the 1970s were [[Jim Cruickshank]], [[Donald Ford]] and [[Drew Busby]], not to forget the loyal servant [[Alan Anderson (footballer)|Alan Anderson]]. After the advent of the ten team Premier Division in 1975, Hearts were subsequently relegated for the first time in [[1976–77 in Scottish football|1977]]. Promotion followed in [[1977–78 in Scottish football|1978]], but several seasons were spent [[yo-yo club|yo-yoing]] back and forth from the Premier League to the First Division. The major problem for Hearts at this time was an antiquated company structure which was a massive disincentive to anyone to invest in the club. The board of directors finally resigned after Hearts failed to regain their Premier Division status.

The arrival of chairman [[Wallace Mercer]] led to a revival in the club's fortunes. The club came within 7 minutes of winning the league in 1986, needing a draw from the last game of the season away to [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]]. Two late goals by [[Albert Kidd]] combined with Celtic winning heavily against St Mirren meant Hearts losing out on goal difference. Hearts finished runners-up again in 1988 and 1992.

In the early 1990s, the club struggled to settle on a manager. Within a two-year period, [[Joe Jordan (footballer)|Joe Jordan]], [[Sandy Clark]] and [[Tommy McLean]] were all sacked. One of the few bright points in this period was the run of 22 games in a row without defeat against arch-rivals [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], including the 2–1 triumph in the fourth round of the 1994 [[Tennents Scottish Cup]] at Easter Road, with [[Wayne Foster]] grabbing the late winner.

In [[1997–98 in Scottish football|1998]], Hearts beat Rangers 2–1 to lift the Scottish Cup under the management of Jim Jefferies, with a first-minute penalty from Colin Cameron and a second-half strike by Stephane Adam.

=== Into the 21st century ===
In recent seasons, Hearts have usually been competing for third place in the Scottish Premier League. They finished third in 2003 and 2004, and reached the inaugural group stages of the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2004–05, but finished bottom of their group, despite [[Robbie Neilson]]'s goal giving a 2–1 victory over [[FC Basel]]. During the 2004–05 season, they finished fifth in the league.

In 2004, then club CEO Chris Robinson announced plans to sell Tynecastle, which he claimed was "not fit for purpose", and instead have Hearts rent [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] from the [[Scottish Rugby Union]].<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=1455932004 Tynecastle architect says £100,000 to fix stadium], ''[[The Scotsman]]''. {{wayback|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=1455932004 |date=20051110132123 |df=y }}</ref> This move was deemed necessary due to the club's increasingly large debt. The plan was very unpopular with supporters, and a campaign, entitled ''Save Our Hearts'', was set up to try to block the move.<ref>[http://quicksitebuilder.cnet.com/bonnjoy/thefederationofheartssupportersclubs/id11.html Save our Hearts]</ref> As Robinson and his supporters had a slight majority of the club's shares, a preliminary deal to sell the stadium was struck with the Cala property development company for just over £20&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=1073472004 Tynecastle sale to go through, but at what price?], ''The Scotsman''.</ref>

=== Romanov years ===
{{Main|Vladimir Romanov's ownership of Heart of Midlothian F.C.}}

In early June 2013, during the close season, a Hearts media statement stated that they would need to raise £500,000 in capital to keep the club up and running during the break between seasons. With no match day income coming in and a lack of finance from owner Romanov, the club have been left in a position where they have had to put their whole squad up for sale.

On 17 June 2013, Heart of Midlothian began the process of entering into [[administration (law)|administration]] with debts of £25&nbsp;million, owing recently bankrupt [[Ukio bankas]] £15&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22944291 Hearts: SPL side to enter administration], BBC Sport, 17 June 2013</ref>

On 18 June 2013, a Scandinavian consortium offered to pay the club £500,000 immediately in return for a share of any future transfer income from up to 12 players but was rejected by Hearts. The process of entering administration began on 19 June 2013 when the club's parent company, Ukio Bankas Investment Group (UBIG), filed papers at the Court of Session on Edinburgh for accountancy firm [[BDO International|BDO]] to be named as administrators.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22963110 Hearts rejected investment offer before administration application], BBC Sport, 18 June 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22953448 Hearts placed into administration and deducted 15 points], BBC Sport, 19 June 2013</ref>

=== Administration ===
On 17 June 2013 Hearts announced that they had lodged court papers stating their intention to enter administration, and on 19 June 2013 the administrators BDO were appointed to run the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/bdo-appointed-to-run-hearts-in-administration.1371649500|title=BDO appointed to run Hearts in administration|work=Herald Scotland}}</ref> This meant that the club was unable to register players over 21 until February 2014 at the earliest. As long as they were still in administration they would not be able to bring in players of any age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23536242|title=Hearts: Registration ban to run until February 2014|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>

As well as the signing embargo, Hearts were to be deducted a third of the previous season's points tally which meant the club would start the 2013/2014 season with −15 points. During this period the BDO administrator Trevor Birch pleaded with Hearts fans to purchase season tickets and stated that they needed to sell at least another 3000 season tickets to raise another £800,000 to keep the club running and avoiding liquidation. The fans met this number and took total season ticket sales beyond the 10,000 mark, giving the club more survival time.<ref>[http://www.heartsfc.co.uk/articles/20130712/season-ticket-update_2241384_3232942 Season ticket update – Hearts<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{wayback|url=http://www.heartsfc.co.uk/articles/20130712/season-ticket-update_2241384_3232942 |date=20130826171529 |df=y }}</ref>
