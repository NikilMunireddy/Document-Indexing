==History==
[[Image:Houston Chronicle frontpage.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Front page of the first edition of the ''Houston Chronicle'', 14 October 1901.]]

From its inception, the practices and policies of the ''Houston Chronicle'' were shaped by strong-willed personalities who were the publishers. The history of the newspaper can be best understood when divided into the eras of these individuals.

===1901–1926: Marcellus E. Foster Era===
The ''Houston Chronicle'' was founded in 1901 by a former reporter for the now-defunct ''[[Houston Post]]'', [[Marcellus E. Foster]].  Foster, who had been covering the [[Spindletop]] oil boom for the ''Post'', invested in Spindletop and took $30 of the return on that investment — at the time equivalent to a week's wages — and used it to fund the ''Chronicle''.

The ''Chronicle's'' first edition was published on October 14, 1901 and sold for two cents per copy, at a time when most papers sold for five cents each. At the end of its first month in operation, the ''Chronicle'' had a circulation of 4,378 — roughly one tenth of the population of Houston at the time.<ref name="tsha">[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eeh02 The Handbook of Texas Online.] ''Houston Chronicle''. Retrieved December 2, 2009.</ref> Within the first year of operation, the paper purchased and consolidated the ''Daily Herald''.

In 1908, Foster asked Jesse H. Jones, a local businessman and prominent builder, to construct a new office and plant for the paper, "and offered [a] half-interest in the newspaper as a down payment, with twenty years to pay the remainder.  Jones agreed, and the resulting Chronicle Building was one of the finest in the South."<ref name="tsha"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Jesse H. Jones, the Man and the Statesman| first=Bascom Nolly |last=Timmons |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=London |year=1956 |isbn=978-0-8371-7925-4 |id=ISBN 0-8371-7925-4 |page=77}}</ref>

Under Foster, the paper's circulation grew from about 7,000 in 1901 to 75,000 on weekdays and 85,000 on Sundays by 1926. Foster continued to write columns under the pen name Mefo, and drew much attention in the 1920s for his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He sold the rest of his interest to [[Jesse H. Jones]] on June 26, 1926 and promptly retired.<ref>Handbook of Texas Online. "[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffo52 Foster, Marcellus Elliot (1870–1942)"].

Gonzalez article, but the [http://blog.chron.com/bayoucityhistory/files/legacy/img246.jpg picture in the Gonzales article] depicts the same building that is seen in the illustration.</ref>]]

In 1911, City Editor [[George Kepple]] started Goodfellows.<ref>[http://www.houstonchronicle.com/goodfellows/ Houstonchronicle.com]</ref>  On a [[Christmas Eve]] in 1911, Kepple passed a hat among the ''Chronicle's'' reporters to collect money to buy toys for a shoe-shine boy.

Goodfellows continues today through donations made by the newspaper and its readers. It has grown into a city-wide program that provides needy children between the ages of 2 and 10 with toys during the [[Christmas and holiday season|winter holidays]].  In 2003, Goodfellows distributed almost 250,000 toys to more than 100,000 needy children in the [[Greater Houston]] area.

===1926–1956: Jesse H. Jones Era===
In 1926, [[Jesse H. Jones]] became the sole owner of the paper.  He had approached Foster about selling, and Foster had answered, "What will you give me?"  Jones described the buyout of Foster as follows (citation in Wikipedia format needed p.&nbsp;121 – 122 of ''Jesse H. Jones: The Man and the Statesman'' by [[Bascom N. Timmons]], copyright 1956 Henry Holt and Company):

"Wanting to be liberal with Foster if I bought him out, since he had created the paper and originally owned most of the stock, and had made a success of it, I thought for a while before answering and finally asked him how much he owed.  He replied, 'On real estate and everything about 200,000 dollars.'  I then said to him that I would give him 300,000 dollars in cash, having in mind that this would pay his debts and give him 100,000 spending money.  In addition, I would given him a note for 500,000 secured by a mortgage on the Chronicle Building, the note to be payable (interest and principal) at the rate of 35,000 a year for thirty-five years, which I figured was about his expectancy.  I would also pay him 20,000 dollars a year as editor of the paper and 6,000 dollars a year to continue writing the daily front-page column, 'MEFO,' on the condition that either of us could cancel the editorship and/or the MEFO-column contracts on six months notice, and that, if I canceled both the column and the editorship, I would give him an additional 6,000 dollars a year for life.  I considered the offer substantially more than the ''Chronicle'' was worth at the time.  No sooner had I finished stating my proposition than he said, 'I will take it,' and the transaction was completed accordingly."

In 1937, Jesse H. Jones transferred ownership of the paper to the newly established [[Houston Endowment Inc.]] Jones retained the title of publisher until his death in 1956.

According to [[The Handbook of Texas]] Online, the ''Chronicle'' generally represented very conservative political views during the 1950s:
::"...the ''Chronicle'' generally represented the very conservative political interests of the Houston business establishment. As such, it eschewed controversial political topics, such as integration or the impacts of rapid economic growth on life in the city. It did not perform investigative journalism. This resulted in a stodgy newspaper that failed to capture the interests of newcomers to the city. By 1959, circulation of the rival ''Houston Post'' had pulled ahead of the ''Chronicle''."<ref name="tsha"/>

Jones, a lifelong Democrat who organized the Democratic National Convention to be in Houston in 1928, and who spent long years in public service first under the Wilson administration, helping to found the Red Cross during World War I, and later famously under the Roosevelt administration, described the paper's mission in these terms:

::"I regard the publication of a newspaper as a distinct public trust, and one not to be treated lightly or abused for selfish purposes or to gratify selfish whims.  A great daily newspaper can remain a power for good only so long as it is uninfluenced by unworthy motives, and unbought by the desire for gain.  A newspaper which can be neither bought nor bullied is the greatest asset of a city or state.  Naturally, a newspaper makes mistakes in judgment, as it does in type; but, so long as errors are honestly made, they are not serious when general results are considered.

::The success or failure of a particular issue is of little consequence compared with the all-important principle of a fearless and honest newspaper.  This I intend the ''Chronicle'' shall always be, a newspaper for all the people, democratic in fact and in principle, standing for the greatest good to the greatest number, championing and defending what it believes to be right, and condemning and opposing what it believes to be wrong.

::Such have always been the policies of the ''Chronicle'' and to such it is now rededicated."<ref>Jesse H. Jones: "The Man and the Statesman", page 122 – 123</ref>

Under Jones' watch, the ''Chronicle'' bought [[KTRH]], one of Houston's oldest radio stations, in 1937.  In 1954, Jones led a syndicate that signed on Houston's third television station, [[KTRK-TV]].

===1956–1965: John T. Jones Era===
The board of Houston Endowment named John T. Jones, nephew of Jesse H. Jones, as editor of the ''Chronicle''. Houston Endowment president, J. Howard Creekmore, was named publisher.
In 1961, John T. Jones hired [[William P. Steven]] as editor. Steven had previously been editor of the ''[[Tulsa Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'', and credited with turning around the declining readership of both papers. One of his innovations was the creation of a regular help column called "Watchem," where ordinary citizens could voice their complaints. The ''Chicago Tribune'' later called this column a pioneer and prototype of the modern newspaper "Action Line."<ref name = "ChiTrib">Heise, Kenan. "W.P. Steven, Ex-newspaper Executive." ''Chicago Tribune''. August 11, 1991. Retrieved October 5, 2011.[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-08-11/news/9103270877_1_william-p-steven-houston-chronicle-city-editor]</ref>

Stevens' progressive political philosophy soon created conflict with the very conservative views of the Houston Endowment board, especially when he editorially supported the election of Lyndon B. Johnson, the Democratic candidate for president.
In 1964, the ''Chronicle'' purchased the assets of its evening newspaper competitor, the ''Houston Press'',<ref name="tsha"/> becoming the only evening newspaper in the city. By then, the ''Chronicle'' had a circulation of 254,000 – the largest of any paper in Texas. The ''Atlantic Monthly'' credited the growth to the changes instigated by Steven.<ref name = "Atlantic">Bagdikian, Ben H. [http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1969/12/houston-apos-s-shackled-press/6926/ theatlantic.com "Houston's Shackled Press"]. ''Atlantic Monthly''. August 1966. Retrieved March 25, 2010.</ref>

In the summer of 1965, Jones decided to buy a local television station that was already owned by the Houston Endowment. He resigned from the Houston Endowment board to avoid a conflict of interest, though he remained as publisher of the ''Chronicle''. On September 2, 1965, Jones made a late-night visit to the Steven home, where he broke the news that the Endowment board had ordered him to dismiss Steven. Jones had to comply. On September 3, the paper published a story announcing that Everett Collier was now the new editor.<ref name = "Atlantic" />

No mention was made of Steven or the Houston Endowment board.  ''Houston Post'' staff wrote an article about the change, but top management killed it. Only two weekly papers in Houston: ''Forward Times'' (which targeted the African-American community) and the ''Houston Tribune'' (an ultra conservative paper). Both papers had rather small circulations and no influence among the city's business community.<ref name = "Atlantic" /> The two major newspapers in Houston never mentioned Steven for many years thereafter.

===1965–1987: J. Howard Creekmore Era===
In 1965, both John T. Jones and William P. Steven left the ''Chronicle''. J. Howard Creekmore, president of the Houston Endowment, took John Jones' place at the ''Chronicle''. Everett D. Collier replaced Steven as editor. Collier remained in this position until his retirement in 1979.

J. Howard Creekmore was born in Abilene, Texas in 1905. His parents died while he was young, so he was raised by his stepmother. The family moved to Houston in 1920. Howard enrolled in Rice Institute, where he graduated with degrees in history and English. After graduation, he went to work for Jesse Jones as a bookkeeper. Jones took an interest in the young man’s career, and put him through law school. Creekmore passed the bar exam in 1932 and returned to work for Jones. He held several positions in the Jones business empire. In 1959, he was named to the board of Houston Endowment, and was promoted to president of the board in 1964.<ref>

By 1965, Creekmore had persuaded other directors of Houston Endowment to sell several business properties, including the ''Chronicle''. Houston oilman John Mecom offered $85 million for the newspaper, its building, a 30% interest in Texas National Bank of Commerce and the historic Rice Hotel. Early in 1966, Mecom encountered problems raising the additional cash to complete the transaction. He then began lining up potential buyers for the newspaper, which included non-Houstonians such as Sam Newhouse, Otis Chandler and the Scripps-Howard organization. Creekmore strongly believed that local persons should own the paper. He insisted that Mecom pay the $84 million debt immediately in cash. Mecom cancelled his purchase agreement.<ref>''Time''. “Newspapers: A Deal Done In” June 17, 1966. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899233,00.html time.com] Retrieved May 10, 2010.</ref>

In 1968, the ''Chronicle'' set a Texas newspaper circulation record.
In 1981, the business pages — which up until then had been combined with sports — became its own section of the newspaper. Creekmore remained as publisher until Houston Endowment sold the paper to the Hearst Corporation.

===1987–present: Hearst Corporation Era===
On May 1, 1987, the [[Hearst Corporation]] purchased the ''Houston Chronicle'' from Houston Endowment for $415 Million.<ref>Houston Chronicle Archives, "Houston Chronicle purchase completed by Hearst Corp." May 1, 1987.</ref>

Richard J. V. Johnson, who had joined the paper as a copy editor in 1956, and worked up to executive vice president in 1972, and president in 1973, remained as chairman and publisher until he retired April 1, 2002.<ref>[http://www.aaf-houston.org/en/art/21/ "Richard J.V. Johnson: September 22, 1930 – January 14, 2006"]. American Advertising Federation Houston. January 19, 2006. Retrieved December 2, 2009.</ref> He was succeeded by Jack Sweeney.

In 1994, the ''Chronicle'' switched to being a morning-only paper. With the demise of the ''Houston Post'' the following year, the ''Chronicle'' became Houston's sole major daily newspaper.

On October 18, 2008, the paper endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]] for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States Presidential Election, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential Election]], the first Democrat to be endorsed by the newspaper since 1964, when it endorsed Texan [[Lyndon B.

===Robert Jensen series on the September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S.===
In the weeks following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] the ''Houston Chronicle'' published a series of opinion articles by [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] journalism professor [[Robert Jensen]] that asserted the United States was "just as guilty" as the hijackers in committing acts of violence and compared that attack with the history of U.S. attacks on civilians in other countries. The opinion piece resulted in hundreds of angry letters to the editor and reportedly over 4,000 angry responses to Jensen.<ref>Jensen, Robert. "[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/editorial/outlook/1215826 Four months later, no regrets for writing against U.S. policy]." ''Houston Chronicle''. January 20, 2002. Retrieved January 8, 2012.</ref>

Among them were claims of insensitivity against the newspaper and of giving an unduly large audience to a position characterized as being extremist. University of Texas president [[Larry Faulkner]] issued a response denouncing Jenson's as "a fountain of undiluted foolishness on issues of public policy", noting "[h]e is not speaking in the University's name and may not speak in its name."<ref>[http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/RHE306fall01/RhetAnaly/analyzethis.htm CWRL.texas.edu]</ref>

The ''Chronicle'' printed four subsequent opinion articles by Jensen, asserting his case. Jensen is also a regular guest writer on the opinion page and has published several dozen opinion articles on other subjects in the ''Chronicle''.

==Other publications==
In April 2004 the ''Houston Chronicle'' started a Spanish-language supplement, the entertainment magazine ''La Vibra''. ''La Vibra'' caters to speakers of Spanish and bilingual English-Spanish speakers, and is mainly distributed in Hispanic neighborhoods. In December 2004 the ''Chronicle'' acquired the Spanish-language newspaper ''[[La Voz de Houston]]''.<ref name="MorenoLaVoz"/>

==Criticism==

===Light rail controversy===
In late 2002, ''Chronicle'' website managers accidentally posted an internal memorandum on its web site. The memorandum outlined a draft agenda of coordinated news articles, editorials, and op-eds seemingly intended to promote a referendum to expand Houston's controversial [[METRORail]] system on the 2003 ballot. It proposed several "investigative" news stories and editorials designed to examine "the campaign led by [[Tom DeLay]] and [[Bob Lanier (politician)|Bob Lanier]] to defeat rail expansion." DeLay, a Houston congressman, and Lanier, a former mayor of Houston, had both actively opposed light rail in the past.

The document was online for only an hour, but long enough to be viewed by some readers. Soon after the ''Houston Review'', a conservative newspaper published by students at the [[University of Houston]], printed the memo's full text and an accompanying commentary that criticized the paper.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20021204203757/www.houstonreview.com/1102/chroniclememo.htm Web.archive.org]</ref><ref>Connelly, Richard. "[http://www.houstonpress.com/2003-09-11/news/trainspotting/ Trainspotting]." ''[[Houston Press]]''. September 11, 2003. Retrieved October 20, 2011.</ref> The ''Chronicle's'' response was initially muted. Its first official response appeared in the "corrections" section later the same week stating: "An internal ''Houston Chronicle'' document was mistakenly posted to the editorial/opinion area of the Web site early Thursday morning. We apologize for any confusion it may have caused." ''Chronicle'' editor Jeff Cohen, who gave a statement in defense of the memorandum: "I make no apologies for having a thorough discussion of the issue. We have nothing to apologize for…There was an inadvertent posting of it to the Web site, and I'm sorry about that, but I make no apologies for the contents of it."

As the bond referendum approached, the ''Houston Chronicle'' requested that [[Texans for True Mobility]] (TTM), the main critic of METRORail, provide the paper with a copy of their financial contributor reports. TTM declined, saying they did not believe the ''Chronicle'' would adequately protect the privacy of their donors. The ''Chronicle'' responded by making a complaint to the Harris County District Attorney's office asking that Texans for True Mobility be investigated for potential violations of Texas election law. The ''Chronicle'' alleged that TTM broke a law requiring [[political action committee|PAC]]s to disclose their donors. TTM said that their status as a registered [[non-profit]] [[501(c)(6)]] organization, as opposed to a PAC, did not require them to do so. The ''Chronicle'' argued that the law covered TTM because it made "paid political moves." Texas campaign law allows nonprofits to run "educational" advertisements, but those advertisements cannot endorse specific political positions or people or make a specific recommendation in a pending election. The dispute was over whether TTM's advertisements, and specifically the slogans "Metro's Rail Plan Costs Too Much ... Does Too Little" and "Metro's Plan Won't Work Here,"  were specific recommendations on how to vote.<!-- Political Action Committees Helped Fund Houston-Area Anti-Rail Effort, Knight Ridder, March 24, 2004; Chronicle seeking list of anti-rail contributors, ''Houston Chronicle'', October 11, 2003 -->

Harris County District Attorney Rosenthal later dismissed the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s complaint, finding it without merit on the grounds that the statute did not apply. Rosenthal's involvement in the probe itself came under fire by the ''[[Houston Press]]'', which in editorials questioned whether Rosenthal was too close to TTM: from 2000 to 2004, Rosenthal accepted some $30,000 in donations from known TTM supporters.<ref>Ties That Bind? The D.A. shares something with those he's supposed to be probing: campaign support, Houston Press, January 15, 2004</ref> Later that year, TTM revealed that that their television and radio ads were funded by $30,000 in contributions made the day before the election by two PACs controlled by DeLay.

===Sandoval family interview===
In early 2004, ''Chronicle'' reporter Lucas Wall interviewed the family of Leroy Sandoval, a Marine from Houston who was killed in Iraq. After the article appeared, Sandoval's stepfather and sister called into Houston talk radio station [[KSEV]] and said that a sentence alleging "President Bush's failure to find weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq misrepresented their views on the war and President [[George W. Bush]], that Wall had pressured them for a quotation that criticized Bush, and that the line alleging Bush's "failure" was included against the wishes of the family.<ref>[http://www.publiustx.net/index.php?itemid=1092 Publiustx.net]</ref>

A dispute ensued between KSEV radio show host/owner [[Dan Patrick (Texas politician)|Dan Patrick]] and an assistant managing editor at the ''Chronicle''. The incident prompted Patrick to join the call for a boycott of the paper.<ref name="Abclocal.go.com">Abrahams, Tom. "[http://web.archive.org/web/20050313080722/http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/news/040904_local_boycott.html Radio talk show host launches boycott against local newspaper]." ''[[KTRK-TV]]''. April 4, 2004. Retrieved October 20, 2011.</ref> The story was also picked up by the local Houston television stations and, a week later, the [[O'Reilly Factor]]. Eventually, ''Chronicle'' publisher Jack Sweeney contacted the Sandoval family to apologize.<ref name="Abclocal.go.com"/>

===Purchase of ''Houston Post'' assets===
On 18 April 1995, the ''[[Houston Post]]'' ceased operations, leaving the ''Chronicle'' as Houston's only major daily newspaper, and the Hearst Corporation purchased some of the ''Post's'' assets. ''Houston Chronicle'' announced it in a way that suggested the shutdown and Hearst's purchase of the ''Post's'' assets were simultaneous events. "''Post'' closes; Hearst buys assets," the ''Chronicle'' headline read the day after the ''Post'' was shut.

Internal memos obtained from by FOIA from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] [[antitrust]] attorneys who investigated the closing of the ''Houston Post'' said the ''Chronicle's'' parent organization struck a deal to buy the ''Post'' six months before it closed. The memos, first obtained by the alternative paper the ''Houston Press'', say the ''Chronicle's'' conglomerate and the ''Post'' "reached an agreement in October, 1994, for the sale of Houston Post Co.'s assets for approximately $120 million."<ref>[http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/print.php?story=04/05/31/6064236 Reclaimthemedia.org]</ref>

===Tom DeLay poll===
In January 2006 the ''Chronicle'' hired Richard Murray of the [[University of Houston]] to conduct an election survey in the district of U.S. Rep. [[Tom DeLay]], in light of his 2005 indictment by District Attorney [[Ronnie Earle]] for alleged campaign money violations. The ''Chronicle'' said that its poll showed "severely eroded support for U.S. Rep Tom DeLay in his district, most notably among Republicans who have voted for him before."<ref>Mack, Kristen. "[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/3587652.html Troubles erode support for DeLay in 22nd District]." ''Houston Chronicle''. January 14, 2006. Retrieved October 20, 2011.</ref>

Former Texas Secretary of State [[Jack Rains]] contacted the ''Chronicle's'' James Howard Gibbons, alleging that the poll appeared to incorrectly count non-Republican Primary voters in its sample. Rains also asserted that Murray had a conflict of interest in the poll, as Murray's son Keir was a political consultant working for [[Nick Lampson]], DeLay's Democratic challenger in 2006.<ref>[http://lonestartimes.com/2006/01/19/hendee-emails-murray-re-chron-delay-poll/ Lonestartimes.com]</ref> In response, Gibbons denied the methodological flaws in the poll.

==Availability of ''Houston Post'' articles==
Some ''[[Houston Post]]'' articles had been made available in the archives of the ''Houston Chronicle'' website, but by 2005 they were removed. The ''Houston Chronicle'' online editor Mike Read said that the ''Houston Chronicle'' decided to remove ''Houston Post'' articles from the website after the 2001 [[United States Supreme Court]] ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'' decision; the newspaper originally planned to filter articles not allowed by the decision and to post articles that were not prohibited by the decision. The ''Houston Chronicle'' decided not to post or re-post any more ''Houston Post'' articles because of difficulties in complying with the ''New York Times Co. v. Tasini'' decision with the resources that were available to the newspaper.<ref name="blogs.chron.com">Newkirk, Jim.
