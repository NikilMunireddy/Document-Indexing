The '''Houston Texans''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. The team competes in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC South|South]] division. The Texans first played in 2002 as an [[expansion team]] after Houston's previous franchise, the [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]], moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they are now the [[Tennessee Titans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hworth.net/nfl_history/hou.html |title=Houston Texans History |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080330205340/http://www.hworth.net/nfl_history/hou.html |archivedate=March 30, 2008 }}</ref> The team's majority owner is [[Bob McNair]].

==Franchise history==
{{main|History of the Houston Texans}}
<!-- There should be at least a paragraph or two while maintaining the link to the history article. That will whet people's appetite to read the fuller, separate article. -->

In 1997, Houston entrepreneur [[Bob McNair]] had a failed bid to bring a [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) expansion team to the city, and [[Bud Adams]] relocated the city's NFL team, the Houston Oilers, to [[Nashville]] where they were renamed the [[Tennessee Titans]]. In 1996, a year earlier, the [[Cleveland Browns]] had [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|controversially relocated]] to become the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. As part of the settlement between the NFL, the city of [[Cleveland]] and the team owned by [[Art Modell]], the league promised to return football to Cleveland within the following three years.

In order to even out the franchisees at 32, the league also contemplated adding another expansion franchise. As Houston was one of the favorites for the extra franchise along with [[Toronto]] and [[Los Angeles]] (which had lost the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]] and the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] in 1995), McNair then decided to join the football project and founded Houston NFL Holdings with partner [[Steve Patterson (sports executive)|Steve Patterson]]. In association with [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]], they would push for a domed stadium as part of the bid to lure the NFL back to Houston. On October 6, 1999 the NFL awarded the 32nd team to Houston, at the cost of $700 million.<ref name="TexansTeamHistory" />

The Houston Texans joined the league at the [[2002 NFL season]], playing at the newly founded [[NRG Stadium|Reliant Stadium]]. While the team struggled in early seasons, results began to improve once native Houstonian [[Gary Kubiak]] became the head coach in 2006. The Texans finished with a .500 season (8-8) in both 2007 and 2008, and nearly qualified for the [[2009–10 NFL playoffs]] with a 9–7 result in 2009. In 2010, the team started the season on a 4–2 record going into a Week 7 bye week, but promptly collapsed 2–8 in the second part of the season, finishing 6–10. The following season, former [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] head coach [[Wade Phillips]] was hired as the defensive coordinator of the Texans, and the improved defense led to the Texans finishing 10–6, winning their first [[AFC South]] title.<ref name=globe>[http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2012/12/10/for-houston-texans-big-games-have-become-routine-after-years-mediocrity-worse/SefzCa2Wcfml2SdtUXgyjK/story.html Texans have climbed to the top of NFL], ''[[The Boston Globe]]''</ref> The Texans then beat wild card [[Cincinnati Bengals]] 31–10 in the first round of the [[2011-12 NFL playoffs]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCATRE80700P20120108|title=Foster powers Texans to win over Bengals|work=[[Reuters]] Canada|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|date=January 7, 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> before a 20–13 defeat by the Ravens in the semifinals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.masnsports.com/dan_kolko/2012/01/ravens-slip-past-texans-20-13-advance-to-afc-championship.html|title=Ravens slip past Texans 20–13, advance to AFC Championship|first=Dan|last=Kolko|date=January 15, 2012|accessdate=January 15, 2012|work=MASN Sports|publisher=[[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network]]}}</ref>

The Texans surged as the team to beat in the AFC South in {{nfly|2012}}, holding an 11–1 record by week 14. However, they lost three of their last four games to finish 12–4; beating the rival [[Indianapolis Colts]] in that four-game stretch allowed them to clinch their 2nd AFC South title. The Texans beat the Bengals again in the wild-card round, but they lost in the second round to the [[New England Patriots]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55832/NE_Gamebook.pdf | title=NFL Gamebook: HOU @ NE | publisher=NFL | date=2013-01-13 | accessdate=2013-01-13}}</ref> The Texans started 2–0 in 2013 but went into a tailspin and lost every game afterwards. Head Coach Kubiak was fired after being swept by the rival [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], who themselves started 0–8. Wade Phillips filled in as head coach, but the Texans' poor form did not change, and they finished 2–14, tying, with 2005, their worst record in franchise history. The 14-game losing streak is also the worst in franchise history.

The Texans entered the [[2014 Houston Texans season|2014 season]] with a 14-game losing streak. Former Penn State head coach [[Bill O'Brien (American football)|Bill O'Brien]] became the Texans' new head coach, and the third in franchise history, during the offseason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimatetexans/2014/01/bill-obrien-officially-introduced-as-texans-new-coach/|title=Bill O’Brien officially introduced as Texans new coach|work=Ultimate Texans}}</ref> In 2014, the Texans won three of their first four games, defeating the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in the season opener, the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]], and the [[Buffalo Bills|Bills]], losing to the [[New York Giants]]. They lost three of their next four games, losing to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], the [[Indianapolis Colts]], and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], respectively. The Texans went on to finish 9–7 in the 2014 season and barely missed the playoffs.

In the 2015 season, the Texans started with a 2–5 record. <ref>{{Cite web|title = 2015 Season Schedule|url = http://www.houstontexans.com/team/season-schedule.html|website = www.houstontexans.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}</ref> Quarterback [[Ryan Mallett]] was released amidst controversy regarding his benching in favor of [[Brian Hoyer]] during a loss against the [[Indianapolis Colts]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ryan Mallett Released by Texans|url = http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2583229-ryan-mallett-released-by-texans-latest-details-comments-and-reaction?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=editorial|website = Bleacher Report|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}</ref> Former Texans quarterback [[T.

However, they were shut out by the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in the Wild Card round 30-0, ending their championship hopes for the year.

On March 9, 2016, the Texans signed Brock Osweiler to a 4-year, $72 Million dollar deal.

==Team identity==

===Nickname===
On March 2, 2000, Houston NFL 2002 announced that the team name search had been narrowed down to five choices: Bobcats, Stallions, Texans, Toros, and Apollos. The list of names was determined after several months of research conducted jointly by Houston NFL 2002 and NFL Properties. An online survey regarding the name generated more than 65,000 responses in just seven days.

On September 6, 2000, the NFL's 32nd franchise was officially christened the Houston Texans before thousands at a downtown rally on Texas Avenue. McNair explained that the name evoked "someone who's powerful, independent, courageous and hard-working".<ref name=name>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LOCAL/southwest/09/07/hci.texans/|work=The Houston Chronicle|title=It's official: Houston Texans|author=McClain, John|date=September 7, 2000}}</ref> The name had previously been the name of a defunct [[World Football League]] franchise, which moved to Louisiana to become the [[Shreveport Steamer]], and the nickname Texans was also used by the precursor of the present-day [[Kansas City Chiefs]], the [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]] of the [[American Football League|AFL]]. The nickname "Texans" was more recently used by the now-defunct [[Canadian Football League]] franchise in San Antonio. Owner Bob McNair did have to make a deal with Chiefs' owner [[Lamar Hunt]] to use the Texans nickname for his new team.<ref name=globe/>

===Logos and uniforms===
[[File:Texans Uniforms.jpg|thumb|324px|Houston Texans Nike Uniforms, 2015]]

Along with the team name, McNair also unveiled the team logo, an abstract depiction of a bull's head, split in such a way to resemble the [[flag of Texas]] and the state of Texas, including a lone star to stand for the eye, the five points of which representing pride, courage, strength, tradition and independence. McNair described the colors as "Deep Steel Blue", "Battle Red" and "Liberty White".<ref name=name/> A year later the Texans unveiled their uniforms during another downtown rally.

The Texans' helmet is dark blue with the Texans bull logo. The helmet was initially white when the team name and logo were unveiled, but was later changed to dark blue. The uniform design consists of red trim and either dark blue or white jerseys. The team typically wears white pants with its blue jerseys and blue pants with its white jerseys. Starting with the 2006 season, the Texans wear all-white for their home opener, and the team began to wear an all-blue combination for home games vs. the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. In 2003, the Texans introduced an alternative red jersey with blue trim; they wear this jersey at one home game each year, usually against a division rival. In 2007 the Texans introduced red pants for the first time, pairing them with the red jerseys for an all-red look (this uniform combination was not well-received and has since been retired). In October 2008 the Texans paired blue socks (instead of the traditional red) with their blue pants and white jerseys.

In 2002 the team wore a patch commemorating their inaugural season. Also, they celebrated 10 years as a franchise by wearing an anniversary patch throughout 2012.

===Mascots and cheerleaders===
The team's official mascot is [[Toro (mascot)|Toro]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstontexans.com/kids/toro.asp|title=Official Site of the Houston Texans|publisher=}}</ref> The team also has a [[NFL Cheerleading|cheerleading squad]] simply named the [[Houston Texans Cheerleaders]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstontexans.com/cheerleaders/index.html |title=Texans Cheerleaders |publisher=HoustonTexans.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref>

==Rivalries==
The Texans are the youngest franchise in the NFL, having only been competing in the League since 2002. For most of that time, they were considered perennial bottom-dwellers in the AFC South. For that reason, they have not had the history or the reputation on which to build classic rivalries like the ones that often exist between older franchises.

However, there are a few franchises for whom Texans fans hold special animosity. The [[Tennessee Titans]], formerly the Houston Oilers before their relocation in the 1990s, are viewed by many Houston fans as the Texans' chief rival. The [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], and the [[Indianapolis Colts]], whom the Texans had never defeated in Indianapolis (compiling an all-time record of 0–13 there until a win in Week 15 of the 2015 season), are Texans rivals in the AFC South. The Texans also have an intrastate rivalry with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], with whom they contest the so-called [[Governor's Cup (Texas)|Governor's Cup]] every year (either in the preseason or the regular season) for bragging rights in the state of Texas.

More recently, Houston has increased bitterness with the Indianapolis Colts due to longtime star Texans receiver [[Andre Johnson]] leaving for the Colts after the 2014 season. The Texans have also developed a somewhat close rivalry with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], starting in 2011 and 2012, when young Bengals quarterback and Houston-area native [[Andy Dalton]] led the Bengals to the playoffs only to be stopped short by the Texans two years in a row. (In 2011, the Texans had clinched their playoff spot, the first ever for the franchise, with a regular-season victory in Cincinnati.) The two teams have competitive bitter matchups in the regular season too, including the 3-5 Texans' upset road victory over the until-then undefeated Bengals on Monday Night Football on November 16, 2015.

==Statistics==
{{Main|Houston Texans records}}

===Win-loss record===
As of the end of the 2015 season, the Texans' overall regular season win-loss record is 97–127 (.427).  They are 2–3 (.400) all-time in playoff games. The Texans posted their best-ever season record in 2012, finishing at 12–4.  The team's worst-ever seasons on record are 2–14, in both 2005 and 2013. Most recently, the Texans finished 9–7 in 2015, winning the AFC South for the third time in franchise history. 

All three of the Texans' playoff berths were as a result of winning the AFC South division championship. The Texans participated in the playoffs for the first time at the end of the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]], after having clinched the AFC South division title and qualifying as the AFC's third seed. In the Wild Card round, the Texans hosted a playoff game for the first time, defeating the [[2011 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] 31–10. However, the following weekend the Texans were defeated 20–13 by the [[2011 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] on the road in the Divisional round. In 2012, the Texans won the AFC South division championship and were seeded third once again. They again defeated the [[2012 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] at home in the Wild-Card round; this time by a score of 19–13. However, the following weekend the Texans were defeated 41–28 by the [[2012 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] on the road in the Divisional round. The Texans would return to the playoffs in 2015, but their stay would be short lived as the team was overwhelmed by the [[2015 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 30-0.

===Notable records vs opponents===
As members of the AFC South, the Texans play 6 of their 16 regular season games against other AFC South teams. As of the end of the 2015 season, the Texans have a cumulative record of 35–49 (.417) against their three divisional rivals: 17–11 versus the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]; 13–15 versus the [[Tennessee Titans]]; and 5–23 versus the [[Indianapolis Colts]] (including losses in all but one of 14 games played there). The Texans have fared better against the rest of the AFC, posting a regular season record of 37–41 (.474) against AFC teams from divisions other than the South, with a 13–12 record against AFC East teams, 12–16 against AFC North teams, and 12–13 against AFC West teams. The Texans are 21–31 (.404) against NFC teams, tallying a 4–12 record against NFC East teams, 6–6 against NFC North teams, 7–5 against NFC South teams, and 4–8 against NFC West teams.<ref>{{cite web|title=Houston Texans Records by Opponent|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/houston-texans/opponents|website=The Football Database|publisher=Patrick Gilligan|accessdate=2014-12-22}}</ref>

As of the end of the 2015 season, there is one team against which the Texans have never lost: the [[Chicago Bears]] (3–0). There are also two teams which the Texans have never beaten: the [[Minnesota Vikings]] (0–3) and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] (0–4). According to the [[NFL scheduling formula|NFL's scheduling formula]], the Texans' next regular-season games versus the Bears and Vikings will be in 2016, and the Eagles in 2018.

==Traditions==
* '''[[Battle Red Day]]''' – On Battle Red Day the team wears the red alternate jerseys and fans are encouraged to wear red to the game. Starting in 2007 and including 2008, this included the Texans wearing red pants along with the red jerseys.
* '''[[Reliant Stadium|Bull Pen]]''' – The sections behind the north end zone of NRG/Reliant Stadium are known as the Bull Pen. Some of the most avid Texans fans attend games in the Bull Pen and regular members have helped create and implement fan traditions, songs and chants, such as:
*-Holding up giant Texans jerseys while the visiting team’s players are announced
*-Turning their backs on the opposing team after they score
*-Gathering as a group for tailgating in the NW corner of the Platinum Lot of Reliant Stadium at the “Blue Crew” tailgate and conducting the Bull Pen Toast every game approximately an hour and a half prior to kickoff
*-Walking in the HEB Holiday Parade on Thanksgiving Day
*-Visiting the Bull Pen Pub for TORO Wraps, cheerleader autographs and to listen and dance with the Bull Pen Pep Band
* '''[[Bull Pen Pep Band]]''' – 45-member musical group that performs at all Houston Texans home games.
* '''Pre-Kickoff Tradition''' – Before each kickoff at a home game, the Texans will run a short clip of a raging bull thrashing the opponent of the week. The video is paired with the AC/DC song "Thunderstruck". 
* '''Player Introduction''' – When the players are introduced before the game, the announcer says the player's first name and the crowd yells out the last name (e.g. The announcer will say "Linebacker [[Brian Cushing|Brian]]..." and the crowd will yell out "CUSHING!!!").

==Radio and television==
{{As of|2007}}, the Texans' flagship radio stations were [[KILT (AM)|KILT]] SportsRadio 610AM and [[KILT-FM|KILT]] 100.3FM. The AM station has an [[sports radio|all-sports]] format, while the FM station plays contemporary [[country music]]. Both are owned by [[CBS Radio]].
