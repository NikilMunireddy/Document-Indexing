'''Adobe Systems Incorporated''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ə|d|oʊ|b|iː}} is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more-recent foray towards [[rich Internet application]] [[software development]]. It is best known for [[Photoshop]], an image editing software, [[Adobe Reader]], the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) and [[Adobe Creative Suite]], as well as its successor [[Adobe Creative Cloud]].

Adobe was founded in February 1982<ref name="fastfacts">{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/fastfacts.pdf | title = Adobe Fast Facts|date=March 9, 2009|accessdate=April 4, 2009|format=PDF| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326033602/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/fastfacts.pdf| archivedate= 26 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> by [[John Warnock]] and [[Charles Geschke]], who established the company after leaving [[Xerox PARC]] in order to develop and sell the [[PostScript]] [[page description language]]. In 1985, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] licensed PostScript for use in its [[LaserWriter]] [[computer printer|printers]], which helped spark the [[desktop publishing]] revolution.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1150845/laserwriter.html| title=Four reasons the LaserWriter mattered| last=Edwards| first=Benj| date=April 27, 2010| publisher=MacWorld| access-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref>

{{as of|2015}}, Adobe Systems has about 13,500 employees,<ref name="10K"/> about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], Massachusetts; [[New York City, New York|New York City]], New York; [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota; [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]], Utah; [[Seattle]], Washington; [[San Francisco]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]], California in the United States.

==History==

The name of the company, ''Adobe'', comes from [[Adobe Creek (near Los Altos)|Adobe Creek]] in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], California, which ran behind the houses of both of the company's founders.<ref name="fastfacts" /> Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of [[John Warnock]], Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/adobe-logo/|title=Adobe Logo: Design and History| publisher=Famouslogos.net|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>

Adobe's first products after [[PostScript]] were [[digital font]]s, which they released in a proprietary format called [[Type 1 font|Type 1]]. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] subsequently developed a competing standard, [[TrueType]], which provided full scalability and precise control of the [[pixel]] pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to [[Microsoft]]. Adobe responded by publishing the Type 1 specification and releasing [[Adobe Type Manager]], software that allowed [[WYSIWYG]] scaling of Type 1 fonts on screen - like TrueType without the precise pixel-level control.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} But these moves were too late to stop the rise of TrueType. Although Type 1 remained the standard in the graphics/publishing market, TrueType became the standard for business and the average Windows user. In 1996, Adobe and Microsoft announced the [[OpenType]] font format, and in 2003 Adobe completed converting its Type 1 font library to OpenType.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer [[Computer software|software]] market with [[Adobe Illustrator]], a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drawing program for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers. Unlike [[MacDraw]], the then standard Macintosh vector drawing program, Illustrator described shapes with more flexible [[Bézier curve]]s, providing unprecedented accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Font rendering in Illustrator, however, was left to the Macintosh's [[QuickDraw]] libraries and would not be superseded by a PostScript-like approach until Adobe released Adobe Type Manager.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Adobe Systems entered [[NASDAQ]] in 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.<ref name="google">{{cite web|url=http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ADBE|publisher=Google Finance|title=Adobe Systems Incorporated Company Profile}}</ref> Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November.  For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.

In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its [[flagship]] product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.<ref name="siliconuser">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconuser.com/?q=node/10|title= How Adobe's Photoshop Was Born|accessdate=June 12, 2007|last=Hormby|first=Thomas|publisher=[[SiliconUser]]<!--DASHBot-->}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In 1993, Adobe introduced [[PDF]], the Portable Document Format, and its [[Adobe acrobat|Adobe Acrobat and Reader]] software. PDF is now an International Standard: [[PDF|ISO 32000-1:2008]]. The technology is adopted worldwide as a common medium for electronic documents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded to [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] in 2003.  In 1994, Adobe acquired [[Aldus]] and added [[Adobe PageMaker]] and [[Adobe After Effects]] to its product line later in the year; it also controls the [[TIFF]] file format. In 1995, Adobe added [[Adobe FrameMaker]], the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added [[Ares]] Software Corp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18422328.html |title= Adobe gets font technology.

[[File:Adobesystemsottawa.jpg|right|thumb||Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival [[Corel]]).]]In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc.; in 1994, the company acquired [[Aldus|Aldus Corporation]]. On May 30, 1997, Adobe reincorporated in Delaware by merging with and into Adobe Systems (Delaware), which had incorporated on May 9, 1997. Adobe Systems Incorporated (Delaware), the surviving corporation, changed its name to Adobe Systems Incorporated concurrently with the merger.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The company acquired GoLive Systems, Inc. and released [[Adobe GoLive]] in 1999 and began shipping [[Adobe InDesign]] as a direct competitor to [[QuarkXPress]] and as an eventual replacement for [[PageMaker]]. In May 2003, Adobe acquired Syntrillium Software, adding [[Adobe Audition]] to its product line. In December 2004, French company OKYZ S.A., makers of 3D collaboration software, was acquired. This acquisition added 3D technology and expertise to the Adobe Intelligent Document Platform.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival [[Macromedia]] in a [[stock swap]] valued at about $3.4 billion, adding [[Adobe ColdFusion]], [[Adobe Contribute]], [[Adobe Captivate]], [[Adobe Acrobat Connect]] (formerly Macromedia Breeze), [[Adobe Director]], [[Adobe Dreamweaver]], [[Adobe Fireworks]], [[Adobe Flash]], [[FlashPaper]], [[Adobe Flex]], [[Adobe FreeHand]], [[Adobe HomeSite]], [[Adobe JRun]], [[Adobe Presenter]], and [[Adobe Authorware]] to Adobe's product line.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jefferson|last=Graham|title=Adobe buys Macromedia in $3.4B deal|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2005-04-18-adobe-macromedia_x.htm?csp=34|work=USA Today|date=April 18, 2005|accessdate=March 31, 2007}}</ref>

On November 12, 2007, CEO, [[Bruce Chizen]] resigned. Effective December 1, he was replaced by [[Shantanu Narayen]], Adobe's current president and Chief Operating Officer. Bruce Chizen served out his term on Adobe's Board of Directors, and then continued in a strategic advisory role until the end of Adobe's 2008 [[fiscal year]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008. On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, [[Adobe GoLive|GoLive]] in favor of [[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]]. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched [[Acrobat.com]], a series of [[web application]]s geared for collaborative work.<ref name="AcrobatDotCom">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acom/2008/06/welcome_to_acrobatcom_work_tog_1.html|title=Welcome to Acrobat.com – Work.

After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/uk-will-pay-1000-more-for-adobe-cs3-3039286561/ |title=UK will pay £1,000 more for Adobe CS3 |publisher=ZDNet |date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://photo.net/photography-news-forum/00LDbS |title=10,000 sign Adobe CS3 European pricing petition |publisher=Photo.net |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/254173/adobe-hikes-uk-prices-by-10.html|title=Adobe hikes UK prices by 10% &#124; News|publisher=PC Pro|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}</ref> and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.<ref>{{cite news|author=Charles Arthur |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jun/04/adobe-software |title=Adobe widens the price gap |publisher=The Guardian |date= June 3, 2009|accessdate=2014-05-23 |location=London}}</ref>

Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of ''Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies'', based on a 2013 survey on [[Reddit.com]].<ref>{{cite web|author=08.20.13 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/20/the-internet-s-9-most-hated-companies.html |title=The Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies - The Daily Beast &#124; Business |publisher=The Daily Beast |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> Adobe's [[Adobe Reader|Reader]] and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] were listed on ''The 10 most hated programs of all time'' on [[TechRadar.com]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Gary Marshall&nbsp; |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/the-10-most-hated-programs-of-all-time-1060129 |title=The 10 most hated programs of all time: Terrible software that made everybody see red |publisher=TechRadar |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref>

=== Security ===
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pagliery |first=Jose |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/08/technology/security/adobe-security/ |title=Adobe has an espically abysmal security record - CNNMoney |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2013-10-08 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see [[Flash player#Criticism|criticism of Flash Player]]). A report by security researchers from [[Kaspersky Lab]] criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.<ref>{{cite web|author=Aug 17, 2011 by Jeff James in Security Blog |url=http://windowsitpro.com/blog/adobe-fares-poorly-kaspersky-lab-security-report |title=Adobe Fares Poorly in Kaspersky Lab Security Report |publisher=WindowsITPro |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref>

Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including [[spyware]] in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named [[Omniture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071228/020818.shtml |title=Adobe Spying On Its Customers |publisher=Techdirt |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/12/adobe_ate_me_baby.html |title=John Nack on Adobe: Adobe ate me baby!! |publisher=Blogs.adobe.com |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Login |url=http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/adobe-creative-suite-patch-backtrac-77760 |title=Adobe Backtracks On Patching ‘PR Disaster’ |publisher=TechWeekEurope |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brenner |first=Bill |url=http://blogs.csoonline.com/data-protection/2178/was-stupid-adobe |title=That was stupid, Adobe &#124; CSO Blogs |publisher=Blogs.csoonline.com |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref>

Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] update process,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/adobe-and-skype-top-my-foistware-hall-of-shame/3195 |title=Adobe and Skype top my Foistware Hall of Shame |publisher=ZDNet |date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> and for pushing a third-party [[scareware]] program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/adobes-latest-critical-security-update-pushes-scareware/4681 |title=Adobe's latest critical security update pushes scareware |publisher=ZDNet |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref>

===Customer data breach===

On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24392819 |title=Adobe in source code and customer data security breach|publisher=BBC |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Adobe accounts hacked, data exposed for 2.9 million customers - Digital Photography Review |url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2013/10/03/adobe-accounts-hacked-data-exposed-for-2-9-million-customers }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=King |first=Rachel |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57605962-83/adobe-hacked-3-million-accounts-compromised/ |title=Adobe hacked, 3 million accounts compromised &#124; Security & Privacy - CNET News}}</ref> Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57609753-83/adobe-hack-attack-affected-38-million-accounts/ |title=Adobe hack attack affected 38 million accounts &#124; Security & Privacy - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/adobe-security-breach-actually-affected-closer-to-38-million-users-7000022560/ |title=Adobe security breach actually affected closer to 38 million users|publisher=ZDNet}}</ref> The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.kioskea.net/news/24146-adobe-cyber-attack-was-a-lesson-for-corporations|title=Adobe Cyber Attack was a Lesson for Corporations - Kioskea.net|date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/10/09/how-safe-is-encrypted-card-data-adobe/ |title=After Security Breach Exposes 2.9 Million Adobe Users, How Safe Is Encrypted Credit Card Data? |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23 |first=Alex |last=Konrad}}</ref>

Many of the credit cards were tied to the [[Creative Cloud]] software-by-subscription service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243010/Adobe_hack_shows_subscription_software_vendors_lucrative_targets?pageNumber=1|title=Adobe hack shows subscription software vendors lucrative targets {{!}} Computerworld}}</ref> Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/10/massive-adobe-security-breach-change-your-passwords-now/ | title=Massive Adobe Security Breach: Change Your Passwords Now {{!}} Lifehacker Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/10/adobe-treating-australians-as-lesser-beings-even-after-details-of-2-9-million-accounts-were-stolen/| title=Adobe Treating Australians As Lesser Beings Even After Details Of 2.9 Million Accounts Were Stolen {{!}} Gizmodo Australia}}</ref> When a [[data breach]] occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/25/us-adobe-cyberattack-idUKBRE9AO10R20131125|title=Adobe says breach notification taking longer than anticipated &#124; Reuters | date=November 25, 2013}}</ref>

===Anti-competitive practices===
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.<ref name="law360"/><ref name="twff"/> [[Adobe Freehand|Freehand]] was direct competition to [[Adobe Illustrator]], Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.<ref name="twff"/><ref name="law360">{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/243049/adobe-hit-with-class-action-over-freehand-app|title=Adobe Hit With Class Action Over FreeHand App|first=Dan|last=Rivoli|date=2011-05-03|publisher=Law360}}</ref> The [[Federal Trade Commission]] intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).<ref name="twff"/><ref name="law360"/> Altsys was then bought by [[Macromedia]], which released versions 5 to 11.<ref name="twff"/> When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of [[Adobe FreeHand|Freehand]] in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.<ref name="law360"/><ref name="cwff">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-vendors/adobe-sued-by-freehand-user-group-3280625/|title=Adobe sued by FreeHand user group|date=2011-05-18|publisher=[[Computerworld]] UK}}</ref> With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.<ref name="law360"/>

In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner ''Free Freehand'', and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.<ref name="twff">{{cite web|url=http://www.techworld.com/news/apps/adobe-accused-of-software-monopoly-not-by-apple-3222555/|title=Adobe accused of software monopoly (not by Apple)|first=Lexton|last=Snol|date=2010-05-05|publisher=Tech World}}</ref><ref name="law360"/><ref name="quarkff">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetquark.com/2011/05/05/adobe-sued-for-killing-freehand/|title=Adobe Sued for Killing FreeHand|first=Jay|last=Nelson|date=2011-05-03|publisher=Planet Quark}}</ref><ref name="macff">{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1159949/freehand_lawsuit.html|title=FreeHand users sue Adobe for 'killing' the application|date=2011-05-18|publisher=[[Macworld]]}}</ref> The suit alleged that ''Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market'' and that ''Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.''<ref name="law360"/><ref name="quarkff"/><ref name="macff"/> Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.<ref name="law360"/><ref name="cwff"/> The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.<ref name="twff"/>

As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated ''"While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista."'' As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page.
