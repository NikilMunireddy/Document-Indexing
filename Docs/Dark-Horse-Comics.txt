'''Dark Horse Comics''' is an [[United States|American]] [[comic book]] and [[manga]] publisher. It was founded in 1986 by [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Mike Richardson]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon]], with the concept of establishing an ideal atmosphere for creative professionals.

Richardson started out by opening his first comic book store, Pegasus Books, in Bend, Oregon, in 1980. From there he was able to use the funds from his retail operation to start his own publishing company. ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' and ''[[Boris the Bear]]'' were the two initial titles in 1986 and within one year of its first publication, Dark Horse Comics added nine new titles to its roster, including ''[[The American (comics)|The American]]'', ''The Mark'', ''[[Trekker (comics)|Trekker]]'', and ''Black Cross''. [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Sin City]]'' is one of the most famous works associated with Dark Horse, and it has become something of a token comic to the publishing house.

In 2011, ''Dark Horse Presents'' relaunched including the return of [[Paul Chadwick]]'s  ''[[Concrete (comics)|Concrete]]'' and [[Steve Niles]]' ''[[Criminal Macabre]]'', as well as new talent including Sanford Greene, [[Carla Speed McNeil]], Nate Crosby and others.
