It is not known who was responsible for the Romanisation of the name "Hong Kong" but it is generally believed to be an early imprecise phonetic rendering of the pronunciation of the spoken [[Cantonese]] or [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] name {{lang|zh-hant|香港}}, meaning "Fragrant Harbour" or "Incense Harbour.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="etym">{{cite book

The reference to fragrance may refer to the sweet taste of the harbour's fresh water estuarine influx of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]], or to the incense from factories, lining the coast to the north of Kowloon, which was stored near Aberdeen Harbour for export before the development of the [[Victoria Harbour]].<ref name=etym/>

The name had often been written as the single word ''Hongkong'' until the [[government of Hong Kong|government]] adopted the current form in 1926.<ref>Hongkong Government Gazette, Notification 479, 3 September 1926</ref> Nevertheless, a number of century-old institutions still retain the single-word form, such as the [[Hongkong Post]], [[Hongkong Electric]] and [[the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]].

The full official name, after 1997, is "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China". This is the official title as mentioned in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and the Hong Kong Government's website;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/ |title=GovHK: Residents |publisher=[[Hong Kong Government]] |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> however, "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" and "Hong Kong" are widely accepted.

Hong Kong has carried many nicknames: the most famous among those is the "Pearl of the Orient", which reflected the impressive night-view of the city's light decorations on the skyscrapers along both sides of the [[Victoria Harbour]]. The territory is also known as "[[Brand Hong Kong|Asia's World City]]".

====Imperial China====
From the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] to the early period of [[Tang dynasty]], the territory that now comprises Hong Kong was governed by [[Bao'an County]] (寶安縣). In the Tang dynasty, the Guangdong region flourished as an international trading center. The Tuen Mun region in what is now Hong Kong's New Territories served as a port, naval base, salt production centre and, later, as base for the exploitation of pearls. Lantau Island was also a salt production centre, where the salt smugglers riots broke out against the government.

Under the [[Tang dynasty]], the Guangdong (Canton) region flourished as a regional trading centre. In 736 AD, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|the first Emperor of Tang]] established a military stronghold in [[Tuen Mun]] in western Hong Kong to defend the coastal area of the region.<ref name="SiuKK">{{cite journal|last=Siu Kwok-kin|script-title=zh:唐代及五代時期屯門在軍事及中外交通上的重要性|trans_title=The importance of Tuen Mun during Tang and Five Dynasties period for foreign traffic and military|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829000000/http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/TC/Content_3419/CH_S1-3_AV_12.doc|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/TC/Content_3419/CH_S1-3_AV_12.doc|journal=From Sui to Ming|publisher=[[Education Bureau]], Hong Kong Government|pages=40–45|archivedate=29 August 2010|accessdate=29 August 2010|language=Chinese}}</ref> The first village school, [[Li Ying College]], was established around 1075 AD in the modern-day [[New Territories]] under the [[Northern Song dynasty]].<ref name="Sweeting">{{cite book|last=Sweeting|first=Anthony|year=1990|title=Education in Hong Kong, Pre-1841 to 1941: Fact and Opinion|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=93|isbn=962-209-258-6}}</ref> After their defeat by the Mongols, the Southern Song court briefly moved to modern-day [[Kowloon City]] (the [[Sung Wong Toi]] site), before its final defeat at the [[Battle of Yamen]].<ref name="Barber">{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Nicola|year=2004|title=Hong Kong|publisher=[[Gareth Stevens]]|page=48|isbn=978-0-8368-5198-4}}</ref>

From the mid-[[Tang dynasty]] to early [[Ming dynasty]], the territory that now comprises Hong Kong was governed by [[Dongguan County]] (東莞縣/ 東官縣). In [[Ming dynasty]], the area was governed by [[Bao'an County|Xin'an County]] (新安縣) before it was colonized by the [[British government]]. The [[Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|indigenous inhabitants]] of what is now Hong Kong are identified with several ethnicities, including [[Punti]], [[Hakka]], [[Tanka people|Tanka]]) and [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]].

The earliest European visitor on record was [[Jorge Álvares]], a Portuguese explorer who arrived in 1513.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Porter|title=Macau, the Imaginary City: Culture and Society, 1557 to the Present|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|year=1996|page=63|isbn=978-0-8133-2836-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Richard L.|last=Edmonds|title=China and Europe Since 1978: A European Perspective|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|page=1|isbn=978-0-521-52403-2}}</ref> Having founded an establishment in [[Macau]] by 1557, Portuguese merchants began trading in southern China.

===British Crown Colony: 1842–1941===
{{main|British Hong Kong|History of Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)}}
In 1839, the refusal of [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] authorities to support opium imports caused the outbreak of the [[First Opium War]] between the British Empire and the Qing Empire. Qing's defeat resulted in the occupation of [[Hong Kong Island]] by British forces on 20 January 1841. It was initially ceded under the [[Convention of Chuenpee]], as part of a ceasefire agreement between Captain [[Charles Elliot]] and Governor [[Qishan (Qing dynasty)|Qishan]]. While a dispute between high-ranking officials of both countries led to the failure of the treaty's ratification, on 29 August 1842, Hong Kong Island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under the [[Treaty of Nanking]].<ref name="Courtauld">{{cite book|last=Courtauld|first=Caroline|last2=Holdsworth|first2=May|last3=Vickers|first3=Simon|year=1997|title=The Hong Kong Story|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=38–58|isbn=978-0-19-590353-9}}</ref> The British officially established a [[Crown colony]] and founded the [[Victoria, Hong Kong|City of Victoria]] in the following year.<ref name="HoeRoebuck">{{cite book|last=Hoe|first=Susanna|last2=Roebuck|first2=Derek|year=1999|title=The Taking of Hong Kong: Charles and Clara Elliot in China Waters|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=203|isbn=978-0-7007-1145-1}}</ref>

The population of Hong Kong Island was 7,450 when the [[Union Flag]] raised over [[Possession Point]] on 26 January 1841. It mostly consisted of [[Tanka (ethnic group)|Tanka]] fishermen and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Charcoal maker|charcoal burners]], whose settlements scattered along several coastal hamlets. In the 1850s, a large number of Chinese immigrants crossed the then-free border to escape from the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Other natural disasters, such as flooding, typhoons and famine in [[mainland China]] would play a role in establishing Hong Kong as a place for safe shelter.<ref name=thomson>John Thomson 1837–1921,[http://irc.aa.tufs.ac.jp/thomson/vol_1/mother/102.html Chap on Hong Kong], Illustrations of China and Its People (London,1873–1874)</ref><ref>Info Gov HK.

Further conflicts over the opium trade between Britain and Qing quickly escalated into the [[Second Opium War]]. Following the Anglo-French victory, the Crown Colony was expanded to include [[Kowloon Peninsula]] (south of Boundary Street) and [[Stonecutter's Island]], both of which were ceded to the British in perpetuity under the [[Convention of Beijing]] in 1860.

In 1898, Britain obtained a 99-year lease from Qing under the [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]], in which Hong Kong obtained a 99-year lease of the [[Lantau Island]], the area north of [[Boundary Street]] in Kowloon up to [[Shenzhen River]] and over 200 other outlying islands.<ref name="Wiltshire">{{cite book|first=Trea|last=Wiltshire|title=Old Hong Kong|volume=Volume II: 1901–1945|page=148|publisher=FormAsia Books|edition=5th|year=1997|isbn=962-7283-13-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/www/english/life/travel/chinamap/2010-07/548745.html |title=History of Hong Kong |newspaper=[[Global Times]] |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100723195834/http://www.globaltimes.cn:80/www/english/life/travel/chinamap/2010-07/548745.html |archivedate=23 July 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Political change and the crisis of legitimacy in Hong Kong|first=Ian|last=Scott|year=1989|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|page=6|isbn=978-0-8248-1269-0}}</ref>

Hong Kong soon became a major [[entrepôt]] thanks to its [[free port]] status, attracting new immigrants to settle from both China and Europe alike. The society, however, remained [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] and polarised under British colonial policies. Despite the rise of a British-educated Chinese upper-class by the late-19th century, race laws such as the [[Peak Reservation Ordinance]] prevented ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong from acquiring houses in reserved areas, such as the [[Victoria Peak]]. At this time, the majority of the Chinese population in Hong Kong had no political representation in the British colonial government. There were, however, a small number of Chinese elites whom the British governors relied on, such as [[Kai Ho|Sir Kai Ho]] and [[Robert Hotung]], who served as communicators and mediators between the government and local population.

[[File:1937 Hong Kong VP8.webm|thumb|left|Hong Kong filmed in 1937]]

Hong Kong continued to experience modest growth during the first half of the 20th century. The [[University of Hong Kong]] was established in 1911 as the territory's oldest higher education institute. While there was an exodus of 60,000 residents for fear of a German attack on the British colony during the [[World War I|First World War]], Hong Kong remained peaceful. Its population increased from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and reached 1.6 million by 1941.<ref>Linda Pomerantz-Zhang (1992).

In 1925, [[Cecil Clementi]] became the 17th [[Governor of Hong Kong]]. Fluent in Cantonese and without a need for translator, Clementi introduced the first ethnic Chinese, [[Shouson Chow]], into the Executive Council as an unofficial member. Under his tenure, [[Kai Tak Airport]] entered operation as [[RAF Kai Tak]] and several aviation clubs. In 1937, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out when the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] expanded its territories from northeastern China into the mainland proper. To safeguard Hong Kong as a freeport, Governor [[Geoffry Northcote]] declared the Crown Colony as a neutral zone.

As part of its [[Pacific War|military campaign in Southeast Asia]] during [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] moved south from [[Guangzhou]] of [[mainland China]] and attacked Hong Kong on 8 December 1941.<ref>{{cite web|first=Klemen |last=L |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/december2.html |title=Chronology of the Dutch East Indies, 7 December 1941 – 11 December 1941 |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942}}</ref> The [[Battle of Hong Kong]] ended with the British and Canadian defenders surrendering control of Hong Kong to Japan on 25 December 1941 in what was regarded by locals as Black Christmas.<ref>{{cite web|first=Klemen |last=L |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/december5.html |title=Chronology of the Dutch East Indies, 25 December 1941 – 31 December 1941 |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942}}</ref>

During the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]], the Japanese army committed atrocities against civilians and [[POW]]s, such as the [[St. Stephen's College massacre]]. Local residents also suffered widespread food shortages, limited rationing and hyper-inflation arising from the forced exchange of currency from Hong Kong Dollars to [[Japanese military yen|Japanese military banknotes]]. The initial ratio of 2:1 was gradually devalued to 4:1 and ownership of Hong Kong Dollars was declared illegal and punishable by harsh torture. Due to starvation and forced deportation for slave labour to mainland China, the population of Hong Kong had dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945, when Britain resumed control of the colony on 30 August 1945.<ref name="NYTime05">{{cite news|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/international/asia/17cnd-hong.html|title=Thousands March in Anti-Japan Protest in Hong Kong|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 April 2005|accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Flag of Hong Kong 1959.svg|thumb|left|[[Flag of British Hong Kong]] from 1959–1997]]

Hong Kong's population recovered quickly after the war, as a wave of skilled migrants from China flooded in for refuge from the [[Chinese Civil War]]. When the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] gained control of mainland China in 1949, even more skilled migrants fled across the open border for fear of persecution.<ref name="Wiltshire"/> Many newcomers, especially those who had been based in the major port cities of [[Shanghai]] and [[Guangzhou]], established corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses and shifted their base operations to British Hong Kong.<ref name="Wiltshire"/> The Chinese Communist Party's establishment of a socialist state in China on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong's open border to mainland China. In 1951, a [[Frontier Closed Area|boundary zone]] was demarked as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist China. Border posts in the north of Hong Kong began operation in 1953 to regulate the movement of people and goods into and out of British Hong Kong.

In the 1950s, Hong Kong became the first of the [[Four Asian Tigers|Four Asian Tiger economies]] under rapid industrialisation driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to China. As the population grew, with labour costs remaining low, living standards began to rise steadily.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cxxGJ7c10noC&pg=PA48&dq=textiles+growth+hong+kong&q=textiles%20growth%20hong%20kong|title=The growth and structure of international trade since the Second World War

Under [[Sir Murray MacLehose]], 25th [[Governor of Hong Kong]] (1971–82), a series of reforms improved the public services, environment, housing, welfare, education and infrastructure of Hong Kong. MacLehose was British Hong Kong's longest-serving governor and, by the end of his tenure, had become one of the most popular and well-known figures in the Crown Colony. MacLehose laid the foundation for Hong Kong to establish itself as a key [[global city]] in the 1980s and early 1990s.

[[File:HK010.jpg|thumb|left|Development of [[Hong Kong Island]] in 1986|alt=A sky view of Hong Kong Island]]

To resolve traffic congestion and to provide a more reliable means of crossing the [[Victoria Harbour]], a rapid transit railway system (metro), the [[MTR]], was planned from the 1970s onwards. The [[Island Line (MTR)|Island Line]] (Hong Kong Island), [[Kwun Tong Line]] (Kowloon Peninsula and East Kowloon) and [[Tsuen Wan Line]] (Kowloon and urban New Territories) opened in the early 1980s.<ref>Forsyth, Neil, dir. ''Underground Pride''. Mass Transit Railway Corporation, 1990. Film. 21 November 2013</ref>

Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs, as well as new development in southern China under the [[Open Door Policy]] introduced in 1978 which opened up China to foreign business. Nevertheless, towards the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre along with [[London]] and [[New York]], a regional hub for logistics and freight, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world's exemplar of [[Laissez-faire]] market policy.<ref name="Dodsworth">{{cite book|title=Hong Kong, [[China]]: Growth, Structural Change, and Economic Stability During the Transition|publisher=International Monetary Fund|year=1997|page=54|isbn=1-55775-672-4|first=John|last=Dodsworth|first2=Dubravko|last2=Mihaljek}}</ref>

====The Hong Kong question====
Facing the uncertain future of Hong Kong, Governor MacLehose raised the question in the late 1970s. In 1983, the United Kingdom reclassifed Hong Kong as a [[British overseas territories|British Dependent Territory]] (now British Overseas Territory) when reorganising global territories of the [[British Empire]]. Talks and negotiations began with China and concluded with the 1984 [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]. Both countries agreed to transfer Hong Kong's sovereignty to the [[China]] on 1 July 1997, when Hong Kong would remain autonomous as a ''Special Administrative Region'' and be able to retain its free-market economy, British common law through the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], independent representation in international organisations (e.g. [[World Trade Organisation|WTO]] and [[World Health Organisation|WHO]]), treaty arrangements and policy-making except foreign diplomacy and military defence.<ref name="Wiltshire"/> It stipulated that Hong Kong would retain its laws and be guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years after the transfer. The Hong Kong Basic Law, based on [[English law]], would serve as the constitutional document after the transfer. It was ratified in 1990.<ref name="Wiltshire"/> Nevertheless, the expiry of the 1898 lease on the New Territories in 1997 created problems for business contracts, property leases and confidence among foreign investors.

===Handover and Special Administrative Region status===
{{Main|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|2000s in Hong Kong}}

====Transfer of sovereignty====
[[File:Golden Bauhinia Square 20080830.JPG|thumb|[[Golden Bauhinia Square]]]]

On 1 July 1997, the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the [[United Kingdom]] to the People's Republic of China took place, officially marking the end of Hong Kong's 156 years under British colonial governance. As what was by far the largest remaining [[Crown Colony|colony]] of the United Kingdom, the loss of Hong Kong also effectively represented the end of the [[British Empire]]. At the same time, Hong Kong switched its country of administration overnight to become China's first Special Administrative Region. [[Tung Chee-Hwa]], a pro-Beijing business tycoon, was elected Hong Kong's first [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] by a selected electorate of 800 in a televised ceremony.

====Transition to Chinese rule====
Soon after Hong Kong's reversion to China, the city suffered an economic double-blow from the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian financial crisis]] and the pandemic of [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 bird flu]]; in December 1997, officials had to destroy 1.4 million chickens and ducks to contain the virus from spreading.<ref name="Wiltshire"/> Subsequently, mismanagement of Tung's housing policy disrupted the market supply, sent properties prices in Hong Kong tumbling and caused many homeowners to become bankrupt due to [[negative equity]]. In 2003, Hong Kong was gravely affected by the outbreak of [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200401/16/eng20040116_132721.shtml |title=Links between SARS, human genes discovered |newspaper=People's Daily |date=16 January 2004 |accessdate=1 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=SARS in China and Hong Kong|first=S.

Distrust of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained strong in the initial years of Chinese rule. A legacy of the democratic reforms by [[Chris Patten]], China refused to recognise the legitimacy of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] after its 1994 direct election. The "Provisional" Legislative Council of Hong Kong (1997–99), which was unable to draft any new bills or authorise new legislation, completed its five-year term in 1999. The [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) resumed its full function after the 1999 LegCo election.

Despite the unopposed re-election of Tung in July 2002, the government's attempt to complete legislation of the Basic Law's Article 23 (National Security) aroused strong suspicion among Hong Kong citizens. This was due to the Article granting the police force right of access to private property, under the reason of 'safeguarding national security', without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and deflation following the Asian Financial Crisis, [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2003 protest|a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003]]. This hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.<ref>{{cite news|last = Yau|first = Cannix|title = Tung's gone.

====Tensions with mainland China====
{{Main|Hong Kong–Mainland conflict}}

Since Hong Kong's reunification with China, there has been increasing social tension between Hong Kong residents and mainland Chinese due to cultural and linguistic differences, as well as accusations of unruly behaviour and spending habits of mainland Chinese visitors to the territory.<ref>[http://world.time.com/2012/01/24/trouble-down-south-why-hong-kong-and-mainland-chinese-arent-getting-along/ Trouble Down South: Why Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese Aren't Getting Along] Ko, Vanessa. '''TIME''', 24 June 2012.</ref> A 2011 survey (with a sample base of 541) in Hong Kong shows that 17% respondents considered themselves as "Chinese citizens", while 38% considered themselves just "Hong Kong citizens".<ref>[http://hkupop.hku.hk/english/release/release884.html Hong Kong population survey, 2011]</ref>

In 2012 Chief Executive elections saw the Beijing backed candidate [[CY Leung|Leung Chun-Ying]] elected with 689 votes from a committee panel of 1,200 selected representatives, and assumed office on 1 July 2012.

Social conflicts also influenced the mass [[2014 Hong Kong protests|protests]] in 2014, primarily caused by the Chinese government's proposal on [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|electoral reform]]. The debates over China's vision of granting Hong Kong full democracy have escalated into diplomatic rows between China and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=VWPrintVW3&article_id=1222907707&printer=printer&rf=0 |title=Hong Kong politics: China sets reform timetable |date=2 January 2008|author=The Economist Intelligence Unit|work=The Economist |accessdate=6 September 2010}}</ref>

Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, as its political and judicial systems operate independently from those of mainland China. In accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and the underlying principle of [[one country, two systems]], Hong Kong has a "high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region in all areas except defence and foreign affairs".{{refn|Section 3(2) of the ''Sino-British Joint Declaration'' states in part: "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs which, are the responsibilities of the Central People's Government."|group=note}} The declaration stipulates that the region maintain its [[Capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and guarantees the rights and freedoms of its people for at least 50 years after the 1997 handover.{{refn|Section 3(5) of the ''Sino-British Joint Declaration'' states that the social and economic systems and lifestyle in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and mentions rights and freedoms ensured by law.

The implementation of the Basic Law, including how and when the universal suffrage promised therein is to be achieved, has been a major issue of political debate since the transfer of sovereignty. In 2002, the government's proposed anti-subversion bill pursuant to [[Article 23 of the Basic Law]], which required the enactment of laws prohibiting acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government, was met with fierce opposition, and eventually shelved.<ref name="BasicLawC2">{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_2.html|title=Basic Law, Chapter II|publisher=Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee|accessdate=10 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="immd"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hkhrm.org.hk/english/reports/present_abode.html|title=Presentation to Legislative Council on Right of Abode Issue|work=[[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]]|date=10 May 1999|accessdate=20 January 2007}}</ref> Debate between pro-Beijing groups, which tend to support the Executive branch, and the [[Pan-democracy camp]] characterises Hong Kong's political scene, with the latter supporting a faster [[Democratic development in Hong Kong|pace of democratisation]], and the principle of [[one man, one vote]].<ref name="Cohen">{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Warren I.|last2=Li|first2=Zhao|year=1997|title=Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule: The Economic and Political Implications of Reversion|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62761-0|pages=220–235}}</ref>

The document proposed the enlargement of the Election Committee, Hong Kong's electoral college, from 800 members to 1,200 in 2012 and expansion of the legislature from 60 to 70 seats. The ten new legislative seats would consist of five geographical constituency seats and five functional constituency seats, to be voted in by elected district council members from among themselves.<ref name=consult2012>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmab-cd2012.gov.hk/doc/consultation_document_en.pdf|title=Public Consultation on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2012|date=11 June 2010|publisher=Hong Kong Government|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref> The proposals were destined for rejection by pan-democrats once again, but a significant breakthrough occurred after the Central Government in Beijing accepted a counter-proposal by the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]].

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Hong Kong}}
Hong Kong continues to play an active role in the international arena and maintains close contact with its international partners. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong is exclusively in charge of its external relations, whilst the Government of the [[China]] is responsible for its foreign affairs. According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong may on its own, using the name "Hong Kong, [[China]]", maintain and develop relations and conclude and implement agreements with foreign states and regions and relevant international organisations in the appropriate fields, including the economic, trade, financial and monetary, shipping, communications, [[tourism]], cultural and sports fields.<ref>Article 151, [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]</ref>

As a separate customs territory, Hong Kong maintains and develops relations with foreign states and regions, and plays an active role in such international organisations as the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), the [[International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA), and the [[International Basketball Federation]] (FIBA) in its own right under the name of Hong Kong, [[China]]. Under such special conditions, Hong Kong's international partners usually exercise particular policies to maintain relations with Hong Kong, such as the [[United States-Hong Kong Policy Act]].

There is a large [[Consular missions in Hong Kong|foreign representation]] in Hong Kong, including 59 Consulates-General, 62 Consulates and 5 officially recognised international bodies, such as the Office of the [[European Union]].<ref>Chapter 1, Hong Kong Year Book 2011</ref> Due to Hong Kong's [[One country, two systems|special status]], some countries' Consulates-General operate independently of their Embassies in [[Beijing]]. For example, the [[Consulate General of the United States, Hong Kong and Macau|US Consulate General to Hong Kong]] is not under the jurisdiction of the [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing|Embassy in Beijing]], and reports directly to the [[US Department of State]].<ref>[http://www.ait.org.tw/en/pressrelease-pr1224.htm  Christopher J.

===Human rights===
{{main|Human rights in Hong Kong}}
The Hong Kong government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and members of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and the [[District Council of Hong Kong]] are elected into office by Hong Kong citizens. However, there are 27 [[ex officio]] members of the district council (the [[Rural Committee]] Chairmen in the [[New Territories]]) as of the [[Hong Kong local elections, 2015|fifth District Council Assembly]], and roughly half of the legislative council seats are elected by 3% of the people in Hong Kong through the [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]]. The imbalance of voting power in the LegCo has led to widespread criticism of the its inability to represent Hongkonger's socio-economic needs.<ref>http://www.chinadailyasia.com/hknews/2015-06/10/content_15274499.html</ref> In addition, the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] is elected by 1,200 members based on their contributions to four different sectors of Hong Kong's society. This policy has received criticism from various political figures in Hong Kong, and led to the [[Umbrella Revolution]]. Plans to expand the voting population had begun to appear in the 2000s, and political figures liaised with the government to provide [[Democratic development in Hong Kong|universal suffrage]].

When Hong Kong's sovereignty transferred to People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997, the British barracks were replaced by a [[PLA Hong Kong Garrison|garrison of the People's Liberation Army]], comprising ground, naval, and air forces, who come under the command of the Chinese [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]].

The [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law of Hong Kong]] protects local civil affairs against any interference by the garrison; members of the garrison are subject to Hong Kong laws. The Hong Kong Government remains responsible for the maintenance of public order; however, it may ask the PRC government for assistance from the garrison in maintaining public order and in disaster relief. The PRC government is now responsible for the costs of maintaining the garrison.<ref name="BasicLawC2"/><ref name="Rioni2">{{cite book|last=Rioni|first=S.

The Hong Kong Government has traditionally played a mostly passive role in the economy, with little by way of [[industrial policy]] and almost no [[Trade restriction|import or export controls]]. Market forces and the private sector were allowed to determine practical development. Under the official policy of "[[positive non-interventionism]]", Hong Kong is often cited as an example of laissez-faire capitalism.

Providing an adequate [[water supply]] for Hong Kong has always been difficult because the region has few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate [[groundwater]] sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard [[granite]] [[bedrock]] found in most areas in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water demand is met by importing water from the [[Dong River (China)|Dongjiang River]] in neighbouring [[Guangdong]] province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed by the use of seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = N.

Most comprehensive schools in Hong Kong fall under three categories: the rarer public schools; the more common subsidised schools, including government aids-and-grant schools; and private schools, often run by Christian organisations and having admissions based on academic merit rather than on financial resources.

Since 2011, there have been growing concerns that mothers-to-be from mainland China, in a bid to obtain the right of abode in Hong Kong and the benefits that come with it, have saturated the neonatal wards of the city's hospitals both public and private. This has led to protest from local pregnant women for the government to remedy the issue, as they have found difficulty in securing a bed space for giving birth and routine check-ups. Other concerns in the decade of 2001–2010 relate to the workload medical staff experience; and medical errors and mishaps, which are frequently highlighted in local news.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/asia/mainland-chinese-flock-to-hong-kong-to-have-babies.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=Mainland Chinese Flock to Hong Kong to Give Birth|first=Sharon|last=LaFraniere|date=22 February 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, Hong Kong successfully organised the [[2009 East Asian Games|V East Asian Games]]. Other major international sporting events including the [[Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics]], [[Hong Kong Sevens]], [[Hong Kong Marathon]], [[AFC Asian Cup]], [[EAFF East Asian Cup]], [[Hong Kong Tennis Classic]], [[Premier League Asia Trophy]], and [[Lunar New Year Cup]] are also held in the territory. {{As of|2010}}, there were 32 Hong Kong athletes from seven sports ranking in world's Top 20, 29 athletes in six sports in Asia top 10 ranking.
