'''Hertha Berliner Sport-Club von 1892''', commonly known as '''Hertha BSC'''  ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛʁtaː beː ʔɛs t͡seː}}) or sometimes just '''Hertha''', is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Berlin]]. Hertha BSC was founded in 1892. A [[Founding Clubs of the DFB|founding member of the German Football Association]] in [[Leipzig]] in 1900, Hertha BSC play in the [[Bundesliga]], the top-tier division of German football, after finishing at the top of the [[2. Bundesliga]] table at the end of the [[2012–13 2. Bundesliga|2012–13 season]]. Hertha BSC have won the [[List of German football champions|German championship]] in 1930 and 1931. Since 1963, Hertha's stadium is the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]].

==History==
===Early years===
The club was formed in 1892 as ''BFC Hertha 92'', taking its name from a steamship with a blue and white smokestack; one of the four young men who founded the club had taken a day trip on this ship with his father.<ref name="1892-1963">{{cite web|title=Hertha: Vereinsgeschichte, 1892–1963|accessdate=20 March 2016|publisher=Hertha BSC official website |url=http://www.herthabsc.de/de/hertha/vereinsgeschichte/1892-1963/page/391-500-4--.html}} {{De icon}}</ref> The name Hertha is a variation on [[Nerthus]] referring to fertility goddess from Germanic mythology.[[File:Hertha ship 1886 (1).JPG|thumb|right|The ship that gave name to the club.]]

Hertha performed consistently well on the field, including a win in the first Berlin championship final in 1905.<ref name="1892-1963"/> In May 1910, Hertha won a friendly match against [[Southend United F.C.]], which was considered significant at the time as England was where the game originated and English clubs dominated the sport.<ref name="1892-1963"/> However, their on-field success was not matched financially and in 1920 the staunchly working-class<ref name="Hesse-Lichtenberger">Hesse-Lictenberger, Ulrich (2003), ''Tor! The Story of German Football'', WSG Books Ltd. ISBN 978-0-9540134-5-5</ref> Hertha merged with the well-heeled club [[Berliner Sport-Club]] to form ''Hertha Berliner Sport-Club''.<ref name="1892-1963"/> The new team continued to enjoy considerable success in the [[Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg]], while also enduring a substantial measure of frustration. The team played its way to the German championship final in six consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1931, but were only able to come away with the title in 1930 and 1931<ref name="1892-1963"/> with ''BSC'' leaving to become an independent club again after the combined side's first championship. Even so, ''Hertha'' emerged as the Germany's second most successful team during the inter-war years.

===Play under the Third Reich===
German football was re-organized under the [[Third Reich]] in 1933 into sixteen top-flight divisions, which saw ''Hertha'' playing in the [[Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg]]. The club continued to enjoy success within their division, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table and capturing the divisional title in 1935, 1937, and 1944. However, they faded from prominence, unable to advance out of the early rounds of the national championship rounds. Politically, the club was overhauled under Hitler, with Hans Pfeifer, a Nazi party member being installed as president.<ref name=1892-1963/><ref>HA HO HE Hertha BSC; München: Copress-Verlag, 1971</ref>

===Postwar play===
After World War II, occupying Allied authorities banned most organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. Hertha was re-formed late in 1945 as ''SG Gesundbrunnen'' and resumed play in the Oberliga Berlin&nbsp;– Gruppe C. The thirty-six teams of the first season of the postwar Oberliga Berlin were reduced to just a dozen the next year and the club found itself out of first division football and playing in the Amateurliga Berlin. By the end of 1949, they had re-claimed their identity as ''Hertha BSC Berlin'' and earned a return to the top-flight.

Tensions between the western Allies and the Soviets occupying various sectors of the city, and the  developing [[Cold War]], led to chaotic conditions for football in the capital. Hertha was banned from playing against [[East Germany|East German]] teams in the 1949–50 season after taking on several players and a coach who had fled the [[Dresden]] club [[Dresdner SC|SG Friedrichstadt]] for [[West Berlin]].<ref name=1892-1963/> A number of sides from the eastern half of the city were forced from the Oberliga Berlin to the newly established DDR-Liga beginning with the 1950–51 season.

Through the 50's an intense rivalry developed with [[Tennis Borussia Berlin]]. A proposal for a merger between the two clubs in 1958 was resoundingly rejected, with only three of the 266 members voting in favour.<ref name=1892-1963/>

Being a major Berlin side, Hertha had fans in the whole of Berlin, but following the division of the city, supporters in [[East Berlin]] found if both difficult and dangerous to follow their beloved team. In interviews with the long time supporter Helmut Klopfleisch, he describes his difficulties as a supporter in East Berlin. Klopfleisch came from the district of [[Pankow]] and attending his first home match as a young boy in 1954 he became an instant supporter.<ref name="hinter der mauer">{{cite web |url=http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/news/blau-weisse-liebe-hinter-der-mauer_0000275088.jsp |title=Blau-weisse liebe hinter der Mauer  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=25 October 2013 |website=bundesliga.de |publisher=Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH |language=German |access-date=5 August 2015 |quote=}}</ref> He continued to attend home matches at the stadium, but with the construction of the [[Berlin wall]] in 1961, this became impossible. Despite this, he did not give up. By this time, Hertha played at the [[Stadion am Gesundbrunnen]], nicknamed ''Die Plumpe''. The stadium was located close enough to the Berlin wall for the sounds from the stadium to be heard over the wall. Thus, Klopfleisch and other supporters gathered behind the wall to listen to the home matches. When the crowd at the stadium cheered, Klopfleisch and the others cheered as well.<ref name="hinter der mauer"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Kuper |first=Simon |date=7 November 2009 |title=Still injury time for a fan on the wrong side of Berlin's wall |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/beb0021a-cb3c-11de-97e0-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3hw6ZUOnh |language= |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd |location=London |access-date=5 August 2015 }}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news |last=Ehrmann |first=Johannes |date=30 September 2010 |title=Der Fan hinter der Mauer |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/der-fan-hinter-der-mauer/1946324.html |language=German |newspaper=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |publisher=Verlag Der Tagesspiegel GmbH |location=Berlin |access-date=5 August 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.herthabsc.de/de/fans/klopfleisch-einheit/page/3525--59-59-.html |title=Helmut Klopfleisch&nbsp;– ein Fan der Einheit |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=herthabsc.de |publisher=Hertha BSC GmbH & Co.

===Entry to the Bundesliga===
At the time of the formation of the [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] in 1963, Hertha was Berlin's reigning champion and so became an inaugural member of the new professional national league.<ref name="1963-68">{{cite web|title=1963–1965: Hertha startet in die Bundesliga |trans_title=1963–68: Hertha starts in the Bundesliga |publisher=Hertha BSC official website |accessdate=26 December 2009 |language=German |url=http://www.hertha.de/index.php?id=1315 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20050223023200/http://www.hertha.de:80/index.php?id=1315 |archivedate=23 February 2005 }}</ref> In spite of finishing clear of the relegation zone, the team was demoted after the 1964–65 season following attempts to bribe players to play in the city under what had become decidedly unpleasant circumstances after the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref name="1963-68"/> This caused something of a crisis for the Bundesliga which wanted, for political reasons, to continue to have a team in its ranks representing the former capital. Through various machinations this led to the promotion of [[SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin]], which then delivered the worst-ever performance in Bundesliga history. Hertha managed a return to the premier German league in 1968–69 and developed a solid following, making it Berlin's favorite side.<ref name="1968-79">{{cite web|title=1968–1979: Rückkehr ins Fußballoberhaus, Bundesligaskandal und erfolgreiche 70er|trans_title=1968–1979: Return to Top Flight Football, Bundesliga Scandal, and Successful 70s|publisher=Hertha BSC official website|accessdate=26 December 2009|language=German|url=http://www.hertha.de/index.php?id=1316}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

However, Hertha was again soon touched by scandal through its involvement with several other clubs in the Bundesliga match fixing scandal of 1971. In the course of an investigation of Hertha's role, it was also revealed that the club was 6 million DM in debt. Financial disaster was averted through the sale of the team's former home ground.<ref name="1968-79"/>

In spite of this, the team continued to enjoy a fair measure of success on the field through the 70's with a second place Bundesliga finish behind [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in 1974–75,<ref name="1968-79"/> a semi-final appearance in the 1979 [[UEFA Cup]],<ref name="1968-79"/> and two appearances in the final of the [[DFB-Pokal|German Cup]] (1977 and 1979).<ref name="1968-79"/> The following season saw the fortunes of the team take a turn for the worse as they were relegated to [[2. Fußball-Bundesliga|2.&nbsp;Bundesliga]]<ref name="1980-89">{{cite web|title=1980–1989: Berg- und Talfahrt|trans_title=1980–89: Roller Coaster Ride|accessdate=26 December 2009|publisher=Hertha BSC official website|language=German|url=http://www.hertha.de/index.php?id=1317}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> where they would spend thirteen of the next seventeen seasons.

Plans in 1982 for a merger with [[Tennis Borussia Berlin]], [[SpVgg Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin]] and [[SCC Berlin]] to form a side derisively referred to as ''FC Utopia'' never came to fruition.<ref name="1980-89"/> Hertha slipped as low as the third tier Amateur Oberliga Berlin where they spent two seasons (1986–87 and 1987–88).<ref name="1980-89"/> Two turns in the Bundesliga (1982–83<ref name="1980-89"/> and 1990–91) saw the team immediately relegated after poor performances. Hertha's amateur side enjoyed a greater measure of success, advancing all the way to the final of the [[DFB-Pokal|German Cup]] in 1993 where their run ended in a close 0–1 defeat at the hands of Bundesliga side [[Bayer Leverkusen]].<ref name="1989-94">{{cite web|title=1989–1994: Hertha überwindet die "Mauer" zur 1.

Following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Hertha became a popular side in East Berlin as well. Two days after the wall came down, 11,000 East Berliners attended Hertha's match against [[SG Wattenscheid]].<ref name="1989-94"/> A fan friendship with [[1. FC Union Berlin]] developed, and a friendly match between the two attracted over 50,000 spectators.<ref name="1989-94"/>

Financial woes once more burdened the club in 1994 as it found itself 10 million DM in debt.<ref name="1989-94"/>  The crisis was again resolved through the sale of real estate holdings in addition to the signing of a new sponsor and management team.<ref name="1994-97">{{cite web|title=1994–1997: Weichenstellung mit neuen Partnern|trans_title=1994–97: Setting the Tracks with new Partners|language=German|accessdate=26 December 2009|publisher=Hertha BSC official website|url=http://www.hertha.de/index.php?id=1319}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> By 1997 Hertha found its way back to the Bundesliga<ref name="1994-97"/> where they generally managed to finish in the upper third of the slate. When Hertha was promoted in 1997, it ended Berlin's six-year-long drought without a Bundesliga side which had made the Bundesliga the only top league in Europe without representation from its country's biggest city and capital.

===Recent history===
[[File:Eintracht frankfurt gegen hertha bsc albert streit vs sofian chahed.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Two years in a row, Hertha's opening Bundesliga fixture was against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]].]]

Most recently, bright spots for the side have been a continuous string of appearances in international play in the [[UEFA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] beginning in the 1999 season, and the signing of players such as [[Sebastian Deisler]] and Brazilian international [[Marcelinho Paraíba|Marcelinho]], named the Bundesliga's player of the year in May 2005.  Hertha has also invested heavily in its own youth football academy, which has produced several players with Bundesliga potential.

[[File:Ostkurve in Action.jpg|left|thumb|The ''Ostkurve'' at the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]].]]

The team was almost relegated in the [[2003–04 Bundesliga|2003–04 season]], but rebounded and finished fourth the following season, but missed out on the Champions League after they were held to a draw on the final day by [[Hannover 96]], which saw [[Werder Bremen]] overtake them for the spot on the final day. As a thank-you gesture, Werder sent the [[Hannover]] squad ninety-six bottles of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]].  In 2005–06 the Herthaner finished sixth, qualified for the UEFA Cup by defeating [[FK Moskva]] in the [[Intertoto Cup]] but were eliminated in the first round of the UEFA Cup by [[Odense BK]]. In 2006–07 Hertha finished 10th after sacking manager [[Falko Götz]] on 11 April. Hertha started the 2007–08 season with a new manager, [[Lucien Favre]] who had won the Swiss Championship in 2006 and 2007 with [[FC Zürich]]. They finished 10th again, but started in the first qualification round of the UEFA Cup via the Fair Play Ranking, making it as far as the group stage in the tournament. After a successful campaign in [[2008–09 Hertha BSC season|2008–09 season]], finishing in fourth place and remaining in the title race up until the second to last matchday, they had a very poor season in [[2009–10 Hertha BSC season|2009–10 season]] and finished at the very bottom of the Bundesliga.

After spending the [[2010–11 2. Bundesliga|2010–2011 season]] in the [[2. Fußball-Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]], Hertha BSC secured their return to the [[Bundesliga]] for the 2011–12 season by winning 1–0 at [[MSV Duisburg]], with three matchdays left to go in the season. However, Hertha finished 16th in the [[2011–12 Bundesliga]] and lost in a [[2011–12 Fußball-Bundesliga#Relegation play-offs|controversial relegation playoff]] tournament to [[Fortuna Dusseldorf]].

In [[2012–13 2. Bundesliga|2012–13]], Hertha achieved promotion from the second division as champions for the second time in three seasons. On the opening day of the [[2013–14 Bundesliga|2013–14 season]], Hertha beat [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] 6–1 at the [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]] to top the Bundesliga table at the end of matchday 1.

At the half way point of the [[2015–16 Bundesliga|2015–16 Bundesliga Season]] Hertha Berlin lies in 3rd place, their highest position at the winter break since the [[2008–09 Bundesliga|2008–2009 season]].<ref>http://www.bundesliga.com/en/stats/table/</ref>

==Stadium==
[[File:Olympicstadium2.jpg|thumb|right| The [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]] after renovation in 2004.]]
Since 1963, Hertha BSC has played its matches in Berlin's [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]], originally built for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].

The stadium has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympiastadion-berlin.de/en/stadium-visitor-centre/facts-and-figures.html |title=Facts and Figures: Olympiastadion Berlin |publisher=Olympiastadion-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> making it the largest stadium in Germany in terms of seating capacity and the second largest stadium in Germany, behind the [[Signal Iduna Park]] in [[Dortmund]], in terms of total capacity. For certain football matches, such as those against [[FC Bayern München]], the capacity can be temporarily expanded. This is made by the addition of mobile grandstand over the Marathon Arch. The extended capacity reached 76,197 seats in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herthabsc.de/de/fans/kapazitaet-olympiastadion/page/4736--59-59--59.html|title=76.197 Zuschauer gegen Bayern München |publisher=herthabsc.de|date= |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/article126119328/Berliner-Olympiastadion-erhaelt-405-zusaetzliche-Sitze.html|title=Berliner Olympiastadion erhält 405 zusätzliche Sitze|publisher=Berliner Morgenpost|date= 24 March 2014|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>

The stadium underwent major renovations twice, in 1974 and from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the renovations were for the upcoming [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. In the 1974 upgrades, the stadium received a partial roof. It underwent a thorough modernisation for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. In addition, the colour of the track was changed to blue to match Hertha's club colours. In addition to Hertha's home games, Olympiastadion serves as one of the home grounds for the [[Germany national football team|German national football team]], and it hosts concerts, track and field competitions, and the annual German Cup final. It was also the site for six matches of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] including the tournament final.

From 1904, Hertha's [[Stadion am Gesundbrunnen|home ground]] was the Plumpe in the city's [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin)|Gesundbrunnen district]] . A stadium was built there in 1923 with a capacity of 35,000 (3,600 seats). The club left the stadium when it joined the [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] in 1963. Hertha returned to the site during the Regionalliga years from 1965 to 1968. The sale of the site in 1971 helped the club avoid bankruptcy.

Due to a lack of spectator interest, Hertha played their 2nd Bundesliga and Amateurliga matches from 1986 to 1989 in [[Poststadion]]. The opening fixtures of the 1992–93 season, as well as [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], and [[UEFA Cup]] qualifying matches were played at the [[Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark]].

It was confirmed on 23 May 2016, that Hertha will still play their home games in [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]] until 2025.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hertha bleibt bis 2025 im Olympiastadion|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/652500/artikel_hertha-bleibt-bis-2025-im-olympiastadion.html|accessdate=24 May 2016|language=German}}</ref>

==Women's football==
Missing out on a trend of promoting women's football,<ref name="tagesspiegel.de">http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/hertha-bsc/neues-maedchenteam-hertha-heiratet/1435070.html</ref> Hertha became one of a decreasing number of major German football clubs left outside the top of women's football. Several steps had been taken to develop women's football, but most of them ended up inconclusive. The change came in 2009, when the club announced that it was to launch a cooperation in women's football with [[1. FC Lübars]], a football club from the Berlin borough [[Reinickendorf]] and with decades of history in women's football.<ref name="zeit.de">http://www.zeit.de/online/2009/07/frauenfussball-hertha-bsc-berlin-fc-luebars-kooperation</ref>

From one side, the partnership meant that Hertha was to provide Lübars with various forms of support, including financial support,<ref name="zeit.de"/> expertise in licensing and sponsor acquisition, equipment and training instruction&nbsp;– investing approximately 1 million Euros in the project.<ref name="bild.de">http://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/1-mio-euro-fuer-neues-frauen-team-7511210.bild.html</ref> From the other side, the partnership meant that Lübars was to compete in the colours of Hertha,<ref name="tagesspiegel.de"/> thus earning the nickname ''"Die Hertha-Frauen"'' ("The Hertha-women"). In the long run, the club plans for the team of 1. FC Lübars to be integrated with Hertha BSC.<ref name="zeit.de"/><ref name="bild.de"/> 1. FC Lübars now competes in the [[2. Bundesliga (women)|2. Bundesliga of women's football]].
