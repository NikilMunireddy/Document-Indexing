The '''Australian Football League''' ('''AFL''') is the highest-level professional competition in the sport of [[Australian rules football]]. Through the [[AFL Commission]], the AFL also serves as the sport's governing body, and is responsible for controlling the [[Laws of Australian football|Laws of the Game]]. The league was founded as the Victorian Football League (VFL) as a breakaway from the previous [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), with [[1897 VFL season|its inaugural season]] commencing in 1897. Originally comprising only teams based in the Australian state of Victoria, the competition's name was changed to the Australian Football League for the 1990 season, after expanding to other states throughout the 1980s.

The league currently consists of 18 teams spread over five of Australia's six states ([[Tasmania]] being the exception). Matches have been played in all mainland [[states and territories of Australia]], as well as in [[New Zealand]]. The AFL season currently consists of a [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|pre-season competition]] (currently branded as the "NAB Challenge"), followed by a 23-round regular (or "home-and-away") season, which runs during the Australian winter (March to September). The top eight teams then play off in a four-round [[AFL finals system|finals series]], culminating in the [[AFL Grand Final]], which is held at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] each year. The winning team in the Grand Final is termed the "[[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiers]]", and is awarded the premiership cup. The current premiers are [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]].

===1897: Breakaway VFA clubs found VFL===
[[File:Prem1897.jpg|thumb|right|300px|{{AFL Ess}} won the [[1897 VFL season|1897 Victorian Football League]] (VFL), the first edition of the breakaway competition established by eight Victorian Football Association (VFA) clubs. The VFL would eventually evolve into the present day Australian Football League (AFL).]]
The Australian Football League can trace its beginnings back to the foundation of the Victorian Football League in 1897 when six of the strongest clubs in Victoria – Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne and South Melbourne – broke away from the established [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] to establish a more professional competition. The six clubs invited two more VFA clubs – Carlton and St Kilda – to join the league for its inaugural season in 1897. Among the notable initiatives established in the new league was an annual [[playoffs|finals]] tournament, rather than awarding the premiership directly to the team with the best record through the season; and, the formal establishment of the modern scoring system, in which six points are scored for a goal, and one point is scored for a behind.

Although the Victorian Football League and the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] continued to compete for spectator interest for many years, the VFL quickly established itself as the premier competition in Victoria. In 1908, the league expanded to ten teams, with Richmond crossing from the VFA and University from the Metropolitan Football Association. University, after three promising seasons, finished last each year from 1911 until 1914, including losing 51 matches in a row; this was in part caused by its players' focus on their studies rather than football, particularly during examinations, and it was partly because the club operated on an amateur basis at a time when player payments were becoming common – and as a result, the club withdrew from the VFL at the end of 1914.<ref name="The University Team">{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|title=The University Team|date=18 September 1914|page=4|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|title=Exit University – Football League Retirement|date=17 October 1914|page=20|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref>

Beginning sporadically during the late 1800s and consistently from 1907 until [[WWI]], the VFL premier and the premier of the [[SANFL|South Australian Football League]] met in a playoff match for the [[Championship of Australia]]. {{AFL Por}} was the most successful club of the competition winning three titles during the period along with an earlier victory.

===1915-1945: Three VFA Clubs Join VFL Between World Wars===
{{Main|The VFL during the World Wars}}
[[File:1924 Victorian Football Championship.jpg|thumb|300px|right|During 1924 in Victoria [[1924 Championship of Victoria|the premiers of the VFL, Essendon, played the premiers of the VFA, Footscray]], with the latter winning by 28 points at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of the years largest crowd of 46,100 (Inset captains [[Con McCarthy]] of Footscray and [[Syd Barker]] of Essendon). The result of the match played a large part in Footscray, Hawthorn and North Melbourne being admitted into the VFL for the 1925 season.  ]]
In 1925, the VFL expanded from nine teams to twelve, with [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]], [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] each crossing from the VFA. North Melbourne and Hawthorn remained very weak in the VFL for a very long period. Although [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] would become the first of the 1925 expansion sides to reach a Grand Final in [[1950 VFL Grand Final|1950]], initially it was  [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]] that adapted to the VFL with the most ease of the three clubs, and by 1928 were well off the bottom of the ladder.

Between the years of 1927 and 1930, Collingwood became the first, and only VFL team, to win four successive Premierships.

=== 1946-1976: Victorian Postwar Pastime ===
In 1952, the VFL hosted 'National Day', when all six matches were played outside of Melbourne. Matches were played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]], [[North Hobart Oval]], [[Albury Sports Ground]] and Victorian country towns [[Yallourn]] and [[Euroa]].

Footscray became the first of the 1925 expansion teams to win the premiership in 1954.

Melbourne became a powerhouse during the 1950s and early 1960s under coach [[Norm Smith]] and star player [[Ron Barassi]]. The club contested seven consecutive grand finals from 1954 to 1960, winning five premierships, including three in a row from 1955 to 1957.

Television coverage began in 1957, with direct telecasts of the final quarter permitted. At first, several channels competed through broadcasting different games. However, when the VFL found that television was reducing crowds, it decided that no coverage was to be allowed for 1960. In 1961, replays (in Melbourne) were introduced although direct telecasts were rarely permitted in Melbourne (other States and Territories, however, enjoyed live telecasts every Saturday afternoon).

In 1959, the VFL planned the first purpose built mega-stadium, [[Waverley Park|VFL Park]] (later known as Waverley Park), to give it some independence from the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], which managed the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. VFL Park was planned to hold 155,000 spectators, which would have made it one of the largest stadiums in the world – although it would ultimately be built with a capacity of 78,000. Land for the stadium was purchased at Mulgrave, then farmland but predicted to be near the demographic centre of Melbourne's population.

The VFL Premiership Trophy was first awarded in addition to a pennant flag in 1959; essentially the same trophy design has been in use since.

In the 1960s, television began to have a huge impact. Spectators hurried home from games to watch replays and many former players took up positions as commentators on pre-game preview programs and post-game review programs. There were also several attempts at variety programs featuring VFL players, who generally succeeded in demonstrating that their skills were limited to the football ground.

The VFL played the first of a series of [[Australian rules football exhibition matches|exhibition matches]] in 1962 in an effort to lift the international profile of the league.

The 1970 season saw the opening of VFL Park, with the inaugural match being played between Geelong and Fitzroy, on 18 April 1970. Construction work was carried out at the stadium as the 1970s progressed, culminating in the building of the now heritage listed Sir Kenneth Luke stand. The [[Queen of Australia]], [[Elizabeth II]] was a guest at the game and officially opened the stadium to the public. The [[1970 VFL Grand Final|1970 Grand Final]] between traditional rivals Carlton and Collingwood, arguably the league's most famous game which saw Carlton recover from a 44-point deficit at half-time to win the game by ten points, featured a famous [[spectacular mark]] by [[Alex Jesaulenko]], and was witnessed by a record crowd of 121,696.

=== 1977-1981: VFL Leaves Australian National Football Council===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1976 Wills Cup Grand Final.jpg|thumb|200px|The last [[Australian National Football Council]] competition VFL clubs took part in was the [[1976 NFL Championship Series (Australia)|1976 NFL Championship Series]] between [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in [[Adelaide]]. The VFL would host its own National Night Series until 1986 when it ended the event after [[West Australian Football Commission|WAFC]] confirmed {{AFL WCE}}'s entry to the VFL.]] -->
{{Main|Championship of Australia}}
{{Main|NFL Night Series}}
{{Main|Australian Football Championships Night Series}}

In 1976, the [[Australian National Football Council|National Football League]], which was the national administrative body for Australian rules football at the time, established the [[NFL Night Series]] to succeed the [[Championship of Australia]]. Played concurrently with the premiership season, the Night Series was contested among twelve clubs from the VFL, SANFL and WANFL invited based on their finishing positions from the previous year. The event was mostly played on Tuesday nights, with night games at [[Norwood Oval]] in Adelaide, and all games were televised live in colour on [[Nine Network|Channel 9]], which opened up unprecedented revenue streams from television rights and sponsorship opportunities for the sport.<ref name="nightseries">{{cite news|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publication-place=Canberra, ACT|title=First NFL Cup match next month|date=15 April 1976|page=18|author=Barry Rollings}}</ref> The NFL began plans to expand its Night Series to incorporate more teams from the VFL, SANFL and WAFL, as well as state representative teams from other states.

In November 1976, the VFL announced that it was withdrawing from the NFL's competition, having arranged more substantial television and sponsorship deals for its own Night Series for 1977 to be based in Melbourne and feature only the VFL clubs. Light towers were erected at VFL Park specifically for the event.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publication-place=Canberra, ACT|title=Rules pools plan|date=16 November 1976|page=18|author=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publication-place=Canberra, ACT|title=VFL criticised|date=12 November 1976|page=22|author=}}</ref> The VFL established a [[proprietary limited company]] called Australian Football Championships Pty Ltd in 1978 to run the Night Series, and offered shareholdings to the other state leagues in an attempt to lure other states into the competition.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publication-place=Canberra, ACT|title=$2m night-football plan|date=28 June 1978|page=36|author=}}</ref>

For the three years from 1977 until 1979, the NFL and AFC competitions were run separately as rival Night Series. In 1978, the [[Tasmania Australian rules football team|Tasmanain representative team]] competed in both the NFL and AFC series, but all SANFL and WAFL clubs and the minor states teams remained in the NFL Night Series. In 1979, the WAFL clubs and the New South Wales and A.C.T. representative teams defected from the NFL Night Series and joined the AFC Night Series, leaving the NFL Night Series mostly composed of SANFL teams. The NFL Night Series was not revived in 1980, and the SANFL clubs joined the AFC Night Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballget.net/nfl---1979-escort-cup.html|author=David Eastman|title=1979 NFL Escort Cup|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> Although the NFL itself continued to exist as an administrative body into the early 1990s, the power gained by the VFL as a result of its Night Series take over was one of the first significant steps in its spread interstate and ultimately its take-over (as the Australian Football League) of administrative control of all football in Australia.<ref>{{citation|author=John Devaney|page=252|title=Clubs of the South Australian National Football League|date=2014|publisher=Full Points Publication|publication-place=Great Britain}}</ref>

In 1980 and 1981, the first years after the NFL Night Series had ended, the AFC Night Series competition was at its largest, with all VFL, WAFL and SANFL clubs plus the four minor states teams (selected under residential qualification rather than [[state of origin]] qualification) competing for a total of 34 teams. The size of the competition was reduced from 1982, and thereafter only the top two or three teams from the SANFL and WAFL and the winner of the minor states' annual carnival were invited.

In 1987, the Night Series reverted to only the VFL teams. The competition was pushed earlier into the year, with the final played on 28 April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/seasons/season/afl/138/national%2Bpanasonic%2Bcup/11/12/1987/basic|title=National Panasonic Cup|accessdate=28 December 2015|publisher=AustralianFootball.com}}</ref> The following season, the competition did not overlap with the day premiership season at all, and became entirely a [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|pre-season competition]]. The Night Series is generally considered to be of equivalent importance as the pre-season competition and the [[VFL Night Series]] (1956–1971), and records relating to the three competitions are often combined.

With the number of players recruited from country leagues increasing, the wealthier VFL clubs were gaining an advantage that metropolitan [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] and the Coulter law (salary cap) restricting player payments had prevented in the past. Country zoning was introduced in the late 1960s, and whilst it pushed Essendon and Geelong from the top of the ladder, it created severe inequality during the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1972 and 1987, only six of the league's twelve clubs – Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Hawthorn, North Melbourne and Richmond – played in Grand Finals.

===1982-1989: Professionalism, Bankruptcy and Expansion===

[[File:Sydney80s.png|thumb|200px|left|For the [[1982 VFL season]] South Melbourne Football Club became the first VFL club to relocate and the competitions first club based outside Victoria. The club was officially renamed the [[Sydney Swans]] in 1983. ]]

The 1980s was a period of significant structural change in Australian football around the country. The VFL was the most popular and dominant of the state leagues around the country in terms of overall attendance, interest, and money, and began to look towards expanding its influence directly into other states. The VFL and its top clubs were asserting their financial power to recruit top players from interstate. As a result of this, rising cost pressures were driving some of Victoria's weaker clubs into dire financial situations. South Melbourne became the first VFL club to relocate interstate with the club moving to Sydney to become the Sydney Swans in 1982. Under the private ownership of wealthy [[Dr Geoffrey Edelsten]] during the mid-1980s Sydney became a successful team on-field.

Throughout the 1980's approaches were made by SANFL and WAFL clubs to enter the VFL. Of particular note were approaches by the [[East Perth Royals]] in 1980,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article125628291 |title=AUSTRALIAN FOOTBAll |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=55, |issue=16,459 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=18 October 1980 |accessdate=4 May 2016 |page=48 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> the [[Norwood Redlegs]] in 1986<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Phoenix Rises|last=Oakley|first=Ross|publisher=Slattery Media Group|year=2014|isbn=9780987420596|location=Melbourne|pages=244}}</ref> and 1988,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Phoenix Rises|last=Oakley|first=Ross|publisher=Slattery Media Group|year=2014|isbn=9780987420596|location=Melbourne|pages=131}}</ref> and an [[East Fremantle Football Club|East]]-[[South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle]] merger proposal in 1987.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|author=Peter Simunovich|page=78|date=24 July 1987|title=Top WAFL clubs eye VFL spot}}</ref> None of these attempts were successful despite Norwood trying again in 1990 and 1994.

In 1986, the [[West Australian Football League]] and [[AFL Queensland|Queensland Australian Football League]] were awarded licences to join the VFL as expansion teams, leading to the establishment of the [[West Coast Eagles]] and [[Brisbane Bears]] who both joined the league in 1987. These [[expansion team]] licences were awarded on payment of multimillion-dollar fees which were not required of the existing VFL clubs.  In 1989 financial troubles nearly forced [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] and [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] to merge but a fundraising event from Footscray supporters stopped the proposed merger at the eleventh hour.

The 1980s first saw new regular timeslots for VFL matches. VFL matches had previously been played on Saturday afternoons but Sydney began playing its home matches on Sunday afternoons and North Melbourne pioneered playing matches on Friday night. These have since become regular timeslots for all teams.

The first [[AFL Draft|National Draft]] was introduced in 1986 and a [[salary cap]] was introduced in 1987.

===1990-present: Australian Football League===
[[File:The teams line up for the national anthem, 2005 AFL Grand Final.jpg|right|thumb|333x333px|The players from the [[West Coast Eagles]] of Western Australia and the [[Sydney Swans]] of New South Wales lining up for the national anthem at the [[2005 AFL Grand Final]].]]

The league was officially renamed the Australian Football League in 1990 to reflect the new national perspective;<ref name="Football Ltd">{{cite book|last=Linnell|first=Garry|title=Football Ltd|publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia|location=Sydney|year=1995|isbn=0-330-35665-8|page=297}}</ref> the [[Victorian Football Association|VFA]] later took over the [[Victorian Football League]] name in 1996. Functionally, the AFL gave up control over its Victorian-based [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|minor grades]] at the end of 1991 – clubs continued to field reserves teams in the independent [[Victorian State Football League]].

In 1990, the SANFL's most successful club, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], made a bid for an AFL licence. In response, the SANFL established a composite South Australian team called the [[Adelaide Crows]], which was awarded the licence and joined the league in 1991 as the fourth interstate club. The same year saw the West Coast Eagles become the first interstate club to reach the Grand Final, losing to Hawthorn. The Eagles would then win the premiership in 1992 and 1994. In 1994, the [[Fremantle Football Club]] was formed in Western Australia, and joined the AFL in 1995, becoming the fifth interstate club.

In 1996 several Victorian clubs were in severe financial difficulties, most notably Fitzroy and Hawthorn. Hawthorn proposed to merge with Melbourne to form the [[Melbourne Hawks]] but the merger ultimately fell through and both teams continued as separate entities. Fitzroy, however, was too weak to continue by itself. The club nearly merged with North Melbourne to form the [[Fitzroy-North Melbourne Kangaroos Football Club|Fitzroy-North Melbourne Kangaroos]] but, after the other clubs voted against it, the club merged with Brisbane to become the [[Brisbane Lions]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abr.business.gov.au/(z2yvqy2wuqpjll2idwocz5vz)/search.aspx?StartSearch=True&SearchText=43054263473|title=ABN lookup|publisher=Aust Govt|date=8 April 2007}}</ref> Fitzroy played its last match at the end of 1996. With the Brisbane-Fitzroy merger, Port Adelaide was awarded an AFL licence and joined the league in 1997.

Through the 1990s there was a significant trend of Melbourne-based teams abandoning the use of their small (20,000–30,000 capacity) suburban venues for home matches in favour of the larger MCG and Waverley Park. The 1990s saw the last matches played at [[Windy Hill, Essendon|Windy Hill]] (Essendon), [[Moorabbin Oval]] (St Kilda), [[Whitten Oval|Western Oval]] (Footscray) and [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]] (Collingwood) and saw [[Visy Park|Princes Park]] abandoned by its long-term co-tenant Hawthorn. The transition to the use of only two venues in Melbourne was ultimately completed in 2005 when Carlton abandoned the use of Princes Park. In 1999, the league sold [[Waverley Park]] stadium and used the funds in a joint venture to begin construction of a brand-new stadium situated at Melbourne's [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]]. Representative state football came to an end, with the last [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of origin|State of Origin]] match held in 1999.

In the late 2000s, the AFL looked to establish a permanent presence on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], which was fast-developing as a major population centre. North Melbourne, which was in financial difficulty and had played a few home games on the Gold Coast in previous years, was offered significant subsidies to relocate to the Gold Coast but declined. The AFL then began work to establish a club on the Gold Coast as a new expansion team. The [[Gold Coast Suns]] were established and joined the AFL in 2011 as the 17th team. The [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]], based in both Western Sydney and Canberra, were then established and entered the league as the 18th team in 2012. Early in 2008, a meeting held by the AFL discussed having two new teams enter the AFL competition.<ref>Wilson, Caroline; [http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/its-war-afl-raids-league-heartland/2008/02/15/1202760609307.html Raid on home turf of league]; Realfooty.com.au; 16 February 2008</ref> In March 2008, the AFL won the support of the league's 16 club presidents to establish sides on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and in Western Sydney; both teams would enter the competition in 2011 and 2012 respectively. In 2010, a licence was granted to the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]], a second Sydney-based team based at Homebush in Western Sydney.  In 2011 new club, the [[Gold Coast Suns]] entered the league<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/07/23/241201_gold-coast-afl.html|title=AFL|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> having been granted a licence in 2009. In 2012 the Greater Western Sydney Giants joined the league and played their first season finishing in last place. On 25 April 2013 the [[Westpac Stadium]] in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] hosted the first ever Australian Football League game played for premiership points outside of [[Australia]]. The night game between {{AFL Stk}} and {{AFL Syd}} was played in front of a crowd of 22,183 on [[Anzac Day]] to honour the [[Anzac]] bond between the two countries.<ref name=stk-rp>{{cite web|last=Holmesby|first=Luke|title=Riewoldt proud to be part of historic occasion|url=http://www.saints.com.au/news/2013-04-24/riewoldt-proud-to-be-part-of-historic-occasion|work=Official website|publisher={{AFL Stk}}|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=24 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=age-aflkiwi>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Caroline|title=We want AFL team: Kiwis|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/we-want-afl-team-kiwis-20130425-2ihk7.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=26 April 2013|location=Melbourne}}</ref>

The AFL operates on a single table system, with no divisions, conferences nor promotion and relegation from other leagues.

The league was founded as the '''Victorian Football League''' (VFL) in [[1897 VFL season|1897]], consisting of eight teams only based in the Australian [[States and territories of Australia|state]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Over the next century, a series of expansions, a relocation, a merger and a club withdrawal saw the leagues teams expand to the 18 teams there are today.

The current 18 teams are based across 5 states of Australia. The majority (10) still remain in Victoria, including nine teams located in the [[Melbourne]] metropolitan area. The states of New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia have two teams each. In 1990 the national nature of the competition resulted in the  name change to the Australian Football League. [[Tasmania]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], and [[Northern Territory]] are the only states or mainland territories not to have AFL clubs although games are regularly played in each of those areas.

===Former clubs===
Since the Australian Football League commenced in 1897 as the Victorian Football League, only one club has left the competition, the [[Melbourne University Football Club]]. It last competed in 1914 and withdrew because, as a strictly amateur club, it became unable to remain competitive in a time when player payments were becoming common;<ref name="The University Team"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> the club still competes to this day in the [[Victorian Amateur Football Association]] (VAFA). Two other clubs, the [[Fitzroy Football Club]] (Fitzroy Lions) and the [[Brisbane Bears]], merged in 1996 to form the [[Brisbane Lions]].  However, after a coming out of financial administration in 1998, Fitzroy resumed its playing operations in 2009 and currently competes in the VAFA.

==Players==
{{See also|List of current AFL team squads|Category:VFL/AFL players}}
AFL players are drawn from a number of sources; however, most players enter the league through the [[AFL draft]], held at the end of each season. A small number of players have converted from other sports, or been recruited internationally. Prior to the nationalisation of the competition, a [[Zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning system]] was in place. At the end of the season, the best 22 players and coach from across the competition are selected in the [[All-Australian team]]. [[File:Ruckwork.jpg|thumb|300px|Close up of ruckwork from a Melbourne vs. Western Bulldogs game at Docklands Stadium in Melbourne with the roof open]]
The AFL has tight controls over the player lists of each club.  Currently, apart from the recently added expansion clubs who have some additional players, each team can have a senior list of 38 to 40 players plus 4 to 6 [[Rookie list|rookie players]], to a total of 44 players<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richmondfc.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/6301/newsid/152285/default.aspx|title=New Tigers unveiled today – Official AFL Website of the Richmond Football Club|date=11 December 2012|publisher=Richmond Football Club|accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> (following a reduction by two of the number of rookies in 2012) and up to three development rookies (international, alternate talent or New South Wales scholarship players).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mm.afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/MemoRookiesAug14.pdf|title=Rookie Rule Amendments|last=Anderson|first=Adrian|date=14 August 2012|publisher=AFL|page=3|accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref>  Changes to playing lists are permitted only in the off-season: clubs can trade players during a "[[AFL trade week|trade period]]" which follows each season and recruit new players through the three [[AFL draft]]s, the national draft, the [[AFL pre-season draft|pre-season draft]] and the rookie draft, which take place after the trade period.

A [[salary cap]] (known as the Total Player Payments or TPP) is also in place as part of the league's equalisation policy; this is A$9,130,000 for the 2013 season with a salary floor of $8,673,500 except for the [[Gold Coast Suns|Gold Coast]], whose salary cap will be A$9,630,000 with a salary floor of $9,171,500, and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|Greater Western Sydney]], whose salary cap is $9,987,000 with a floor of $9,530,500. As part of the AFL's enhanced equalisation policies, in 2014 the league announced an increase of the TPP for the '''2015''' and '''2016''' seasons. TPP increases an additional $150,000 per club in 2015 above previously contracted amounts, increasing from $9.92m to $10.07m in 2015 and $10.22m to $10.37m in 2016.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-06-04/equalisation-changes-explained The AFL's equalisation changes explained] ({{Wayback |df=yes|date=20140605081440 |url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-06-04/equalisation-changes-explained }})</ref>

The salary cap was set at A$1.25 million for 1987–1989 as per VFL agreement, with the salary floor set at 90% of the cap or $1.125 million; the salary floor was increased to 92.5% of the cap in 2001, and 95% of the cap for 2013 due to increased revenues. Both the salary cap and salary floor has increased substantially since the competition was rebranded as the AFL in 1990.

Salaries of draft selections are fixed for two years. Salaries for senior players are not normally released to the public, though the average AFL player salary at the conclusion of the 2012 season was $251,559<ref name="afl.com.au">[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-01-25/millionaires-club-explodes]– "Millionaires' club explodes," www.afl.com.au; retrieved 20 December 2013.</ref> and the top few players can expect to earn up to and above $1,000,000 a year.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,21424440-23211,00.html?from=news Massive pay hike]</ref> Upon successfully trading to the [[Sydney Swans]] in 2013, marquee player [[Lance Franklin]] signed a 9-year contract with the club, reportedly worth over $10 million and resulting in subsequent payments of $1.8 million annually in consecutive seasons.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl/afl-clears-buddys-10m-move/story-fnca0u4y-1226735072406 | work=The Australian | title=AFL clears Buddy Franklin's $10m move | date=9 October 2013}}</ref> The Total Player Earnings (TPE) – or total amount of revenue spent on reimbursement of AFL listed players – at the conclusion of the 2012 season was $173.7 million, up by 13 per cent from $153.7 million in 2011.<ref name="afl.com.au"/>

The breaches of the salary cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the AFL are: exceeding the TPP; falling below the salary floor; not informing the AFL of payments; late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents; or engaging in draft tampering. Penalties include fines of up to triple the amount involved ($10,000 for each document late or incorrect lodged or lost), forfeiture of draft picks and/or deduction of premiership points. The most significant breach of the salary cap was that of the [[Carlton Football Club salary cap breach|Carlton Football Club in the early 2000s]].

==Season structure==

===Pre-season===
{{Main|Australian Football League pre-season competition}}
From 1988 until 2013, the AFL ran a pre-season competition that finished prior to the commencement of the premiership season, which served as both warm-up matches for the season and as a stand-alone competition. It was mostly contested as a four-week [[knock out tournament]], but the format changed after the expansion of the league beyond sixteen clubs in 2011. The competition has frequently been used to trial rule changes. In 2014, the competition format was abandoned, and practice matches are now played under the sponsored name '''NAB Challenge'''. This consists of all 18 clubs playing three matches each, which are played one or two games per day, for most days in late February and early March.

===Premiership season===
{{See also|2016 AFL season}}
The AFL home-and-away season at present lasts for 23 rounds, starting in late March and ending in early September. As of the [[2013 AFL season]], each team plays 22 matches, with one bye. Teams receive four premiership points for a win and two premiership points for a draw. Ladder finishing positions are based on the number of premiership points won, and "percentage" (calculated as the ratio of points scored to points conceded throughout the season) is used as a tie-breaker when teams finish with equal premiership points. At the end of the home-and-away season, the [[McClelland Trophy]] is awarded to the [[minor premiers]]. Also, in somewhat antiquated fashion, the team that comes bottom of the ladder is rewarded with the number one draft pick for the following season. This has brought about the term "tanking", where teams will deliberately lose matches to gain a competitive advantage in the following season.
[[File:AFL WCE VS COLLINGWOOD.JPG|thumbnail|2014 AFL premiership West Coast Eagles vs Collingwood match at [[Subiaco Oval]]]]

====Themed rounds and special matches====
Some rounds of the season are named as themed rounds, such as Rivalry Round (in which traditional rivals are matched up against each other), Women's Round and [[AFL Heritage Round|Heritage Round]] (where teams play in [[Throwback uniform|old style guernseys]]). Some matches are also themed for special events. For example, each year Collingwood play Essendon in the annual [[The Anzac Day clash|ANZAC Day match]] at the MCG and the game will typically sell out regardless of the positions of the two teams on the ladder due to their strong rivalry and huge followings. Another annual match is the Queen's Birthday game between Melbourne and Collingwood. {{as of|2006}}, Richmond and Essendon play in the ''[[Dreamtime at the 'G]]'' match. There are separate trophies for the matches between several clubs and former rivalries such as the Lake Trophy between St Kilda and the Sydney Swans.

===Finals series===
{{See also|List of Australian Football League premiers}}

The top eight teams at the end of the AFL Premiership season compete in a four-week [[AFL finals system|finals series]] throughout September, culminating in a [[AFL Grand Final|grand final]] to determine the premiers. The grand final is traditionally played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on the afternoon of the last Saturday in September.

The winning team receives a silver premiership cup and a navy blue premiership flag with the exception of 1996 where a gold premiership cup was produced in celebration of the centenary season – a new one of each is manufactured each year. The flag has been presented since the league began and is traditionally unfurled at the team's first home game of the following season. The trophy was first introduced in 1959 and is manufactured annually by Cash's International at their metalworks in [[Frankston, Victoria]].<ref>[http://www.footy.com.au/dags/FAQ2v1-5.html link] Australian Football League Frequently Asked Questions</ref> Additionally, each player in the grand final-winning team receives a premiership medallion.

==Awards==
The following major individual awards and accolades are presented each season:

* [[Brownlow Medal]] – to the [[best and fairest|fairest and best]] player in the league, voted by the umpires
* [[Coleman Medal]] – to the player who kicks the most [[Goal (Australian rules football)|goals]] during the home-and-away season
* [[All-Australian team]] – a squad of 22 players deemed the best in their positions, voted by an AFL-appointed committee
* [[AFL Rising Star|Rising Star Award]] – to the fairest and best young player (under the age of 21 and with less than ten games' experience at the beginning of the year), voted by the All-Australian committee
* [[Norm Smith Medal]] – the best player on the ground in the Grand Final, voted by a committee
* [[Jock McHale Medal]] – the coach of the premiership-winning team
* [[Mark of the Year]] – to the player who takes the best or most spectacular [[mark (Australian rules football)|mark]] during the season
* [[Goal of the Year (Australia)|Goal of the Year]] – to the player who kicks the best or most spectacular goal during the season
* [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]] – to the best player in the league, voted by the players through the [[AFL Players' Association]]

Other independent [[best and fairest]] awards are presented by different football and media organisations.

==Representative football==

===State football===
{{Further|Interstate matches in Australian rules football}}
Since 1999 there has been no official state representation for AFL players, despite the concept being well supported among fans and calls to re-introduce a [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of origin|State of Origin]] series.<ref>Robertson, Doug; [http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21284443-5012456,00.html Cornes calls for Origin return]; Adelaide Now; 25 February 2007</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/more-news/rodney-eade-supports-return-of-state-of-origin/story-e6frf9jf-1226351811775 |title=Rodney Eade supports return of State of Origin|first=Jon |last=Anderson |work=[[Herald Sun]]|date=10 May 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/67YhLbdYl|archivedate=10 May 2012}}</ref>

====History of the VFL/AFL's involvement====
VFL players first represented the Victoria representative team in 1897 regardless of their state of origin.

Being the dominant league drawing many of the country's best players, the [[Victoria Australian rules football team]] (nicknamed the "Big V" and composed mostly of VFL players) dominated interstate matches until the introduction of State of Origin selection criteria by the [[Australian National Football Council|Australian Football Council]] in 1977, after which Victoria's results with the other main Australian football states became more even.

The AFL Commission assumed control of interstate football in 1993 and co-ordinated an annual State of Origin series typically held during a mid-season bye round. However, after the 1999 series, the AFL declared the concept of interstate football "on hold" citing club's unwillingness to release star players and a lack of public interest and shifted its focus of representative football to the International Rules Series where it draws a greater television revenue.

The last time AFL players played formal interstate football was in the 1999 State of Origin Series when Victoria inflicted a massive defeat on South Australia in wet conditions in front of a crowd of 26,063. Just 10 years earlier, the same match with a plethora of star players attracted a crowd of 91,960.

A once-off representative match, known as the [[AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match]] was played in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport. The match was played between a team of players of Victorian origin and a team of players of interstate origin (the "[[Dream Team Australian rules football team|Dream Team]]")

Some past AFL players participate and help promote the [[E. J. Whitten Legends Game]], however this event is not affiliated with or promoted by the AFL.

===International Rules Series===
{{See also|International rules football}}
The [[International Rules Series]] is an annual competition played twice every three years between AFL listed players from [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]] and [[Gaelic football]]ers from [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]]. The series is organised under the auspices of the AFL and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]]. The game itself is a [[hybrid sport]], consisting of rules from both Australian football and Gaelic football. The series provides the only outlet for AFL players to represent their nation.

==Administration==
{{Main|AFL Commission}}
{{See also|List of VFL/AFL presidents}}
The [[AFL Commission]] is responsible for the administration of the AFL. It was established in December 1985, and then granted almost unilateral administrative control over the league in 1993,<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|pages=37–38|author1=Stephen Linnell|author2=Patrick Smithers|date=20 July 1993|title=United club stand forces AFL to back down on expulsion power}}</ref> after the club parochialism and self-interest which came with the traditional club delegate based administrative structure threatened to undermine the competition.

The Commission's chairman is [[Mike Fitzpatrick (footballer)|Mike Fitzpatrick]], a former Subiaco and Carlton player, and the Chief Executive is [[Gillon McLachlan]], who officially took over from [[Andrew Demetriou]] on 4 June 2014.

The Commission's composition remains almost exclusively Victorian based with one exception, [[Bob Hammond]] from South Australia.

In addition to administering the national competition, the AFL is heavily involved in promoting and developing the sport in Australia. It provides funds for local leagues and in conjunction with local clubs, administers the [[Auskick]] program for young boys and girls.

The AFL also plays a leading role in developing the game outside Australia, with projects to develop the game at junior level in other countries (e.g. South Africa) and by supporting affiliated competitions around the world (See [[Australian football around the world]]).

The players of the AFL are represented by the [[AFL Players Association]], the coaches are represented by the [[AFL Coaches Association]], the umpires are represented by the [[AFL Umpires Association]], and the related media employees are represented by the [[Australian Football Media Association]].

===Television===

====Australian television====
{{see also|List of Australian Football League television shows}}
AFL matches are currently broadcast in Australia by the free-to-air [[Seven Network]], subscription television provider [[Foxtel]], and digital content provider [[Telstra]]. The 5-year deal, announced in April 2011, covers the 2012-2016 (inclusive) seasons. Telstra won the rights to broadcast one live match per week via IP Television and on its Telstra Mobile service. The deal was confirmed when the Seven Network, Foxtel and Telstra agreed to pay A$1.253 billion to the Australian Football League to broadcast every match of every round and all of the Finals Series across their platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/112560/default.aspx |title=AFL's $1.25 billion broadcast deal |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> As part of the agreement, [[Austar]] broadcasts Foxtel`s AFL coverage in the regional areas of Australia that are not part of Foxtel`s service area. Regional free-to-air broadcasters associated with the Seven Network – [[Prime7]], [[GWN7]], [[Seven Queensland]], [[Southern Cross Television]] and [[WIN Television]] – all show Seven's coverage in their respective areas.

The Seven Network broadcasts four games from every round of the regular premiership season, as well as the AFL Finals Series and the [[AFL Grand Final]]. Foxtel broadcasts every match from every round, including simulcasts of all Seven Network games except for the Grand Final (which Seven shows exclusively live). Coverage is also available via Foxtel`s IP television service (Foxtel on T-Box).

====Telecast history====

The 1957 VFL season was the first broadcast after the commencement of television in Australia (introduced in 1956 to coincide with the Melbourne Olympic Games). During the late 1950s and 1960s, all Melbourne stations ([[ABV2]], [[HSV7]], [[GTV9]] and, after it commenced in 1965, [[ATV10|ATV0/ATV10]]) broadcast some games. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the VFL was concerned that direct telecasts may affect attendances and stations were only permitted to telecast a delayed replay of the last quarter of games. In the 1980s, the [[Seven Network]] was given exclusive rights to VFL/AFL games. The only year Seven did not telecast games was 1987, when the rights were bought by Broadcom, which on-sold the rights to the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC). The exclusive rights were won back by Seven in 1988.

With the launch of subscription television in Australia, AFL match coverage commenced on cable television. [[Optus Vision]] bid for and won exclusive pay TV rights from 1996–2001, screening coverage on its own 24-hour AFL channel, branded ''Sports AFL'' in Brisbane Sydney and Melbourne (where available). The Sports AFL channel was later closed due to financial issues and relaunched in March 1999 as [[C7 Sport]] by the [[Seven Network]] with AFL match coverage also transferred to the new channel. C7 Sport became available in regional areas not in the [[Foxtel]] or [[Optus Vision]] licence area via [[Austar]] soon after the re-launch. The AFL coverage was not available through Foxtel at this time as the Seven Network and Foxtel disagreed on the cost of carrying the C7 channel. These issues regarding C7 and AFL broadcsting rights evolved into a court case between not just the Seven Network and [[News Limited]], but Seven against the owners of the Nine Network and Network Ten in the years that followed.

In late 2000, the Seven Network's main rivals, the [[Kerry Packer]] led [[Nine Network]], [[Network Ten]] and pay-TV's [[Foxtel]] set up a consortium which bid $500 million for the right to broadcast the [[2002 AFL season|2002]]–[[2006 AFL season|2006]] seasons inclusive. Seven had purchased a guaranteed right to make the last bid in 1995,<ref name="SevenFox">Day, Mark (1 February 2007); [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21149551-7582,00.html Pay TV strikes a deal on AFL]; The Australian</ref> but decided not to outbid their rivals.<ref>Reynolds, Fiona (25 January 2001); [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s238069.htm Seven gives up AFL rights]; PM (ABC radio)</ref> The games were split between the networks, with Nine screening [[Friday Night Football (Australia)|Friday Night Football]] and two matches on Sunday, Ten screened a Saturday afternoon and a Saturday night match, with the remaining four matches shown on Foxtel. Foxtel set up its own version of a dedicated AFL-only channel, the [[Fox Footy Channel]], which showed every game on replay during the week as well as many news, [[Talk radio|talkback]] and general interest shows related to Australian rules football.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/08/21/1029114135689.html Live and sweaty]; 22 August 2002</ref>

When the rights were offered again in January 2006 for the [[2007 AFL season|2007]] to 2011 seasons, Seven formed an alliance with Ten and used its guaranteed last bid rights to match Nine's offer of $780 million to win back the broadcast rights in what was the biggest sport telecasting deal in Australian history at the time. After lengthy negotiations, Foxtel agreed to be a broadcast partner and now showed four live matches each week, although no longer on a dedicated AFL channel.<ref name="SevenFox"/> Seven took back the Friday night match and only one game on Sunday, while Ten retained showing two matches on Saturdays. Foxtel showed two games on Saturday and two on Sunday, including a late afternoon or twilight game.<ref>Barrett, Damian (20 January 2007); [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21087638-11088,00.html Foxtel in footy twilight zone]; Herald Sun</ref>

====International broadcast partners====
Historically AFL broadcasts in other countries have varied.

In the 1980s, VFL matches were shown in the United States on [[ESPN]] for some time. In the early 1990s, [[Prime Network]], an American regional sports network unrelated to the [[Prime7|Australian regional television network]], aired Seven's weekly highlight show as well as the Grand Final.  Some other English speaking countries have shown the game, however it has been since 2008 that channels in other countries began televising matches.  From 1998 to 2006 games were broadcast in the United States by the [[Fox Soccer|Fox Sports World]] network.<ref>[http://www.backpagelead.com.au/afl/2585-afl-news-the-day-i-bought-the-afl-rights- The day I bought the AFL TV rights]</ref>

In 2007, after the record domestic television rights deal, the AFL secured an additional bonus: greater international television rights and increase exposure to overseas markets, including a five-year deal with [[Setanta Sports]] and new deals with other overseas [[pay-TV]] networks.  The deal ended early in 2009 when Setanta stopped broadcasting into Great Britain.  ESPN again took up the contract.<ref>[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/2009080100090050 ESPN picks up AFL in UK and Ireland]</ref>

The following countries are ranked by the approximate extent of their current television coverage (and whether it is free to air):

===Global===
The AFL has stated that it wishes to showcase the footballing code to other countries such as [[India]], [[China]] and [[South Africa]] so as to create a global following thus creating more exposure for its sponsors in the increasing [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n markets.<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/afl-hopes-to-net-china/story-e6frf9jf-1225857803219 AFL hopes to net China | Herald Sun]</ref> On 17 October 2010, AFL clubs [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne Demons]] and [[Brisbane Lions]] played an exhibition game in front of almost 10,000 people at the [[Jiangwan Stadium|Riverside Sports Center]] in [[Shanghai]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  This was the first professional AFL game to be played in [[China]].

The AFL has garnered increased interest in Ireland due to the introduction of the International Rules series played between an AFL picked All Australian Team and Ireland.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This paved the way for young Irish footballers to be rostered to AFL teams mainly due to the fact that salaries in the AFL are much larger than that of Gaelic Football although most Irish players fail to make the grade into 1st team football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/10/22/the-afl-is-tempting-irelands-true-promise/|title=The AFL is tempting Ireland’s true promise|date=22 October 2009|work=The Roar|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>  This also paved the way for extended news coverage and increased broadcasting in the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Radio===
The first broadcast of a VFL game was by [[Radio National|3AR]] in 1923, the year that broadcasting officially commenced in Australia. The first commentator was [[Wallace Shallard|Wallace (Jumbo) Shallard]], a former Geelong player who went on to have a long and respected career in print and broadcast media. The VFL/AFL has been broadcast every year since then by the ABC and (since 1927) by various commercial stations. The saturation period was the early 1960s when seven of the eight extant radio stations ([[Radio National|3AR]], [[3UZ]], [[3TTT|3DB]], [[3KZ]], [[3AW]], [[3XY]] and [[3AK]]) broadcast VFL games each week, as well as broadcasts of Geelong games by local station [[K-Rock (Australia)|3GL]]. (At this time, the only alternative that radio listeners had to listening to the football on a Saturday afternoon were the classical music and fine arts programs that were broadcast by [[3LO]]).

Currently, the official radio broadcast partners of the AFL are:
* [[Triple M]] Melbourne
* [[K-Rock (Australia)|K-Rock]] Geelong
* [[3AW]] Melbourne
* [[FIVEaa]] Adelaide
* [[6PR]] Perth
* [[SEN 1116]] Melbourne
* [[4AAA|98.9FM]] Brisbane
* Triple M Sydney (Broadcasts only Swans and Giants matches)
* Triple M Brisbane (Broadcasts only Lions matches)
* Triple M Adelaide
* [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] – ([[ABC Radio Grandstand|ABC Grandstand]]) broadcasts matches across Australia on the [[ABC Local Radio]] network and via the [[ABC News Radio]] network to selected major cities in NSW\QLD\ACT.

===Internet===

The official internet/mobile broadcast partner of the AFL is [[BigPond|Bigpond]], part of [[Telstra]]. The AFL also provides exclusive broadband content including streaming video for international fans via its website. Bigpond also hosts the official websites of all the 17 AFL clubs excluding Essendon.

The service is also provided to international subscribers. Delayed video is available 12 hours or more after the game.

However, the website is frequently derided by users for its convoluted [[information architecture]] and [[Software bloat|bloated]] presentation.<ref>[http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=688538 New AFL Website] – Whirlpool forums.</ref><ref>[http://www.bigfooty.com/forum/showthread.php?t=429368&highlight=website New AFL website – how bad is it?] – BigFooty</ref>

Since 2012, [[Telstra]] has broadcast live matches over its [[Telstra#Mobile networks|Next G]] mobile network for a pay-per-view or season fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eftm.com.au/2012/02/watch-every-afl-game-this-season-on-your-telstra-mobile-for-50-3792 |title=Watch every AFL game this season on your Telstra mobile for $50 |publisher= www.eftm.com.au |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}</ref>

==Corporate relations==

===Sponsorship===
The following are the official naming sponsors of the VFL/AFL competition:
* [[Carlton & United Breweries]] (1980–81, 86, 89–94, 2001–03)
* [[Holden]] (1982–83)
* [[Nissan]] (1984–85)
* Sportsplay (1987)
* [[Elders Limited|Elder's IXL]] (1988)
* [[Coca-Cola]] (1995–2001)
* [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] (2004–present)

¹<span style="font-size:87%;">Note: In 2001 CUB and Coca-Cola were joint sponsors</span>

The official print broadcast partner of the AFL is [[News Limited]].
The [[AFL Record]] is a match-day magazine published by the AFL and is read by around 225,000 people each week.

===Membership===
The AFL sells memberships that entitle subscribers to reserve seats for matches at [[Docklands Stadium]] and [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in Melbourne. AFL members also receive priority access to finals.  Two levels of memberships are now offered, silver and full, with the main difference being that only full members have guaranteed access to Preliminary and [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aflmembership.com.au/join/afl-silver-membership-packages/|title=Home - Australian Football League|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

===Merchandising===
The AFL runs a chain of stores that sell merchandise from all clubs. Merchandise is also available from other retailers.

====AFL World====
A modern museum called the Hall of Fame and Sensation opened in Melbourne in 2003 to celebrate the culture of the AFL and to provide a venue for the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]]. The museum, a licensed offshoot of the AFL, was originally touted for the MCG, but the Hall of Fame failed to get support from the Melbourne Cricket Club. The new QV shopping centre on Swanston Street was then chosen as the location. However, controversy followed the appointment of an administrator as the museum began running at a loss. Many blamed high entry prices, which were subsequently reduced, and the museum remains open to the public. In early 2006 the name was changed to AFL World. It features various honour boards and memorabilia as well as a range of innovative interactive displays designed to immerse visitors in the experience of elite Aussie Rules. It was closed down in 2008.

====Gambling====
The AFL is the subject of footy tipping and betting competitions around Australia run by individuals, syndicates, workplaces and professional [[bookmaker]]s. In recent years national website based tipping competitions have started to replace the traditional, but more labour-intensive, office or pub run competitions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Fantasy football (Australian rules football)|Fantasy football]] competitions based on actual player statistics (number of kicks, marks, goals etc.) are also very popular on websites and in newspapers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}
