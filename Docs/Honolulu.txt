Evidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original [[Polynesia]]n migrants to the [[archipelago]] comes from oral histories and artifacts. These indicate that there was a settlement where Honolulu now stands in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellohonolulu.com/history.cfm |title=Honolulu History – |publisher=Hellohonolulu.com |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref> However, after [[Kamehameha I]] conquered [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] in the [[Battle of Nu'uanu|Battle of Nu{{okina}}uanu]] at [[Nuuanu Pali|Nu{{okina}}uanu Pali]], he moved his royal court from the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] to [[Waikiki|Waikīkī]] in 1804. His court relocated in 1809 to what is now [[downtown Honolulu]].  The capital was moved back to [[Kailua-Kona]] in 1812.

In 1794, Captain [[William Brown (Royal Navy officer)|William Brown]] of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now Honolulu Harbor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/United-States/Hawaii-Honolulu-History-c2089416.html |title=Honolulu History, Hawaii |publisher=Travelgrove.com |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref> More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia.

In 1845, [[Kamehameha III]] moved the permanent capital of the [[Hawaiian Kingdom]] from [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]] on [[Maui]] to Honolulu. He and the kings that followed him transformed Honolulu into a modern capital,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108523.html |title=About Infoplease, Part of Family Education Network |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=December 7, 1941 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref> erecting buildings such as [[Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew, Honolulu|St. Andrew's Cathedral]], [[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]], and [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali{{okina}}iōlani Hale]]. At the same time, Honolulu became the center of commerce in the islands, with descendants of American missionaries establishing major businesses in downtown Honolulu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.honolulu.gov/cchnl.htm#city |title=About the City, Official Web Site for The City and County of Honolulu |publisher=.honolulu.gov |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

Despite the turbulent history of the late 19th century and early 20th century, such as the [[overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy]] in 1893, Hawai{{okina}}i's [[Territory of Hawaii|subsequent annexation by the United States]] in 1898, followed by a [[Chinatown, Honolulu#Great Honolulu Chinatown Fire of 1900|large fire]] in 1900, and the [[Japan]]ese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, Honolulu remained the capital, largest city, and main airport and seaport of the Hawaiian Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honolulu-city.com/honolulu-history.htm |title=Honolulu History |publisher=Honolulu-city.com |date=December 7, 1941 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

An economic and tourism boom following statehood brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu and Hawai{{okina}}i. Modern air travel brings, {{As of|2007|lc=y}}, 7.6 million visitors annually to the islands, with 62.3% entering at [[Honolulu International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/visitor-stats/visitor-research/2007-annual-research.pdf | title = 2007 Annual Visitor Research Report | publisher = Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, State of Hawaii | date =July 1, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2009 }}</ref> Today, Honolulu is a modern city with numerous high-rise buildings, and Waikīkī is the center of the tourism industry in Hawai{{okina}}i, with thousands of hotel rooms.

Temperatures vary little throughout the months, with average high temperatures of {{convert|80|–|90|°F|°C}} and average lows of {{convert|65|–|75|°F|°C}} throughout the year. Temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on an average 38 days annually,<ref>This is comparable to Washington, D.C. despite being slightly warmer during the summer, see [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=hnl].</ref> with lows in the upper 50s °F (14–15&nbsp;°C) occurring once or twice a year. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|95|°F}} during a heat wave in September 1998. The highest recorded temperature in the state was also recorded later that day in [[Ni'ihau]]. The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|52|°F}} on February 16, 1902, and January 20, 1969.

Annual average rainfall is {{convert|17.05|in|abbr=on}}, which mainly occurs during the winter months of October through early April, with very little rainfall during the summer.

* Kalanianaole Highway, State Rte. 72, runs eastward from Waialae/Kahala to [[Hawaii Kai, Hawaii|Hawaii Kai]] and around the east end of the island to [[Waimanalo Beach, Hawaii|Waimanalo Beach]].
* [[Kamehameha Highway]], State Rts. 80, 83, 99 and 830, runs westward from near [[Hickam Air Force Base]] to [[Aiea, Hawaii|Aiea]] and beyond, eventually running through the center of the island and ending in [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]].

Like most major American cities, the Honolulu metropolitan area experiences heavy traffic congestion during rush hours, especially to and from the western suburbs of [[Kapolei]], [['Ewa Beach, Hawaii|'Ewa Beach]], [[Aiea, Hawaii|Aiea]], [[Pearl City]], [[Waipahu]], and [[Mililani]].

There is a Hawaii Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP).<ref>{{cite web |title= Hawaii Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies |publisher= High Technology Development Corporation |url= http://www.htdc.org/programsservices/hcatt.html |accessdate=November 13, 2009 }}</ref>

===Public transport===

====Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation====
In November 2010, voters approved a charter amendment to create a [[public transit]] authority to oversee the planning, construction, operation and future extensions to Honolulu's future rail system.  The Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) currently includes a 10-member board of directors; three members appointed by the mayor, three members selected by the Honolulu City Council, and the city and state transportation directors.<ref name="HART">{{cite web |url= http://www.honolulutransit.org/hart.aspx |author=Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation |authorlink=Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project |title=HART - Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation |publisher=Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation |location=Honolulu, HI, USA  |accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref> 
The opening of the [[Honolulu Rail Transit]] is delayed until approximately 2018, as HART canceled the initial bids for the first nine stations and intends to rebid the work as three packages of three stations each, and allow more time for construction in the hope that increased competition on smaller contracts will drive down costs;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.kitv.com/news/hart-cancels-bids-for-first-9-rail-stations/27967000 |title=HART cancels bids for first 9 rail stations |newspaper=[[KITV]] |date=September 10, 2014 |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref> initial bids ranged from $294.5 million to $320.8 million, far surpassing HART's budget of $184 million.<ref>honolulutransit.org [http://www.honolulutransit.org/media/280559/20140814-weekly-eblast.pdf Honolulu Transit E-Blast (PDF)] August 18, 2014.</ref>

====Bus====
{{Main|TheBus (Honolulu)}}

Established by former Mayor [[Frank F. Fasi]] as the replacement for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (HRT), Honolulu's [[TheBus (Honolulu)|TheBus]] system was honored in 1994–1995 and 2000–2001 by the [[American Public Transportation Association]] as "America's Best Transit System". TheBus operates 107 routes serving Honolulu and most major cities and towns on [[Oahu]]. TheBus comprises a fleet of 531 buses, and is run by the [[non-profit corporation]] Oahu Transit Services in conjunction with the city Department of Transportation Services. Honolulu is ranked 4th for highest per-capita use of [[mass transit in the United States]].<ref>[http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/other_data_products/Top_Transit_Cities.xls National Transit Database], Top Transit Cities (2006)</ref>

====Rail====
{{Main|Honolulu Rail Transit}}

Currently, there is no [[urban rail transit]] system in Honolulu, although electric street railways were operated in Honolulu by the now-defunct Honolulu Rapid Transit Company prior to [[World War II]]. Predecessors to the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company were the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company (began 1903) and Hawaiian Tramways (began 1888).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&year=1888 |title=Hawaii's History in 1888 – Hawaii History – 1888 |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

The City and County of Honolulu is currently constructing a {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} rail transit line that will connect Honolulu with cities and suburban areas near [[Pearl Harbor]] and in the Leeward and West Oahu regions. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project is aimed at alleviating [[traffic congestion]] for West Oahu commuters while being integral in the westward expansion of the metropolitan area. The project, however, has been criticized by opponents of rail for its cost, delays, and potential environmental impacts, but the line is expected to have large ridership.
