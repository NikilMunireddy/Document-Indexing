It has a [[Copenhagen Municipality|municipal]] population of 591,481 and a larger [[Urban area of Copenhagen|urban]] population of 1,280,371 ({{As of|2016|01|01|lc=on}}).<ref name="pop1" /> The [[Copenhagen metropolitan area]] has just over 2 million inhabitants.<ref name="provinces">http://www.statbank.dk/FRLD113 (select "provinces" - København by, København omegn, Nordsjælland & Østsjælland). Statistics Denmark. Retrieved on 25 April 2016.</ref> The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and is separated from [[Malmö]], Sweden, by the strait of [[Øresund]].

Originally a [[Viking]] fishing village founded in the 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century, under the reign of [[Christian IV]], it developed into an important regional centre, consolidating its position as capital of [[Denmark–Norway]] with its institutions, defences and armed forces. Magnificent architectural expressions of prestige from this time include some of Copenhagen's most important tourist attractions, such as [[Børsen]] (Stock Exchange), the [[Rundetårn]] (Round Tower) and [[Rosenborg Castle]]. After suffering from the effects of [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.

Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in [[information technology]], [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[Øresund Bridge]], a road, railway and tunnel project, the [[Copenhagen metropolitan area]] has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malmö, known as the [[Øresund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterized by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], the [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|Little Mermaid Statue]], the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.

Copenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]] and [[Copenhagen Business School]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC København]] and [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. The [[Copenhagen Metro]] serves central Copenhagen together with the [[S-train]] network connecting the outlying boroughs. Serving roughly 2 million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup]], is the largest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].

==Etymology==
The name of the city reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation, from which the contemporary Danish name derives, was ''Køpmannæhafn'', meaning "merchants' harbour", often simply ''Hafn'' or ''Havn'' ("harbour"). The English [[cognate]] would be "[[Chapmen|Chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kjøbenhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> The English name for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''. The abbreviations ''Kbh.'' or ''Kbhvn'' are often used in Danish for ''København'', and ''kbh.'' for ''københavnsk'' (of Copenhagen).<ref>[http://www.ut.ngb.army.mil/clp/linguists/fbis/dan.pdf ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS USED IN THE PRESS OF DENMARK, glossary by Foreign Broadcast Information Service, Washington DC, USA]</ref>

The chemical element [[hafnium]] is named for Copenhagen ([[Latin]] name ''Hafnia''), where it was discovered.<ref name="Authier2013">{{cite book|first=André|last=Authier|title=Early Days of X-ray Crystallography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ej9oAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA153|date=1 August 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-163501-4|page=153}}</ref>{{sfn|Cardarelli|2008|p=336}} The bacterium ''[[Hafnia (bacterium)|Hafnia]]'' is also named after Copenhagen: Vagn Møller of the [[State Serum Institute]] in Copenhagen named it in 1954.<ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Copenhagen|Timeline of Copenhagen}}
[[File:København1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen {{circa|1500}}]]

===Early history===
Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the [[12th century]], recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in [[Pilestræde]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the [[11th century]], have been unearthed near where [[Strøget]] meets [[Rådhuspladsen]].

These finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the [[11th century]]. Substantial discoveries of [[flint]] tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Arkæologer graver ny teori om København op af mulden|publisher=''Videnskab.dk''|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} 
The natural harbour and good [[herring]] stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the [[11th century]] and more permanently in the [[13th century]].<ref name=khdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=København – historie|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> The first habitations were probably centred on [[Gammel Strand]] (literally "old shore") in the 11th century or even earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=Københavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref>

The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] referred to it as ''Portus Mercatorum'', meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time, ''Købmannahavn''.<ref name=metro1415>Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14–15</ref> Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a modest fortress on the little island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by [[Wends|Wendish]] pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with [[Copenhagen Castle]].{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}}

===Middle Ages===

In 1186, a letter from [[Pope Urban III]] states that the castle of ''Hafn'' (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158–1191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177–1201, by King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]]. On Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|Bishopric of Roskilde]].<ref name=khdsd/> Around 1200, the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.<ref name=khdsd/>

As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the [[Hanseatic League]]. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of [[herring]], the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]]<ref name="Copenhagen1898">{{cite book|last=Copenhagen|first=Dansk turistforening,|title=Copenhagen, the Capital of Denmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJPVAAAAMAAJ|year=1898|page=49}}</ref> who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges.{{sfn|Booth|2003|p=9}} In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.{{sfn|Booth|2003|p=9}}

With the establishment of the [[Kalmar Union]] (1397–1523) between [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when [[Eric of Pomerania]] moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle.<ref name="Ingebritsen2006">{{cite book|first=Christine|last=Ingebritsen|title=Scandinavia in World Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1VRPBAF9NcC&pg=PA7|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0966-5|pages=7–}}</ref>{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}} The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]], following approval from Pope [[Sixtus IV]].<ref name="histuni">{{cite web|url=http://introduction.ku.dk/presentation/history/|title=History of the University|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref> This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and [[List of medieval universities|one of the oldest in Europe]].

In disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of [[Frederik I of Denmark|Frederik I]], who supported [[Lutheranism]]. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malmö]] and [[Lübeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/> The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.

During the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on [[Slotsholmen]]: the [[Tøjhus Museum|Tøjhus Arsenal]] and [[Børsen]], the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of [[Christianshavn]] with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen.<ref name=kher>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Historie_-_Efter_Reformationen)|title=Københavns historie efter Reformationen|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including [[Rosenborg Slot]] and the [[Rundetårn]].{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1658–59, the city withstood a siege by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] under [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X]] and successfully repelled [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|a major assault]].<ref name=kher/>

By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Citadel]] in 1664 and the extension of [[Christianshavns Vold]] with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Nyholm]].<ref name=kher/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Milit%C3%A6r/S%C3%B8v%C3%A6rnet/Holmen|title=Holmen|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref>

===18th century===
[[File:Amalienborg Palace (8132069805).jpg|thumb|A mansion at Amalienborg in [[Frederiksstaden]] (1750), part of the [[Amalienborg Palace]]]]

Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the [[The plague during the Great Northern War|plague]] in 1711.{{sfn|Woodward|1998|p=10}} The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure.{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}} The [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728]] was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the [[Copenhagen fire of 1795|1795 fire]], it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.<ref>Raabyemagle, p. 16.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lauring|first=Kåre|title=Byen brænder|pages=86–88}}</ref>

A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of [[Christiansborg Palace (1st)|Christiansborg Palace]] which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] was initiated. Designed by [[Nicolai Eigtved]] in the [[Rococo]] style, its centre contained the mansions which now form [[Amalienborg|Amalienborg Palace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=1921 |title=Frederiksstaden, København|publisher=arkark.dk|accessdate= 14 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Major extensions to the naval base of [[Holmen naval base|Holmen]] were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]].<ref name="Københavns historie 1728-1914">{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavns_historie_1728-1914 |title=Københavns historie 1728–1914|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefitted from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of [[Højbro Plads]] while [[Nytorv]] and [[Gammel Torv]] were converged.<ref name="Københavns historie 1728-1914" />

===19th century===
On 2 April 1801, a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet under the command of [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Admiral Sir Hyde Parker]] defeated a [[Denmark–Norway|Danish-Norwegian]] [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|fleet]] anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] led the main attack.{{Sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}} He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed.{{sfn|Cowie|1990|p=130}} Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].{{Sfn|Pocock|1994|p=229}} It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have "put the telescope to the blind eye" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to [[Ceasefire|cease fire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article2372230.ece|title=Copenhagen's second battle remembered – 200 years on |work=The Times |first=Peter|last=Davies|date=3 September 2007}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Second Battle of Copenhagen]] (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a [[preemptive war|preemptive attack]] on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population in order to seize the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Dano-Norwegian fleet]].{{Sfn|Smith|1998|p=204}} But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary [[Congreve rocket]]s (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, ''[[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Vor frue kirke]]'', was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first [[Terrorism|terror attack]] against a major European city in modern times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/waterloo/battle-copenhagen.htm |title=The Battle of Copenhagen|publisher=BritishBattles.com|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/K%C3%B8benhavns_bombardement?highlight=K%C3%B8benhavns%20bombardement|title=Københavns bombardement|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the [[Danish Golden Age]]. Painting prospered under [[C.W. Eckersberg]] and his students while [[C.F. Hansen]] and [[Gottlieb Bindesbøll]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to the city's architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guldalder.dk/|title=Guide til Dansk Guldalder|publisher=Golden Days|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|The Lakes]] ({{lang-da|Søerne}}) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of [[Nørrebro]] and [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad [[sanitation]] in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the [[Freeport of Copenhagen]] 1892–94.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavns_Havn|title=Københavns Havn|work=Den Store Danske |language=Danish |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>  Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.<ref name="Københavns historie 1728-1914"/>

===20th century===

By the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new [[Copenhagen City Hall|city hall]] and [[Copenhagen Central Station|railway station]], its centre was drawn towards the west.<ref name="Københavns historie 1728-1914"/> New housing developments grew up in [[Brønshøj]] and [[Valby]] while [[Frederiksberg]] became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/Frederiksberg_Kommune/Frederiksberg_Kommune_(Historie)|title=Frederiksberg Kommune – historie|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> The northern part of [[Amager]] and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901–02.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/khsd/1900/1900.html|first=Steffen|last=Linvald|title=Københavns hvornår skete det|publisher=København|accessdate=24 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref>

As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the [[First World War]], Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/monumenter/artikel.aspx?xid=denmark_and_southern_jutland |first=Jan|last=Baltzersen|title=Denmark and Southern Jutland during the First World War|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate= November 2013}}</ref>

In the [[1920s]] there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas.{{sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=161}} However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued,<ref name="Københavns historie siden 1914">{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn_-_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie_siden_1914?highlight=k%C3%B8benhavns%20historie |title=Københavns historie siden 1914|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> with the demolishment of one side of Christianhavn's [[Torvegade]] in order to build five large blocks of flats.{{sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=161}}

====World War II====
{{See also|Denmark in World War II|Danish resistance movement}}
During [[Denmark in World War II|World War II in Denmark]], Copenhagen was [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied by German troops]] along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] hoped that Denmark would be "a model [[protectorate]]"<ref>Henning Poulsen, "Dansk Modstand og Tysk Politik" ("Danish opposition and German Politics") in ''Jyske Historiker'' 71(1995), p.10.</ref> and initially the [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The [[Danish Folketing election, 1943|1943 Danish parliamentary election]] was also allowed to take place, with only the [[Communist Party of Denmark|Communist Party]] excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the [[Royal Danish Navy]] to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|started to arrest Jews]], although most managed to escape to [[Sweden]].<ref name=occupation>{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/society/history/occupation/|title=The Occupation of Denmark|publisher=Denmark.dk|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

[[File:Shellhuset 210345.jpg|thumb|left|The RAF's bombing of [[Gestapo]] headquarters in March 1945 was coordinated with the Danish resistance movement]]

In 1945 [[Ole Lippman]], leader of the Danish section of the [[Special Operations Executive]], invited the British [[Royal Air Force]] to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, [[Air vice-marshal|Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Basil Embry|Sir Basil Embry]] drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] and [[Gestapo]] building, the former offices of the [[Shell Oil Company]]. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building.<ref name="milhist.dk">{{cite web|url=http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/shell/shell.html |title=The Bombing of the Shellhus on March 21, 1945|first=Klaus|last=Velschow|publisher=Dansk Militærhistorie |date=21 March 1945 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

[[File:People celebrating the liberation of Denmark. 5th May 1945. At Strøget in Copenhagen..jpg|thumb|People celebrating the [[liberation of Denmark]] at Strøget in Copenhagen, 5 May 1945. Germany surrendered two days later]] 
The attack, known as "[[Operation Carthage]]", came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg Girls School. Because of this crash four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target, and aimed their bombs at the school leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolchildren).<ref name="milhist.dk"/> However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.<ref name="milhist.dk"/>

On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] who supervised the surrender of 30,000 Germans situated around the capital.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Occupation of Denmark|url=http://Denmark.dk/en/society/history/occupation/|work=Denmark.dk|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref>

====Post-war decades====
[[File:SHL - Black Diamond.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Black Diamond (library)|Black Diamond]] (1999)]]
Shortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the [[Finger Plan]] was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five "fingers" stretching out from the city centre along the [[S-train]] routes.<ref name="OECD2010">{{cite book|title=Regional Development Policies in OECD Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SK4Pg3zEHUC&pg=PA357|date=4 November 2010|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-08722-4|page=357}}</ref>{{sfn|Cervero|1998|p=132}} With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former Bådsmandsstræde Barracks in [[Christianshavn]] was occupied, leading to the establishment of [[Freetown Christiania]] in September 1971.<ref name=kkkh>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/om-kommunen/fakta-og-statistik/historie-og-udvikling/koebenhavns-historie |title=Københavns historie |publisher=Københavns Kommune |accessdate=15 November 2013 |language=Danish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222905/http://www.kk.dk/da/om-kommunen/fakta-og-statistik/historie-og-udvikling/koebenhavns-historie |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>

[[File:Bridge over Øresund.jpg|thumb|[[Øresund Bridge]] (1999)]]
Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect [[Jan Gehl]], pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/%E2%80%98copenhagenizing%E2%80%99-world-one-city-time|first=Elise|last=Beacom|title='Copenhagenizing' the world, one city at a time|publisher=''the Copenhagen post''|date=10 November 2012|accessdate=24 November 2013 }}</ref> Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen naval base. [[Copenhagen Airport]] underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the [[Nordic countries]]. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of [[Amager]].<ref name="Københavns historie siden 1914"/> The national library's [[Black Diamond (library)|Black Diamond]] building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.danskarkitekturguide.dk/node/6855|title=The Black Diamond|publisher=''Danish architecture guide''|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

===2000 to present===
[[File:Copenaghen Opera House.jpg|thumb|left|[[Copenhagen Opera House]] (2004)]]
Since the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of [[Malmö]] have been connected by the [[Øresund Bridge]], which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public [[transport network|transport system]] and has led to the extensive redevelopment of [[Amager]].<ref name=kkkh/> The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the [[University of Copenhagen]] with its 35,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/koebenhavn/|title=København|publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Another important development for the city has been the [[Copenhagen Metro]], the underground railway system which opened in 2000 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/copenhagen/|title=Copenhagen Metro, Denmark|publisher=railwaytechnology.com|accessdate=23 November 2013 }}</ref>

On the cultural front, the lavish [[Copenhagen Opera House]], a gift to the city from the shipping magnate [[Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller]] on behalf of the A.P. Møller foundation, was completed in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henninglarsen.com/projects/0400-0599/0553-the-opera-copenhagen.aspx |title=The Opera in Copenhagen|publisher=Henning Larsen Architects|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> In December 2009 Copenhagen gained international prominence when it hosted the worldwide climate meeting [[COP15]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/copenhagen_dec_2009/meeting/6295.php|title=Copenhagen Climate Change Conference – December 2009|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>

Copenhagen is part of the [[Øresund Region]], which consists of [[Zealand]], [[Lolland-Falster]] and [[Bornholm]] in [[Denmark]] and [[Scania]] in [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oresundsregionen.org/en/about-the-oeresund-region|title=What is the Øresund Region?|publisher=Øresund|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of [[Amager]] and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the [[Øresund]] to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from [[Sweden]], and which connects the [[North Sea]] with the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] towns of [[Malmö]] and [[Landskrona]] lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/travel/copenhagen-19.html|title=Copenhagen (København), Denmark|publisher=Danishnet.com|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> By road, Copenhagen is {{convert|42|km}} northwest of [[Malmö]], Sweden, {{convert|85|km}} northeast of [[Næstved]], {{convert|164|km}} northeast of [[Odense]], {{convert|295|km}} east of [[Esbjerg]] and {{convert|188|km}} southeast of [[Aarhus]] by sea and road via [[Sjællands Odde]].<ref>{{Google maps | url =https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Copenhagen&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF-8&ei=USGSUuWnH_KA7QaTz4CYBA&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg  | accessdate =24 November 2013}}</ref>

The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]]s, which are still referred to as the [[Fortification Ring, Copenhagen|Fortification Ring]] (''Fæstningsringen'') and kept as a partial green band around it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/parker/indre-by |title=Parker I Indre By |language=Danish |publisher=Copenhagen Municipality |accessdate=25 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023035646/http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/parker/indre-by |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}</ref>  Then come the late 19th and early 20th century residential neighbourhoods of [[Østerbro]], [[Nørrebro]], [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] and [[Amagerbro]].

===Topography===
The central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by [[moraine]]s from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The slopes of [[Valby]] and [[Brønshøj]] reach heights of over {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}}, divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|Copenhagen lakes]] of Sortedams Sø, Peblinge Sø and Sankt Jørgens Sø.<ref name=kgdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn_-_geografi|title=København – geografi|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=16 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the [[Danian]] period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some [[greensand (geology)|greensand]] from the [[Selandian]] is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocenter.dk/xpdf/geoviden-4-2005.pdf|author1=Lars Nielsen |author2=Alexander Lassen |author3=Hans Thybo |title=Carlsbergforkastningen|publisher=''Geoviden''|issue=4|pages=8–11|year=2005|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} thick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Geologi)|title=København – geologi|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

===Climate===

Copenhagen is in the [[oceanic climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb&#x202f;'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Denmark.htm|title=Denmark|publisher=Weather Online|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> Its weather is subject to [[low pressure area|low-pressure systems]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While there can be snow from late December to late April, there can also be rain with average temperatures around the freezing point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,copenhagen,Denmark|title=Average weather in Copenhagen, Denmark|publisher=World Weather and Climate Information|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21&nbsp;°C. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with from four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/arkiver/normaler-og-ekstremer/klimanormaler-dk/|title=Klimanormaler|publisher=Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut|accessdate=1 February 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50&nbsp;cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour period during the winter months<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/CPH/DK/MAIN/Foer+afrejse/Vejr+og+flyvning/Kl%C3%A6dt+p%C3%A5+til+vinteren.htm |title=Københavns Lufthavn er klædt på til vinteren |publisher=CPH |accessdate=17 November 2013 |language=Danish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111045859/http://www.cph.dk:80/CPH/DK/MAIN/Foer+afrejse/Vejr+og+flyvning/Kl%C3%A6dt+p%C3%A5+til+vinteren.htm |archivedate=11 November 2013 }}</ref> while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of {{convert|33|°C|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/danmark/varmeste-dag-i-37-aar|title=Exceptionel varm sommerdag i København|publisher=''BT''|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|title=Sol op/ned |publisher=Almanak|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Copenhagen aims to be [[carbon-neutral]] by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. [[District heating]] will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste [[incineration]] and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or [[biofuel]] by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/apr/12/copenhagen-push-carbon-neutral-2025 Copenhagen's ambitious push to be carbon-neutral by 2025] Guardian 12 April 2013</ref>

The city's architectural planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of [[Low-energy house|low-energy standards]]. Priorities include [[sustainable drainage system]]s,<ref>[http://nordvand.dk/klimatilpasning/Sider/default.aspx We make room for the rainwater] {{wayback|url=http://nordvand.dk/klimatilpasning/Sider/default.aspx |date=20150729044059 |df=y }}</ref> [[Water conservation|recycling rainwater]], [[green roof]]s and efficient [[waste management]] solutions.

Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions with a focus on [[research and development]] within the field of biotechnology,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copcap.com/BusinessOpportunities/Life%20science/background |title=Life Science in the Øresund Region |publisher=Copenhagen Capacity |accessdate=23 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112173601/http://www.copcap.com/BusinessOpportunities/Life%20science/background |archivedate=12 January 2014 }}</ref> and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and [[Lundbeck]], both of which are among the [[List of pharmaceutical companies|50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world]], are located in this business cluster.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/marketplace/ibi/copenhagen.htm |title=Copenhagen – Overview|publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=19 May 2009 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

Shipping is another import sector with Maersk, the world's largest [[List of ship companies|shipping company]], having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, [[Copenhagen Port]]. Following decades of stagnation, it has experienced a resurgence since 1990 following a merger with [[Malmö]] harbour. Both ports are operated by [[Copenhagen Malmö Port]] (CMP). The central location in the Øresund Region allows the ports to act as a hub for freight that is transported onward to the [[Baltic countries]]. CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 [[TEU]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://annualreport2012.cmport.com/archive/files/19811/CMP%20Annual%20Report%202012.pdf.aspx |title=Copenhagen Malmö Port Annual Report 2012 |publisher=Copenhagen Malmö Port |format=PDF |accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>

===Tourism===
{{See also|Tourism in Denmark}}
Tourism is an important sector for the city's economy. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe.<ref name="tourismstats">{{cite web|title=Copenhagen - a city of growth|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/global-connected/copenhagen/copenhagen-city-growth|publisher=Wonderful Copenhagen / Global Connected|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref> Hotel capacity in the city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, Copenhagen experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors.<ref name="tourismstats" /> The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million.<ref name="tourismstats" />

In 2010, it is estimated that [[wikt:city break|city break]] tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover. However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29% in that one year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Copenhagen City Break Strategy 2012-2014|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.dk/sites/default/files/asp/visitcopenhagen/Corporate/PDF-filer/Analyser/Citybreak/strategi_final.pdf|publisher=VisitDenmark / Wonderful Copenhagen|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref> 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press room|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/cruise/copenhagen/press-room-1|publisher=Cruise Copenhagen Network|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>

==Cityscape==
{{wideimage|Copenhagen skyline.jpg|600px|The city skyline features many towers and spires}}
The city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the [[bike path|bicycle paths]] that line most streets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/koebenhavn/arkitektur/koebenhavns-forskellige-bydele|title=Københavns forskellige bydele|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=18 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

The oldest section of Copenhagen's [[inner city]] is often referred to as ''Middelalderbyen'' (the [[medieval]] city).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guides.dk/Turforslag/Bytur-i-Koebenhavn.html|title=København – byen ved vandet&nbsp;... |publisher=Guides.dk|language=Danish|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>  However, the city's most distinctive district is [[Frederiksstaden]], developed during the reign of [[Frederick V of Denmark|Frederick V]]. It has the [[Amalienborg|Amalienborg Palace]] at its centre and is dominated by the dome of [[Frederik's Church]] (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century [[Rococo]] mansions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verdensarv.dk/english/candidates/frederiksstad-with-amalienborg/ |title=Frederiksstad with Amalienborg |publisher=Kultur Styrelsen |accessdate=20 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214204614/http://www.verdensarv.dk/english/candidates/frederiksstad-with-amalienborg/ |archivedate=14 December 2013 }}</ref> The inner city includes [[Slotsholmen]], a little island on which [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands and [[Christianshavn]] with its canals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/copenhagen-city-centre|title=Copenhagen city centre|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> [[Børsen]] on Slotsholmen and [[Frederiksborg Palace]] in Hillerød are prominent examples of the [[Dutch Renaissance]] style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs ([[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]], [[Nørrebro|Inner Nørrebro]], [[Indre Østerbro|Inner Østerbro]]) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noerrebrolokalhistorie.dk/historie.php|title=Lidt Nørrebro-historie|publisher=Nørrebro Lokalhistoriske Forening og Arkiv|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Sometimes referred to as "the City of Spires", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the [[Baroque]] spire of the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker/Vor_Frelsers_Kirke|title=Vor Frelsers Kirke (København)|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=21 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> Other important spires are those of [[Christiansborg Palace]], the [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a [[modern art]] venue. Not quite so high are the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] spires of [[Rosenborg Castle]] and the "dragon spire" of [[Børsen|Christian IV's former stock exchange]], so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.<ref>{{cite book|author=Knud Kapper Hansen|title=Tårne, spir og kupler: om Københavns og Frederiksbergs karakteristiske tårnlandskab|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5hqGQAACAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Tårngruppen}}</ref>

Recent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen<ref name="baumeister1">{{cite web|url=http://www.baumeister.de/|title=B1 Kopenhagen entdecken|publisher=Baumeister – Zeitschrift für Architektur|year=2009|language=German|accessdate=2016-02-12}}</ref> both for [[Architecture of Denmark|Danish architecture]] and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine ''[[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle]]'' named Copenhagen the ''World's best design city 2008''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/copenhagen-probably-the-best-city-in-the-world-842782.html|title=World's best design city 2008|work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Emily|last=Dugan|date=9 June 2008}}</ref>

The boom in [[urban planning|urban development]] and [[modern architecture]] has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. [[Ørestad]] now has seen most of the recent development. Located near [[Copenhagen Airport]], it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the [[IT University of Copenhagen|IT University]] and a high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orestad.dk/~/media/Orestad/pdf/Copenhagen-Growing_web.ashx|title=Copenhagen growing|publisher=''By&Havn''|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>

===Parks, gardens and zoo===
{{Main|Parks and open spaces in Copenhagen}}
[[File:Rosenborg - park setting.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rosenborg Castle]] and park in central Copenhagen]]
Copenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens|King's Garden]] (''{{lang|da|Kongens Have}}''), the garden of [[Rosenborg Castle]], is the oldest and most frequented of them all.<ref name="www1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ses.dk/392755f0|title=King's Garden|publisher=Slots- og Ejeondomsstyrelsen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329224035/http://www.ses.dk/392755f0|archivedate=29 March 2008}}</ref> It was [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] who first developed its landscaping in 1606.

In Copenhagen, many [[cemetery|cemeteries]] double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]], the burial place of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], is an important green space for the district of [[Nørrebro|Inner Nørrebro]] and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known [[Vestre Cemetery|Vestre Kirkegaard]] is the largest cemetery in Denmark ({{convert|54|ha|abbr=on}}) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown [[tomb]]s, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other [[List of garden features|garden feature]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde |title=Kirkegårde |publisher=Københavns Kommune |language=Danish |accessdate=21 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023034448/http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}</ref>

===Landmarks by district===

====Indre By====
[[File:Christianshavns Kanal boats.jpg|thumb|[[Christianshavn]] Canal]]
The historic centre of the city, [[Indre By]] or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as [[Frederiksstaden]], developed by [[Frederik V of Denmark|Frederik V]] in the second half of the 18th century in the [[Rococo]] style, has the four mansions of [[Amalienborg]], the royal residence, and the wide-domed [[Frederik's Church|Marble Church]] at its centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie/Frederiksstaden|title=Frederiksstaden|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed [[Copenhagen Opera]] stands on the island of [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Holmen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktalink.dk/titelliste/open|author1=Charlotte Haase |author2=Susanne Nørgaard |title=Operaen|publisher=Faktalink|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> To the south of Frederiksstaden, the [[Nyhavn]] canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/cph-nyhavn.asp|title=Nyhavn|publisher=Copenhagenet.dk|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}</ref> The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of [[Kongens Nytorv]] which was laid out by [[Christian V]] in 1670. Important buildings include [[Charlottenborg Palace]], famous for its art exhibitions, the [[Embassy of France, Copenhagen|Thott Palace]] (now the French embassy), the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] and the [[Hotel D'Angleterre]], dated to 1755.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/kings-new-square-gdk428111|title=King's New Square|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}</ref> Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of [[Christiansborg]], the [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and [[Rundetårn]], originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including [[Thorvaldsen Museum]] dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.usnews.com/Copenhagen_Denmark/Neighborhoods/|title=Copenhagen Neighborhoods and Towns|publisher=U.S. News Travel|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}</ref> Closed to traffic since 1964, [[Strøget]], the world's oldest and longest pedestrian street, runs the {{convert |3.2|km|abbr=on}} from Rådhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv.

====Christianshavn====
[[File:Halmtorvet seen from Øksnehallen.jpg|thumb|[[Halmtorvet]] in [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]]]]
[[Christianshavn]] lies to the southeast of [[Indre By]] on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of [[Amsterdam]], he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its [[Christianshavns Vold|ramparts]] which are still well preserved today.<ref name=kher/> The canals themselves, branching off the central [[Christianshavns Kanal|Christianshavn Canal]] and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions. Another interesting feature is [[Freetown Christiania]], a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on "Pusher Street" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo [[Christian's Church, Copenhagen|Christian's Church]]. Once a warehouse, the [[North Atlantic House]] now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the [[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]] restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/maritime-christianshavn-holmen|title=Maritime Christianshavn & Holmen|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-christianshavn|title=Guide to Christianshavn|publisher=AOK|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}</ref>

[[File:Gefion fountain, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|The [[Gefion Fountain]]]]
Just north of the city centre, [[Østerbro]] is an upper middle-class district with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/%C3%98sterbro|title=Østerbro|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=28 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> The district stretches from Nørrebro to the waterfront where the statue of [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]] can be seen from the promenade known as [[Langelinie]].

Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving [[open sandwich]]es, known as [[smørrebrød]] – a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/gastronomy/top-10-traditional-danish-lunch|title=Top 10 traditional Danish lunch|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=22 November 2013 }}</ref> [[Danish pastry]] can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city.

Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] and [[Valby]] districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with [[Beer in Denmark|Danish beer]] production.
