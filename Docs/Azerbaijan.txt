The Persian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] turned Caucasian Albania into a [[vassal state]] in AD 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule, Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Persia, and retained its monarchy.<ref name="Chaumont">Nevertheless, "despite being one of the chief vassals of Sasanian ''[[Shahanshah]]'', the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sassanid [[marzban]] (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.</ref>
In the first half of the 7th century AD, the Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sassanids and Byzantines from the Caucasus region and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by King [[Javanshir]], was suppressed in 667. Caucasian Albania however, came already under nominal Muslim rule through the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], as it made up part of the Sassanid territory upon advent of the Muslim conquest. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid]]s, [[Sajids]], [[Shaddadid]]s, [[Rawadid]]s and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes from Central Asia. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuqs]], which entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.

The pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijani Republic spoke several Indo-European and Caucasian languages, among them – [[Armenian language|Armenian]]<ref>Hewsen, Robert H.

The local dynasty of the [[Shirvanshah]]s became a [[vassal]] state of [[Timurid dynasty|Timur's Empire]], and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival states emerged: [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]].

Azerbaijan is in the [[South Caucasus]] region of [[Eurasia]], straddling [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]] and Eastern Europe. It lies between latitudes [[38th parallel north|38°]] and [[42nd parallel north|42° N]], and longitudes [[44th meridian east|44°]] and [[51st meridian east|51° E]].

Three physical features dominate Azerbaijan: the Caspian Sea, whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east; the [[Greater Caucasus]] mountain range to the north; and the extensive flatlands at the country's center.

The main water sources are surface waters. However, only 24 of the 8,350 rivers are greater than {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} in length.<ref name="GEO"/> All the rivers drain into the Caspian Sea in the east of the country.<ref name="GEO"/> The largest lake is [[Lake Sarysu|Sarysu]] (67&nbsp;km²), and the longest river is [[Kura River|Kur]] (1,515&nbsp;km), which is transboundary. Azerbaijan's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over thirty square kilometers.

Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani government]] has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan. But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]]. Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecology.html |title=Ecological problems in Azerbaijan |publisher=Enrin.grida.no |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

[[File:Azerbajiani landscape - Another version.jpg|thumb|The landscape of Khinalug valley.]]
Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan's land mass consists of mountain ridges, crests, [[yaila]]s, and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400–1000&nbsp;meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120&nbsp;meters, and others from 0–50&nbsp;meters and up ([[Qobustan, Absheron]]). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consist of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about −28&nbsp;meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466&nbsp;meters (Bazardüzü peak).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecologicalzones.html |title=Orography of Azerbaijan |publisher= United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold [[arctic]] [[air mass]]es of Scandinavian [[anticyclone]], temperate of [[Siberia]]n anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone.<ref name="CLIM">{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan – Climate| publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Climate/_climate_e.html| accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country.<ref name="CLIM"/> The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] rates.

Nine out of 11 existing [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]] are present in Azerbaijan.<ref name="KL">{{cite web| title =Climate| work = Water Resources of the Azerbaijan Republic| publisher = Institute of Hydrometeorology, Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources | url = http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html| accessdate = 2007-05-26| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070524005453/http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html| archivedate= 24 May 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Both the absolute minimum temperature (<span style="white-space:nowrap"> {{convert|-33|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} </span>) and the absolute maximum temperature (<span style="white-space:nowrap"> {{convert|46|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} </span>) were observed in [[Julfa Rayon|Julfa]] and [[Ordubad Rayon|Ordubad]].<ref name="KL"/> The maximum annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls in [[Lankaran]] ({{convert|1600|to|1800|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the minimum in Absheron ({{convert|200|to|350|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}).<ref name="KL"/>

Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} per year of water per square kilometer.<ref name="KL"/> All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].

There are 8,350 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Only 24 rivers are over 100&nbsp;kilometers long.<ref>{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan: Geography| publisher = Central Asia and Caucasus Institute| url = http://www.cac-biodiversity.org/aze/aze_geography.htm}}</ref> The [[Kura River|Kura]] and [[Aras River|Aras]] are the most popular rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the [[Kura-Aras Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur–Devechi and Lankaran lowlands.

[[Yanar Dag]], translated as "burning mountain", is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on the [[Caspian Sea]] near [[Baku]], which itself is known as the "land of fire." Flames jet out into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer. It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area.

The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century.<ref name="GEO"/> Unlike fauna, the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of animals, but also the number of individual species.

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan.<ref name="GEO"/> The national animal of Azerbaijan is the [[Karabakh horse]], a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. However today the horse is an endangered species.<ref>{{cite web| title =The Karabakh Horse | publisher = Karabakh Foundation| url = http://www.karabakhfoundation.org/pages/history-and-culture/karabakh-region/the-karabakh-horse/}}</ref>

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of [[higher plants]]. Due the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Planting/_planting_e.html |title=Azerbaijan – Flora |publisher=Heydar Aliyev Foundation|accessdate=2010-03-05 }}</ref> About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole [[Caucasus]] can be found in Azerbaijan.

The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] on 12 November 1995. According to the Article 23 of Constitution, the [[National symbol|state symbols]] of the Azerbaijan Republic are the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|flag]], the [[Coat of arms of Azerbaijan|coat of arms]] and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan|national anthem]]. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.

The government of Azerbaijan is based on the [[separation of powers]] among the [[Legislature|legislative]], executive and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The [[New Azerbaijan Party|Yeni Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat. European observers [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Campaign irregularities|found numerous irregularities]] in the run-up to the election and [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Election|on election day]].<ref>{{cite news |title =Monitors criticize Azerbaijani elections | publisher = [[Al Jazeera]]| url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html| accessdate = 8 November 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101111072636/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html| archivedate= 11 November 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

The executive power is held by the [[President of Azerbaijan|president]], who is elected for a five-year term by direct elections, and the [[prime minister of Azerbaijan]]. The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the President and the National Assembly. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]], his Deputies and Ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]] and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The President nominates the judges in these courts.

The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.

The Azerbaijani government, in late 2007, stated that the long-standing dispute over the Armenian-occupied territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is almost certain to spark a new war if it remains unresolved.<ref name="NSC AZ"/> The Government is in the process of increasing its military budget. Furthermore, economic sanctions by Turkey to the west and by Azerbaijan itself to the east have combined to greatly erode Armenia's economy, leading to steep increases in prices for basic commodities and a great decline in the Armenian state revenues. A recent attack by Azerbaijani military on Armenian villages in Nogorno-Karabagh has caused physical damage and raised controversy over the future of peaceful relations between Azerbaijan and its neighbor, Armenia.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/02/asia/azerbaijan-armenia-violence/index.html</ref>

Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism. The country is contributing to peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Azerbaijan is an active member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] program. It also maintains good relations with the [[European Union]] and could potentially one day apply for membership.<ref name="NSC AZ"/>

After gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan became a member of the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], the [[Islamic Development Bank]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name="AZE">{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan – General Information | publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Economy/_GeneralInfo/_generalInfo_e.html| accessdate = 2007-05-22| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070505020428/http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Economy/_GeneralInfo/_generalInfo_e.html| archivedate= 5 May 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The banking system of Azerbaijan consists of the [[Central Bank of Azerbaijan]], [[commercial bank]]s and non-banking credit organizations. The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR. The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the [[Azerbaijani manat]], and to supervise all commercial banks. Two major commercial banks are UniBank and the state-owned [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]], run by [[Jahangir Hajiyev|Dr. Jahangir Hajiyev]].

Pushed up by spending and demand growth, the 2007 [[First quarter of a calendar year|Q1]] inflation rate reached 16.6%.<ref name="INF">{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan's Q1 inflation rate 16.6%, National Bank Chief says | publisher = Today.Az| url = http://www.un-az.org/undp/bulnews48/e3.php| accessdate = 29 May 2007}}</ref> Nominal incomes and monthly wages climbed 29% and 25% respectively against this figure, but price increases in non-oil industry encouraged inflation in the country.<ref name="INF"/> Azerbaijan shows some signs of the so-called "[[Dutch disease]]" because of the fast-growing energy sector, which causes inflation and makes non-energy exports more expensive.

In the early years of this century the chronically high inflation was brought under control and this led to the launch of a new currency, the new Azerbaijani manat, on 1 January 2006, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mehdizade| first = Sevinj| title =Azerbaijan's New Manats: Design and Transition to a New Currency | publisher = Azerbaijan International| url = http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai143_folder/143_articles/143_manat.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ismayilov|first=Rovshan|title=Azerbaijan's Manat Makeover: Good Times Ahead?|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/business/articles/eav030106.shtml|publisher=EurasiaNet|accessdate=7 December 2010}}</ref>

Azerbaijan also eliminated the minimum loan cutoff of $1,100, more than doubling the number of borrowers covered by the credit registry. Also, taxpayers can now file forms and pay their taxes online.

[[File:Shahdag01.jpg|thumb|[[Shahdag Mountain Resort]] is the country's largest winter resort.]]
Tourism is an important part of the [[economy of Azerbaijan]]. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. However, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1990s, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/baku/27857 |title=Rapid Tourism Assessment for the Azerbaijan Tourism Sector Development Program – Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref>

It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays.<ref>[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/388501.html Azərbaycan Qarabağın turizm imkanlarını təbliğ edir] {{az icon}}</ref> In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism.<ref name="Baku Boom Has Yet to Hit Regions">{{cite web| last = Ismayilov| first = Rovshan | authorlink = | title =Azerbaijan: Baku Boom Has Yet to Hit Regions| work = | publisher = EurasiaNet| url = http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav081307.shtml| doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2007| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070819211953/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav081307.shtml| archivedate= 19 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> During winter, the [[Shahdag Mountain Resort]] offers skiing with state of the art facilities.

The [[government of Azerbaijan]] has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination as a top priority. It is a national strategy to make tourism a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.az/?menu=1&submenu=12&lang=eng |title=Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan: Goals |publisher=Tourism.az |date=6 February 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101128233315/http://tourism.az/?menu=1&submenu=12&lang=eng| archivedate= 28 November 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> These activities are regulated by the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan]].

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transportation in Azerbaijan|Rail transport in Azerbaijan}}
The convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the [[Silk Road]] and the south–north corridor, highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country's economy.<ref>{{cite web| last =Ziyadov | first =Taleh | title= The New Silk Roads| publisher = Central Asia-Caucasus Institute Silk Road Studies Program| url = http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/publications/GCA/GCAPUB-10.pdf}}</ref> The transport sector in the country includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport.

Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials. The [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]] (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774&nbsp;kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to 50&nbsp;million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets.<ref>{{cite journal | publisher= The Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, Silk Road Studies Program | author= [[Zeyno Baran]] | title = The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline: Implications for Turkey | url= http://www.silkroadstudies.org/BTC_6.pdf | journal= The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline: Oil Window to the West | pages=103–118 | format=PDF | year=2005 | accessdate=30 December 2007}}</ref> The [[South Caucasus Pipeline]], also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the [[Shah Deniz gas field]].

In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions. In the same year, the country became a member of the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cracowrent.pl/uploads/pliki/CP_Vienna_convention.pdf|title= List of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Road Traffic |publisher = UN Economic Commission for Europe |accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> The highest priority being; upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country, as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.

In 2012, the construction of [[Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway]] expected to provide transportation between Asia and Europe through connecting the railways of China and Kazakhstan in the east with Turkey's [[Marmaray]] to the European railway system in the west. [[Russian gauge|Broad-gauge]] railways in 2010 stretched for {{convert|2918|km|0|abbr=on}} and electrified railways numbered {{convert|1278|km|0|abbr=on}}. By 2010, there were 35 airports and one [[heliport]].<ref name="cia"/>

===Science and technology===

[[File:Shamakhi observatory.jpg|thumbnail|[[Shamakhi Astrophysical Observatory]]]]
In the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors, and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and [[List of Azerbaijani inventions and discoveries|innovation]]. The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.<ref>{{cite news |title=Azerbaijan aims for hi-tech state|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/11/26/azerbaijan-aims-for-hi-tech-state/|publisher=[[Euronews]]|accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref>

The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector. The Ministry of Communications & Information Technologies (MCIT), as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom, is both a policy-maker and regulator. Public pay phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks. Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration. {{As of|2009}}, there were 1,397,000 main telephone lines<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2150rank.html CIA.gov], CIA World Factbook Telephones – main lines in use, Azerbaijan 1,397,000 main lines</ref> and 1,485,000 internet users.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html CIA.gov], CIA World Factbook Internet users, Azerbaijan Internet users: 1,485,000.</ref> There are four [[GSM]] providers: [[Azercell]], [[Bakcell]], Azerfon ([[Nar Mobile]]), [[Nakhtel]] mobile network operators and one [[CDMA]].

In the 21st century a number of prominent Azerbaijani [[geodynamics]] and [[geotectonics]] scientists, inspired by the fundamental works of [[Elchin Khalilov]] and others, designed hundreds of earthquake prediction stations and earthquake-resistant buildings that now constitute the bulk of The Republican Center of Seismic Service.<ref>{{cite news | title =Azerbaijani scientist invents earthquake-resistant building| publisher = News.Az| url = http://www.news.az/articles/society/33169| accessdate = 18 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =International Station for the Forecasting of Earthquakes Atropatena-AZ3, Baku, Azerbaijan | publisher = Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes| url = http://seismonet.org/page.html?id_node=190}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | script-title=ru:Азербайджанский ученый изобрел метод оповещения о землетрясении | publisher = BlackSea News| url = http://www.blackseanews.net/read/14548| accessdate = 29 March 2011|language=ru}}</ref>

The [[Book of Dede Korkut]] consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century,<ref name="Meeker">Michael E. Meeker, "The Dede Korkut Ethic", International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug. 1992), 395–417. excerpt: The Book of Dede Korkut is an early record of oral Turkic folktales in Anatolia, and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves "Turcoman" rather than "Oghuz," had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.</ref> was not written earlier than the 15th century.<ref name="Kafadar">Cemal Kafadar(1995), "in Between Two Worlds: Construction of the Ottoman states", University of California Press, 1995.

Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include ''The Divan of Ghazals'' and ''The Qasidas''. In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of [[Ashik]] ({{lang-az|Aşıq}}) poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of Khatāī ({{lang-ar|خطائی}} for ''sinner'') Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azerbaijani,<ref name="minorsky1">{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Vladimir |year=1942 |title=The Poetry of Shah Ismail |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=10 |issue=4 |page=1053 |url= |quote= |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00090182 }}</ref> which were later published as his ''Divan''.

In the span of the 17th and 18th centuries, Fizuli's unique genres as well [[Ashik]] poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as [[Qovsi of Tabriz]], [[Abbas II of Persia|Shah Abbas Sani]], [[Agha Mesih Shirvani]], [[Nishat (poet)|Nishat]], [[Molla Vali Vidadi]], [[Molla Panah Vagif]], [[Amani (poet)|Amani]], [[Zafar (poet)|Zafar]] and others.

In the mid-19th century, it was taught in the schools of [[Baku]], [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]], [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Tbilisi]], and [[Yerevan]].

This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.

The [[Azerbaijani rug|Azerbaijani carpet]] is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions.

Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery, ceramics, and carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological sites in Dashbulaq, Hasansu, Zayamchai, and Tovuzchai uncovered from the BTC pipeline have revealed early Iron Age artifacts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agt.si.edu/site_overviews/azerbaijan/zayam_tovuz_artifact_catalogue.html|title=Ancient Heritage of the BTC – SCP Pipeline Corridor|website=Smithsonian|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>

Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. Scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of [[Latif Kerimov]], a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.<ref>{{cite web| title =Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | url = http://portal.unesco.org/es/ev.php-URL_ID=31108&URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&URL_SECTION=201.html}}</ref>

In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in [[cinematography]].<ref name="mishon">{{cite news |url= http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html|title=Cinema in Azerbaijan: Pre-Soviet Era|date=Autumn 1997|publisher="Azerbaijan International"|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref> Therefore, it's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in [[Baku]] – at the start of the 20th century, this bay town on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.<ref name="cinemainazerbaijan">[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html Celebrating 100 Years in Film, not 80] by Aydin Kazimzade.

This also influenced the creation of [[Azerbaijani animation]].<ref name="ocaz"/>

In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming 2 August to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.<ref name="mishon"/>

===Media and media freedom===
{{Main|Media of Azerbaijan|Media freedom in Azerbaijan}}
There are three state-owned television channels: [[AzTV]], [[Idman Azerbaijan TV|Idman TV]] and [[Medeniyyet TV]]. One public channel and 6 private channels: [[İctimai Television]], [[ANS TV]], [[Space TV]], [[Lider TV]], [[Azad Azerbaijan TV]], [[Xazar TV]] and [[Region TV]].

Print and broadcast media in Azerbaijan are almost wholly under control of the ruling Aliyev family, eventually through friendly intermediaries.<ref>Kazimova, Arifa: "Media in Azerbaijan: The Ruling Family Dominates TV, the Opposition Has Some Papers" in the [http://www.laender-analysen.de/cad/pdf/CaucasusAnalyticalDigest25.pdf ''Caucasus Analytical Digest No. 25'']</ref> Ownership opacity is backed by law. Azerbaijan hosts 9 national TV stations (of which a public service broadcaster and 3 more state-run channels), over 12 regional TV stations, 25 radio channels, over 30 daily newspapers. Opposition media manages to work on the perpetual brink of survival.<ref name=FH>[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/azerbaijan Azerbaijan] 2015 Press Freedom report</ref>

The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]] guarantees freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice. After several years of decline in press and media freedom, in 2014 the media environment in Azerbaijan deteriorated fast under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the [[Council of Europe]] (May–November 2014). Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm.<ref name=pace>Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]], [http://www.cfom.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PACE-HORSLEY-FINAL-2014-REPORT-AAC-25_14-Flego-protection-of-media-freedom-18-June.pdf The Protection of media freedom in Europe].Background report prepared by Mr William Horsley, special representative for media freedom of the [[Association of European Journalists]]</ref> All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country.<ref name="FH"/>

According to their 2013 [[Freedom of the Press (report)|Freedom of the Press report]], Azerbaijan's press freedom status is "not free" and Azerbaijan ranks 156th out of 179 countries world-wide.<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/freedom-press-2013 ''Freedom of the Press 2013"], Freedom House, 1 May 2013.</ref>

The three broadcasting stations [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] and [[Voice of America]], which were the only ones that ensured political pluralism for its citizens, are banned in Azerbaijan since 2009.<ref>[http://en.rsf.org/report-azerbaijan,91.html Azerbaijan – Reporters Without Borders]. Retrieved 22 February 2013</ref>
During the last few years, three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international human rights organizations. Azerbaijan has the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in Europe and Central Asia in 2015, according to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], and is the 5th most censored country in the world, ahead of Iran and China.<ref>[https://cpj.org/blog/2015/06/baku-2015-press-freedom-azerbaijan-and-the-europea.php Committee to Protect Journalists]</ref>
