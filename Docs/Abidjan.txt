'''Abidjan''' is the economic capital of [[Ivory Coast]] and the most populous French-speaking city in [[West Africa]]. According to the 2014 Ivory Coast census, Abidjan's population was 4.7 million, which is 20 percent of the overall population of the country. Within West Africa, only [[Lagos]], the former capital of [[Nigeria]], surpasses Abidjan in population. Considered the cultural crossroads of West Africa, Abidjan is characterised by a high level of industrialisation and urbanisation.

The city grew up quickly after the construction of a new wharf in 1931, followed by its designation as the capital city of the then-French colony in 1933. Abidjan remained the capital of Ivory Coast after its independence from France in 1960. The completion of the [[Vridi Canal]] in 1951 enabled Abidjan to become an important [[sea port]]. In 1983, the city of [[Yamoussoukro]] was designated as the official political capital of Cote d'Ivoire. However, almost all political institutions and foreign [[embassy|embassies]] continue to be located in Abidjan. Because Abidjan is also the largest city in the country and the centre of its economic activity, it has officially been designated as the "economic capital" of the country.

The '''Abidjan Autonomous District''', which encompasses the city and some of its suburbs, is one of the 14 [[districts of Ivory Coast]].

== Geography ==
[[File:CarteSituationAbidjan.svg|thumb|Location map of Abidjan]]
Abidjan lies on the south-east coast of the country in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The city is located on the [[Ébrié Lagoon]]. The business district [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Le Plateau]] is the center of the city, along with [[Cocody]], [[Deux Plateaux]] (the city's wealthiest neighborhood and a hub for diplomats), and  [[Adjamé]], a [[slum]] on the north shore of the lagoon. [[Treichville]] and [[Marcory]] lie to the south, [[Attecoube]], Locodjro, Abobo Doume and [[Yopougon]] to the west, and  [[Île Boulay]] is located in the middle of the lagoon. Further south lies [[Port Bouët]], home to the [[Port Bouet Airport|airport]] and main [[seaport]]. Abidjan is located at 5°25′ North, 4°2′ West (5.41667, −4.03333).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |title=GNS: Country Files |publisher=Earth-info.nga.mil |accessdate=28 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110509082929/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html| archivedate=9 May 2011| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
The city has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: Aw) with a long rainy season from May through July, a short rainy season (September–November) and two dry seasons, though rain is seen even during these dry seasons. Abidjan is generally humid throughout the year, with humidity generally at or higher than 80 percent. During the rainy season it can rain continuously for several consecutive days, or intensely for over an hour. The rainfall is abundant at about 2,000&nbsp;mm per year.<ref>Atlas de la Côte d'Ivoire, 2 éd de Pierre Vennetier et Geneviève Daverat (1983)</ref> The monthly rainfall varies between about 20&nbsp;mm and 500&nbsp;mm in January to June and the temperature is almost constant at around {{convert|27|°C|°F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentsoftheworld.info/pagegeo_fr.php3?Pays=CIV |title=Températures et précipitations à Abidjan |publisher=Studentsoftheworld.info |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

=== Territorial division ===
Abidjan is informally composed of two parts (northern Abidjan and southern Abidjan) with ten formal boroughs, or communes, each being run by a mayor.

==== Communes of Northern Abidjan ====
[[File:Toursplateau1.jpg|right|thumb|Some buildings in the Plateau]]
*'''[[Abobo]]''' consists mainly of public housing. Abobo has a significant population of migrants with low financial means. This area has developed spontaneously around the station.
*'''[[Adjamé]]''' developed from the village of [[Ébrié]], which existed before Abidjan developed. Although small in size and polluted, this commune is commercially very important for the Ivorian economy. Its market contains a varied shopping district and its bus station is the Ivory Coast's main hub for international bus lines.
*'''[[Yopougon]]''' is the most populous commune of Abidjan, lying partly in Northern Abidjan and partly across the lagoon in Southern Abidjan. It is home to industrial and residential areas. The research station [[ORSTOM]], [[Pasteur Institute]], and a teaching hospital are located in this commune.
*'''[[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Plateau]]''' is Ivory Coast's business center, with very modern, tall buildings. Although the governmental and administrative capital of Ivory Coast was officially transferred to [[Yamoussoukro]] in 1983, the institutions of the republic such as the Presidency and National Assembly are still located in Plateau. It is the main administrative commercial and financial center of Ivory Coast.
*'''[[Attécoubé]]''' contains Banco forest, classified as a national park. 
*'''[[Cocody]]''' is famous for its residential districts Deux-Plateaux and Riviera. The [[University of Cocody]], a public institution, and some private universities are located within the commune. [[Radio Television Ivoirienne (RTI)]] is located in Cocody. The President of the Republic resides in this commune. Cocody also contains the embassy district.

==== Communes of Southern Abidjan ====
[[File:Abidjanvridi.jpg|Beach of Vridi|thumb|upright]]

*'''[[Koumassi]]''': This commune has an important industrial area.
*'''[[Marcory]]''': This commune is mainly a residential area.
** [[Biétry]] and Zone 4 are residential areas where many foreigners live
*'''[[Port-Bouët]]''': This commune includes both a refinery ([[Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage SIR]]) and the [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny International Airport]]. There is also an established office of the [[Institut de Recherche pour le Développement|IRD]], the centre of Little Bassam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ird.ci/ird/petitbassam.html |title=Centre des Sciences Sociales |website=[[Institut de recherche pour le développement|IRD]] |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207201015/http://www.ird.ci/ird/petitbassam.html |archivedate=7 December 2008}}</ref> The famous [[lighthouse]] sweeps the [[Gulf of Guinea]] for several nautical miles.
** [[Vridi]]: the beach area is busy every weekend, although the ocean is very aggressive the "bar" does a little to move away from the shore, a phenomenon widely along the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. From 1950, Vridi has become the main employment areas in Abidjan because of the increasing number of factories and warehouses
*'''[[Treichville]]''': This commune is home to the [[Autonomous Port of Abidjan]] and many shops. The port area is also an industrial area. There is also the pool of State Treichville (PET), the palace of sports Treichville, [[Palace of Culture of Abidjan|the Palace of Culture]], street 12, [[racetrack]] Abidjan.
** [[Île Boulay]].

==== Suburbs ====
The main towns which are near Abidjan are [[Jacqueville]], [[Grand-Lahou]] and [[Dabou]] in the west; [[Sikensi]], [[Tiassalé]], [[Agboville]], [[Adzopé]] and [[Aleppo]] in the north; and [[Grand-Bassam]] to the east.

The towns (or [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]]) of [[Anyama]], [[Bingerville]], [[Brofodoumé]] and [[Songon]] are within the [[Abidjan Department]], which is co-extensive with the autonomous district.

== <span id=Toponymy></span>Origin of the name "Abidjan" ==
According to [[oral tradition]] of the [[Ebrié|Ébrié]] as reported in the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Côte d'Ivoire,<ref>de R. Borremans (1986)</ref> the name "Abidjan" results from a misunderstanding. Legend states that an old man carrying branches to repair the roof of his house met a European explorer who asked him the name of the nearest village. The old man did not speak the language of the explorer, and thought that he was being asked to justify his presence in that place. Terrified by this unexpected meeting, he fled shouting "''min-chan m'bidjan''", which means in the Ébrié language: "I just cut the leaves." The explorer, thinking that his question had been answered, recorded the name of the locale as ''Abidjan''.

A slightly different and less elaborate version of the legend: When the first colonists asked a native man the name of the place, the man misunderstood and replied "''M'bi min djan''": "I've just been cutting leaves".<ref name="statoids1">{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/uci.html |title=Côte d'Ivoire Regions |publisher=Statoids.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Abidjan}}

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:Piroguiers - cleaned b&w.jpg|thumb|Abidjan boatmen.]]

Abidjan was originally a small fishing village. In 1896, following a series of deadly [[yellow fever]] epidemics, the French colonists who first settled in Bassam decided to move to a safer place. They located in the current location of Abidjan in 1898, and in 1903 it received town status.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Abidjan|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=32}}</ref> Their movement was followed by the colonial government created in 1899, although nearby [[Bingerville]] became capital of the French colony from 1900 until 1934.

The future Abidjan, situated on the edge of the ''lagoon n'doupé'' ("the lagoon in hot water, "future "Ébrié Lagoon"), offered more space and greater opportunities for trade expansion. The wharf in Petit Bassam (now [[Port-Bouet]]) south of the town, quickly overtook in importance the wharf of [[Grand-Bassam]], hitherto the main economic access to the colony. In 1904, the rail terminus was located in the [[Port-Bouet]] area of Abidjan.<ref name=EB/> From 1904, when [[Bingerville]] was not yet complete, Abidjan became the main economic hub of the colony of Ivory Coast and a prime channel for distributing products to the European hinterland, particularly through the Lebanese community which was increasingly important.

[[Henri Terrasson de Fougères]] became governor of French Sudan in 1924, and remained the governor until his death in 1931. One of the main streets of Abidjan still bears his name.

In 1931, Plateau and what became [[Treichville]] were connected approximately at the position of the bridge Houphouet Boigny by a floating bridge. That year, it was first addressed as the streets of Abidjan. It temporarily held the name in 1964, under the leadership of Mayor Konan Kanga, completed by the Americans in 1993.

Abidjan became the third capital of Ivory Coast, after [[Grand-Bassam]] and [[Bingerville]] in 1934.<ref name=EB/> Several villages in Tchaman were then deserted. It is particularly Adjame ("center" in Tchaman), located at the north of the Plateau, which is still the leader of the Tchaman community.

South of the Plateau district (the current central district of the city of Abidjan), the village of ''Dugbeo'' was moved across the lagoon to Anoumabo, "the forest of fruit bats", which became the neighborhood of [[Treichville]] (now Commikro). This area was thus renamed in 1934 in honour of [[Marcel Treich-Laplénie]] (1860–1890), the first explorer of Ivory Coast and its first colonial administrator, considered its founder. Instead of Dugbeyo, is the current Treich Laplénie Avenue, the bus station and water lagoon buses in Plateau, and the Avenue [[Charles de Gaulle]] (commonly called Rue du Commerce).

The city was laid out like the usual colonial towns as a [[grid plan]]. [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Le Plateau]] ("m'brato" in Tchaman) was inhabited by settlers. In the north, the city was inhabited by the colonized. The two zones were separated by the [[Gallieni]] Military Barracks, instead of the current courthouse.

Near the port and along a petanque, originally named Boulevard de Marseille, facetious settlers who had "borrowed" a street sign of a famous street of Marseille renamed the street Canebière, a sand track. This is the legend behind the first Blohorn oil mills, in [[Cocody]]. A racetrack was built in the south of the city that never stops growing.

Le Plateau in the 1940s, the hotel grew and became Bardon Park Hotel, the first air-conditioned hotel working in [[francophone Africa]].

Abidjan's lagoon became connected to the sea once the 15m deep [[Vridi Canal]] was completed in 1950.<ref name=EB/> Soon Abidjan would become the financial center of West Africa. In 1958, the first bridge to connect [[Petit Bassam|Petit-Bassam Island]] with the mainland was completed.<ref name=EB/>

=== After independence ===
After independence in 1960, the old settler town became the administrative center and business headquarters of the Presidency. The axis south of [[Treichville]], towards the international airport and the beaches, became the headquarters of European and middle-class Abidjan. There, in November 2004, focus was on the anti-French riots and looting. The [[Cocody]] district, famous for a gentleman embodied in film by [[Jean Marais]], which should be a vast indigenous district according to the colonial urban pattern, became an upscale neighborhood including the presidential residence, the embassy of France, Hotel Ivoire (which for a long time, was the only African hotel to have a skating rink), and since 2006, the largest U.S. embassy in Africa. Large areas have grown popular among these clusters, extended by areas of poor housing and poverty fed by the rural exodus and sub-regional immigration.

In 1983, the village of [[Yamoussoukro]] became the new political capital of Ivory Coast under the leadership of President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], who was born there.

Since 1999, Abidjan has suffered from the consequences of the civil war. Since the 1980s, despite undeniable improvements and because of the negligence of officials, corruption as well as general degradation of the city of Abidjan has been prevalent. In 2006, a mass poisoning of people by pollutants dumped in landfills occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/081/article_45984.asp |title=Intoxication à Abidjan |publisher=Rfi.fr |date=17 February 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> ([[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump|case of the Probo Koala]]).

== Politics ==

=== Administration ===

==== Organisation ====
Formerly managed by the French "colonial administration", Abidjan became a municipality in 1956, and was divided into administrative areas by lagoons. Its first municipal council was elected on 18 November 1956, and the first mayor in the context of the Framework Law of 1956 was president [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]. A law of 1978 established twenty-seven municipalities full year in the country. After the application of this new organization, [[Dioulo Emmanuel]] was elected mayor of Abidjan on 30 November 1980.

Since 2001, the city has been divided into ten boroughs (communes). In 2011, the automous district of Abidjan was established,<ref>Décret n° 2011-263 du 28 septembre 2011 portant organisation du territoire national en Districts et en Régions.</ref> with rural sub-prefectures in  [[Anyama]], [[Bingerville]], [[Brofodoumé]], and [[Songon]]. The autonomous district is co-extensive with the [[Abidjan Department]], which was established in 1969 and has had its current boundaries since 1998. In 2011, the post of Mayor of Abidjan was replaced by the District Governor, appointed by the head of state. The position has been occupied by [[Robert Beugré Mambé]] since 2011. Each of the ten communes of Abidjan has its own municipal council headed by a mayor. The last municipal elections were held in March 2001. The sub-prefectures of the autonomous district also have their own mayors and councils.

The communes of Abobo, Adjamé, Attécoubé, Cocody, and Plateau are located north of the Ébrié Lagoon (hence the name "Abidjan North"). This is the continental part of Abidjan.
The commune of Yopougon straddles the lagoon, with part lying north and part south of that body of water. The communes of [[Treichville]], Koumassi, Marcory, and Port-Bouet in Abidjan are south of the lagoon.

[[Blokosso]] and Locodjro villages are included within the city and maintain cultural identity in urban areas.

== Places of interest ==
[[File:AbidjanSib.JPG|thumb|right|Le Plateau, Abidjan]]

The [[University of Abidjan]] (1958),<ref name=EB/> several technical colleges, and the [[National Library of Ivory Coast]] and [[National museum]] are in the city.

Sights in Abidjan include [[Cathédrale Saint-Paul d'Abidjan|St Paul's Cathedral]], designed by [[Aldo Spirito]], the [[Cocody Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art]] and the [[Parc du Banco]] [[rainforest]] reserve. Plateau is known for its skyscrapers, unusual in West Africa.

''Plateau'' is the business centre of Abidjan. With its gleaming skyscrapers, chic boutiques, and outdoor cafes, Plateau is a favourite place of business travelers. There are many different banks located in the ''Plateau'' district.

=== Government institutions ===
[[File:Asnat codivoire.jpg|thumb|Seat of the [[National Assembly of Cote d'Ivoire]]]]

The majority of Ivorian government institutions are still located in Abidjan and have not been transferred to the political capital Yamoussoukro. The President's office is in [[Cocody]],<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.présidence.ci Le site officiel de la présidence de Côte d'Ivoire]</ref> and the parliament,<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.premierministre.ci Site officiel de la Primature de la République ivoirienne]</ref> the [[Constitutional Council (Ivory Coast)|Constitutional Council]], the Supreme Court, and the Chancellery of the National Order are all in [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Plateau]]. Under the presidency of [[Laurent Gbagbo]] (2000–11), efforts were made to give effect to the project of making the political capital Yamoussoukro in Ivory Coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courrierinternational.com/article.asp?obj_id=13683 |title=Article de Courrier International |work=Courrier International |location=France |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> This goal continues to be the consensus of the country's political leaders.

Government offices are located in [[Le Plateau]]<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.gouv.ci Portail officiel du gouvernement ivoirien]</ref> in the administrative district of Abidjan, Boulevard Carde or Angoulvant Boulevard (near the Cathedral of St. Paul of Abidjan), or elsewhere in the great buildings of the town.

=== Security ===
Since 2004, when virtually all prisoners of Abidjan were released from prison, insecurity has increased significantly: increase in crimes and misdemeanors, increased drug seizures. Besides the presence of the police, gendarmerie, the impartial forces (UNOCI whose headquarters are in [[Attécoubé]] and a large base to [[Biétry]]), French soldiers based in [[Port-Bouet]] and the Ivorian army, were created in the 2000 by the CECOS and several private security firms.

In 2007, ''Permanent Danger'' by [[Pierre Laba]] a film about the laxity of the police against the banditry in major African cities in the image of the Ivorian capital was out in cinema

==== Police ====
Abidjan is divided into districts, each of which has a police station. The municipal police and national police are distinguished.

The police's training center (National Police Academy) located in the town of Cocody, where all police are trained. They are recruited by competitive examination held by the police administration. The policy includes several sections, it is the BAE (Anti Riot Squad), whose base is located in the Yopougon north of the city, the CRS (Republican Security Company), whose main base is located in Williamsville (Adjame) also includes a secondary base called CRS2 which is located in zone 4 in the town of Marcory (central capital).

The Force and CECOS (Command Center Security Operations) accompany the police.

The main base of the gendarmerie is Agban (common Adjamé), another in Abobo and Kumasi, It also has training school "School de Gendarmerie" in Cocody and the city.

==== Drugs ====
Since 2000, Ivory Coast has experienced a sharp rise in drug trafficking. The drug dens occur mainly in informal settlements and there has been a recent spike in demand among the young unemployed and Ivorian vagrants. The Ivorian police are increasingly focused on the fight against trafficking and drug use in the district of Abidjan. A report by the Office of the UN says West Africa plays an increasingly important role in the transit of cocaine to Latin American and Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/09/21/africa.drug.cartels/ |title=Latin American drug cartels find home in West Africa |first=Arthur |last=Brice |date=21 September 2009 |website=[[CNN|CNN.com]]}}</ref> According to an investigation by the commission for the fight against drug trafficking UN, 46 percent of youth in West Africa is dependent on the drug.

=== French military base ===
Abidjan is home to [[Port-Bouet]], one of the six French military bases that still exist in Africa ([[Dakar]], [[Libreville]], [[Bouar]] CAR, [[N'Djamena]] and [[Djibouti]]). Thousands of people live there, around the 43rd BIMA which is permanently parked in accordance with established defense agreements 24 April 1961 linking the two countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.diplomatie.gouv.fr/BASIS/pacte/webext/bilat/SDF?TOUSTI=d%E9fense |title=Accords et Traités |publisher=Doc.diplomatie.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref>

=== Relationships and partnerships ===

==== Diplomacy and international bodies ====
Abidjan is the regional headquarters of major international institutions: [[UNICEF]], [[UN Development Program]], [[World Health Organization]], [[World Food Program]], [[UNOPS]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unops.org/english/where-we-work/africa/Pages/default.aspx |title=UNOPS in Africa |website=[[United Nations Office for Project Services|UNOPS]]}}</ref> [[UNFPA]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.unfpa.org/docs/civ |title=Cote D'Ivoire |website=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}</ref> [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), etc.

The great nations of the world all have representation in Abidjan, most of which serve sub-region

The American Embassy is located in Ivory Coast<ref>{{cite web|url=http://french.cotedivoire.usembassy.gov |title=Site de l'ambassade des États-Unis |publisher=French.cotedivoire.usembassy.gov |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> while the [[African Development Bank]] (ADB)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.izf.net/IZF/FicheIdentite/BAD.htm |title=La BAD |publisher=Izf.net |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> moved for a while to [[Tunisia]], which is the largest financial institution in Africa.

=== Miscellaneous ===
In the 1980s, [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] took refuge in Abidjan after his ouster from power in the Central Africa Republic.

== Society ==
The 1998 Census revealed Abidjan's population to be 2,877,923. Estimates for the population of the Abidjan metropolitan area {{As of|2005|lc=on}} vary between 4 and 5 million inhabitants. As Abidjan is inhabited by people from a wide array of different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]], the French language is used as the language of communication in the [[metropolitan area]], which is the third-largest French speaking metropolitan area in the world after Paris and [[Kinshasa]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reference needed. The "largest french speaking" city/urban area/metropolitan area in the world after "Paris, etc." is claimed also in the articles of [[Kinshasa]] and [[Montreal]]. An authoritative reference is needed so that the relative sizes of these Francophone cities is acknowledged in the different artlces|date=June 2009}} A specific colloquial Abidjan French has even appeared, with a pronunciation and some colloquial words distinct from standard French. The area of Abidjan is recognized as one of a few areas in Africa where French (colloquial Abidjan French) is truly a native tongue,<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.amazon.fr/dp/2271059682 ''Le français à Abidjan : Pour une approche syntaxique du non-standard''] by Katja Ploog, [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS Editions]], Paris, 2002.</ref> along with [[Libreville]], Gabon.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/afrique/Gabon.htm "De plus, le français est également devenu la langue maternelle de plus de 30 % des Librevillois et il est de plus en plus perçu comme une langue gabonaise."]</ref>

=== Demographics ===
The population of Abidjan was 4,707,404 at the 2014 Census. In 2006, the metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase can be attributed to the displacement caused by the war (since September 2002). This city has many inhabitants who come to live downtown because they seek employment and safer lodgings.

[[File:Abidjan Centre1.JPG|thumb|right|Abidjan Centre]]
By 1950, Abidjan had just exceeded a population of 50,000 (at the end of 1948). Reaching a population of a million by the end of 1975, the city grew at a rate of 10 to 12% per year: a doubling every 6 or 7 years. However, this growth underwent a sharp decline due to the crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In the last 20 years of the 20th century, the growth rate dropped to 3–6%. Growth by birth rate was supplemented by migration, with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly compensating the arrivals. Positive migration, prior to the census of 1988, contributed a growth of about 80,000 with 50,000 people from within Ivory Coast, and about 30,000 from abroad per year. From within Ivory Coast, the migration pattern was dominated by [[Akan people|Akan]] (South-east, 48%), then [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] (North-west, 24%) and [[Krumen people|Krou]] (South-west, 20%). From abroad, the migration was [[Burkina Faso|Burkinabes]] (30%), Malians (22%), Ghanaians (19%), Nigerien (11%), and Guineans (9%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/education/ACTES/Com_Zanou.PDF |title=Strategies Educatives En Milieu Emigre De La Cote-D'Ivoire |accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref> Of the Non-African migration, Lebanese migration exceeded that of Europeans, with the French being largest of these. All in all, non-African migration represents hardly 3% of the total population of Abidjan, which is still the highest in the area.

Before 2014, the last population census in the country had taken place in 1998. It presented 2,877,948 inhabitants for the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digital-afrique.com/villafrique1/abidjan/city/index.asp?id=056 |title=La Ville d'Abidjan: Population |website=Digital Afrique |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928162745/http://www.digital-afrique.com/villafrique1/abidjan/city/index.asp?id=056 |archivedate=28 September 2007}}</ref>

The figures for 2006 estimated the population of Abidjan to 3,796,677 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase is mainly due to war-displaced since the events of September 2002. The town hosts many people in search of both jobs and a more secure

A new census was held in May 2014. The provisional returns produced a population for the city of 4,707,404.

=== Languages ===
The traditional language of the city was [[Ebrié language|Ebrié]]. Since independence, the [[official language]] in Abidjan and throughout Ivory Coast is French. While the official language is a formal variety similar to that of France, the most common form of [[African French#Abidjan French vocabulary|French spoken in Abidjan]] is a colloquial dialect known as ''français de Treichville'' or ''français de Moussa'' and differs from standard French in pronunciation and in some of its vocabulary. Another form of spoken French in Abidjan is ''[[Nouchi]]'', a highly informal variety used as adolescent slang. The historical lingua franca, still spoken and understood by most of the trading population of Abidjan, is [[Dioula language|Dioula]]. Finally, the city hosts many Ivorians from all over the country and so all the vernacular languages of the country, about sixty, are spoken, such as Attié, Baoulé, Bété, and Wobé.

Abidjan is surrounded by more than thirty villages where [[Baoulé language|Baoulé]] and Ebrié are still commonly spoken.

=== Education ===
In Ivory Coast, the enrollment rate is 74%<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/livre244/l24424.pdf |title=La Scolarisation en Côte d'Ivoire |first=Noël Kouassi |last=Ayewa |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625164113/http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/livre244/l24424.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2007}}</ref> and access to secondary education is limited by an entrance assessment at the 6th stage after which one-third of students are allowed to continue their studies. 24% of the student population resides in Abidjan, out of 20% of the population. Abidjan is the location of the main educational institutions in the Ivory Coast. These include the Lycée Classique d'Abidjan, the Lycée Sainte-Marie de Cocody Lycée Boy Bingerville Mami Adjoua the Lyceum, the Blaise Pascal Abidjan school is a French school – meaning a school who has signed an agreement with the ADFE. Recently the Lycée International Jean-Mermoz re-opened its door to students. Initially called College International Jean-Mermoz, founded by Pierre Padovani. The Institution suffered from a devastating war and was forced to close. However, the good news is that the country is safe and the Lycée International Jean-Mermoz opened its door to students from all cultures and origins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adfe.org |title=Site de l'ADFE |publisher=Adfe.org |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

=== Health ===
Some traditional medicine establishments sell old drugs in the street.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} There are numerous health centers, pharmacies and pharmacopoeias.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The city has more than fifty clinics, and over sixty specialist locations (veterinary, [[dermatology]], dental, [[optometry]], motherhood, psychology, [[pediatrics]], etc.){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

=== Urbanism and habitat ===
Modern districts like [[Le Plateau, Abidjan|Plateau]] or [[Cocody]] have developed like those in Europe with the construction of large office towers, apartment buildings between the 1970s and the mid-1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/fr/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100024&bt=5&ht=2&sro=0 |title=Abidjan – Immeubles de grandes hauteurs existant |publisher=Emporis |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

Traditional neighborhoods like [[Treichville]] or [[Marcory]] maintained the system of "concessions" where housing is adjacent to the plant and the system of "court" group of which several houses, within the normal organization and multi centuries-old villages Africans.<ref>Haeringer Ph., Vingt-cinq ans de politique urbaine à Abidjan ou la tentation de l'urbanisme intégral, Politique Africaine, n°17, 20–40, 1985</ref>

The district of Cocody is also home to many single-storey wooden villas, surrounded by vast gardens where there is lush vegetation fed by heavy rains that water the city. Recently, it became "fashionable" for wealthier inhabitants to construct villas in imitation of Greek temples in this district. In addition, many houses were built on stilts on the edge of the Ébrié Lagoon.

The town hall, a fine example of modernist architecture, was designed by architect [[Henry Chomette]].

==== Problems with urban network ====
[[File:Abidjan-Plateau1.JPG|thumb|Urban Network in Le Plateau]]

The urban network is disrupted as Abidjan has seen its population double every seven years since 1945. Rural people attracted by the opportunities of the future of the city form the bulk of inward migration. Abidjan represents 45 percent of city dwellers in Ivory Coast and 20 percent of the overall population. However, if a significant rise was observed for half a century, its growth would not have been more than 4.5 percent per year (compared to 10 percent from 1960 to 1990) and we find more than one third of Rural involved in the growth of the city (two-thirds from 1960 to 1990). Despite this decline, the city is still the most populated in comparison to the second largest city in the country, [[Bouaké]] (which had 542,082 inhabitants in 2014) or the political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]] (with 207,412 inhabitants in 2014).

==== Urban squalor ====
{{POV-section|date=October 2013}}
Despite the case of the Probo Koala-2006,<ref>Probo-Koala : la mortelle errance d'un bateau-poubelle, ''Le Monde'', 29 septembre 2006</ref> sanitary conditions which affect Africa could be solved in Abidjan. Indeed, a contract was signed between China and Ivory Coast: a Chinese company handling urban waste and industrial plans to treat all waste district this transformation also create daily cleaning. The project is funded 60 percent by China and 40 percent by Ivory Coast. A gigantic waste treatment center is built at Attengué. 15,000 permanent jobs and 5,000 seasonal jobs will be created through this project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.abidjan.net/videos/video_wm.asp?n=4467&cat=pol |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210206/http://news.abidjan.net/videos/video_wm.asp?n=4467&cat=pol |title=Salubrité urbaine : Signature d’un accord entre la chine et le District d’Abidjan |website=Abidjan.net |language=French |archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref>

==== Urban rehabilitation ====
The last building program of roads in Abidjan, led to the consolidation of certain roads in the capital in 1994. Since May 2007, the company Ageroute (Road Management Agency) is undertaking major operations in Abidjan and [[Anyama]]. These works relating to roads badly damaged, suffering from lack of maintenance, and heavy rain events, gutters, roads not tarred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediaf.org/fr/pays/fiche.php?itm=2124&md=&thm=&p=16 |title=Article du Matin d'Abidjan |publisher=Mediaf.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206231145/http://www.mediaf.org/fr/pays/fiche.php?itm=2124&md=&thm=&p=16 |archivedate=6 February 2008}}</ref> The District and BNETD plan to rehabilitate and construct {{convert|400|to(-)|500|mi|km|abbr=off}}, providing them with a quality 15 to 20 years of life.

Improvements include the rehabilitation of roads in Abidjan and [[Anyama]], construction of drains, the tarring of gravel roads and sanitation of the city by the construction of sewers. These rehabilitations affect all municipalities in Abidjan:

* In [[Cocody]], at a cost of 3&nbsp;billion CFA francs, was taken to the reconstruction of the Corniche, one of the busiest routes in the municipality. Reconstruction has been extended by the dam of the limit, located at the crossroads of life, to filter all runoff from their waste before they throw themselves into the lagoon.
* At [[Yopougon]], the rehabilitation nerve Sand continues with the construction of a culvert {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=off}} long designed to slow the streaking wastewater, the main cause of degradation pathways.
* In [[Abobo]] extent of degradation of the road requires a significant investment in manufacturing and installation of gutters to ensure proper sanitation. The rehabilitation of roads and highways continues.

== Economy ==
The principal stock exchange of the country, the [[Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières]] (BRVM), is located in the city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} [[Air Ivoire]] has its head office in Abidjan.<ref>"[http://www.airivoire.com/a_propos/index.php?page=contacts Contacts]." [[Air Ivoire]]. Retrieved 8 October 2009.</ref>

Prior to its dissolution, [[Air Afrique]] was headquartered in Abidjan.<ref>"World Airline Directory." ''Flight International''. 30 March 1985. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200893.html 33]." Retrieved on 17 June 2009.</ref>

== Industry ==
Major industries include [[food processing]], [[lumber]], automobile manufacturing, and the manufacture of textiles, [[chemical industry|chemicals]], and soap. There is also a large [[oil refinery]].

The region of the lagoons is the most industrialized region of the country.

Its industries are mainly Construction and Maintenance with the presence of major international groups: the furnace SETAO, Colas, Bouygues, [[Jean Lefebvre]], and Swiss Holcim.

There are textile industries with the packaging of the grown cotton in the north either for export or for on-site processing of cloth, canvas, batik clothing and miscellaneous. The textile sector is very dynamic, representing 15.6% of net investment, 13% of turnover and 24% of the value added of Ivorian industry.

There are several oil wells off the coast offshore operations (Ivory Coast is an oil producing country, even if it is not self-sufficient in this area), which leads to the presence chemical industry with refineries pétrole,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbendi.co.za/french/RESI.HTM |title=Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage (SIR) – Simple Oil Refinery in Vridi, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire |publisher=Mbendi.co.za |date= |accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref> et un port pour [[hydrocarbures]], and a port for oil. It also works on stones and precious metals for exportation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notre-planete.info/actualites/actu_1209_moratoire_interdiction_commerce_ivoire.php |title=Interdiction du commerce international de l'ivoire |publisher=Notre-planete.info |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

The city also has a large wood processing activity mainly at the port by river from the forests of central Canada. It is exported either as natural as [[mahogany]] which was already sold two centuries ago by the English Victorian or in a semi-industrialized: peeled wood, plywood, chipboard.

In the food industry mainly include: the production of oil palm, processing of bergamot and Seville oranges, processing of rubber from plantations in the west, the manufacture of beverages from pineapples, oranges<ref>En Afrique de l'Ouest, les oranges ont la peau verte</ref> and mangoes, and especially the roasting of coffee, robust type, came from the plantations of the West whose country is the third largest producer, behind [[Colombia]] and Brazil<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tkwa.free.fr/lespaysproducteurs.php |title=Carte des pays producteurs de café |publisher=Tkwa.free.fr |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> as well as packaging and processing of cocoa, including [[Ivory Coast]]'s, the world's leading producer to [[Ghana]] and [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/francais/cacao/marche.htm |title=Le marché du cacao |publisher=Unctad.org |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> (37% of cocoa and 10% of coffee products undergo at least one first local processing). Abidjan is also the first African tuna port, and three plants condition tuna primarily for the European market. This activity generates about 3,000 salaried jobs, and is an important source of foreign exchange.

As in all countries of the Third World developing countries, much of the city's economy lies in what economists describe as informal economy<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN02103lcononajdib0 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927195014/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN02103lcononajdib0 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=L'économie parallèle, béquille d'Abidjan. |language=French |date=2001-10-02 |first=Paul |last=Loubière}}</ref> with its many "odd jobs".<ref>Abdou Touré, La civilisation quotidienne en Côte d'Ivoire: Les petits métiers à Abidjan, Éditions Karthala, 1982</ref>

=== Tertiary sector ===
The development of tertiary industry, with the establishment of international commercial banks and the increasing number of service companies of all types, appears to be the trend of recent years.
Abidjan is the main financial center of [[French West Africa]]. The seat of the common stock exchange of West Africa (BRVM) is located in Abidjan. BRVM is mainly dominated by Ivorian firms.

=== Electricity ===

Trains on the line to [[Ouagadougou]] run from several stations in the city, the most important being in Treichville. Ferries link Treichville, Abobo-Doumé and Le Plateau. [[Port Bouet Airport|Felix Houphouet Boigny International Airport]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aeria.ci/abideng.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040705171600/http://www.aeria.ci/abideng.htm |archivedate=2004-07-05 |title=Abidjan Plan}}</ref> serves the city. Work on a new [[Abidjan Metro|metro system]] has begun, with the beginning of service anticipated in 2020.

==== Transport ====
[[Société des transports Abidjanais|SOTRA]] (Abidjan Transport Company) ensure regular urban transportation in Abidjan via bus, taxi and luggage Line Express.

Sotra has announced the start of work for the use of light rail to Abidjan. The project has three phases at a cost of 125&nbsp;billion CFA francs for a long loop of 32&nbsp;km.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Taxis ====
It is very difficult to imagine the streets of the city without cabs. There are two kinds: the taxi-meter, color orange, which can travel throughout the city, and woro-woro, yellow and green or blue or orange depending on the commune, which are limited to a neighborhood. They are often used in taxi mode

==== Airport ====
[[Port Bouet Airport]] has a large capacity that allows it to accommodate all existing large aircraft. Abidjan is located an hour's flight from all the capitals of the sub-region. Abidjan is served by major airlines in the direction of the great capitals of the world. Headquarters of the former multinational African Air company, Abidjan knows a traffic of nearly 900,000 passengers (1995 figure)

==== Circulation ====
The District<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abidjan-da.ci/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219065904/http://www.abidjan-da.ci/index.html |archivedate=2007-02-19 |title=BIENVENUE}}</ref> has several paved streets and boulevards linking the towns between them and the District across the country. Abidjan has a network of urban bypasses.

River transport is already consistent with the fishing smacks and the many boat-buses connecting the various neighborhoods of the city thrives plan lagoon.

Abidjan is also the bridgehead of the country's only highway linking the city to the administrative and political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]].

==== Port ====
[[File:2009 Abidjan port 3841939455.jpeg|thumb|right|Port of Abidjan, 2009]]
Abidjan has the biggest port in the sub-region (West Africa), which is also the second biggest in Africa; the biggest being in [[Lagos]]. It is a container transshipment port and was opened in 1951 in the presence of the Minister of Overseas and Colonies at the time, [[François Mitterrand]]. Thanks to the 15m deep [[Vridi Canal]], boats with large draughts can dock in the deep-water port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winne.com/ssa/ivorycoast/reports/2007/cp/port_autonome/index.php |title=Le port d'Abidjan |publisher=Winne.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

The Ivory Coast is in the Franc Zone (where the currency is CFA francs), as part of the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]] (WAEMU). Abidjan is the economic centre of both the Ivory Coast and of the whole region, including [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]]; this is mainly because of its deep-water port. The road network in Abidjan (5,600&nbsp;km asphalted in 1995, compared to 1,000kmm in 1970), which covers the whole region, effectively increases its port activity as 50% of the business from Burkina Faso, Mali and [[Niger]] pass through it.

Abidjan receives the bulk of the country's industrial activity; its port alone receiving 60% of ivory park industry. Abidjan has ambitions of oil-production—off-shore production and especially [[refining]] and distribution. In 1995 the port received 12 million tonnes of traffic, of which 5.5&nbsp;million tonnes were petroleum products.

Exports include coffee, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], timber, bananas, [[pineapple]]s, and [[manganese]].<ref name=EB/>

==== Bridges ====
The two-halves of the city, Northern Abidjan and Southern Abidjan, are joined by the Houphouët-Boigny, the Charles de Gaulle and the [[Henri Konan Bédié Bridge|Henri Konan Bédié]] bridges. The two former bridges constructed in the 1950s and 1960s respectively, are located between [[Treichville]] and [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Le Plateau]]. The [[Second Abidjan Bridge|Général-de-Gaulle Bridge]] extends over the immense Valéry Giscard d'Estaing Boulevard which leads to the airport. Both bridges are capacity constrained, especially during rush hour or on the occasion of police and military roadblocks.

A third 1.5&nbsp;km long toll bridge crossing and expressway, the [[Henri Konan Bédié Bridge]] between [[Cocody]] and [[Marcory]] was completed in December 2014.  Project construction began in earnest in the second half of 2012 and requiring the relocation of several homes and businesses opposite the Mille Maquis (the noted restaurant ''la Bâche bleue'' was moved).<ref>{{cite web|author=David Cadasse |url=http://www.afrik.com/article5740.html |title=La Bache bleue |publisher=Afrik.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> According to data reported by the [[African Development Bank]], some 2,499 persons were impacted by the bridge construction and were relocated and compensated.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Henri Konan Bédié Bridge, a masterpiece in the heart of Abidjan|url=http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/the-henri-konan-bedie-bridge-a-masterpiece-in-the-heart-of-abidjan-13858/|website=www.afdb.org|publisher=African Development Bank Group|accessdate=28 January 2015|archivedate=15 December 2014}}</ref>

==== Trains and trams ====
{{Main|Rail transport in Ivory Coast}}
[[File:2014 Abidjan train 14462380563.jpg|thumb|left|Train platform, Abidjan, 2014]]
The city is the foothold for the region's only railway:  the Abidjan-[[Ouagadougou]] line, with stations in [[Treichville]], [[Abobo]] and [[Adjamé]]. This line only has two trains, the ''Gazelle'' and the ''Bélier'', and links the two capitals in about 40 hours.<ref>La construction de cette ligne a commencé en 1902. Elle devait à l'origine relier Abidjan à [[Niamey]]</ref>

The most recent project in Abidjan is one for an electric train which is promised by the Ivory Society of Railroads (SICF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lematindabidjan.com/visual_article.php?num_actualite=648 |title=Article Le matin d'Abidjan |publisher=Lematindabidjan.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

The development of infrastructural projects has been envisaged, including a suburban train system in Abidjan which is estimated to cost almost 100&nbsp;billion CFA francs. This suburban train system would link the North-West to the East and North of the city. The project extends over 25&nbsp;km of railway tracks which {{As of|2011|lc=on}} were used by the operator [[Sitarail]], a subsidiary company of the [[Bolloré]] group. The infrastructural works (tracks, electrification, and civil engineers) have been estimated at 40&nbsp;billion [[CFA francs]], financed by the State of Ivory Coast and backers ([[World Bank]] and the French Development Agency). In addition, a BOT concession contract would be given to a private operator, over 20–30 years, to operate the network. This operator will be in charge of the acquisition of railway materials, workshop renovation and the implementation of an organisational system. The concession contract has been estimated at around 60&nbsp;billion CFA francs.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Plagecocody.jpg|right|thumb|A beach in [[Cocody]]]]

Abidjan is a unique city in Africa. Its nicknames, such as "Manhattan of the tropics", "Small Manhattan" or "Pearl of the lagoons", explain the city's unpredictable and triumphant image. With its accommodation facilities – such as the Golf Hôtel&nbsp;– and sporting facilities, its lively night life, transport and communication lines as well as its impressiveness, it is the perfect city for business tourism.

Abidjan also has beaches around the lagoon, with palm and coconut trees, in the [[Vridi]] area, which are very popular at weekends with the picturesque sight of the pineapple and coconut sellers. Nevertheless, the rip-tides which affects practically the whole of the Gulf of Guinea's coast, means that in this area swimming is not usually allowed.

Generally, in Cote d'Ivoire, tourism has never really been developed as an economic industry; the country does not appear among common holiday destinations.

==== Parc du Banco (Banco National Park) ====
[[File:Laundry in the river.jpg|left|thumb|Fanicos, Abidjan's washermen]]

Converted in 1926, this park has 3,000 hectares and ancient "sacred wood" lies at the entrance to the city, in the [[Attécoubé]] community, which has been conserved as a relic of the first forest which surrounded the lagoon in the past. A tarmaced road goes straight to the lake at the heart of the park and trails go throughout it. The park is inhabited and there are coffee and [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] plantations.

At the edge of the park, a small river serves as a wash-house where the ''fanicos'', laundry men, work after collecting the laundry from the whole of the city. It is one of the 'small jobs' which exist in Abidjan.

==== Nightlife ====
Overall, the nightlife in Abidjan is considered to be one of the liveliest in the whole of Africa.

The district has an abundance of night-clubs, maquis, out-door areas, and go-go bars. These entertainment platforms provide a musical 'pipeline' encompassing mainly DJs, [[Coupé Décalé]] and Zouglou, and, in lesser amounts, other local and international varieties.

Formerly containing only local traditional varieties, Congolese music and Western music, Abidjan's night life has experienced a positive cultural disruption in its music since the start of the 2000s, with the arrival of [[Coupé Décalé]].

Indeed, this musical genre was introduced in 2002 by [[Douk Saga]] and [[JetSet]], with the help of Sagacité, created a phenomenon which has not stopped spreading and reaching out to the hot nights in the capitals of the sub-region. It has given a cultural identity, globally identifiable, to entertainment 'Made in Côte d'Ivoire'.

The very popular Zouglou additionally benefits "Wôyô" spaces; furnished and dedicated so that the most famous, the Internat at Fitini's and the Lycee at Vieux Gazeur's, attract 'zouglouphiles' the whole weekend.

[[Treichville]], with its many maquis, discothèques, and jazz clubs, used to be the liveliest area in the city, but since the end of the 1990s [[Youpougon]], [[Marcory]], and [[Cocody]] have taken over this role.

=== Music ===
Abidjan is a turntable for West African music, and a major producer of musical art in Africa. The city attracts the majority of musicians from the Ivory Coast mainly because of its many discothèques, which allow artists to make their debut and express themselves, record companies and national media. Here are a few examples of the most popular artists to have made their debut in Abidjan: [[Alpha Blondy]], [[Aïcha Koné]], the group [[Magic System]], [[Meiway]], and [[Tiken Jah Fakoly]], as well as Gadji Celi, Chantal Taiba, Nayanka Bell, DJ Arafat. In the 1980s [[Myriam Makeba]] came to the city, when she was not allowed back to her own country, South Africa, as did the Congolese diva [[Tshala Muana]], apostle of the Soukous style of dance.

Since the 1990s, Abidjan has had a significant variety of musical styles being exported throughout Africa and the West. These are namely Zoblazo, Mapouka, Zouglou and, since 2002, the Coupé Décalé; the popularity and great variety of these dances make the city a kind of African dance and musical trend capital. Congo-Kinchasa used to be known by this title; with Rumba, Soukous and then Ndombolo.

Abidjan is also considered to be the reggae capital of Africa.

Each year, the city organises the following music festivals:

* Abi-Reggae <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abireggae.ci}}</ref>
* Faya Flow<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abidjanshow.com/a_videobox_suite.php?newsid=1385 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219211007/http://abidjanshow.com/a_videobox_suite.php?newsid=1385 |archivedate=2009-02-19 |title=Fayaflow résumé de l'édition 2}}</ref>

=== Media ===
Most mass media in the Ivory Coast can be found in Abidjan.

==== Television and radio ====
The National Council for Audio-visual Communication (CNCA) is the regulating authority of audio-visual material in the Ivory Coast.

[[Radiodiffusion Television Ivoirienne]] (RTI) is the radio and television broadcasting authority for the Ivory Coast; it is financed by licence fees, publicity and grants. RTI has four television channels and two radio stations: ''La Première'' (non-specialised), ''TV2'', ''RTI Music TV'', ''RTI Sport TV'', ''Radio Côte d'Ivoire'', and ''Fréquence 2'' (non-specialised radio). ''Radio Jam'' is a private radio station in the Ivory Coast, and is the station the most listened to by young people.

With regards to private channels, [[Tam-Tam TV]] will be the first International Ivory Coast television channel with headquarters in Abidjan, with other studios in the United States, Italy, France, Asia, the Middle East.

There are also several Ivory Coast TV channels or radio stations available on the Internet: ''Africahit'', ''Music TV'', ''Abidjan.net TV'', ''Bengueshow'', etc.

With the launch in 2015 of DISCOP Africa Abidjan, the city became a hub for TV market professionals from French-speaking Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discopafrica.com/introducing-discop-africa-express/ |title=Intro to Discop Africa Abidjan |publisher=discopafrica.com |accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>

==== Press ====
At the time of the single-party, a political situation which ruled over the country for 30 years like most other [[West African countries]] after independence, only one daily newspaper was distributed throughout the country: [[Fraternité Matin]], from the parliamentary group [[PDCI-RDA]], which was founded by the first president, [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]. The advent of multiple parties in the Ivory Coast in 1999 can be seen in the proliferation of newspapers and diverse publications, of which the majority is published in Abidjan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abidjan.net/titrologie |title=Titrologie de la presse ivoirienne |publisher=News.abidjan.net |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

'''Events''' :

The main football event organised in Abidjan was the 1984 [[African Cup of Nations]] and one of the finals of the 1983 [[African Youth Cup of Nations]].

In 1964, the ''Jeux d'Abidjan'' took place in Abidjan, as did the final of the [[African Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1975, 1980, 1983, and 1990, then another in 1992 under the name of [[CAF Confederations]] Cup. The [[Stade Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] was the host of the very first [[African Super Cup]] in 1992, and the second in 1998. The finals of the 1966, 1986, 1995, and 1998 [[CAF Champions League]] also took place in Abidjan.

The economic capital also attracted other football events such as the [[Assumption Tournament]] (the first one taking place in 2007 in the [[Stade Robert Champroux]]), the West African Club Championship (UFOA Cup), and international gala matches.

Abidjan is the centre of Ivorian rugby, and most of the [[Ivory Coast national rugby union team]] have come from here. Although the origins of Ivorian rugby go back to the 1960s and earlier, real growth came about when the paid French official Jean-François Turon managed to get the game adopted by [[Abidjan University]] at the turn of the 1980s, but it is François Dali who is seen as the father of Ivorian rugby, and his son was the national captain during the 1990s.<ref name=Completerugby>Bath, Richard (ed.)

The complex will have, in addition to areas for all different Olympic disciplines (football, athletics, swimming, etc.), restaurants, shops, auditoriums, conference rooms, a hotel for the "sidelined" sportspeople, and training areas. Since the sudden increase in Ivory Coast football, the Ivory Coast State believes that the national team deserves a better stadium. Indeed, there is a problem with the "Félicia": it is impossible to increase its size due to its location in Le Plateau. The project for the new complex was suspended {{As of|2011|lc=on}} because of a lack of investors and the political situation which the country has been experiencing since December 1999.
