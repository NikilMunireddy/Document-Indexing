'''DSC Arminia Bielefeld''' ({{IPA-de|deː ʔɛs t͡seː ʔaʁˈmiːni̯a ˈbiːləfɛlt|pron}}; full name: {{lang-de|Deutscher Sportclub Arminia Bielefeld e.V.}} {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏ̯t͡ʃɐ ˈʃpɔʁtklʊp ʔaʁˈmiːni̯a ˈbiːləfɛlt|}}; also known as "Die Arminen" {{IPA-de|diː ˈʔaʁmiːnən|}} or "Die Blauen" {{IPA-de|diː ˈblaʊ̯ən|}}) is a German [[sports club]] from [[Bielefeld]], North Rhine-Westphalia. Arminia offers the sports of [[Association football|football]], [[field hockey]], [[figure skating]] and [[cue sports]]. The club has 12,000 members and the club colours are black, white and blue.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.arminia-bielefeld.de/index.php?id=5 | title = Arminia | language = German | publisher = Arminia Bielefeld | accessdate = 21 January 2013}}</ref> Arminia's name derives from the [[Cherusci]]an chieftain [[Arminius]], who defeated a [[Roman army]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].

The club is most commonly known for its professional football team that is now playing its 17th [[2. Bundesliga]] season. Arminia has mostly played in the first or second tier of the German football league system, among them 17 seasons in the 1. [[Bundesliga]]. Arminia's most successful years were the 1920s, the early 1980s and the middle 2000s. In 1947 and in the 1950s Arminia had sunk down to a team playing in a rather local area in the third tier (later third tiers covered larger areas).

Arminia plays their home games at the [[Bielefelder Alm]] stadium since 1926. Since 2004 the stadium has been named ''Schücoarena'' through a sponsorship deal.

==History==
{{Main|List of Arminia Bielefeld seasons}}
[[File:1. FC Arminia Bielefeld.png|115px|left|thumb|Logo of founding side ''1. FC Arminia Bielefeld''.]]Arminia Bielefeld was founded on 3 May 1905 as ''1. Bielefelder FC Arminia''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=18 }}</ref> The fourteen men who founded the club were from the local bourgeoisie. Two weeks later, the club played its first match against a team from [[Osnabrück]]. Neither the name of the opponent nor the result are known. The club was admitted to the [[German Football Association]] in the same year and started to play in a league (in one consisting only of Arminia and three teams from Osnabrück, at first) in 1906.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blaue-daten.de/arminia-bielefeld-statistik-tabellen-1906-1945.html | title= Arminia Bielefeld Statistik: Tabellen 1906 bis 1945 | language = German | work=blaue-daten.de | accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> In 1907, local rivals ''FC Siegfried'' joined Arminia, a move which strengthened Arminia‘s squad.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=20 }}</ref> and other clubs from Bielefeld joined league football.

After playing on various grounds, Arminia moved to a new home at the Pottenau in 1910. Their first big achievement came in 1912, when they won the Westphalian championship after a 5–1 win over [[BV 04 Dortmund]] in the final.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=22 }}</ref> The outbreak of World War I interrupted Arminia rise to the top. In 1919, Arminia merged with ''Bielefelder Turngemeinde 1848'' to form ''TG Arminia Bielefeld''. However, the two merged teams dissolved the merger in 1922 and both parent clubs were formed again.

===1922–1945===
Arminia won the West German championship in 1922. Originally, they were even on points with [[1. FC Köln|Kölner BC 01]], but Köln fielded an ineligible player in one match. Arminia played for the first time in the German championships but were eliminated in the quarter-finals after losing 0–5 to [[FC Wacker München]]. In 1923, Arminia won their second West German championship in a dramatic way. They trailed [[TuRU Düsseldorf]] 1–3 at half time of the final, but came from behind to win 4–3 after extra time. Arminia faced [[Union Oberschöneweide]] in the quarter-finals of the German championships. The match ended goalless, so a replay was held. Arminia led 1–0 and suffered the equalizer in injury time. The Berlin side won the match after extra time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=28 }}</ref> [[Walter Claus-Oehler]] became Arminia‘s first player to win a cap in the [[Germany national football team|German national team]]. Arminia won further Westphalian titles from 1924 to 1927 but were unable to repeat their success in the West German championships. A match between [[SC Preußen Münster]] and Arminia in November 1925 was the first football match to be broadcast on German radio.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/liga2/clubs/arminia-bielefeld/daten.php | title= Warrior boys Arminia are back | work=bundesliga.com | accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref> On 30 January 1926, the club took its current name ''Deutscher Sportclub Arminia Bielefeld''. Their next piece of silverware was won in 1932 with a triumph in the Westphalian cup.

In 1933, Arminia qualified for the [[Gauliga Westfalen]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=31 }}</ref> from which they were relegated after the inaugural season. Three attempts of gaining promotion failed before their return to the top flight was won in 1938. Their best performance in the Gauliga was the 1939–40 campaign, where Arminia finished second. Two years later, Arminia was one of only two teams to win a match at [[Schalke 04]]. On 25 July 1943 Arminia merged with local rivals ''VfB 03 Bielefeld''. The merger finished the 1943–44 season on the last place.

===Post World War II===
After World War II, a new league with all teams who competed in the Gauliga Westfalen was formed. Arminia were relegated and failed to win re-promotion. In 1947–48, Arminia were a third division side for the first time in their history. After a dominating season in the Bezirksklasse, Arminia was docked 14 points because they fielded an ineligible player.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=50 }}</ref> The next season was already under way when the Landesliga (II) was expanded by two teams. Arminia took their chance, won the league and gained promotion to the [[Oberliga West (1947–63)|Oberliga West]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=51 }}</ref>

The dream lasted for only a year. Arminia beat [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] 4–2 at home but finished only second from the bottom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=52 }}</ref> In 1954, Arminia were even relegated to the third tier, the "Landesliga Westfalen, Gruppe Ostwestfalen", a league only covering the north-eastern part of Westphalia. In 1956, Arminia qualified for a new third tier, the "Verbandsliga Westfalen, Gruppe Ostwestfalen", which encompassed a little larger area. Only in 1962, Arminia became a second division side again (then: 2. Liga West, covering the whole of North Rhine-Westphalia). In 1962–63, they struggled to finish on seventh place to secure a spot in the newly formed [[Regionalliga West (1963–74)|Regionalliga West]], which was situated directly below the new Bundesliga.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=58 }}</ref>

Arminia finished their first seasons in mid-table, but became one of the better Regionalliga teams later on. In 1966, Arminia beat [[Alemannia Aachen]] to claim the West German cup for the first time. A year later, forward [[Ernst Kuster]] joined the team and went on to become the club‘s all-time leading goal scorer. A 0–1 loss to [[Wuppertaler SV]] on the last day of the 1966–67 season held Arminia to enter the Bundesliga promotion play-offs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=60 }}</ref> Arminia were runners-up in the 1969–70 season and won their first promotion to the Bundesliga after a 2–0 win at [[Tennis Borussia Berlin]] in the play-offs.

===1970–71 Match Fixing scandal===
{{see also|Bundesliga scandal (1971)}}

The team had a poor start in [[1970–71 Bundesliga|their first Bundesliga season]]. They bounced back to finish 14th, however, near the end of the season it was discovered that Arminia had engaged in match-fixing. Three of the ten games proven to have been manipulated directly involved Arminia. Two players for the club were banned for life ([[Waldemar Slomiany]] and [[Jürgen Neumann]]. Arminia was allowed to play the [[1971–72 Bundesliga|1971–72 season]] in the Bundesliga, but were automatically relegated to the Regionalliga as a penalty. Arminia struggled in the following seasons, but were good enough to be appointed to the newly formed [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974.

===Recovery, glorious early 80s and down into the Oberliga===
After two seasons in mid-table, Arminia had good chances of returning to the Bundesliga in [[1976–77 2. Bundesliga|1976–77]] but they finished only as runner-up behind [[FC St. Pauli]]. They faced [[TSV 1860 München]] in a two-legged play-off whose winner would win promotion to the top flight. Arminia won the first match at home 4–0, but lost the second leg in Munich 0–4. A third match had to be played in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] which Munich won 2–0.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschneck, Uhlig u.&nbsp;a. |title=Arminia Bielefeld&nbsp;– 100 Jahre Leidenschaft |page=79 }}</ref>

The team was shocked but bounced back to win promotion in [[1977–78 2. Bundesliga|1977–78]]. Arminia started well and on 10 March 1979, they won 4–0 at [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/1979/22/bmuenchen-bielefeld/ |title=Spielstatistik FC Bayern München&nbsp;– Arminia Bielefeld 0:4 (0:2) |accessdate=24 August 2008 |publisher=Fussballdaten |language=german | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080926144823/http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/1979/22/bmuenchen-bielefeld/| archivedate= 26 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> However, Arminia were hit by a slump and were relegated again. The club managed to keep the team together and bounced back after a record-breaking year. They won 30 of 38 matches, scored 120 goals, had a 28 match unbeaten streak and set a league record by beating [[Arminia Hannover]] 11–0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fussballdaten.de/zweiteliga/nord/1980/ |title=Tabelle der 2. Bundesliga Nord 1979–80 nach dem 38.Spieltag |accessdate=24 August 2008 |publisher=Fussballdaten |language=german }}</ref>

Arminia struggled to avoid relegation and managed to stay in the Bundesliga for five years, including two finishes in eighth place in [[1982–83 Bundesliga|1982–83]] and [[1983–84 Bundesliga|1983–84]] seasons. Furthermore, Arminia took part in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] three times. An ugly event shocked Germany when [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] defender [[Norbert Siegmann]] slashed [[Ewald Lienen]]'s right [[thigh]] during a match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/;art272,1915861 |title=Die Jahre danach waren nicht einfach |accessdate=24 August 2008 |publisher=Tagesspiegel |language=german }}</ref> The success on the pitch did not prevent the club from suffering declining attendances which enlarged the financial problems. In [[1984–85 Bundesliga|1984–85]], Arminia finished third from the bottom and lost the relegation play-offs against [[1. FC Saarbrücken]].

The team failed to gain promotion and in the fall of 1987, Arminia had debts of 4.5 million [[Deutsche Mark|Marks]]. The result was a last place finish in [[1987–88 2. Bundesliga|1987–88]]. [[Ernst Middendorp]] became the new manager and assembled a young team for the new season. Arminia led the way in the [[Oberliga Westfalen]] but finished only second in 1988–89. They won the Oberliga a year later, but failed in the promotion play-offs to [[VfB Oldenburg]] and [[TSV Havelse]]. Four dismal years followed in which the team started well but were unable to compete for the championship. In 1991, Arminia won the Westphalian cup, a cup for Westphalian teams not playing in the First or Second Bundesliga, and beat [[FSV Mainz 05]] in the first round of the [[DFB-Pokal]].

===From Regionalliga to yo-yo-team to five consecutive seasons in the Bundesliga again===
In the spring of 1994, Arminia created a relatively large media buzz by signing veteran Bundesliga players like [[Thomas von Heesen]], [[Armin Eck]] and [[Fritz Walter (1980s footballer)|Fritz Walter]]. Arminia struggled at first but went on the become champions of the newly formed [[Regionalliga West/Südwest]] and runners-up in the [[1995–96 2. Bundesliga]]. Arminia signed [[Stefan Kuntz]] for the [[1996–97 Bundesliga|1996–97 Bundesliga season]], their first in 11 years and finished on 14th position.

The club wrote German football history by signing [[Iran]]ian players [[Ali Daei]] and [[Karim Bagheri]] along with the [[SK Brann]] icon [[Geirmund Brendesæter]], who enjoyed a brief spell with the club in 1997. However, after a poor run after the winter break, Arminia were relegated shortly after Brendesæter had left the club. They bounced back by winning the [[1998–99 2. Bundesliga|1998–99 season]]. [[Bruno Labbadia]] became the league's top scorer with 28 goals. The club suffered from financial problems and entered the [[1999–2000 Bundesliga|1999–2000 season]] with a smaller budget. Relegation followed again after the team became the third team in Bundesliga history to lose ten matches in a row.

Arminia struggled against relegation again the next season and avoided to drop into the Regionalliga in close season. Their fortunes turned around and Arminia won their sixth promotion to the Bundesliga in [[2001–02 2. Bundesliga|2001–02]] with [[Artur Wichniarek]] scoring 18 goals. Arminia were almost saved the next year but a slump with only two points out of the last six matches sealed relegation again.

The team bounced back again in [[2003–04 Bundesliga|2003–04]] and were able to stay in the top flight until 2009. In 2004–05, [[Patrick Owomoyela]] became Arminia's new record national player. Furthermore, Arminia reached the semi-finals of the [[DFB-Pokal]] in 2005 and 2006. In both seasons, Arminia also kept away from the relegation zone virtually the whole time (except the season's beginnings). In those years the image campaign "Aktion 5000 +" let the number of members rise above 10,000. In 2007, many Arminia fans were sad to see the old East Stand being torn down (then the last non-seater stand in the Bundesliga not being placed behind one of the goals)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog5.fussballkompetenz.de/2007/03/04/sitzen-ist-furs-gesas-tschuss-block-5 |title=Sitzen ist fürs Gesäß |accessdate=21 January 2013 |publisher=Blog5 |language=german }}</ref> and also further marketing attempts alienated the fans from the club's management board. From 2007 onwards, managerial sackings became more and more common and avoiding relegation became more and more difficult.

===Down into the 3. Liga===
Arminia played their fifth consecutive Bundesliga season in [[2008–09 Bundesliga|2008–09]]. They finished last and were relegated to the [[2. Bundesliga]]. However, after finishing seventh in the 2009–10 season, their next season was fraught with managerial sackings and financial difficulties. After a poor season, picking up only 16 points and winning only four games, Bielefeld were relegated to the [[3. Liga]].

After a poor start, they ended the [[2011–12 3. Liga|2011–12]] season in 13th place. They also won the [[Westphalia Cup]] in a final against arch rival [[SC Preußen Münster]]. By reaching the final, they also qualified for the [[2012-13 DFB-Pokal]], where they beat [[SC Paderborn 07]], a team playing in the 2. Bundesliga, but lost in the second round in a close match against [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]], a Europa League participant. On 11 May 2013, Bielefeld beat [[VfL Osnabrück]] 1–0 to guarantee a top two finish and promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga for the [[2013–14 2. Bundesliga|2013–14]] season. That season began quite hopeful: Arminia qualified for thee second round of the [[2013-14 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] again and at the 8th matchday they had even climbed up to the 3rd rank in the league table. But after a disastrous autumn and a mediocre winter Arminia fell down onto the 17th rank and the popular coach [[Stefan Krämer]] had to leave. His successor [[Norbert Meier]] at first had only little more success: Arminia finished 16th in the 2. Bundesliga, and lost a playoff against [[SV Darmstadt 98]] on away goals after a 122nd minute (extra time) goal gave Darmstadt the victory. Arminia had to go back into the 3. Liga.

But the next season could wipe out the bitterness of that disaster: In the [[2014–15 DFB-Pokal]], as a [[3. Liga]] club, Arminia reached the semi-finals by defeating three [[Bundesliga]] teams ([[Hertha BSC]], [[SV Werder Bremen]] and [[VfL Borussia Mönchengladbach]]). They also were the top team in the 3. Liga (after a bad beginning with only four points from the first four matches) for the most parts of the season. After the loss against [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in the semi-final of the DFB-Pokal, Arminia seemed to have lost their ability to win their matches in the 3. Liga as well. Even the qualification for the 2. Bundesliga seemed to become doubtful, but was secured after a 2–2 draw against [[SSV Jahn Regensburg]], the last team in the league table, at the 37th matchday. Liberated from the pressure of a possible non-qualification, they also won the 3. Liga with a final 1–0 victory at the last matchday.

===Modern day===
A stable season with a defeat in the first round of the [[2015–16 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]], a lot of draws in the [[2015–16 2. Bundesliga|league]] (especially in the beginning: eight out of ten matches; in the end Arminia reached a record of 18) and only very few goals scored at home (only eight until the 30th matchday) followed so that the 4-2 over [[Greuther Fürth]] at the 31st matchday which secured Arminias staying up was only Arminias third win at home. The brightest spots probably were the draws against all three top teams away. In the league table Arminia never went deeper than rank 14 and finished 12th. Paying back the depts which were accumulated especially in the 2000s stays an important topic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westfalen-blatt.de/DSC/2378767-Arminias-Geschaeftsfuehrer-Gerrit-Meinke-ueber-attraktivere-Heimspiele-Schuldenabbau-und-das-Ziel-Bundesliga-Meinke-Wir-wissen-wo-wir-hinwollen |title=Meinke: "Wir wissen, wo wir hinwollen" |accessdate=22 May 2016 |publisher=Westfalenblatt |language=german }}</ref>

Arminia took the club colours blue, white and black upon their foundation in 1905. The colours haven‘t changed though the current club colours are black, white and blue. Despite this, Arminia played their first match in an orange [[Kit (association football)|kit]]. Arminia‘s home kit was blue for most of the time while their shorts and socks were white. The team that won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1970 wore a blue shirt with thick white stripes. The current home kit is blue with a white hoop, black shorts and white socks. The away kit was mostly all white while green shirts were worn in the 1990s. Currently the away kit consists of a white shirt, white shorts and black socks. Their third kit is entirely maroon and is used if their other kits clash with the kit of the other teams.

The crest consists of a flag with the club‘s colours black, white and blue from left to right. The white part of the [[flag]] includes the letter A for Arminia. The flag is surrounded by a [[wreath]] of [[oak]].

==Stadium==
{{Main|Bielefelder Alm}}
[[File:Bielefelder Alm.JPG|thumb|250px|The new eastern stand.]]
Arminia played their first home matches at the ''Kesselbrink'' in downtown Bielefeld. They moved to a new ground at the ''Kaiserstraße'' (today: August-Bebel-Straße) in 1907 and to the ''Pottenau'' in 1910. In 1926, Arminia [[lease]]d a ground from a farmer named Lohmann. The ground didn‘t look like a football pitch. The club member Heinrich Pahl said that the area looks like an Alm (German for ''[[Alps|alpine]] [[grassland]]''). The stadium was known as the Alm. Arminia played its first match against [[Victoria Hamburg]] on 1 May 1926. The first grandstands were constructed in 1954. When Arminia won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1970, the Alm underwent a genereal development. A main stand with seats was built and the northern and eastern stands were enlarged. The Alm had a capacity of 30,000 and [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]]s were installed. In 1978, a roof was added to the main stands and the other stands were enlarged again. The stadium had a capacity of 35,000 then.

When Arminia was relegated to the Oberliga in 1988, the northern and the southern stand were torn down because both stands didn‘t match the new safety regulations. The eastern stand was also made smaller and a roof was added. The capacity was reduced to about 15,000. After Arminia won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1996, the main and northern stands were demolished and completely rebuilt. The same happened to the south stand in 1999. In 2004, Arminia signed a sponsorship deal with [[Schüco]] and the stadium was named ''SchücoArena''. The latest redevelopment saw the eastern stand being rebuilt in 2008.

The Bielefelder Alm has a capacity of 27,300, including 20,381 seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arminia-bielefeld.de/stadion.html |title=Die SchücoArena |accessdate=24 August 2008 |publisher=Arminia Bielefeld |language= german| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080823144105/http://www.arminia-bielefeld.de/stadion.html| archivedate= 23 August 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Bielefelder Alm was a candidate to host matches of the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]].

==Supporters==
[[File:Arminia Pauli.jpg|thumb|250px|Arminia supporters backing their team during an away game at [[Millerntor-Stadion]]]]
Arminia have a large number of loyal supporters. Even in 2011–12, Arminia had an average attendance of 8,930 which was the highest in the [[3. Liga]]. In 2014–15, Arminia had an average attendance of 14,540 which was the second (!) highest in that 3. Liga season. The numbers also show the risen popularity of the 3. Liga. Arminias matches during the 2013–14 2. Bundesliga were attended by 16,890 in the average,<ref>{{cite web | website = blaue-daten.de| url=http://www.blaue-daten.de/arminia-bielefeld-zuschauer-saison.html | title = Arminia Bielefeld Statistik: Liga: Zuschauer pro Saison | language = German | access-date = 3 October 2015}}</ref> (eighth highest average attendance in the league). These numbers only count league matches. Arminia's matches in the 2014–15 DFB-Pokal were attended by 21,763 in the average. The core of the fans can be found on the terraces of the Southern Stand.

Arminia's fans come primarily from the [[Ostwestfalen-Lippe]] region with a [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] of about 100 kilometers around Bielefeld. There are around 140 fanclubs, mostly from Ostwestfalen-Lippe. However, there are fanclubs in Berlin, [[Stuttgart]], London, Birmingham, Taunton, Austria and the Netherlands.

There is a traditional rivalry with [[SC Preußen Münster]]. The match against them in March 2012 which was the first one taking place in Bielefeld after nearly 20 years was attended by 21,203 spectators. No other match in the [[3. Liga]] had such a high attendance. One year later the stadium was nearly sold out in that derby. The earlier rival was VfB 03 Bielefeld from the east of Bielefeld, but the rivalry deceased with the meaning of VfB Bielefeld and nowadays friendly matches between Arminia and [[VfB Fichte Bielefeld]], as the club nowadays is called, take place every year. Another rival is [[VfL Bochum]], especially since the late 90s, and there were some sort of "fashion rivalries" with other clubs from the [[Ruhr]], because that area also belongs to Westphalia.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=stadionsuche.de| url=http://www.stadionsuche.de/stadioninfo.php?club_id=5 |title=Schüco Arena |access-date=2013-01-21 }}</ref> Also the matches against [[VfL Osnabrück]] are some sort of derby. Some [[SC Paderborn 07]] supporters seem to consider Arminia as their main rival, but Arminia fans are unlikely to feel the same about them.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jan-H. Grotevent |publisher=FANkultur.com| url=http://www.fankultur.com/blog/rundumbeobachtungen/item/632-derby-ohne-derby |title=Derby ohne Derby |access-date=2013-01-20 }}</ref> There are friendly relations to the supporters of the [[Hamburger SV]] with both clubs sharing the same colours (black, white and blue).
