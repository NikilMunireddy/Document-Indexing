'''Halifax RLFC''' (known as '''Halifax Blue Sox''' from 1996–2002) is a professional [[rugby league]] club in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], which formed in 1873. Halifax were one of the original twenty-two rugby clubs that formed the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] in 1895. They have been Rugby League Champions four times and have won the Challenge Cup five times.

They have rivalries with neighbours [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] and [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] and with fellow Championship side [[Featherstone Rovers]].

Known as 'Fax', the club colours are blue and white hoops, white shorts and blue and white socks. They share [[the Shay]] stadium with the town's football club, [[F.C. Halifax Town|Halifax Town]].

== History ==

===1873–1939: Early years===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
The club was founded as ''Halifax'' in 1873. After winning the first [[Yorkshire Cup (rugby union)|Yorkshire Cup]] in 1878, they went on to win it on another four occasions. Several players were picked for the Yorkshire County side in these years, and five were for the [[England national rugby union team|England rugby union team]]. In 1886, the club moved to [[Thrum Hall]], which would be their home ground for the next 112 years. The first game there was played on 18 September 1886 against [[Hull F.C.|Hull]] and drew 8,000 spectators.

Halifax were founding members of the breakaway [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] in 1895. In 1896, Halifax lost out on winning the first ever [[Rugby Football League Championship]] by a single point, with [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]] becoming the inaugural champions. In 1902–03, they achieved the 'double' by winning the [[Challenge Cup]] and finishing top of Division One. They won the cup again the following season, and were the first ever Championship play-off winners in 1906–07.

Halifax won their first [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] Challenge Cup final in 1931, beating [[York City Knights|York]] 22–8. An estimated 100,000 people lined the route to a civic reception at the town hall.

Towards the end of the 1937 season, [[Streatham and Mitcham R.L.F.C.|Streatham and Mitcham]] folded after just one full season in the league. The club had made a number of high-profile signings from the [[New Zealand]] [[All Blacks]], including [[George Nepia]] and [[Charles Smith (rugby)|Charles Smith]], and these players now joined Halifax.

In 1938, Halifax reached the semi-final of the Challenge Cup, after winning three replays in a row, before they were knocked out by [[Barrow Raiders|Barrow]] at [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield|Fartown]], [[Huddersfield]] in the dying seconds of the game.

In 1939, Halifax became the last team to win the Challenge Cup final before the war. Favourites [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] were beaten 20–3 in front of a record 55,453 spectators.

===Post-Second World War===

In 1947 Halifax's [[Hudson Irving]] died from a heart attack while playing at Dewsbury.<ref name="Baker">{{cite news

In 1949, Halifax's David Craven died after breaking his neck playing against [[Workington Town]].<ref name="Baker"/>

The 1949 Challenge Cup final was sold out for first time as 95,050 spectators saw [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] beat Halifax.

In the 1950s, Halifax were Championship runners-up three times, beat [[Hull F.C.|Hull]] in Yorkshire Cup finals in 1954 and 1955, and were Yorkshire League winners in 1950, 1953, 1954 and 1956. Halifax were unbeaten at their home ground of Thrum Hall between December 1952 and November 1956. They played in a Wembley final of the [[1953–54 Northern Rugby Football League season#Challenge Cup|1953–54]] [[Challenge Cup]], featuring in the first ever drawn final against [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] in 1954, losing in the replay at [[Odsal Stadium]], [[Bradford]] in front of what was then a world record rugby league crowd officially given as 102,569, although estimates suggest another 20,000 plus entered unofficially.

After securing a Yorkshire league and cup double in 1955–56, the club was in sight of winning ''"[[All Four Cups]]"''. Wembley was reached after a 11–10 Challenge Cup  semi-final victory over [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] at [[Odsal Stadium|Odsal]] and Halifax beat [[St Helens RFC|St Helens]] 23–8 in the Championship semi-final. However, St Helens ran out 13–2 winners in the Challenge Cup and a week later, Halifax lost in the Championship match against Hull at [[Maine Road]], [[Manchester]], a last minute penalty goal securing a 10–9 victory for Hull.

In 1959, Halifax hosted Wigan before a club record 29,153 people in the third round of the Challenge Cup.

===1960–1996: Financial difficulties===
Halifax finished 7th in the league in the 1964–65 season and won the Championship Final after a 16-team play-off.

Halifax was hit hard by the financial situation of the late 1960s and 1970s. Fortunes on the pitch suffered as the shortfall was met by selling players. In 1970, a concert was held at Thrum Hall in an attempt to alleviate these financial troubles. Horrific weather conditions meant that only around 3,000 arrived to watch the Halifax Pop and Blues Concert which made a loss of £6,000.<ref name="rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk/subjects/view/becoming-a-director |title=Becoming a Director |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>

Despite victory in the inaugural [[Regal Trophy]] final (then [[Players No. 6 Trophy]]) in 1971–72, financial problems continued for the next decade. In 1983, local businessman, David Brook provided much needed investment in the club.<ref name="rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk"/>

[[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] was player-coach of Halifax from November 1984 to May 1987 when he retired from playing to be coach in 1987–88. The team won the League Championship in 1985–86, the 1986–87 [[Challenge Cup]] against [[St Helens RFC|St. Helens]] and made a second successive appearance in the Challenge Cup final in 1988 when they lost to [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. Despite this on-field success, Halifax were banned from signing new players by the RFL after complaints of non-payments in November 1988.

In 1989, [[John Dorahy]] took up a position as captain-coach of Halifax for the 1989–90 season. Halifax players threatened strike action over unpaid wages in April 1990. The club sold [[Neil James]] for £20,000 to pay wages but were still in financial trouble including an unpaid tax bill of £70,000. Halifax went into the hands of receivers, £760,000 in debt, a take-over bid having failed after the players refused to take a pay cut. The club was re-formed and the assets were purchased by the Marsland/Gartland consortium of local businessmen.

[[Peter Roe (rugby league)|Peter Roe]] was appointed as head coach at Halifax for season 1990–91 when they achieved promotion along with Salford who were their opponents in the Divisional Final at [[Old Trafford]]. The club's record victory was set in October 1990 with an 82–8 win over [[Runcorn Highfield RLFC|Runcorn Highfield]] at Thrum Hall. Roe was removed from office 24-hours later when he refused to re-apply for his own job. The Halifax board stated that he did not have the required experience for a club in the top division.

[[Roger Millward]] took the coaching job at Halifax, but was only there 17 months before resigning. [[Mal Reilly]] became the coach in 1992. In August 1993, in financial trouble again, Halifax put seven players on the transfer list for a total of £170,000.

===1996–2002: Summer era===

In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural [[Super League]] season and changed from a winter to a summer season.<ref name="hadfield20-12-95">{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rugbys-pounds-87m-deal-gives-murdoch-transfer-veto-1526582.html |publisher= The Independent |title=Rugby's pounds 87m deal gives Murdoch transfer veto |author=Dave Hadfield |date=20 December 1995 |location=London |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In the lead-up, the Halifax President, Tony Gartland, and former Chairman, Peter Marsland, left the board over plans to merge with rivals [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] and join the proposed Super League as single club.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/british-tours-will-survive-the-super-league-fallout-1616669.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=British tours will survive the Super League fall-out | first=Dave | last=Hadfield | date=22 April 1995 |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>

Halifax joined the Super League in 1996, the local newspaper did a poll of suggested nicknames for the club with Halifax Bombers topping the list. But the Board upon the recommendation of Chief executive Nigel Wood chose ''Halifax Blue Sox''. However, this proved to be unpopular with most supporters who continued to refer to them as 'Fax'. Halifax finished third in Super League in 1998 under [[John Pendlebury (rugby league)|John Pendlebury]].

Halifax sold [[Thrum Hall]] for £1.5 million to [[Asda]] for a supermarket development in 1998, and moved across town to their present home, [[the Shay]] stadium, which they share with the town's football club [[F.C. Halifax Town|Halifax Town]]. The proceeds from the sale were supposed to enable Halifax RLFC to make a contribution to the costs of a redevelopment of the Shay stadium, but the money was swallowed up by debts.

Under Chief Executive Nigel Wood, Halifax went to [[Jacksonville University]], [[Florida]], in 2000 to help develop American rugby league, along with [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]].

[[Steve Linnane]] joined the club as assistant coach from [[Rochdale Hornets]] and took full charge after [[Gary Mercer]]'s resignation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/1257218.stm | work=BBC News | title=Mercer willing to play on | date=3 April 2001 |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> With the club threatened again by financial problems and the danger of relegation Halifax sacked coach Steve Linnane in August 2002, the morning after a 64–0 loss to St. Helens, which came after nine losses from ten games which put the club at risk of relegation. Replacement Tony Anderson signed a deal that covered the four remaining matches of this season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/3033288/Halifax-give-Linnane-the-boot.html |title=Halifax give Linnane the boot |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 September 2013 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=25 August 2002}}</ref>

===2003–2008: Relegation and financial difficulties===
The club returned to their traditional Halifax RLFC name at the start of 2003. At the end of the 2003 season they were relegated from [[Super League]] to [[National League]] One. Halifax's financial troubles meant they were unable to retain a full-time team and they struggled in the new league. In 2004 having been saved from insolvency by their new chairman Howard Posner they narrowly avoided a second relegation to National League 2, with a last-gasp victory in a play-off with [[York City Knights|York]].

[[Anthony Farrell]] was asked to become temporary coach until the end of the year following the sacking of Tony Anderson. After saving the club from relegation the following season and taking the club within a whisker of a place in the grand final, they lost out to [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]]. The year after was less successful and after a poor series of results including a club record loss to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]], Farrell lost his job. [[Martin Hall (rugby league)|Martin Hall]] took over the role of head coach in June 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/5083962.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hall replaces Farrell at Halifax | date=15 June 2006 |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>

In August 2006, Halifax was on the verge of going bust. The club announced that it needed to raise £90,000 or it would go into liquidation. Rugby league fans nationwide rallied behind 'Fax', and through visits to the ground during home fixtures and other fund-raising events, were able to raise £55,000. Howard Posner then came forward and announced that he would loan the club the remaining £35,000 in order to keep Halifax alive, repayment of the loan was waived. Posner and the new Board of Directors subsequently invested further sums to ensure the club could survive and that Halifax would be playing in National League One during 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/5326948.stm | work=BBC News | title=Posner secures Halifax survival | date=8 September 2006 |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> Howard Posner, again became club Chairman and  [[Martin Hall (rugby league)|Martin Hall]] took up the post of director of football in October 2006. Assistant coach [[Matt Calland]] was then named the new head coach of Halifax.

===2009– Present: Rebuilding and Championship Success===
In the [[2009 Challenge Cup]] Halifax came within moments of reaching the quarter-finals, losing by one point in extra time to Castleford. They also lost the final of the Co-Operative Championship to [[Barrow Raiders|Barrow]] 26 -18. Barrow were later stripped of the title due to salary cap breaches

In 2010, Halifax won the Co-Operative Championship, beating [[Featherstone Rovers]] 23–22 in the final after extra time. It was the first trophy Halifax had won in 23 years.

In 2011, Halifax reached the [[Northern Rail Cup]] final at [[Bloomfield Road]], [[Blackpool]], losing narrowly to [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] in the last minute. They were also unable to defend their Championship title, losing heavily to [[Sheffield Eagles]] in the play-offs. [[Karl Harrison]] took over as head coach at the end of the season.

The following season, Halifax made it to the final of the Northern Rail Cup but this time were victorious over favourites Featherstone Rovers beating them 21–12 in a match watched by over 7,000 spectators.

In 2015 Halifax finished the regular season in the top four of the Championship, earning them a place in the Qualifiers. Despite being the lowest ranked team in the competition, and part time, they beat promotion favourites [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] and Sheffield Eagles to finish 6th out of 8, and secured improved central funding for 2016.

==Stadiums==

===1886–1998: Thrum Hall===
{{Main|Thrum Hall}}
Shortly after they were founded in 1873, Halifax bought some land in Halifax from a farmer with the aim to build a multipurpose sports venue. Thrum Hall hosted rugby league finals and test matches as well as [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]].<ref>[http://www.defunctspeedway.co.uk/Halifax%20(Thrum%20Hall).htm Thrum Hall Speedway]</ref> Halifax played at Thrum Hall for 112 years until they sold the land for £1.5 million to [[ASDA]] to move to a new stadium in the [[Super League]] era.

Thrum Hall was notable for its distinctive slope. As it was built on the side of a hill, the ground had a 4 yard slope from the main grandstand side to the outer wing.

Thrum Hall had a spectator capacity of 9,832 when it closed as a sports venue.

===1999–Present: The MBi Shay ===
{{Main|The Shay}}
[[File:SkircoatStand.jpg|thumb|right|Skircoat Stand]]
Halifax first played at the Shay in the 1998 Super League season and ground shared with association football team [[FC Halifax Town|Halifax Town]]. The Shay has a current capacity of 14,061 (5,830 seated).

The Shay hosted games during the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]].

==Colours and badge==

===Colours===
Halifax have traditionally play in blue and white. Their home jersey is blue and hoops and their away colours are have been in recent season a combination red, black and white, replacing their traditional red and white hoops. For the 2016 season the away jerseys are blue, purple and white.

===Badge===
[[Image:HalifaxBlueSox.gif|thumb|Right|100px|Halifax Blue Sox club logo]]
Since its formation in 1873, Halifax used the town's coat of arms as a crest as many other clubs did until the advent of [[Super League]], Halifax and many other clubs, changed their names and badge thus becoming known as the '''Halifax Blue Soxs''' from the 1996 season. This however was unpopular with fans and the name was reverted to 'Halifax' and the town coat of arms was reintroduced with Halifax under it.

==Youth and community development==

'''Activities''':

Blue Base Study Support Centre was a community sporting initiative sponsored by Halifax, and part of the national Playing For Success educational scheme launched for school pupils to interact with professional sports teams, to help provide motivation to young people. Locally, Blue Base was working with an initiative established by the [[DfES]], in [[partnership]] with Calderdale Children and Young People's Services and Halifax. The funding ceased in March 2011, when the Blue Base Centre closed.

The centre existed to support [[Calderdale]] schools in their drive to raise attainment levels with their pupils. This is achieved by developing young peoples' levels of motivation, self-esteem and helping them to have a more positive attitude towards learning by concentrating particularly upon literacy, numeracy and the use of ICT.

Retired player, Frank Watene, leads Calderdale Community Coaching Trust which is the club's Foundation providing a wide range of educational programmes designed to promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles amongst people of all ages in the Calderdale area. Activities include Touch Rugby League, healthy heart circuit training and an 'Over 50s Club which plays Kurling at the Shay stadium.
