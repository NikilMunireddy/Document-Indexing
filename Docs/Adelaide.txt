Named in honour of [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], [[queen consort]] to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], the city was founded in 1836 as the [[new town|planned capital]] for a freely-settled British province in Australia. [[William Light|Colonel William Light]], one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city and chose its location close to the [[River Torrens]], in the area originally inhabited by the [[Kaurna people]]. Light's design set out Adelaide in a [[grid plan|grid layout]], interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by [[Adelaide Parklands|parklands]]. Early Adelaide was shaped by prosperity and wealth — up until the [[Second World War]], it was Australia's third largest city.<ref>{{cite book|first=Patrick|last=Troy|title=A History of European Housing in Australia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521777339|pages=188}}</ref> It has been noted for early examples of religious freedom, a commitment to political [[progressivism]] and civil liberties.

As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] along the cultural boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]], [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street]] and in various districts of the metropolitan area. Today, Adelaide is noted for [[:Category:Festivals in Adelaide|its many festivals]] and sporting events, its food and wine, its long beachfronts, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors.

[[File:Kaurnaland.png|thumb|left|upright|Approximate extent of Kaurna territory, based on the description by Amery (2000)]]

===Before European settlement===
Prior to its proclamation as a British settlement in 1836, the area around Adelaide was inhabited by the indigenous [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] nation (pronounced "Garner" or "Gowna").

Kaurna culture and language was almost completely destroyed within a few decades of the European settlement of South Australia in 1836.<ref>[http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/adelaide_history/adelaide_brief_history.pdf] {{wayback|url=http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/adelaide_history/adelaide_brief_history.pdf |date=20130515205647 }}</ref> However, extensive documentation by early missionaries and other researchers has enabled a modern revival of both language and culture.

[[File:Adelaide supplement to the Illustrated Sydney News.png|thumb|In July 1876, the Illustrated Sydney News published a special supplement that included an early aerial view of the City of Adelaide, the River Torrens and portion of North Adelaide from a point above Pennington Terrace, North Adelaide.]]

South Australia was officially proclaimed as a new British colony on 28 December 1836, near [[The Old Gum Tree]] in what is now the suburb of [[Glenelg North, South Australia|Glenelg North]]. The event is commemorated in South Australia as [[Proclamation Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1463|title=City of Holdfast Bay – Proclamation Day|publisher=}}</ref> The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, through the design made by the architect [[George Strickland Kingston]].<ref>Johnson and Langmead, [http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1082509 ''The Adelaide city plan: fiction and fact''], Wakefield Press, 1986.</ref>

Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress,<ref>Wakefield cites:
* Edward Curr, ''An Account of the Colony of Van Diemen's Land, principally designed for the use of emigrants'', George Cowie & Co., London, 1824;
* Henry Widdowson, ''Present State of Van Diemen's Land; comprising an account of its agricultural capabilities, with observations on the present state of farming, &c. &c. pursued in that colony: and other important matters connected with Emigration'', S. Robinson, W. Joy and J. Cross, London, and J. Birdsall, Northampton, 1829; and

Cross, London, 1826
</ref> and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals.<ref>Wakefield, ''Letter from Sydney'', December 1829, pp. 99–185, written from Newgate prison. Editor Robert Gouger.</ref> Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen.<ref>Wakefield wrote about this under a pseudonym, purporting to be an Australian settler. His subterfuge was so successful that he confused later writers including [[Karl Marx]], who wrote "It is the great merit of E.G. Wakefield to have discovered not anything new about the Colonies, but to have discovered in the Colonies the truth of as to the condition of capitalist production in the mother-country.' ''Das Kapital'', Moscow, 1958, p 766"</ref>  Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land.<ref>''Plan of a Company to be Established for the Purpose of Founding a Colony in Southern Australia, Purchasing Land Therein, and Preparing the Land so Purchased for the Reception of Immigrants'', 1832; in Wakefield, Edward Gibbon, Prichard, M.

[[File:North Terrace, 1841.jpg|thumb|North Terrace in 1841]]

As it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a gaol in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. However, by mid-1837 the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now named [[South Australia Police]]) in April 1838 under 21-year-old [[Henry Inman (police commander)|Henry Inman]].<ref>J.

[[File:Karte Adelaide MKL1888.png|thumb||upright=1.0|1888 Map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout]]

Adelaide's early history was wrought by economic uncertainty and incompetent leadership.{{Dubious|date=October 2015}} The first governor of South Australia, [[John Hindmarsh]], clashed frequently with others, in particular the Resident Commissioner, [[James Hurtle Fisher]]. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over {{convert|405|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. Light's survey was completed in this period and land was promptly offered for sale to early colonists.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north.

[[George Gawler|Governor Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a [[Customs House Port Adelaide|customs house]] and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. In addition, houses for public officials and missionaries and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during Gawler's governorship.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Adelaide had also become economically self-sufficient during this period, but at heavy cost: as a result of Gawler's public works the colony was heavily in debt and relied on bail-outs from London to stay afloat.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey|Governor Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established with the [[Murray River]] being successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament. [[Secret ballot]]s were introduced, and a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.<ref>{{cite web | author=Blair, Robert D.| year=2001| title=Events in South Australian History 1834–1857 | work=Pioneer Association of South Australia |url=http://www.users.on.net/~rdblair/events-sa.htm | accessdate=10 May 2006}}</ref>

In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the [[University of Adelaide]] was founded in 1874, the [[South Australian Art Gallery]] opened in 1881 and the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric trams were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in World War I. Historian F.W. Crowley examined the reports of visitors in the early 20th century, noting that "many visitors to Adelaide admired the [[Light's Vision|foresighted planning]] of its founders", as well as pondering on the riches of the young city.<ref>F.K. Crowley, ''Modern Australia in Documents: 1901 – 1939''</ref> Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom, entering a time of relative prosperity. Its population grew, and it became the 3rd most populous metropolitan area in the country—after Sydney and Melbourne. Its prosperity was short lived, with the return of droughts, having endured the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, and later returning to fortune under strong government leadership.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}[[Secondary sector of industry|Secondary industries]] helped reduce the state's dependence on [[primary sector of industry|primary industries]]. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location.<ref>Cockburn, S (1991): ''Playford - Benevolent Despot.'' Axiom Publishing. P. 85. ISBN 0 9594164 4 7</ref> Shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]].

The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries. International manufacturers like General Motors [[Holden]] and [[Chrysler Australia|Chrysler]]<ref>When Chrysler stopped manufacturing in Adelaide, [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited]] took over the [[Tonsley Park]] factory. After many years of mixed fortunes, Mitsubishi ceased manufacturing at Tonsley Park on 27 March 2008.</ref> made use of these factories around Adelaide, completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a 20th-century city. A pipeline from [[Mannum, South Australia|Mannum]] brought [[River Murray]] water to Adelaide in 1954 and [[Adelaide International Airport|an airport]] opened at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]] in 1955. [[Flinders University]] and the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, south of the city. Today, Flinders Medical Centre is one of the largest teaching hospitals within the South Australia.

The [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan Governments]] of the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival' {{cn|date=May 2016}}, establishing a wide array of social reforms and overseeing the city becoming a centre of the arts, building upon the biennial "[[Adelaide Festival of Arts]]" which commenced in 1960. Adelaide hosted the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]] between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands; it then moved to Melbourne in 1996.<ref name="f1-move">{{cite web | title =Adelaide Street Circuit | publisher=Formula 1 Database |url=http://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Adelaide_Street_Circuit | access-date=13 June 2007}}</ref> The 1991 [[State Bank of South Australia|State Bank]] collapsed during the then economic recession, with its effects lasting until 2004, when ratings agency [[Standard & Poor's]] reinstated South Australia's AAA credit rating.<ref>{{Cite news | title = All-round country |work=The Australian | page = 14 | date = 29 September 2004}}</ref>  Since 1999, the [[Clipsal 500]] [[V8 Supercars]] race has made use of sections of the former Formula One circuit.

In the early years of the 21st century there was a significant increase in the State Government's spending on Adelaide's infrastructure. The [[Mike Rann|Rann Government]] invested $535 million in a major upgrade of the Adelaide Oval to enable [[Australian Football League|AFL]] to be played in the city centre<ref>Michael Owen, The Australian, 3 December 2009</ref> and more than $2 billion to build a new [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] on land adjacent to the Adelaide Railway Station.<ref>ABC News, Wednesday 7 June 2006</ref> The Glenelg tramline was extended through the city to Hindmarsh<ref>ABC News, 6 April 2005</ref> and the suburban railway line extended south to Seaford.<ref>ABC News, 13 May 2009</ref>

Following a period of stagnancy in the 1990s and 2000s, Adelaide began several major developments and redevelopments.

==Geography==
[[File:Adelaide Metropol.png|thumb|Satellite image of Adelaide's metropolitan area. The Adelaide Hills is the green area to the right of the image.]]

Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the foothills, and {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] at its northern extent to [[Sellicks Beach, South Australia|Sellicks Beach]] in the south. According to the Regional Development Australia, an Australian government planning initiative, the "Adelaide Metropolitan Region" has a total land area of {{convert|870|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while a more expansive definition by the Australia Bureau of Statistics defines a "Greater Adelaide" statistical area totalling {{convert|3,257.7|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.  The city sits at an average elevation of {{convert|50|m|ft|}} above sea level.  [[Mount Lofty]], east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of {{convert|727|m|ft|}}, is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]].

[[File:Adelaide Hills aerial.jpg|thumb||Aerial view of fields in the [[Adelaide Hills]]]]

Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation – sandhills, swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion.<ref>[http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/sharedassets/public/coasts/no27.pdf The Adelaide Metropolitan Coastline] ''Coastline'', South Australian Coastal Protection Board, No. 27, April  1993. Retrieved 6 December 2015.</ref> Where practical, the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaide's beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the [[Cleland Conservation Park]] and [[Belair National Park]]. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and [[Onkaparinga River National Park|Onkaparinga]] catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] supplying around 40% and the much larger [[Mount Bold Reservoir]] 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.

Adelaide and its surrounding area is one of the most seismically active regions in Australia. On 1 March 1954 at 3:40&nbsp;am Adelaide experienced its largest recorded earthquake to date, with the epicentre 12&nbsp;km from the city centre at [[Darlington, South Australia|Darlington]], and a reported magnitude of 5.6.<ref>C.

===Urban layout===
{{Main|Light's Vision}}
[[File:Adelaide nth tce1.8.jpg|thumb|thumb|left|The corner of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] (right) and [[Pulteney Street, Adelaide|Pulteney Street]] (left), looking south-west from [[Bonython Hall]].]]

Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia, Colonel [[William Light]]. His plan, now known as '''Light's Vision''', arranged Adelaide in a grid, with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.<ref>Page, M. (1981): ''Port Adelaide and its Institute, 1851-1979.'' Rigby Publishers Ltd. Pp.17-20. ISBN 0727015109</ref> Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition.

The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable [[cardinal direction]] grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].<ref>[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''], 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport. {{wayback|url=http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp |date=20140306220115 }}</ref>

[[File:Torrens River at night.jpg|thumb|Footbridge across the Torrens River, with the [[Adelaide Oval|Adelaide Oval stadium]] in the background]]

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and "country towns", as well as the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]].

New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adelaide's Freeways – A History from MATS to the Port River Expressway |work=Ozroads |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm}}</ref> The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.

[[File:King William Street-Adelaide.jpg|thumb|King William Street, one of the widest main streets in an Australian capital city, viewed from Victoria Square.]]

In the 1960s, a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&nbsp;million as the first of these developments.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 "Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village"], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

====Housing====
{{Main|Australian residential architectural styles}}

Historically, Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on {{convert|1/4|acre|m2|adj=on|disp=flip}} blocks. A relative lack of suitable locally available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.<ref>Gibbs, R.M. (2013): ''Under the burning sun: a history of colonial South Australia, 1836-1900''. Peacock Publications. Pp. 58, 333-4. ISBN 978-1921601-85-9</ref>

[[File:Adelaide-NthTce-EastEnd-TerraceHouses-Aug08.jpg|thumb||A row of [[terrace houses]] at the east end of North Terrace.]]

There is a wide variety in the styles of these predominately brick, and to a lesser degree, stone, and/or stone-faced, single-storey detached houses. After both of the World Wars, the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s, cream bricks became popular, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then, cement tiles and colourbond corrugated (and other types of) iron have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, the majority of houses were of "double brick" construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by "dwarf walls". Due to Adelaide's [[Shrink–swell capacity|reactive soils]] (particularly Keswick Clay, black earth and some red-brown earth soils<ref>Sheard, M. J., & A. P. Belperio (1995): "Problem soils". In: Drexel, J. F. & Preiss, W. V. (eds.) ''The geology of South Australia''. Vol.2, The Phanerozoic. p. 274. South Australia Geological Survey, Bulletin 54. ISBN 9780730806219</ref>), since then houses have mainly been constructed of "[[brick veneer]]" over a timber frame (and more recently, over a steel frame) on a concrete raft slab foundation.<ref name=Cadden>Rosemary Cadden: ''Building South Australia: celebrating 125 years''. Solstice Media. pp. 77, 87. ISBN 9780646513430</ref> The use of precast concrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased.<ref name=Cadden /> In addition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the [[South Australian Housing Trust]].

In the 1960s and 1970s, many of the older houses were demolished and replaced by "home units" – a group of three-to-five single-storey dwellings on a common title with shared access.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Two-storey blocks of flats were also common in this period. [[Dutch Colonial]] architecture is rare in Adelaide, but there are a few noteworthy examples in the style popularised in the United States, in the 1960s. The style was brought to South Australia by George Gavin Lawson.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In the 21st century, a significant factor is the government policy of "Urban infill", where single-storey detached houses are being demolished, the land subdivided, and double-storey semi-detached "town-houses" are being built in their place.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Adelaide}}

Adelaide has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Tapper |first=Andrew |last2=Tapper |first2=Nigel |title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First |editor=Gray, Kathleen |page=300}}</ref> with warm to hot dry summers and mild damp winters, with most [[precipitation]] falling in the winter months. Adelaide receives enough annual precipitation to avoid [[Köppen]]'s BSh (semi-arid climate) classification. Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80&nbsp;mm. [[Frosts]] are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Adelaide is a windy city — it experiences [[wind chill]] in winter, which makes the temperature [[apparent temperature|seem colder than it actually is]]. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely uncommon, except for very light and sporadic falls in the hills and at [[Mount Lofty]] — with the most recent occurrence being on 11 July 2015. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from {{convert|8|°C|°F}} to {{convert|10|°C|°F}}.

[[File:OIC sa parliament 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Parliament House, Adelaide]]]]

Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the [[Government of South Australia]]. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the [[City of Adelaide]]. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the state government's collaboration with the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The state parliament's Capital City Committee<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capcity.adelaide.sa.gov.au |title=Capital City Committee |date = October 2008 |publisher=Government of South Australia and Adelaide City Council |accessdate=20 June 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618221636/http://www.capcity.adelaide.sa.gov.au/ | archivedate= 18 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.

==Local governments==
{{Further|Local government areas of South Australia}}

The Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between eighteen [[Local Government Areas of South Australia|local government areas]], including, at its centre, the [[City of Adelaide]], which administers the [[Adelaide city centre]], [[North Adelaide]], and the surrounding [[Adelaide Parklands]]. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, [[James Hurtle Fisher]], was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Adelaide|Lord Mayor]], the current being Lord Mayor [[Martin Haese]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-09/businessman-martin-haese-elected-as-new-lord-mayor-of-adelaide/5877462?section=sa Businessman Martin Haese elected as Lord Mayor of Adelaide, ousting Stephen Yarwood] ABC News, 10 November 2014.

Major areas of population growth in recent years have been in outer suburbs such as [[Mawson Lakes, South Australia|Mawson Lakes]] and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 366,912 houses, 57,695 semi-detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,413 flats, units or apartments.<ref name="ABS2011" />

About one sixth (17.1%) of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.

Overseas-born Adelaideans composed 29.8% of the total population. Suburbs including [[Newton, South Australia|Newton]], [[Payneham, South Australia|Payneham]] and [[Campbelltown, South Australia|Campbelltown]] in the east and [[Torrensville, South Australia|Torrensville]], [[West Lakes, South Australia|West Lakes]] and [[Fulham, South Australia|Fulham]] to the west, have large [[Greek Australian|Greek]] and [[Italian Australian|Italian]] communities. The Italian consulate is located in the eastern suburb of [[Payneham, South Australia|Payneham]].

===Age structure===
Adelaide is ageing more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. More than a quarter (27.5%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55&nbsp;years or older, in comparison to the national average of 25.6%. Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15-year-olds), who comprised 17.7% of the population, compared to the national average of 19.3%.<ref name="ABS2011" />

===Religion===
[[File:St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Victoria Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Adelaide|Saint Francis Xavier's Cathedral]] in Victoria Square]]

Adelaide was founded on a vision of religious tolerance which attracted a wide variety of religious practitioners. This led to it being known as ''The City of Churches''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1455 |title=Religion: Diversity |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1466 |title=Religious freedom |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}</ref> However, approximately 28% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 22.3%, making Adelaide one of the least religious cities in Australia.
Over half of the population of Adelaide identifies as Christian, with the largest denominations being [[Roman Catholic Church in Australia|Catholic]] (21.3%), [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] (12.6%), [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]] (7.6%) and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] (3.5%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/4GADE?opendocument&navpos=220 |title=2011 Census – Greater Adelaide |publisher=}}</ref>

Manufacturing, defence technology, high tech electronic systems and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries all play a role in the SA economy. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia are made in Adelaide at the [[General Motors Holden]] plant in [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]].<ref>{{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.southaustralia.biz/fact_sheets/fact_automotive.biz.pdf|date =20110726013520}}{{Dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

The [[State Bank of South Australia|collapse of the State Bank in 1992]] resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4&nbsp;billion). The collapse meant that successive governments enacted lean budgets, cutting spending, which was a setback to the further economic development of the city and state. The debt has more recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.<ref>[http://www.southaustralia.biz/news/sa_creditrating.htm ] {{wayback|url=http://www.southaustralia.biz/news/sa_creditrating.htm |date=20120115021213 }}</ref>

The global media conglomerate [[News Corporation]] was founded in, and until 2004 incorporated in, Adelaide and it is still considered its 'spiritual' home by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Australia's largest oil company, [[Santos Limited|Santos]], prominent South Australian brewery, [[Coopers Brewery|Coopers]], and national retailer [[Harris Scarfe]] also call Adelaide their home.

===Defence industry===
Adelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries, which contribute over A$1&nbsp;billion to South Australia's Gross State Product.<ref>[http://indaily.com.au/news/2013/08/28/defence-interactive/ Visualised: How Defence dominates govt tenders in SA] ''InDaily'', 28 August 2013.

Each quarter, [[The Alternative and Direct Investment Securities Association]] (ADISA) publishes a list of median house sale prices by suburb and [[Local government in Australia|Local Government Area]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} (Previously, this was done by REISA<ref name=RESIA/>) Due to the small size of many of Adelaide's suburbs, the low volumes of sales in these suburbs, and (over time) the huge variations in the numbers of sales in a suburb in a quarter, statistical analysis of "the most expensive suburb" is unreliable; the suburbs appearing in the "top 10 most expensive suburbs this quarter" list is constantly varying. Quarterly Reports for the last two years can be found on the REISA website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reisa.com.au/publicinfo/median-house-prices|title=Public Information – REISA|publisher=}}</ref>

===Primary and secondary education===
At the level of primary and secondary education, there are two systems of school education. There is a public system operated by the South Australian Government and a private system of independent and [[Catholic school]]s. All schools provide education under the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]] (SACE) or, to a lesser extent, the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), with Adelaide having the highest number of IB schools in Australia.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Tertiary education===

While established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838 bringing with them the [[vine cuttings]] that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the [[Barossa Valley]].

After the Second World War, British, Italian, [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Polish people|Polish]] and other European immigrants settled in Adelaide.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} The conclusion of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975 saw an influx of Indo-Chinese immigrants to Adelaide.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} (''See: [[Immigration history of Australia]].'')

===Arts and entertainment===
Adelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers from both major political parties. The renowned [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] and [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe Festival]] were established in 1960 under Thomas Playford. Construction of the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] and, in 1976, the [[State Opera of South Australia]].

Over time, the Adelaide Festival has expanded to include the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]], [[Adelaide Film Festival]], [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]], [[Adelaide Writers' Week]], and [[WOMADelaide]], all held predominately in the autumnal month of March (sometimes jocularly called 'mad March' by locals due to the hectic clustering of these events). Other festivals include [[Feast Festival|FEAST]] (a [[LGBT culture|queer culture]] celebration), [[Tasting Australia]] (a biennial food and wine affair), and the [[Royal Adelaide Show]] (an annual [[agricultural show]] and [[state fair]]).

[[File:Adelaide Convention Centre at night.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Adelaide Convention Centre]], the first of its kind in South Australia, is situated on the River Torrens. Photo taken in 2007.]]

There are many international cultural fairs, most notably the German [[Schützenfest]] and Greek [[Glendi]]. Adelaide is home to the [[Adelaide Christmas Pageant]], the world's largest [[Santa Claus parade|Christmas parade]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} As the state capital, Adelaide is home to a great number of cultural institutions with many along the boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], with around 35,000 works, holds Australia's second largest state-based collection. Adjacent are the [[South Australian Museum]] and [[State Library of South Australia]], while the [[Adelaide Botanic Garden]], [[National Wine Centre]] and [[Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute]] are nearby in the [[East End, Adelaide|East End]] of the city. In the back of the State Library lies the [[Migration Museum, Adelaide|Migration Museum]], Australia's oldest museum of its kind. Contemporary art scenes include the [[Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia]]. [[Adelaide Festival Centre]], on the banks of the Torrens, is the focal point for much of the cultural activity in the city and home to the [[State Theatre Company of South Australia]], with other venues including the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] and the city's many smaller theatres, pubs and cabaret bars.

[[File:AdelaidaParlamento.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|right|The Adelaide Town Hall]]

[[File:Adl utd stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Hindmarsh Stadium]] hosts [[Adelaide United]].]]

The main sports played professionally in Adelaide are [[Australian rules football]], [[association football|association football (soccer)]], [[cricket]], [[netball]], and [[basketball]]. Adelaide is the home of two [[Australian Football League]] teams: the [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Power]], and one [[A-League]] soccer team, [[Adelaide United]]. A local [[Australian rules football]] league, the [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]], is made up of ten teams from around Adelaide. The SANFL has been in operation since 1877 when it began as the South Australian Football Association (SAFL) before changing its name to the SANFL in 1927. The SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code played in Australia.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
Adelaide has developed a strong culture of attracting crowds to major sporting events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/01/17/australian-sport-owes-much-to-little-old-adelaide/|title=Australian sport owes much to little old Adelaide|publisher=}}</ref> Until the completion of the 2012–14 renovation and upgrade of the [[Adelaide Oval]], most large sporting events took place at either [[AAMI Stadium]] (the then home base of the [[Adelaide Crows]], and the then [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide's]] home game venue), or the historic [[Adelaide Oval]], home of the [[Southern Redbacks]] and the [[Adelaide Strikers]] cricket teams. Since completion of the upgrade, home games for Adelaide Crows & Port Adelaide now take place at Adelaide Oval.

[[File:Adelaide Oval, 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adelaide Oval]] is the home of [[Australian rules football]] and [[Cricket]] in [[South Australia]].]]

Since 1884, [[Adelaide Oval]] has also hosted an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of [[One Day International]] cricket matches. [[Memorial Drive Park]], adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host Davis Cup and other major tennis events, including (until 2009) the Adelaide International (now known as the [[Brisbane International]]). Adelaide's professional association football team, [[Adelaide United]], play in the A-League. Founded in 2003, their home ground is [[Hindmarsh Stadium]], which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few [[Soccer-specific stadium|purpose-built soccer stadia]] in Australia.

For two years, 1997 and 1998, Adelaide was represented in Australia's top level [[rugby league]], after the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] had played a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval for five years starting in 1991.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The [[Adelaide Rams]] were formed and played in the breakaway [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] (SL) competition in [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997]] before moving to the new [[National Rugby League]] in [[1998 NRL season|1998]]. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to the more suitable Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a peace deal with the [[Australian Rugby League]] to end the [[Super League war]], the club's owners [[News Limited]] (who were also owners of the SL) suddenly closed the club only weeks before the start of the [[1999 NRL season|1999 season]].

Adelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men's team being the [[Adelaide 36ers]] who play in the [[National Basketball League Australia]] and the women's team, the [[Adelaide Lightning]] who play in the [[Women's National Basketball League]]. Both teams play their home games at the [[Adelaide Arena|Titanium Security Arena]]. Adelaide has a professional [[netball]] team, the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], who play in the trans-Tasman netball competition, the [[ANZ Championship]], with home games played at [[ETSA Park]]. The Thunderbirds occasionally play games or finals at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, while international netball matches are usually played at either the Entertainment Centre or the Adelaide Arena.

[[File:Tourdownunder2.jpg|thumb||The [[Tour Down Under]] is the first event of the [[UCI World Tour]] calendar.]]

Since 1999 Adelaide and its surrounding areas has hosted the [[Tour Down Under]] [[Bicycle racing|bicycle race]], organised and directed by Adelaide-based [[Mike Turtur]]. Turtur won an [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] [[gold medal]] for Australia in the [[Cycling at the 1984 Summer Olympics|4000m Team pursuit]] at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympics]]. The Tour Down Under is the largest cycling event outside Europe and was the first event outside Europe to be granted [[UCI ProTour]] status. Adelaide maintains a franchise in the [[Australian Baseball League]], the [[Adelaide Bite]]. They have been playing since 2009, and their home stadium is [[Norwood Oval|Coopers Stadium]]. Their name stems from the local [[Great Australian Bight]], and from the abundance of local [[Great White Shark]]s. Adelaide also has an Ice Hockey team, [[Adelaide Adrenaline]] in the [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] (AIHL). They were national champions in 2009 and play their games at the [[Ice Arena (Adelaide)|Ice Arena]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaideadrenaline.com.au/ |title=adelaideadrenaline.com.au |work=Adelaide Adrenaline 2014}}</ref>

The [[Australian Grand Prix]] for [[Formula One]] racing was hosted by Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] which was laid out in the city's eastern parklands.<ref name="f1-move"/> The Grand Prix became a source of pride and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful [[Adelaide 500|Clipsal 500]] for [[V8 Supercar]] racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a [[rallying|rally]] of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.

The [[World Solar Challenge]] race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations, although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide hosted the 2012 World Bowls Championships<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbowls2012.com/|title=worldbowls2012.com|work=Independent Insurance}}</ref>  at Lockleys Bowling Club, becoming the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.

[[Dirt track racing|Dirt track speedway]] is also popular in Adelaide with three operating speedways. [[Speedway City]], located adjacent to the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] road racing circuit at [[Virginia, South Australia|Virginia]] ({{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the city centre) has been in continuous operation since 1979. [[Gillman Speedway]] located in the semi-industrial suburb of [[Gillman, South Australia|Gillman]], has been in operation since 1998 and caters to [[Motorcycle speedway]] (including [[Sidecar speedway|Sidecars]]), while the [[Sidewinders Speedway]] is also a motorcycle speedway dedicated to Under-16 riders and has been in operation since 1978.

[[File:SAHMRI Adelaide SA.jpg|thumb||The [[South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute]] (SAHMRI) located on [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]]]

Adelaide's two largest tertiary hospitals are the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] (RAH), a [[teaching hospital]] of the University of Adelaide (705 beds), and the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] (580 beds) in Bedford Park, a teaching hospital of Flinders University. Other major public hospitals in the Adelaide area are the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|Women's and Children's Hospital]] (305 beds), on King William Road in North Adelaide; the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] (340 beds) in Woodville, the [[Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park]] (300 beds) in Daw Park, and the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] (198 beds) in Elizabeth. These hospitals are all teaching hospitals. Additional RAH campuses which specialise in specific patient services are in the suburbs of Adelaide – the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in [[Northfield, South Australia|Northfield]], and the [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]] Campus Mental Health Service. Adelaide also hosts numerous private hospitals in the city centre and suburbs.

In June 2007 the State Government announced a series of overhauls to the health sector that would see a new hospital constructed on railyards at the west end of the city, to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital at the east end of the city. The new 800-bed hospital has a cost of A$1.85 billion and was planned to be named the "Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital" after the [[Marjorie Jackson|former Governor of South Australia]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Owen | first = Michael | title =800 beds, helipad and train station: Our 'Marj' hospital | newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | page = 5 | date = 7 June 2007 |url=}}</ref> However, in 2009, at the former governor's request, the state government chose to drop this name and instead transfer the Royal Adelaide Hospital name to the proposed facility. Construction started in June 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahp.com.au/index.php/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions – General|publisher=}}</ref>

In addition, major upgrades were announced to see the Flinders Medical Centre become the primary centre for health care for the southern suburbs, and the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] in Elizabeth become the centre for the northern suburbs. The trio of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the [[Modbury Hospital]] and the Noarlunga Hospital were to become specialist elective surgery centres. The Repatriation General Hospital was also to expand its range of speciality areas beyond veterans' health to incorporate stroke, orthopaedic rehabilitation and aged care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=1712 |title='News: New $1.7&nbsp;billion hospital spearheads health reform' |publisher=Ministers.sa.gov.au |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090815004226/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au:80/news.php?id=1712 |archivedate=15 August 2009 }}</ref> With the "Global Financial Crisis" of 2008, it remains to be seen if and how these initiatives will proceed.

The largest not-for-profit provider of community health care within Adelaide is the [[Royal District Nursing Service (South Australia)]]  which provides out of hospital care and hospital avoidance care, which in turn eases pressure on the South Australia public hospital system.

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Adelaide}}
[[File:TransAdelaideRailwayMap.svg|thumb|upright|A map of Adelaide's railway and tram network, served by the [[Adelaide Metro]].]]

Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan-wide public transport system, which is managed by and known as the [[Adelaide Metro]]. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[O-Bahn Busway]], [[Railways in Adelaide|metropolitan railways]] (with diesel and electric lines), and the Adelaide-[[Glenelg Tram]], which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]]. There are further plans to extend the tram to [[Port Adelaide]] and [[Semaphore, South Australia|Semaphore]]. A [[Central Business District|CBD]] tram loop too, is being considered and the latest [[Adelaide Airport]] master plan has also revealed a tram extension to the airport in the near future.<ref>http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/city-loop-in-tram-proposal/story-e6frea6u-1226032608322</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaideairport.com.au/assets/pdfs/master-planning/Vol2MaterPlanDec2009.pdf |format=PDF |title=Master Plan – Adelaide Airport |publisher=adelaideairport.com.au}}</ref>

Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Historically, Adelaide was known as a "twenty-minute city", with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now often considered inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic, and often experience traffic congestion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Metro Malcontent – The Twenty Minute City No More |work=Royal Automobile Association, South Australia |format=PDF |year=2005|url=http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents\document_677.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2008}} (1.18MB)</ref>

The Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:
*The [[South Eastern Freeway]] (M1), connects the south-east corner of the Adelaide Plain to the Adelaide Hills and beyond to [[Murray Bridge]] and [[Tailem Bend]], where it then continues as National Highway 1 south-east to Melbourne.
*The [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]] (M2), connecting the outer southern suburbs with the inner southern suburbs and the city centre. It duplicates the route of [[South Road]].
*The [[North-South Motorway]] (M2), is an ongoing major project that will become the major north-south corridor, replacing most of what is now [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]], connecting the Southern Expressway and the [[Port River Expressway]]. Currently, the motorway runs as an elevated freeway from its junction with the Port River Expressway to Regency Road, in Adelaide's inner north-west. Continuation of the motorway is currently under construction at both ends of the motorway, at Darlington and in the "Torrens to Torrens" project.
*The [[Port River Expressway]] (A9), connects Port Adelaide and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] to Port Wakefield Road at the northern "entrance" to the metropolitan area.
*The [[Northern Expressway|Northern Expressway (Max Fatchen Expressway)]] (M20), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the [[Gawler bypass road|Gawler Bypass]] to Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.
*The [[Northern Connector]] (proposed route M20) is due to start construction in 2016 to connect the North-South Motorway with the Northern Expressway. The road will not be subject to direct tolls, but South Australia will become a testing ground for a "network fee" which involves charging trucks based on road use and impact in place of high registration fees.

====Airports====
[[File:Adelaide Airport, 2008.jpg|thumb||A [[Qantas]] plane leaving [[Adelaide Airport]].]]

The Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial airports, [[Adelaide Airport]] and [[Parafield Airport]]. Adelaide Airport, in Adelaide's western suburbs, serves in excess of 7 million passengers annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://annualreport.adelaideairport.com.au/pdf/AAL%20Annual%20Report%202012.pdf |format=PDF |title=Adelaide Airport Limited Annual Report |publisher=annualreport.adelaideairport.com.au}}</ref> Parafield Airport, Adelaide's second airport {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=off}} north of the city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation purposes. Parafield Airport served as Adelaide's main aerodrome until the opening of the Adelaide Airport in February 1955.

[[File:Happy Valley Reservoir 20070223.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] in early 2007]]

Adelaide's energy requirements were originally met by the [[Adelaide Electric Supply Company]], which was nationalised by the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] government in 1946,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/norrie-sir-charles-willoughby-moke-11254 | title = Biography – Sir Charles Willoughby Moke Norrie | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography | author = P.A. Howell | accessdate =16 June 2012 }}</ref> becoming the [[SA Power Networks|Electricity Trust of South Australia]] (ETSA), now known as SA Power Networks. Despite significant public opposition and the Labor party's anti-privatisation stance which left the Liberal party one vote short of the numbers needed to pass the legislation, ETSA was privatised by the [[John Olsen|Olsen]] Government in 1999 by way of a 200-year lease for the distribution network and the outright purchase of ETSA Power by the [[Cheung Kong Holdings]] for $3.5 billion (11 times ETSA's annual earnings) after Labor MP [[Trevor Crothers]] resigned from the party and voted with the government.<ref>http://www.electricity-week.com.au/erisk7/article/315187/function.pg-connect</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58398249.html|title=South Australia|publisher=}}</ref> The electricity retail market was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition was expected to result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110318191.html|title=Power crisis 'as bad as California'.|publisher=}}</ref> In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115625174.html|title=Privatisation 'will cost state billions'.|publisher=}}</ref>  In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while generation costs had in fact fallen 35% by 2012.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} These price increases and large subsides have led to South Australia paying the highest retail price for electricity in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/renewables-blowout-as-wind-solar-hit-harder-than-tax/story-fn59niix-1226397210436 | title = Renewables blowout as wind, solar hit harder than tax | work=The Australian | author1 = Sid Maher | author2 = Michael Owen | date = 16 June 2011 | accessdate =16 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/power-prices-to-be-highest-in-the-world/story-e6frea83-1226305741810 | title = South Australia's power prices set to become highest in the world says Energy Users Association of Australia | first = Claire| last = Peddie | work = AdelaideNow | date = 21 March 2012 | accessdate =16 June 2012 }}</ref>

SA Power Networks now distributes electricity from transmission companies to end users. Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Some of the major companies are: [[TRUenergy]], which generates electricity; [[ElectraNet]], which transmits electricity from the generators to the distribution network, [[Lumo Energy]] and [[AGL Energy]], which retails gas and electricity.<ref name="EnergySA1">{{cite web | title=Industry structure | work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure |url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/dhtml/ss/section.php?sectID=12&tempID=1 | accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624044124/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/dhtml/ss/section.php?sectID=12&tempID=1 |archivedate = 24 June 2005}}</ref> Substantial investment has been made in maintenance and reinforcement of the electricity supply network to provide continued reliability of supply.

Adelaide derives most of its electricity from the [[Torrens Island Power Station]] gas-fired plant operated by [[AGL Energy]] and the [[Pelican Point Power Station]], along with wind power and connections to the national grid. Gas is supplied from the [[Moomba, South Australia|Moomba]] Gas Processing Plant in the [[Cooper Basin]] via the [[Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System]]<ref name="EnergySA2">{{cite web | title=Supply Security | work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure |url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&tempID=1 | accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624044821/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&tempID=1 |archivedate = 24 June 2005}}</ref> and the [[SEAGas pipeline]] from Victoria. South Australia generates 18% of its electricity from [[wind power]], and has 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Water,+energy+and+environment/Energy/Renewable+energy/Wind+energy/Wind+energy+in+South+Australia |title=Wind Energy in South Australia |publisher=Government of South Australia |accessdate=16 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121018043135/http://www.sa.gov.au:80/subject/Water%2C+energy+and+environment/Energy/Renewable+energy/Wind+energy/Wind+energy+in+South+Australia |archivedate=18 October 2012 }}</ref>

Adelaide's water supply is gained from its reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], [[Myponga Reservoir|Myponga]], [[Millbrook Reservoir|Millbrook]], [[Hope Valley Reservoir|Hope Valley]], [[Little Para Reservoir|Little Para]] and [[South Para Reservoir|South Para]]. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]]. A [[Adelaide Desalination Plant|sea water desalination plant]] capable of supplying half of Adelaide's water requirements (100GL per annum) was opened in 2013. The provision of water services is by the government-owned [[SA Water]].
