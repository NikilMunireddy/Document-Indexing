'''Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna Göteborg''', commonly known as '''IFK Göteborg''', is a Swedish professional [[Football team|football club]] based in [[Gothenburg]]. Founded on 4 October 1904, it is the only club in the Nordic countries that has won a pan-European competition, as the club won the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[1981–82 UEFA Cup|1982]] and [[1986–87 UEFA Cup|1987]]. IFK is affiliated with [[Göteborgs Fotbollförbund]] and play all their home games at [[Gamla Ullevi]] since the start of the 2009 season. The club colours are blue and white, colours shared both with the sports society—[[Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna]]—which the club originated from, and with the home town of Gothenburg.

Besides the two UEFA Cup titles, they have won 18 [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish championship]] titles, a record in Swedish football shared with [[Malmö FF]], and have the third most [[Svenska Cupen|national cup]] titles with seven. The team has qualified for four group stages of the [[UEFA Champions League]], and reached the semi-finals of the [[1985–86 European Cup]]. IFK Göteborg is the only Swedish club team in any sport to have won the [[Radiosportens Jerringpris]]—an award for best sports performance of the year voted by the Swedish people—for the 1982 UEFA Cup victory. IFK is one of the most popular football clubs in Sweden, with diverse country-wide support.

They currently play in the highest Swedish league, [[Allsvenskan]], where they have played for the majority of their history. They have played top-flight football in Sweden continuously since 1977, which currently is the longest top-flight tenure of any club in Sweden—the second longest is [[Helsingborgs IF]], since 1993. The club won its first Swedish championship in 1908, four years after the founding, and has won at least one championship title in all decades since, except the 1920s, 1970s and 2010s. IFK Göteborg's most successful period was from 1982 to 1996, when the team prospered in European football and won 10 out of 15 Swedish championships.

== History ==
{{Main|History of IFK Göteborg}}
[[File:Ifkgoteborg1905.jpg|thumb|right|The IFK Göteborg squad year 1905.]]
IFK Göteborg was founded at Café Olivedal, a [[cafeteria]] in the Annedal district in the centre parts of [[Gothenburg]], on October 4, 1904.{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=47}} It was the third, but only lasting, [[Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna|IFK association]] in Gothenburg, becoming the 39th overall.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=9}} A committee for [[Association football|football]] was created at the historic first meeting; the association's first football match ended in a 4–1 victory against a club from the local area, IK Viking.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=10}} The foundation of IFK Göteborg was important for the development of [[Association football|football]] in the city, as until that point, [[Örgryte IS]], the largest of Gothenburg clubs, were dominant. IFK Göteborg represented some needed competition.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|pp=11–13}}

IFK Göteborg became the first Swedish team in four years to beat Örgryte IS in 1907.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=13}} They then went on to win their first [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish Championship]] in 1908 by winning the cup tournament [[Svenska Mästerskapet]], and three players from the club were selected to play for [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in the national team's first match.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=13}} That year IFK played teams from outside Sweden for the first time, meeting the Danish clubs Østerbro BK and [[Boldklubben af 1893]].{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=13}}

In 1910, the team played in blue and white striped jerseys for the first time.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=19}} Two years later the team drew 1–1 in a game against the 1912 Swedish Olympic team, and the newspapers in [[Stockholm]] nominated IFK Göteborg as "the best Swedish football club ever".{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=20}} IFK Göteborg won [[Svenska Serien]]—the highest Swedish league at the time, but not the Swedish Championship deciding competition—for the fifth time in a row in [[1916–17 in Swedish football|1917]]. The early IFK Göteborg team had no trainer; the club gained its first such official in 1921, when Hungarian manager [[Sándor Bródy (footballer)|Sándor Bródy]] was hired.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=25}} Bródy was appointed manager for IFK two years later. The first Swedish official national league, [[Allsvenskan]], started in late [[1924–25 in Swedish football|1924]], the year the legendary [[Filip Johansson]] made his debut for IFK Göteborg.{{sfn|Glanell|Havik|Lindberg|Persson|2004|p=108}} The club finished second, but Johansson scored 39 goals in 22 games and was the league's top goalscorer.{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=48}}

[[File:IFK Göteborg League Performance.png|thumb|240px|right|A chart showing the progress of IFK Göteborg through the [[swedish football league system]]. The different shades of grey represent league divisions.]]

IFK won their first Allsvenskan title in [[1934–35 in Swedish football|1934–35]], the ten previous seasons of the league saw the club finish in the top four.{{sfn|Persson|Glanell|Lundgren|Stark|1988|p=78}} Swedish football was dominated by teams from [[Gothenburg]] during these years,{{sfn|Glanell|Havik|Lindberg|Persson|2004|pp=98–101}} but IFK Göteborg were surprisingly relegated in [[1937–38 in Swedish football|1937–38]],{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=49}} although the team was promoted back to Allsvenskan the next season. Back in the highest division, IFK finished second, with the league continuing despite the outbreak of [[World War II]]. IFK won another title in [[1941–42 in Swedish football|1941–42]] with a strong team,{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=49}} but the rest of the decade saw mixed results. The 1940s team included the talented [[Gunnar Gren]], who became the top scorer in [[1946–47 in Swedish football|1946–47]]. He was also awarded [[Guldbollen]] as the best player in Sweden, and won an Olympic gold medal with the Swedish team at the [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympics]].{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=55}} When Gren left in 1949, IFK were relegated from [[Allsvenskan]] the following season. As happened the last time IFK played in a lower league, they were promoted directly back to Allsvenskan after one season in [[Swedish football Division 2|Division 2]]. IFK went on to compete in a European Cup—the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]]—for the first time in 1958, but were eliminated in the second round by [[FC Erzgebirge Aue|SC Wismut]]. In 1959, the all-time Allsvenskan record attendance of 52,194 was set when IFK played [[Örgryte IS]] at [[Ullevi|Nya Ullevi]].<ref name="sfs">{{cite web |title=Högsta och lägsta publiksiffror i Allsvenskan |url=http://www.bolletinen.se/sfs/allsvenskan/toppublik.pdf |format=PDF| publisher=Sveriges Fotbollshistoriker och Statistiker |year=2004 |accessdate=20 June 2007 |language=Swedish}}</ref>

After an unglamorous decade, IFK were led by manager and retired footballer [[Bertil Johansson]] to a surprising championship title in 1969.{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=49}} The following season was one of the darkest in their history.{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=49}}{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=88}} IFK were relegated, and unlike previous relegations they did not make an immediate return. After three seasons in the second league IFK had lost all signs of being a team from Allsvenskan,{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=99}} and had still not managed to gain promotion. But after hard work from board member Anders Bernmar and others to get the club on the right track, IFK were promoted to Allsvenskan in 1976.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=99}} In 1979, IFK hired [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] as manager.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sven-Göran Eriksson |year=2006 |publisher=The Football Association |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/Coaches/Postings/2003/09/SvenCoach.htm |accessdate=20 June 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050305045303/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/Coaches/Postings/2003/09/SvenCoach.htm |archivedate = 5 March 2005|deadurl=yes}}</ref> He introduced the [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] system with "pressure and support"—called the [[Swenglish]] model<ref name="offsidetoken">{{cite web |title=Bakgrundsfakta till Token från Torsby |year=2006 |url=http://www.offside.org/index.cfm?templateID=3&pageID=4&action=readFullArticle&articleID=85&issueID=37 |publisher=Offside |accessdate=13 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025200/http://www.offside.org/index.cfm?templateID=3&pageID=4&action=readFullArticle&articleID=85&issueID=37 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |language=Swedish}}</ref>—which would give IFK great success later on, and his first season at the club ended with a second place in Allsvenskan and the club's first gold medal in [[Svenska Cupen]].

[[File:Ifk goteborg osk.jpg|thumb|left|IFK Göteborg and their fans celebrate a goal against [[Örebro SK]] in 2004.]]

After reinforcing the team with several expensive players{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=109}}—including Thomas Wernerson and [[Stig Fredriksson]]—IFK had finished second in the league and reached the quarter-finals in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] as 1981 came to an end. 1982 then became a turbulent season as the whole board was replaced and the club almost went bankrupt—even needing to borrow money from the official supporter's association to travel to [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] to play the quarter-final of the UEFA Cup.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|pp=110–111}} After the troubled start IFK won every competition they entered, including Allsvenskan, the Allsvenskan play-off, Svenska Cupen, and the UEFA Cup, defeating [[Hamburger SV]] 4–0 on aggregate in the finals.<ref name="1977-89">{{cite web |last=Jönsson |first=Ingemar |title=IFK Göteborg: 1977–89 |year=2003 |url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/portal/page?_pageid=113,61271&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |publisher=IFK Göteborg |accessdate=13 July 2007 |language=Swedish}}</ref> During the following 15 years the club was the leading club in Swedish football,{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=50}} winning the Swedish championship ten times, the domestic cup three times and the UEFA Cup twice.

IFK managed to field a strong team for a couple of years and won gold in the league in both 1983 and 1984, and the cup in 1983. In 1986, the team reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] but were defeated on penalties against [[FC Barcelona]].<ref name="cresswell">{{cite web |last=Cresswell |first=Peterjon |title=Magazine: Gothenburg |year=2003 |url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=64/newsId=62730.html |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=20 June 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070623024524/http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=64/newsId=62730.html |archivedate = 23 June 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> A new team of talents won both the UEFA Cup and Allsvenskan once again in 1987,<ref name="1977-89" /> after beating [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in the UEFA Cup final.

As IFK won the 1993 Allsvenskan, they qualified for European competition. IFK advanced to the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], where they faced [[FC Barcelona]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Galatasaray S.K.

The new millennium offered varied results, with the club playing a relegation play-off in 2002, but challenging for the championship in 2001, 2004, and 2005. In 2007, the first title in eleven years was secured in the last round of Allsvenskan. The club then won the national cup [[Svenska Cupen]] the next season. IFK Göteborg are still considered to be one of the "Big Three" in Swedish football, along with [[Malmö FF]] and [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], despite only having won three titles in the last ten years.<ref name="cresswell" />{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=10}}{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=27}}{{sfn|Nylin|2004|p=47}}

== Colours, crest and sponsorship ==
=== Colours and kit ===
The traditional colours of all [[Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna|IFK associations]] are blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, it was decided that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=10}}{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=229}} During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=19}} inspired by the kit of [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub]].{{sfn|Persson|Glanell|Lundgren|Stark|1988|p=76}} This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The few visible sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football.<ref name="ab130328">{{cite news |title=Världsklass, Djurgården |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/article16501724.ab |date=28 March 2013 |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |accessdate=30 March 2013 |language=Swedish}}</ref> The traditional away kit is red and white, in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters.<ref name="helvitt">{{cite web |last=Ericson |first=Tomas |title=Blåvitt spelar i helvitt imorgon |date=11 June 2007 |url=http://www.svenskafans.com/fotboll/ifkgoteborg/artikel.asp?id=175704 |publisher=Alltid Blåvitt |accessdate=20 June 2007|language=Swedish}}</ref> In the 2010s, the away kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light grey details, the more traditional red kit with white details, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.

=== Crest ===
The crest of IFK Göteborg has its origins in the [[coat of arms of Gothenburg|coat of arms of the city of Gothenburg]] which in turn is based on several other [[Heraldry|heraldic]] arms. The lion on a field of silver and blue is the heraldic arms of the [[House of Bjelbo|House of Folkung]], and the lion holds the [[Three Crowns]] of Sweden, both symbols being used in the [[coat of arms of Sweden]]. This arms was granted to Gothenburg by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]].<ref name="stadsvapen">{{cite web |title=Stadsvapnets historia |date=4 May 2007 |url=http://www.goteborg.se/prod/sk/goteborg.nsf/1/om_goteborg,stadsvapnets_historia?OpenDocument |publisher=Göteborgs Stad |accessdate=13 July 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070706025010/http://www.goteborg.se/prod/sk/goteborg.nsf/1/om_goteborg,stadsvapnets_historia?OpenDocument |archivedate = 6 July 2007|deadurl=yes|language=Swedish}} [http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.goteborg.se/prod/sk/goteborg.nsf/1/om_goteborg,stadsvapnets_historia?OpenDocument web archive link]</ref> The coat of arms of the city sees the lion facing the sinister (heraldic left, which is viewer's right) side which often is interpreted as a fleeing lion, the normal being a lion facing the dexter (heraldic right) side, and IFK chose to use the latter on the club crest. Finally the three letters [[Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna|IFK]] were added on top. This crest has been used since it first appeared on the kit in 1919.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=241}} These main elements have not been modified since then, but during the years several different designs of the crest have been used, occasionally having the lion facing the sinister side. In the early 1980s, the club standardised the design and only minor changes—such as element colours and different hues—have been made since then, with the exception of the years 1997–1999 when IFK, with [[Reebok]] as kit sponsors, used a crest with some more distinct changes to the standard elements.<ref name="ifkcrest">{{cite web |title=Atletiska män och flyende lejon |date=27 February 2013 |url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/Om-IFK-Goteborg/Karlsrofaltet/Atletiska-man-och-flyende-lejon/ |publisher=IFK Göteborg |accessdate=30 March 2013 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Before 1919 various other symbols were used, with the four-pointed star of the IFK associations featuring on the shirts until 1910.<ref name="ifkcrest" />

{{See also|Gamla Ullevi (1916)|Ullevi|Gamla Ullevi}}
[[File:En stad - Ett lag.jpg|thumb|right|IFK Göteborg's first match (11 April 2009) at the new stadium [[Gamla Ullevi]], a match which IFK won 6–0 against [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]].]]
Historically, IFK Göteborg's main home stadium has been [[Gamla Ullevi (1916)|Gamla Ullevi]], where the majority of the competitive games have been played. The club has played there in two separate periods, most recently after leaving [[Ullevi]] (Nya Ullevi) in 1992, although matches attracting large crowds—such as [[Local derby|derbies]] against the rivals [[Örgryte IS]] and [[GAIS]], or international games—were still played at the larger Ullevi stadium. Gamla Ullevi's capacity was 18,000 when used in the 1990s and 2000s, while Nya Ullevi has a capacity of 43,200.<ref name="gamlaullevi">{{cite web |title=IFK Göteborg: Gamla Ullevi |year=2006 |url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/portal/page?_pageid=113,64384&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&element_id=70288 |publisher=IFK Göteborg |accessdate=21 June 2007|language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name="ullevi">{{cite web |title=IFK Göteborg: Ullevi |year=2006 |url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/portal/page?_pageid=113,61281&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |publisher=IFK Göteborg |accessdate=21 June 2007|language=Swedish}}</ref>

Gamla Ullevi was demolished on 9 January 2007 to make place for a new stadium with the same name, [[Gamla Ullevi]], with a capacity of 18,800. The new stadium was completed in late 2008, but not opened until the start of the [[2009 in Swedish football|2009 season]]. During construction, IFK Göteborg played the 2007 and [[2008 in Swedish football|2008 seasons]] at Nya Ullevi.<ref name="gp070109">{{cite news |author=TT |title=Rivningen av Gamla Ullevi igång |publisher=[[Göteborgs-Posten]] |date=9 January 2007 |url=http://www.gp.se/sport/1.44595-rivningen-av-gamla-ullevi-igang |accessdate=23 February 2009|language=Swedish |authorlink=Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå}}</ref>

On 11 April 2009 IFK Göteborg played their first game on the new [[Gamla Ullevi]] stadium and won against [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] with 6–0 in front of 18,276 spectators.<ref>http://www.bolletinen.se/sfs/java/allsvenskan.htm</ref>

IFK Göteborg have used three other stadia as official home grounds. The first ground was [[Idrottsplatsen]], in use from 1905 to 1916. It was built in 1896 for the cycling club Göteborgs Velocipedklubb, and was originally used for [[track cycling]]. During the [[1909 in Swedish football|1909 season]] IFK Göteborg also used [[Örgryte IS]]' home ground of the time, [[Balders Hage]], due to a conflict with the owners of Idrottsplatsen.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=44}} The third official stadium was [[Walhalla IP|Walhalla Idrottsplats]], used for a number of home matches at the same time as Idrottsplatsen. A fourth ground, [[Slottsskogsvallen]], has never been the official home ground, but has nonetheless been used a number of times for IFK Göteborg home matches.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|pp=46–47}}

Idrottsplatsen fell into decline due to poor leadership and a troubled economy in the 1910s,{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=43}} and a decision was made to completely renovate the arena with the help of outside sponsorship and funding. The construction of the new football ground was started in 1915 and used the site of Idrottsplatsen as foundation. The new stadium, originally named Ullervi,{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=45}} but later changed to Ullevi and finally Gamla Ullevi, was opened in 1916. It was the home ground of IFK Göteborg until 1958, when Nya Ullevi—built for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] held in Sweden—was opened. Due to a number of seasons with low attendance in Swedish football in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a move back to Gamla Ullevi was made in 1992.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=46}}

== Supporters ==
{{See also|Supporterklubben Änglarna}}
Before the foundation of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the Gothenburg area was [[Örgryte IS]], which was considered a middle class club, and in later years an upper class club, like most clubs of that time. IFK became popular amongst the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and the opponents. However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=190}}

After [[World War I]], the rivalry calmed, and Gothenburg supporters became known as friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called ''göteborgstågen'', the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of [[World War II]], when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to [[Borås]] to see IFK play [[IF Elfsborg|Elfsborg]]. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and disturbing a [[Blackout (wartime)|wartime blackout]] exercise.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|p=190}}

[[File:Ifk goteborg supporters.jpg|thumb|left|IFK Göteborg supporters at the home derby against [[Örgryte IS]] in 2005.]]

As in most other parts of the world, the decades following the World War II were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture did not change much. Swedish football culture started to change in the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the English supporter culture. This flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, giving birth to some of the most well-known Swedish supporters clubs, [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]]'s Black Army, [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]]'s Blue Saints (later [[Järnkaminerna]]), and IFK Göteborg's supporters club, [[Supporterklubben Änglarna|Änglarna]] (the Angels). The first attempt to found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated from the highest league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.<ref name="johansson">{{cite web |last=Johansson |first=Andreas |title=Historik |year=2004 |url=http://www.anglarna.se/?page=0106 |publisher=Änglarna.se |accessdate=20 June 2007}}</ref>

As the club gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and thousands of IFK fans travelled to [[Hamburg]], Barcelona, [[Dundee]], Milan, Manchester and [[Munich]], the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team could go to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] to play the quarter-final in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in 1982, or by being the main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|pp=110–111}}{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|pp=191–192}} The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and the first few years of the new millennium brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.{{sfn|Jönsson|Josephson|2004|pp=344–345}}

In the 2000s, supporter culture in Sweden started to shift from being English-influenced to being more influenced by the Southern European countries and their football culture, making [[tifo]]s and [[ultras]] a common sight in Swedish arenas. From acting as an almost uniform group of fans gathered under the same flag, the supporter club Änglarna, IFK fans created separate supporter factions, including Ultra Bulldogs, Young Lions and West Coast Angelz. IFK is the most popular football club in Sweden;<ref name="cresswell" /> a 2004 survey concluded that IFK Göteborg had support from 13% of Swedish football fans.<ref name="cefossom">{{cite journal |author=CEFOS/SOM-Institutet |title=Svenska fotbollssupportrar |publisher=[[Göteborg University]] |date=27 April 2004}}</ref> A majority, 55%, of football fans in Gothenburg support IFK, and the club is the fourth most popular in [[Stockholm]] (after AIK, Djurgårdens IF and [[Hammarby IF]]) and the second most popular in [[Malmö]], after [[Malmö FF]].<ref name="cefossom" />

* [[Swedish football champions|Swedish Champions]]{{refn|The title of "Swedish Champions" has been awarded to the winner of four different competitions over the years. Between 1896 and 1925 the title was awarded to the winner of [[Svenska Mästerskapet]], a stand-alone cup tournament. No club were given the title between 1926 and 1930 even though the first-tier league [[Allsvenskan]] was played. In 1931 the title was reinstated and awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan. Between 1982 and 1990 a [[Allsvenskan play-offs|play-off]] in cup format was held at the end of the league season to decide the champions. After the play-off format in 1991 and 1992 the title was decided by the winner of [[Mästerskapsserien]], an additional league after the end of Allsvenskan. Since the 1993 season the title has once again been awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan.<ref name="Allsvenskan & Swedish champions">{{cite web | url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/historik/ | title=Svenska mästare 1896–1925, 1931– | publisher=The Swedish Football Association | work=svenskfotboll.se | accessdate=22 August 2012 | language=Swedish | trans_title=Swedish champions 1896–1925, 1931–}}</ref>|name=champions|group=upper-alpha}}
