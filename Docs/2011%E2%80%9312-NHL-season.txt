The '''2011–12 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|95th]] season of operation (94th [[Season (sport)|season]] of play) of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The [[Los Angeles Kings]] defeated the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the [[2012 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Final]] four games to two to win the team's first Stanley Cup (in their second Stanley Cup final; they had lost to [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the 1993 Finals).

During the off-season, the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] relocated to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], to become the [[Winnipeg Jets]]. It was the first NHL team relocation since the [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98 season]], when the [[Hartford Whalers]] relocated to become the [[Carolina Hurricanes]]. The league did not change its divisional structure to accommodate the move, and the Jets took the place of the Thrashers in the Southeast Division. In December 2011, the board of governors eventually approved a proposed realignment for the [[2012–13 NHL season|following season]], which would result in four conferences with the first two rounds of the playoffs being divisional, but this was rejected by the [[National Hockey League Players' Association|NHL Player's Association]] (NHLPA).

It was the fifth consecutive season with games in Europe at the start of the season. The Winter Classic was held on January 2, 2012, in [[Philadelphia]] between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and the [[New York Rangers]]. The [[59th National Hockey League All-Star Game|59th All-Star Game]] was held at [[Scotiabank Place]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], the home arena of the [[Ottawa Senators]], on January 29, 2012.

==League business==

===Franchise relocation===
[[Atlanta Spirit, LLC]], which previously owned the [[Atlanta Thrashers]], sold the team to [[True North Sports and Entertainment]], who relocated them to the True North-owned [[MTS Centre]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]<ref name=thrashersale>{{cite web|title=True North buys Thrashers, set to move team to Winnipeg|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=367433|publisher=TSN|accessdate=June 1, 2011|date=May 31, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629074237/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=367433| archivedate= 29 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and renamed the [[Winnipeg Jets]], after a [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|previous NHL team]] in the market.

===Salary cap===
On June 23, 2011, the NHL announced that the salary cap would be increased by $4.9 million. As a result, the new salary cap ceiling was set at $64.3 million while the salary cap floor was $48.3 million.<ref name=salarycap>{{cite web|title=Salary cap set for 2011–12|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=566916|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref>

===Uniform changes===
Several teams announced plans to change their uniforms in the 2011–12 season.<ref>[http://www.icethetics.info/blog/2011/7/31/nhl-jerseywatch-2011.html NHL Jersey Watch 2011], Icetherics.info, October 5, 2011.</ref>

The [[Edmonton Oilers]] unveiled a new away uniform parallel to their "retro" home uniform used from 1979 to 1996. They retained the navy blue, copper and red uniforms as their alternates.

The [[Nashville Predators]] unveiled new home and away uniforms on June 22, complete with the updated [[saber-toothed cat]] logo. Their use of gold as the home colors marked the first time since 1988 that an NHL team wore gold in their home uniforms.

The [[Florida Panthers]] made minor changes to their home uniform, using red as the primary and relegating navy blue as a trim color.

The [[Los Angeles Kings]] returned to the silver and black motif they used from 1988 to 1998, by designating their alternate home black and silver uniform as a regular uniform and unveiling a new white away uniform with black and silver trim. The purple and black uniform were retained as an alternate uniform.

The [[Ottawa Senators]] unveiled a new alternate home uniform based on the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|original Senators]] barber pole design. The uniform does not use the Roman centurion logo, instead using an outlined "O" on stripes. The Senators' uniform will also have an All-Star Game patch.

The [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] promoted their dark blue uniforms, worn during the [[2011 NHL Winter Classic]], as the home alternates, replacing the [[2008 NHL Winter Classic]] alternates.

The [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] unveiled new home and road uniforms, featuring the simplified lightning logo. Originally the uniforms were simply blue and white, but by popular demand, black was added as a trim color to the uniform numbers, and added the lightning bolt to the pants. The "Bolts" alternate home uniform was retained.

The [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] unveiled a new alternate home uniform based on the Leafs uniforms worn during their run to the [[1967 Stanley Cup Finals|1967 Stanley Cup title]], including the 11-point [[maple leaf]] logo.

The [[Washington Capitals]] also promoted their 2011 NHL Winter Classic retro uniforms as their road alternates.

The new [[Winnipeg Jets]] unveiled uniforms consisting of navy with silver and light blue trim, containing a logo based on the [[roundel]] of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]; these were significantly different from, but in a similar color scheme to, the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–1996)|original Jets]] uniforms.

The [[New York Islanders]] unveiled a new black alternate uniform, featuring the team name above the player's number, a similar template the [[Dallas Stars]]' uniforms currently use. Speaking of the Stars, they officially retired their alternate away jersey featuring the team crest, instead using their regular away jerseys with the city name and number in front for all 41 road games.

The [[New York Rangers]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]] wore special commemorative uniforms for the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic]]. The Flyers unveiled theirs on November 21, and is in a classic sweater design in orange featuring black numbers and different striping patterns on the yoke. The Rangers unveiled theirs on November 28, and features a mix of designs used from previous jerseys. The shield logo in front is a variation of the logos used during the 1930s–1940s, while the shoulder, arm and tail striping was taken from the current jersey. Both teams would wear their Winter Classic uniforms again on February 5 and 11 at [[Madison Square Garden]] and [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]] respectively, with the away team wearing the regular uniforms.

In addition several teams sported memorial patches throughout the season; many of these memorials were for related events (see "Off-Season" section below).  Unless specified, the patches were seen on the team helmets:
*[[Anaheim Ducks]]&nbsp;– [[Ruslan Salei]] (24) memorial on uniforms
*[[Calgary Flames]]&nbsp;– [[Harley Hotchkiss]] (HH) memorial
*[[Carolina Hurricanes]]&nbsp;– [[Josef Vašíček|Josef Vasicek]] (63) memorial; worn on uniforms
*[[Dallas Stars]]&nbsp;– [[Kārlis Skrastiņš|Karlis Skrastins]] (37) memorial
*[[Detroit Red Wings]]&nbsp;– [[Brad McCrimmon]], [[Ruslan Salei]] and [[Stefan Liv]] (BM·RS·SL) memorial; worn on uniforms
*[[Minnesota Wild]]&nbsp;– [[Pavol Demitra]] (38) and [[Derek Boogaard]] (24) memorials
*[[Nashville Predators]]&nbsp;– [[Wade Belak]] (3) memorial
*[[New York Islanders]]&nbsp;– 40th anniversary of the franchise; worn on uniforms
*[[New York Rangers]]&nbsp;– Derek Boogaard (94) memorial
*[[Vancouver Canucks]]&nbsp;– [[Rick Rypien]] (37) memorial
*[[Winnipeg Jets]]&nbsp;– Rick Rypien (RR) memorial
*[[St. Louis Blues]]&nbsp;– Pavol Demitra and [[Igor Korolev]] (38) memorial

Furthermore, a new league-wide rule required that player numbers be displayed on the front of their helmets, as well as on the back.

Even though the [[New Jersey Devils]] and the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] unveiled anniversary logos commemorating their 30th and 15th anniversaries of their respective relocations from [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado]] and [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg]], they opted not to use them on their uniforms or helmets.

===Rule changes===
;Boarding
Prior to the 2011–12 season, the Board of Governors unanimously agreed to update and re-word rule 41 involving boarding penalties. The new wording requires the player delivering the check to avoid or minimize contact if the opponent is defenseless.<ref name="rulechanges">http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=566579</ref>

;Illegal hits to the head
The Board of Governors also approved an update to rule 48 involving illegal checks to the head. The new rule will penalize all hits where the head is the principal point of contact. The previous version of this rule only made checks from the blindside illegal. However, determination if the check is legal will depend on various factors including whether or not the player put himself in a vulnerable position or if the hit was unavoidable. A two-minute minor penalty, or a major penalty in the event the hit was deemed to be deliberate with intent to injure, may be assessed.<ref name="rulechanges" />

==Off-season==
Three young (under 40) "[[enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]]"-type players died within a four month span during the off-season. The deaths of [[Derek Boogaard]], [[Rick Rypien]] and [[Wade Belak]] lead to speculation about the effect of fighting on the mental health of players.

Several former NHL players died in the [[2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl air disaster]] involving the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl]] hockey team in [[Russia]]. Those who perished in the plane crash included NHL All-Star [[Pavol Demitra]], [[Alexander Karpovtsev]], [[Igor Korolev]], [[Brad McCrimmon]], [[Karel Rachůnek|Karel Rachunek]], [[Ruslan Salei]], [[Kārlis Skrastiņš|Karlis Skrastins]] and [[Josef Vašíček|Josef Vasicek]].

==Pre-season==

===European exhibition games===
{{See also|List of international games played by NHL teams}}
The four teams going to Europe to open their regular seasons there as part of the NHL Premiere games also played exhibition games against European teams under the banner of NHL Premiere Challenge to close out their pre-seasons. The NHL teams had an overall record of 6–1–0 against the European teams, with the New York Rangers, playing four games in five days in four countries, having a record of 3–1–0.

==Regular season==

===Premiere games===
{{Main|2011 NHL Premiere}}
Four teams participated in the 2011 Compuware NHL Premiere in Europe. The [[Anaheim Ducks]], [[Los Angeles Kings]] and [[New York Rangers]] made their second trip to Europe while the [[Buffalo Sabres]] made its first trip. On October 7, Anaheim played Buffalo at [[Hartwall Areena]] in [[Helsinki]], Finland, and Los Angeles faced New York at the [[Ericsson Globe|Ericsson Globe Arena]] in  [[Stockholm]], Sweden. All four teams played again on October 8 with Los Angeles against Buffalo at the [[O2 World (Berlin)|O2 World Arena]] in [[Berlin]], Germany, and Anaheim against New York in Stockholm.<ref name=2011nhlpremiere>{{cite web|title=Premiere 2011 teams, locations revealed|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=559145|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=May 11, 2011|date=April 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Thanksgiving Showdown===
As part of the league's updated television contract, the NHL debuted the ''Thanksgiving Showdown'', a nationally-broadcast game on the day after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|American Thanksgiving]] in 2011. The game, which was sponsored by [[Discover Card|Discover]], featured the [[Boston Bruins]] (who have traditionally hosted [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] matinées since 1990) hosting the [[Detroit Red Wings]], with Detroit winning the game in a shootout, 3–2.

===2012 Winter Classic===
The [[2012 NHL Winter Classic]] was held at the [[Citizens Bank Park]] baseball stadium in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, on Monday, January 2, 2012. This season, the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] hosted the [[New York Rangers]]. It was the first Winter Classic game for the Rangers and the second for the Flyers. The result of the game was a 3–2 Ranger victory. Philadelphia last played in the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic]] against the [[Boston Bruins]] at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts. The Bruins won that game in overtime by a score of 2–1 on a goal scored by [[Marco Sturm]].<ref name=2012wc>{{cite web|title=Reports: Flyers host Rangers, Jan. 2 NHL Winter Classic at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=562719|publisher=NHL.com|date=May 14, 2011}}</ref>

This was the first time that the Winter Classic was not played on New Year's Day, which fell on a Sunday in 2012. If the Winter Classic was held on New Year's Day, it would have conflicted with the final game of the [[2011 NFL season|National Football League season]] (in which the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] hosted the [[Washington Redskins]] at nearby [[Lincoln Financial Field]]), and the annual [[Mummers Parade]] in downtown Philadelphia. The [[Flyers–Rangers rivalry]] is one of the NHL's most frequently televised rivalries on U.S. television networks; it was televised three times nationally on [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] in 2011–12, including the inaugural [[Hockey Day in America]].

No [[NHL Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]] was played this season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lebrun|first=Pierre|date=June 11, 2011|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=6651931|title=Sources: Only 1 outdoor game next year|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Standings===
Each of the 30 teams play an 82-game season of an unbalanced schedule. Teams play six games against division opponents; four games against other conference opponents; and one or two games against teams of the other conference. The first-place teams in each division place first, second and third in the conference standings. The top five finishers from the rest of the teams in each conference will also qualify for the playoffs, making a total of eight playoff teams in each conference.

==Playoffs==
[[File:2012 Stanley Cup Parade 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Kings' 2012 Stanley Cup victory parade in downtown Los Angeles.]]
{{main|2012 Stanley Cup playoffs}}

The 2012 playoffs started on Wednesday, April 11, 2012, and ended with the sixth game of the Stanley Cup Final in June 11, 2012, in which the [[Los Angeles Kings]] defeated the [[New Jersey Devils]] 6–1 to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. The [[Boston Bruins]] and [[Vancouver Canucks]], the Stanley Cup finalists from 2011, were eliminated in the first round, ensuring a new champion in 2012. In the East, three of the four series went to seven games in the opening round, and two of those went to overtime to decide their series. The series between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh set new playoff scoring records, while the Boston-Washington series had only a single goal differential. In the West, none of the first-round winners had won the Stanley Cup, and the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] won their first playoff series since moving to Phoenix from Winnipeg. All West series were decided in six games or less, and five of the six games in the Chicago-Phoenix series went to overtime. This will mark only 1 Canadian team; Ottawa Senators
