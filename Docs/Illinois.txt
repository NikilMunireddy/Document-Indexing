'''Illinois''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Illinois.ogg|ˌ|ɪ|l|ɨ|ˈ|n|ɔɪ}} {{respell|IL|i|NOY|'}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern region]] of the [[United States]]. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|5th most populous state]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|25th largest state in terms of land area]], and is often noted as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of the entire country.<ref name="so">{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Ohlemacher|title=Analysis ranks Illinois most average state|url=http://www.southernillinoisan.com/articles/2007/05/17/top/20300809.txt|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Southern Illinoisan|location=Carbondale, Illinois|date=May 17, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref> With [[Chicago]] in the northeast, small industrial cities and great [[agricultural productivity]] in central and northern Illinois, and [[natural resource]]s like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major [[transportation hub]]. The [[Port of Chicago]] connects the state to other global ports from the [[Great Lakes]], via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi River]], via the [[Illinois River]]. For decades, [[O'Hare International Airport]] has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a [[bellwether]] both in [[Will it play in Peoria?|social and cultural terms]]<ref name="so" /> and [[swing states|politics]].

Although today the state's largest population center is around Chicago in the northern part of the state, the state's European population grew first in the west, with [[French Canadians]] who settled along the [[Mississippi River]], and gave the area the name, ''Illinois''. After the [[American Revolutionary War]] established the United States, American settlers began arriving from [[Kentucky]] in the 1810s via the [[Ohio River]], and the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|statehood]]. After construction of the [[Erie Canal]] increased traffic and trade through the Great Lakes, Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the [[Chicago River]], at one of the few natural harbors on southern [[Lake Michigan]].<ref>"Chicago's Front Door: Chicago Harbor."

Railroads carried immigrants to new homes, as well as being used to ship their commodity crops out to markets.

By 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and [[coal]] mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and Southern Europe. Illinois was an important manufacturing center during both world wars. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the South established a [[History of African Americans in Chicago|large community]] of African Americans in Chicago, who created the city's famous [[jazz]] and [[blues]] cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/665.html |title=Jazz |work=Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/151.html |title=Blues|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>

Three [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] have been elected while living in Illinois: [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and [[Barack Obama]]. Additionally, [[Ronald Reagan]], whose political career was based in [[California]], was the only U.S. president born and raised in Illinois.

==Etymology==
{{see also|Illinois Confederation|List of counties in Illinois}}

"Illinois" is the modern spelling for the early French [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and explorers' name for the Illinois [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records.<ref>Fay, J. (2009) ''Eriniouaj.'' Retrieved October 21, 2009 from http://www.illinoisprairie.info/Eriniouaj.htm.</ref>

American scholars previously thought the name "Illinois" meant "man" or "men" in the [[Miami-Illinois language]], with the original ''iliniwek'' transformed via French into Illinois.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hodge |first= Frederick Webb |authorlink= Frederick Webb Hodge |title= Handbook of American Indians north of Mexico, Volume 1 |year= 1911 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology |oclc= 26478613 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ze4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA597 |page= 597}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R. Stewart |title= Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |origyear= 1945 |edition= Sentry (3rd) |year= 1967 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]}}</ref> This etymology is not supported by the Illinois language, as the word for 'man' is ''ireniwa'' and plural 'men' is ''ireniwaki''. The name ''Illiniwek'' has also been said to mean "tribe of superior men",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illinois.gov/facts/symbols.cfm |title=Illinois Symbols |accessdate=April 20, 2006 |publisher=State of Illinois |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415195518/http://www.illinois.gov/facts/symbols.cfm |archivedate=April 15, 2006 }}</ref> which is a [[false etymology]]. The name "Illinois" derives from the Miami-Illinois verb ''irenwe·wa'' "he speaks the regular way". This was taken into the [[Ojibwe language]], perhaps in the [[Ottawa dialect]], and modified into ''ilinwe·'' (pluralized as ''ilinwe·k''). The French borrowed these forms, changing the /we/ ending to spell it as ''-ois,'' a [[transliteration]] for its pronunciation in French of that time. The current spelling form, ''Illinois'', began to appear in the early 1670s, when French colonists had settled in the western area. The Illinois' name for themselves, as attested in all three of the French missionary-period dictionaries of Illinois, was ''Inoka'', of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms.<ref>{{cite book |last= Callary |first= Edward |title= Place Names of Illinois |year= 2008 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-03356-8 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ZvHgwa-XImcC&pg=PA169 |page= 169}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Costa|first= David J.|date=January 2007|title= Three American Placenames: Illinois|journal=Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas Newsletter|volume= 25|issue= 4|pages= 9–12|issn= 1046-4476|url= http://myaamia.strackattack.com/OtherFiles/CostaNewsletter.pdf#page=9|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref>

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans.  The [[Koster Site]] has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation. [[Cahokia]], the largest regional [[chiefdom]] and [[Urban Center|urban center]] of the [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Mississippian culture]], was located near present-day [[Collinsville, Illinois]].

The finely crafted ornaments and tools recovered by archaeologists at Cahokia include elaborate ceramics, finely sculptured stonework, carefully embossed and engraved copper and mica sheets, and one funeral blanket for an important chief fashioned from 20000 shell beads. These artifacts indicate that Cahokia was truly an urban center, with clustered housing, markets, and specialists in toolmaking, hide dressing, potting, jewelry making, shell engraving, weaving and salt making.<ref>Nash, Gary B.

French explorers [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]] explored the [[Illinois River]] in 1673. In 1680, other French explorers constructed a fort at the site of present-day [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], and in 1682, a fort atop [[Starved Rock]] in today's [[Starved Rock State Park]]. French Canadians came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of the French empire of [[La Louisiane]] until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to evade British rule.<ref name="Biles"/>

A few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians. In 1778, [[George Rogers Clark]] claimed [[Illinois County]] for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. In a compromise, Virginia ceded the area to the new United States in 1783 and it became part of the [[Northwest Territory]], to be administered by the federal government and later organized as states.<ref name="Biles">{{cite book |last=Biles |first=Roger |title= Illinois: A History of the Land and its People|year= 2005|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|location= DeKalb|isbn=0-87580-349-0}}</ref>

===19th century===
{{see also|History of Chicago|History of Nauvoo, Illinois}}

The [[Illinois-Wabash Company]] was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The [[Illinois Territory]] was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], an early French settlement.

During the discussions leading up to Illinois' [[admission to the Union]], the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sancohis.org/presentations/Illinois%20From%20Territory%20to%20State.htm |title=Full Remarks from Dave M |publisher=Sancohis.org |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> The original provisions of the [[Northwest Ordinance]] had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all. However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a 10-mile northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana's, which is defined as {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. But the Illinois delegate, [[Nathaniel Pope]], wanted more. Pope lobbied to have the boundary moved further north, and the final bill passed by Congress did just that; it included an amendment to shift the border to 42° 30' north, which is approximately {{convert|51|mi|km}} north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added {{convert|8500|sqmi|km2|-2}} to the state, including the [[lead mining]] region near [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]]. More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River. Pope and others envisioned a canal that would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers, and thus, connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.

In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The capital remained at Kaskaskia, headquartered in a small building rented by the state. In 1819, [[Vandalia, Illinois|Vandalia]] became the capital, and over the next 18 years, three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building. In 1837, the state legislators representing [[Sangamon County]], under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln, succeeded in having the capital moved to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/Library/newsletter.asp?ID=137&CRLI=193 |title=Abraham Lincoln and Springfield – Abraham Lincoln's Classroom |publisher=Abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> where a [[Old State Capitol State Historic Site (Illinois)|fifth capitol]] building was constructed. A [[Illinois State Capitol|sixth capitol]] building was erected in 1867, which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today.

Though it was ostensibly a "[[Slave and free states|free state]]", there was [[History of slavery in Illinois|slavery in Illinois]]. The ethnic French had owned black slaves as late as the 1820s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from Kentucky. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves. When Illinois became a sovereign state in 1818, the Ordinance no longer applied, and about 900 slaves were held in the state.

Settlers were allowed to bring slaves with them for labor but, in 1822, state residents voted against making slavery legal. Still, most residents opposed allowing free blacks as permanent residents. Some settlers brought in slaves seasonally or as house servants.<ref>Paul Finkelman, ''Slavery and the Founders: Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson,'' (2001), p 78</ref> The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed.

It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/141.html |title = Black Hawk War |publisher = Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate = August 10, 2012}}</ref> The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to [[Iowa]] in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by U.S. militia.

The winter of 1830–1831 is called the "Winter of the Deep Snow"; a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished. Several severe winters followed, including the "Winter of the Sudden Freeze". On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north and this may have contributed to its name: "[[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]]", after the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers.<ref>Duff, Judge Andrew D. [http://www.springhousemagazine.com/egypt2.htm Egypt - Republished, ''Springhouse Magazine''], accessed May 1, 2006.</ref>

By 1839, the [[Latter Day Saints]] had founded a [[utopian]] city called [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. Located in [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]] along the Mississippi River, Nauvoo flourished and soon rivaled Chicago for the position of the state's largest city. But in 1844, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founder [[Joseph Smith]] [[Death of Joseph Smith|was killed]] in the [[Carthage Jail]], about 30 miles away from Nauvoo.  Following a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)]], [[Brigham Young]] led most Latter Day Saints out of Illinois in a [[Mormon pioneers|mass exodus]] to present-day [[Utah]]; after close to six years of rapid development, Nauvoo rapidly declined afterward.

Chicago gained prominence as a [[Great Lakes]] port and then as an [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois' largest city.<ref name="Biles"/> With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of [[labor unions in the United States]]. The [[Pullman Strike]] and [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket Riot]], in particular, greatly influenced the development of the American [[labour movement|labor movement]]. From Sunday, October 8, 1871, until Tuesday, October 10, 1871, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] burned in downtown Chicago, destroying {{convert|4|sqmi|km2}}.<ref>Roland Tweet, ''Miss Gale's Books: The Beginnings of the Rock Island Public Library'', (Rock Island, IL: Rock Island Public Library, 1997), 15.</ref>

In 1847, after lobbying by [[Dorothea Dix|Dorothea L. Dix]], Illinois became one of the first states to establish a system of state-supported treatment of mental illness and disabilities, replacing local [[almshouse]]s.

====Civil War====

During the [[American Civil War]], Illinois ranked fourth in men who served (more than 250,000) in the [[Union Army]], a figure surpassed by only New York, [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Ohio]]. Beginning with President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments. Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments.<ref>[http://www.illinoiscivilwar.org/units_num.html "Illinois Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery Units"], Illinois in the Civil War, Retrieved November 26, 2006</ref> The town of [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]], at the southern tip of the state at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army. For several months, both General [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] and Admiral [[Andrew Hull Foote|Foote]] had headquarters in Cairo.

===20th century===
At the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5&nbsp;million. Many people from other parts of the country were attracted to the state by employment caused by the then-expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state's population.<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=Illinois – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1800 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}</ref> Bolstered by continued [[History of immigration to the United States|immigration from southern and eastern Europe]], and by the African-American [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. By the end of the century, the population had reached 12.4&nbsp;million.

The [[Century of Progress]] [[World's fair|World's Fair]] was held at Chicago in 1933. Oil strikes in [[Marion County, Illinois|Marion County]] and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford County]] lead to a boom in 1937, and, by 1939, Illinois ranked fourth in U.S. oil production. Illinois manufactured 6.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during [[World War II]], ranking seventh among the 48 states.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.111</ref> Chicago became an ocean port with the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959. The seaway and the [[Illinois Waterway]] connected Chicago to both the Mississippi River and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In 1960, [[Ray Kroc]] opened the first [[McDonald's]] franchise in [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] (which still exists as a museum, with a working McDonald's across the street).

Illinois had a prominent role in the emergence of the [[nuclear age]]. In 1942, as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Chicago Pile-1|University of Chicago]] conducted the first sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. In 1957, [[Argonne National Laboratory]], near [[Chicago]], activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in the United States, [[Dresden Nuclear Power Plant|Dresden 1]], was dedicated near [[Morris, Illinois|Morris]]. In 1967, [[Fermilab]], a national nuclear research facility near [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]], opened a [[particle accelerator]], which was the world's largest for over 40 years. With eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comed.com/sites/PartnersBusiness/Documents/EconomicDevelopmentFactSheet.pdf |title=ComEd and Electricity Related Messages for Economic Development |format=PDF |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110708180209/https://www.comed.com/sites/PartnersBusiness/Documents/EconomicDevelopmentFactSheet.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comed.com/Documents/about-us/economic-development/ComEd_and_Electricity_Related_EconDev_Messages_-_January_2012.pdf |title=Home &#124; ComEd - An Exelon Company |publisher=ComEd |date= |accessdate=2016-02-27}}</ref>

In 1961, Illinois became the first state in the nation to adopt the recommendation of the [[American Law Institute]] and pass a comprehensive criminal code revision that repealed the law against [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy]]. The code also abrogated [[common law crime]]s and established an [[age of consent]] of 18.<ref>{{cite web |last=Painter |first=George|title=The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States: Illinois |url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/illinois.htm#fn73|work=The Sensibilities of Our Forefathers|publisher=Gay & Lesbian Archives of the Pacific Northwest|accessdate=January 12, 2012|date=August 10, 2004}}</ref> The state's [[Illinois Constitution|fourth constitution]] was adopted in 1970, replacing the 1870 document.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Illinois}}
{{further|List of ecoregions in Illinois}}[[File:National-atlas-illinois.png|300px|thumb|Illinois, showing major cities and roads]]

Illinois is located in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest Region]] of the United States and is one of the eight states and Canadian Province of Ontario in the bi-national [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] of North America.

===Boundaries===
Illinois' eastern border with [[Indiana]] consists of a north-south line at 87° 31′ 30″ west longitude in [[Lake Michigan]] at the north, to the [[Wabash River]] in the south above [[Vincennes, Indiana|Post Vincennes]]. The Wabash River continues as the eastern/southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the [[Ohio River]]. This marks the beginning of Illinois' southern border with [[Kentucky]], which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River.<ref>[[Wikisource]]. [[s:Illinois Constitution of 1818|Illinois Constitution of 1818]].</ref> Most of the western border with [[Missouri]] and [[Iowa]] is the [[Mississippi River]]; Kaskaskia is an exclave of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and reachable only from Missouri. The state's northern border with [[Wisconsin]] is fixed at 42° 30' north latitude. The northeastern border of Illinois lies in [[Lake Michigan]], within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of [[Michigan]], as well as Wisconsin and Indiana.<ref name="Nelson">{{cite book |editor=Nelson, Ronald E. |title=Illinois: Land and Life in the Prairie State|origyear= |url= |edition= |year=1978|publisher=Kendall/Hunt|location= Dubuque, Iowa|isbn=0-8403-1831-6|oclc= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>

===Topography===
Though Illinois lies entirely in the [[Interior Plains]], it does have some minor variation in its elevation. In extreme northwestern Illinois, the [[Driftless Area]], a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. [[Charles Mound]], located in this region, has the state's highest elevation above sea level at {{convert|1235|ft|m}}. Other highlands include the [[Shawnee Hills]] in the south, and there is varying topography along its rivers; the [[Illinois River]] bisects the state northeast to southwest. The floodplain on the Mississippi River from [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]] to the [[Kaskaskia River]] is known as the [[American Bottom]].
[[File:Charles Mound, Illinois.JPG|thumb|Charles Mound, the highest natural point in Illinois at 1235 feet, is located in the northwestern part of the state.]]

===Divisions===
[[File:Chicago downtown view from Sears.JPG|thumb|Chicago on Lake Michigan is the third largest city in the United States.]]
[[File:Cairo Ohio River Bridge at sunset.jpg|thumb|The lowest elevation in the State is near Cairo and the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers]]

Illinois has three major geographical divisions. [[Northern Illinois]] is dominated by [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicagoland]], which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], and has a population of over 9.8&nbsp;million people. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, and the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Illinois' third largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates [[Interstate 39|39]] and [[Interstate 90|90]] some {{convert|75|mi|km}} northwest of Chicago. The [[Quad Cities]] region, located along the [[Mississippi River]] in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.

The midsection of Illinois is a second major division, called [[Central Illinois]]. It is an area of mostly [[prairie]] and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium-small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the [[Military Tract of 1812]] and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], the state capital; [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]; [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]; [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]]; and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].<ref name="Nelson"/>

The third division is [[Southern Illinois]], comprising the area south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Illinois|U.S. Route 50]], including [[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]], near the juncture of the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of [[Cahokia]], as well as the site of the first state capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.<ref name="Nelson"/><ref name="Horsley">{{cite book |last=Horsley |first=A. Doyne |title=Illinois: A Geography |year=1986 |publisher=Westview Press|location= Boulder|isbn=0-86531-522-1 }}</ref> This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian Stage]], unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], such as [[East St. Louis]] are located in this region and collectively they are known as the [[Metro-East]]. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] and [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.<ref name="Nelson"/> A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended [[Evansville, Indiana]] Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area.

In addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside of the Chicago Metropolitan area is often called "[[Downstate Illinois|downstate]]" Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the Chicago-area. Thus, some cities in ''Northern'' Illinois, such as [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]], which is west of Chicago, and [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]]—which is actually ''north'' of Chicago—are considered to be "downstate".

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Illinois}}
[[File:Illinois map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Illinois map of Köppen climate classification.]]

Illinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year. Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southern part of the state, from about [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] southward, has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Koppen ''Cfa''), with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over {{convert|48|in|0}} at the southern tip to around {{convert|35|in|0}} in the northern portion of the state. Normal annual snowfall exceeds {{convert|38|in|0}} in the Chicago area, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than {{convert|14|in|0}}.<ref name="Climate_Maps">[http://www.sws.uiuc.edu/atmos/statecli/index.htm Illinois State Climatologist Office].

Illinois averages approximately 51 days of [[thunderstorm]] activity a year, which ranks somewhat above average in the number of thunderstorm days for the United States. Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes with an average of 35 occurring annually, which puts much of the state at around five tornadoes per {{convert|10000|sqmi|km2|-4}} annually.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">"[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif Annual average number of tornadoes, 1953–2004]", NOAA National Climatic Data Center.

Modern developments in storm forecasting and tracking have caused death tolls from tornadoes to decline dramatically, with the [[1967 Oak Lawn tornado outbreak|1967 Belvidere – Oak Lawn tornado outbreak]] (58 fatalities) and [[1990 Plainfield tornado]] (29 fatalities) standing out as exceptions. On November 18, 2013, tornadoes touched down and ripped through Washington, Illinois. There were seven fatalities.

===Manufacturing===
Illinois is one of the nation's manufacturing leaders, boasting annual value added productivity by manufacturing of over $107&nbsp;billion in 2006. As of 2011, Illinois is ranked as the 4th most productive manufacturing state in the country, behind California, Texas, and Ohio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ildceo.net/NR/rdonlyres/1357C591-2810-4228-A334-E8B55EF1288D/0/Manufacturing2011.pdf |title=DCEO: Home |publisher=Ildceo.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-27}}</ref> About three-quarters of the state's manufacturers are located in the Northeastern Opportunity Return Region, with 38 percent of Illinois' approximately 18,900 manufacturing plants located in Cook County. As of 2006, the leading manufacturing industries in Illinois, based upon value-added, were chemical manufacturing ($18.3&nbsp;billion), machinery manufacturing ($13.4&nbsp;billion), food manufacturing ($12.9&nbsp;billion), fabricated metal products ($11.5&nbsp;billion), transportation equipment ($7.4&nbsp;billion), plastics and rubber products ($7.0&nbsp;billion), and computer and electronic products ($6.1&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commerce.state.il.us/NR/rdonlyres/1357C591-2810-4228-A334-E8B55EF1288D/0/Manufacturing.pdf|title=Manufacturing in Illinois|year=2009|publisher=Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}</ref>

===Services===
By the early 2000s, Illinois' economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, law, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois' earlier economies. For example, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], a trading exchange for global [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], had begun its life as an agricultural [[futures exchange|futures market]]. Other important non-manufacturing industries include publishing, tourism, and energy production and distribution.

===Energy===
{{see also|List of power stations in Illinois|Solar power in Illinois}}
Illinois is a net importer of fuels for energy, despite large coal resources and some minor oil production. Illinois exports electricity, ranking fifth among states in electricity production and seventh in electricity consumption.<ref name="finley">"[http://www.isgs.uiuc.edu/maps-data-pub/publications/energy01/globalm.shtml Illinois in the Global Energy Marketplace]", [[Robert Finley]], 2001. Illinois State Geological Survey publication.</ref>

====Coal====
The coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as [[Jacob Loose]] discovered coal in locations such as [[Sangamon County]]. [[Jacob Bunn]] contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry, and was a founder and owner of the [[Western Coal & Mining Company]] of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211&nbsp;billion tons of [[bituminous coal]] are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>[http://www.isgs.uiuc.edu/ Illinois State Geological Survey].

In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4&nbsp;million tons of coal, but only 17&nbsp;million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states and countries. In 2008, Illinois exported 3 million tons of coal and was projected to export 9 million tons in 2011, as demand for energy grows in places such as China, India, elsewise in Asia and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ildceo.net/NR/rdonlyres/EA15E8A9-E0BD-468A-A308-BE58E93D0C03/0/CoalInIllinois2011.pdf |title=DCEO: Home |publisher=Ildceo.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-27}}</ref> As of 2010, Illinois was ranked third in recoverable coal reserves at producing mines in the Nation.<ref name="eia.gov"/> Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois (21&nbsp;million tons in 1998) is mined in the [[Powder River Basin]] of [[Wyoming]].<ref name="finley"/>

==Parks and recreation==
{{mainlist|List of protected areas of Illinois}}
[[File:Illinois Centennial Memorial Column.jpg|thumb|The Illinois Centennial Column in [[Logan Square, Chicago|Chicago's Logan Square]].]]

The [[Illinois state parks]] system began in 1908 with what is now [[Fort Massac]] State Park, becoming the first park in a system encompassing over 60 parks and about the same number of recreational and wildlife areas.

Areas under the protection and control of the [[National Park Service]] include: the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal|Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor]] near [[Lockport, Illinois|Lockport]];<ref>{{cite web | title = Illinois & Michigan Canal | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate =July 15, 2008 | url = http://www.nps.gov/ilmi}}</ref> the [[Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail]]; the [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in Springfield; the [[Mormon Trail|Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail]]; the [[Trail of Tears|Trail of Tears National Historic Trail]]; the [[American Discovery Trail]],<ref>{{cite web|title = Illinois|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate =July 15, 2008|url= http://www.nps.gov/state/il}}</ref> and the [[Pullman National Monument]].  The Federal government also manages the [[Shawnee National Forest]] and the [[Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie]].

==Law and government==
{{main|Government of Illinois|Law of Illinois}}

The [[government of Illinois]], under the [[Constitution of Illinois]], has three branches of government: Executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is split into several statewide elected offices, with the Governor as chief executive. Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly. The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts.

[[File:James R. Thompson Center.JPG|thumb|The [[James R. Thompson Center]] in Chicago]]

The [[Illinois General Assembly]] is the state legislature, composed of the 118-member [[Illinois House of Representatives]] and the 59-member [[Illinois Senate]]. The members of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even-numbered year. The ''[[Illinois Compiled Statutes]]'' (ILCS) are the [[codification (law)|codified]] statutes of a general and permanent nature.<ref name="survey">{{cite book|title=Illinois Criminal Law: A Survey of Crimes and Defenses|first1=John F.|last1=Decker|first2=Christopher|last2=Kopacz|year=2012|edition=5th|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|isbn=978-0-7698-5284-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2I_8OvYAVYC&pg=PT24|at=§ 1.01}}</ref><ref name="tapping">{{cite book|title=Tapping State Government Information Sources|page=126|first1=Lori L.|last1=Smith|first2=Daniel C.|last2=Barkley|first3=Daniel C.|last3=Cornwall|first4=Eric W.|last4=Johnson|first5=J.

The [[Judiciary of Illinois]] is the unified court system of Illinois. It consists of the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Supreme Court]], [[Illinois Appellate Court|Appellate Court]], and [[Illinois Circuit Courts|Circuit Courts]]. The Supreme Court oversees the administration of the court system.

The [[administrative divisions of Illinois]] are counties, townships, precincts, cities, towns, villages, and special-purpose districts.<ref>{{citation|title=Individual State Descriptions: 2007|series=2007 Census of Governments|date=November 2012|pages=89–97|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|url=http://www2.census.gov/govs/cog/isd_book.pdf|ref={{harvid|Census|2007}}}}</ref> The basic subdivision of Illinois are the 102 counties.{{sfn|Census|2007|p=89}} 85 Of the 102 counties are in turn divided into townships and precincts.{{sfn|Census|2007|p=89}}<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.ilsos.gov/isa/localgovnameindexsrch.jsp| title = Name Index to Illinois Local Governments| author = Illinois Regional Archives Depository System| work = Illinois State Archives| publisher = [[Illinois Secretary of State]]|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref> Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns.{{sfn|Census|2007|p=89}} Some localities possess ''[[home rule]]'', which allows them to govern themselves to a certain extent.<ref>{{cite book|title=Illinois Politics & Government: The Expanding Metropolitan Frontier|first1=Samuel Kimball |last1=Gove|first2=James Dunlap|last2=Nowlan|year=1996|series=Politics and Governments of the American States|pages=155–156|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=0-8032-7014-3|lccn=95046017|location=Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JFP49qn_wUC&pg=PA156|ref=harv}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Illinois}}

===Party balance===
[[File:Downtown Springfield.JPG|thumb|[[Illinois State Capitol]] in downtown Springfield]]
Historically, Illinois was a political [[swing state]], with near-parity existing between the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties. However, in recent elections, the Democratic Party has gained ground and Illinois has come to be seen as a solid [[Red states and blue states|"blue" state]] in presidential contests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0716/p01s01-uspo.html |title=Suburb shift turns state blue / The Christian Science Monitor |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=July 16, 2004 |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-124280593.html |title=Chicgao's dominance puts Illinois solidly in 'blue-state' America. – Chicago Tribune (Chicago, IL)|publisher=Highbeam.com |date=November 8, 2004 |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> Chicago and most of Cook County votes have long been strongly Democratic. However, the "[[collar counties]]" (the suburbs surrounding Chicago's [[Cook County, Illinois]]), can be seen as moderate voting districts.<ref>{{cite book |title=Governor Richard Ogilvie: in the interest of the state |last=Pensoneau |first=Taylor |year=1997 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |isbn=978-0-8093-2148-3 |oclc= |page=314 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bxNGKsylQXUC&pg=PA80&dq=kane+dupage+lake+cook+democratic&q=kane%20dupage%20lake%20cook%20democratic |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Patchwork Nation: Sectionalism and Political Change in American Politics |last=Gimpel |first=James G. |author2=Jason E.

Republicans continue to prevail in the outlying  Chicago exurban areas, as well as rural northern and central Illinois; Republican support is also strong in southern Illinois, outside of the [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]] metropolitan area. From [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]] until [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]], the state was carried by the victor of each of these presidential elections - 14 elections.<ref>[http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2011/02/meet_the_new_bellwether_states.php Meet the New Bellwether States: Ohio and Nevada - Smart Politics].

By contrast, Illinois has trended more toward the Democratic party and such, has voted for their presidential candidates in the last six elections; in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], [[George W. Bush]] became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying Illinois or [[Vermont]]. Chicago resident and current president [[Barack Obama]] easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in 2008, with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again with 58% to Republican Mitt Romney's 41%. In 2014, Republican Bruce Rauner defeated Governor Quinn 50% - 46% to become Illinois' first Republican governor in 12 years when he was sworn in on January 12, 2015, while Democratic Senator Dick Durbin was re-elected with 53% of the vote.

===History of corruption===
Politics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[James R. Thompson]]. In 2006, former Governor [[George Ryan]] was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a {{frac|6|1|2}}-year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President [[Barack Obama]] to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, [[Rod Blagojevich]] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions.  In the late 20th century, Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]] was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) [[Orville Hodge]] was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor [[Len Small]] was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.<ref name="Biles"/><ref name="Horsley"/><ref>{{cite book |title= Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833–2003|last= Merriner|first= James L.|year= 2004|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location= Carbondale|isbn= 978-0-8093-2571-9|oclc= 52720998}}</ref>

===U.S. Presidents from Illinois===
Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base: Lincoln, Grant, and Obama. Lincoln was born in [[Kentucky]], but moved to Illinois at the age of 21; he served in the [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] and represented the [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] in the US House of Representatives before his election as President. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was born in [[Ohio]] and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the Civil War, and approaching middle age, Grant moved to Illinois and thus claimed it as his home when running for President. [[Barack Obama]] was born and raised in [[Hawaii]] (other than a four-year period of his childhood spent in [[Indonesia]]) and made Illinois his home and base after completing [[law school]].

Only one person elected President of the United States was actually born in Illinois. [[Ronald Reagan]] was born in [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], raised in [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]] and educated at [[Eureka College]]. Reagan moved to Los Angeles as a young adult and later became [[Governor of California]] before being elected President.

===African-American U.S. senators===
[[List of African-American United States Senators|Nine African-Americans]] have served as members of the [[United States Senate]]. Three of them have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: [[Carol Moseley Braun|Carol Moseley-Braun]], [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> and [[Roland Burris]], who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first and, to date, only African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.

===Political families===
Two families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], gaining both statewide and national fame.

====Stevensons====
The [[Stevenson family]], rooted in central Illinois, has provided four generations of Illinois elected leadership.
*[[Adlai Stevenson I]] (1835–1914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a [[Congressman]]
*[[Lewis Stevenson (politician)|Lewis Stevenson]] (1868–1932), son of Adlai, served as [[Illinois Secretary of State]].
*[[Adlai Stevenson II]] (1900–1965), son of Lewis, served as [[Governor of Illinois]] and as the US Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], losing both elections to [[Dwight Eisenhower]].
*[[Adlai Stevenson III]] (1930–  ), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a [[United States Senator]].

====Daleys====
The [[Daley family]]'s powerbase was in Chicago.
*[[Richard J. Daley]] (1902–1976) served as [[Mayor of Chicago]] from 1955 to his death.
*[[Richard M. Daley]] (1942–   ), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest serving mayor, in office from 1989–2011.
*[[William M. Daley]] (1948–   ), another son of Richard J, is a former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and has served in a variety of appointed positions.

==Education==

===Illinois State Board of education===
{{main|Illinois State Board of Education}}

The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers [[public education]] in the state. Local municipalities and their respective [[school district]]s operate individual public schools but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the [[Illinois School Report Card]]. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.

===Primary and secondary schools===
{{see also|List of school districts in Illinois|List of high schools in Illinois}}

Education is compulsory from ages 7 to 17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly but not exclusively divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[Middle school|junior high school]], and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in ''two'' school districts—one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.

===Colleges and universities===
{{mainlist|List of colleges and universities in Illinois}}

Using the criterion established by [[the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], there are eleven "National Universities" in the state. {{As of|2010|8|19}}, six of these rank in the "first tier" (that is, the top quartile) among the top 500 National Universities in the United States, as determined by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings: the [[University of Chicago]] (4), [[Northwestern University]] (12), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (41), [[Loyola University Chicago]] (99), the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (108), [[DePaul University]] (123), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (129), [[Illinois State University]] (149), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (153), and [[Northern Illinois University]] (194).<ref name="usnews">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|title=Best Colleges 2010 – National Universities Rankings|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2016|work=[[U.S. News & World Report]]}}</ref>

The University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its [[Booth School of Business]], along with Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]] consistently rank within the top 5 graduate business schools in the country and top 10 in the world. While the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is often ranked among the best engineering schools in the world and in United States.

Illinois also has more than 20 additional [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small [[liberal arts college]]s across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public [[community college]]s in the [[Illinois Community College System]].

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
{{see also|List of airports in Illinois|List of Illinois Routes|List of Illinois railroads|Category:Illinois waterways}}

Because of its central location and its proximity to the [[Rust Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]], Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic.

====Airports====
From 1962 until 1998, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by [[Atlanta]]'s [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield]] in 1998, with 59.3&nbsp;million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4&nbsp;million international passengers in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=O'Hare International Airport Activity Statistics |url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208ORDSUMMARY-REVISED.pdf |work=|publisher=City of Chicago: FlyChicago.com |date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref> O'Hare remains one of the two or three busiest airports in the world, and some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major [[airline hub|hub]] for [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]], and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. [[Chicago Midway International Airport]] (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world until supplanted by O'Hare in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area. For a time in the late 1960s and 1970s, Midway was nearly vacant except for [[general aviation]], but growth in the area, combined with political deadlock over the building of a new major airport in the region, has caused a resurgence for Midway. It is now a major hub for [[Southwest Airlines]], and services many other airlines as well. Midway served 17.3&nbsp;million domestic and international passengers in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Midway Airport Activity Statistics|url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208SUMMARYRevised.pdf|work=FlyChicago.com|publisher=City of Chicago|date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref>

====Rail====
[[File:Wikipedia Map Final Draft.pdf|thumb|Illinois Major Rail Network]]

Illinois has an extensive passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago is a national [[Amtrak]] hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak's [[Illinois Service]], featuring the Chicago to Carbondale [[Illini (Amtrak)|''Illini'']] and [[Saluki (Amtrak)|''Saluki'']], the Chicago to Quincy [[Carl Sandburg (Amtrak)|''Carl Sandburg'']] and ''[[Illinois Zephyr]]'', and the Chicago to St. Louis ''[[Lincoln Service]]''. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago–St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago "L"|'L']] system. The largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by [[Metra]], uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.

In addition to the state's rail lines, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Illinois River]] provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. [[Lake Michigan]] gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].

====Interstate highway system====

Illinois is among many US states with a well developed interstate highway system. Illinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states with 13 (with the new addition of Interstate 41 near Wisconsin), as well as the 3rd most interstate mileage behind California and Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/state-index.html |title=Interstates by State |publisher=Interstate-Guide |date=2016-02-02 |accessdate=2016-02-27}}</ref>
