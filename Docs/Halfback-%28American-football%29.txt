A '''halfback''' ('''HB''') is the holder of an [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] position in [[American football]] whose duties involve lining up in the [[backfield]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050425171507/http://images.nfl.com/fans/images/how_players_lineup.jpg Halfback lineup in a play] archived from NFL.com</ref> and carrying the ball on most running plays in formations such as the [[veer]] variant of the [[Wishbone formation|wishbone]].  When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield, and especially when that player is placed behind another player (usually a blocking back), as in the [[I formation]], that player is instead referred to as a '''tailback''' (see [[Halfback (American football)#History|History]] below).<ref>http://www.usafootball.com/resource-center/coaching/coaches-guide/?id=17&p=37</ref><sup>,</sup><ref>[http://football.about.com/cs/football101/g/gl_halfback.htm Halfback info] at about.com</ref>

Historically, from the 1870s through the 1950s, the halfback position was both an offensive and defensive position. In the related sport of [[Canadian football]], [[Halfback (Canadian football)|halfback]] is usually a [[defense (sports)|defensive]] rather than offensive position since the 1980s, though used to also refer to an [[offense (sports)|offensive]] position similar to a [[slotback]] that could line up off the tight end or behind the quarterback.  Some systems require the halfback be proficient at throwing the ball downfield as well.  A halfback famous for his passing ability was [[Marcus Allen]], who threw 6 touchdowns in the NFL.

==History==

From the dawn of American football through the 1880s most offensive schemes focused on the running game. In a running based game plan the halfback was typically the cornerstone of the offense. This system focused on a physical run attack concentrated in the inside of the field, and therefore depended on a skilled “power back”. Pass-catching ability was not very important in this sort of halfback, and pure speed took a backseat to tackle-breaking ability. There was a focus on physicality over finesse, as this type of playing style earned the moniker of “smash mouth” football. In the past few decades the role of the halfback has gone through a great shift as most offensive game plans are now fueled by creativity and finesse instead of raw force. Stamina and durability is more important than ever in the hurry-up offense. On the other hand, speed is often valued over strength, and pass-catching ability is sometimes valued over blocking proficiency. Power was once the most desired trait in a halfback, but has been over taken by the need for a diverse skill set.<ref>http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/story/2012-08-27/nfl-running-backs-Ray-Rice-Michael-Turner/57400806/1</ref>

There has also been a shift in most offense’s dependence on halfbacks, as the quarterback is now generally considered the most essential part of a team. However, the average output of the halfback has not changed. Many of the “scat backs” in the modern era produce more total yards and touchdowns than their ancestor “power backs” by breaking off big plays on outside runs and receptions. The Spread offense and the hurry-up offense change the halfback’s role but create more opportunity for these plays. The Spread, the hurry-up, and the Pro style offenses dominate American football but the “smash-mouth” style of play is far from extinct. A power-running scheme is often utilized to counter an effective Spread attack, as it allows a team to control the clock and keep the ball out of the opposing offense’s control. This strategy is utilized in NFL, college, and all other forms of American football. The need for “power backs is” very prevalent, alongside the need for “scat backs”, and anything in between.

Before the emergence of the [[T-formation]] in the 1940s, all members of the offensive backfield were legitimate threats to run or pass the ball.  Most teams used four offensive backs on every play: a [[quarterback]], two halfbacks, and a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]]. The quarterback began each play a quarter of the way back, the halfbacks began each play side by side and halfway back, and the fullback began each play the farthest back.

The sport's first [[triple threat man|triple threat]], [[Bradbury Robinson]] of [[St. Louis University]], ran, passed, received and [[Punt (gridiron football)|punted]] out of the halfback position.  It was as a halfback that Robinson threw the first legal [[forward pass]] to teammate [[Jack Schneider]] in a game at [[Carroll University|Carroll College]] on September 5, 1906.

Now that most offensive formations have only one or two [[running back]]s, the original designations do not mean as much, as the fullback is now usually a lead blocker (technically a halfback), while the halfback or tailback (called such because he stands at the "tail" of the I) lines up behind the fullback.

==Characteristics of a  halfback==
The halfback position is one of the more glamorous positions on the field, and is commonly viewed as a requirement for a team's success.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n42_v222/ai_21227621 Halfback job type] at findarticles.com</ref> They are responsible for carrying the ball on the majority of running plays, and may frequently be used as a receiver on short passing plays. Occasionally, they line up as additional wide receivers. When not serving either of these functions, the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking, either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football.  Sometimes the halfback or tailback can catch the ball from the backfield as he is an [[eligible receiver]].

In the last few decades the running back’s individual share of offensive output has declined as quarterbacks are generally treated as the cornerstone of the offense.<ref>http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/19/football-evolved-the-hurry-up-offense-and-the-running-back/</ref> The demands of an up-tempo offense also favor a multiple running back system.
===Running===

No position in American football can perform his duties successfully without the help of other players.  Like the wide receiver, who generally cannot make big plays without the quarterback passing to him (with the exception of the [[end-around]] play), the halfback needs good blocking from the offensive line and fullback to successfully gain yardage. Also, a halfback will generally have more rushing attempts than a receiver will have receptions. This is mainly because most football teams have one primary halfback to receive most of the carries, while successful passes will generally be spread between a number of different receivers (wide receivers, tight ends, running backs). The ability to protect the football on the run is the principal skill required of a running back. For an offense to succeed the ball has to be protected, and defensive attempts at stripping the ball will largely occur during runs on the inside of the playing field.

===Receiving ===
In addition to skill at running the ball, some halfbacks in the [[National Football League]] are known for their skill at catching passes. The role of the halfback as a receiver out of the backfield has expanded greatly in the NFL over the years, and a versatile halfback who provides his team with running and pass-catching abilities is highly valued. On passing plays, a halfback will often run a safe route, such as a hook, creating a safe target for a quarterback to throw to if all other receivers are covered.  The increase in demand for halfbacks with good receiving abilities can be attributed to the rise in popularity of the [[West Coast offense]] and its variants, which often requires its halfbacks to catch passes on a regular basis.  A great early example of a system that combined accomplished rushing skills with receiving ability is the offense of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] of the 1980s and 1990s under [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] and [[George Seifert]].  Their teams featured two [[Pro Bowl]] running backs who also had excellent receiving skills in [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] and [[Ricky Watters]].  Craig became the first player in NFL history to both rush and receive more than 1,000 yards in a season.  Currently [[Marshall Faulk]] is one of the top 20 pass catchers in NFL history. A good example of a dual threat running and pass-catching halfback is [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]; in 2003, while with the [[San Diego Chargers]], Tomlinson rushed for 1,645 yards and caught 100 passes for 725 yards, giving him 2,370 total yards from the line of scrimmage, and he became the first NFL player ever to rush for over 1,000 yards and catch 100 passes in a season. Some teams have a halfback who is more skilled at catching short passes than the starting halfback on the team, and/or is better at pass blocking or "picking up the blitz" than that of the other backs. Known as a "third down" back, he is often put in the game in third down and long situations where a pass is needed to pick up a first down. He can also be used to fool the defense by making them think he is being put into the game for a pass play, when the play is actually a run. [[Mike Tolbert]] of the [[Carolina Panthers]] is a good current example of this kind of back.

===Blocking===
Halfbacks are also required to help the offensive line in passing situations, and, in the case of the [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], running plays. Halfbacks will often block blitzing linebackers or safeties on passing plays when the offensive line is occupied with the defensive linemen. On running plays, the fullback will often attempt to tear a hole in the defensive line for the halfback to run through. Effective blocking backs are usually key components for a running back's success (as seen in LaDainian Tomlinson record-breaking season in 2006).

===Physical characteristics===

There is a great diversity in those who play at the running back position. At one extreme are smaller, faster players.  These fast, agile, and elusive running backs are often called "scat backs" because their low center of gravity and maneuverability allow them to dodge tacklers. Hall-of-famer [[Barry Sanders]] of the [[Detroit Lions]] exemplifies this running style. "Scat backs" still active in the NFL include [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]] of the [[Arizona Cardinals]], and [[Reggie Bush]] of the [[San Francisco 49ers]].This type of running back has grown in demand due to changes in offensive play calling, style, and tempo. The trending spread offense demands a player that can utilize open space as much as possible as run blockers are sacrificed to spread out the defense.

At the other extreme are "power backs": bigger, stronger players who can break through tackles using brute strength and raw power. They are usually (but not always) slower runners compared to other backs, and typically run straight ahead (or "North-and-South" in football terminology) rather than dodging to the outside edges of the playing field (i.e. running "East-and-West") like shorter, quicker, lighter backs will often do. Power backs from previous generations were often classified as [[fullback (American football)|fullbacks]], but in more recent times, players such as [[Jerome Bettis]] exemplify the power back position. More recent examples are [[Marshawn Lynch]] of the [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Steven Jackson]] of the [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Frank Gore]] of the [[Indianapolis Colts]] For many years the “power” running back was the central component of an offense. In that time period formations and rhythm favored this type of player. This sort of offensive scheme is now a rarity, as “power backs” take on supporting roles behind faster and more versatile running backs.
In the modern age an “every-down” half back has to have a combination of speed and power running ability, along with a great capability to catch the ball. A primary running back also needs abundant stamina to remain consistent in an up-tempo offense.

===Goal line backs===
Many teams also have a halfback designated as a "goal line back" or "short yardage specialist".  This halfback comes into the game in short yardage situations when the offense needs only one to five yards to get a first down.  They also come into the game when the offense nears the goal-line.  Normally when an offense gets inside the 5-yard line they send in their goal-line formation which usually includes eight blockers, a quarterback, a halfback, and a fullback.  The closer they are to the goal-line the more likely they are to use this formation. If a certain halfback is used often near the goal-line he is called the goal-line back.  Short yardage and goal-line backs are usually larger power backs that are not prone to [[fumble|fumbling]].  Their job is to get the first down or touchdown by muscling through or pushing a large mass of players that are being blocked without dropping the ball.

===Special teams===
A halfback might be called upon to return [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]s and [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]s on special teams.  Although this is most often done by [[wide receiver]]s and [[defensive back]]s, such as [[cornerback]]s (because they are generally the fastest players on the team), some halfbacks have enough speed and talent to perform this role.  The NFL's current all-time leading in kickoff return yards (14,014 yards) and punt return yards (4,999) by a halfback is [[Brian Keith Mitchell|Brian Mitchell]].  He also gained 1,967 rushing yards, 2,336 receiving yards, and 15 fumble return yards, giving him a total of 23,330 all-purpose yards, the second most in NFL history behind [[Jerry Rice]].

===Passing===
On rare occasions, and in the early days of the sport, a halfback is asked to throw the ball when running a [[Halfback option play|HB option]].<ref>[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4340080/Option-football-from-eternity-to.html Halfback option] at ecnext.com.</ref><ref>[http://www.football.com/playbook/option.shtml Halfback option play] at football.com.</ref> This play is generally referred to as a half-back pass, regardless if the player throwing the football is a tailback or fullback. This play is risky because most halfbacks are inexperienced passers, and so it is often run only by certain halfbacks more skilled at passing than most. The halfback can also throw the ball while running a [[direct snap]] play where the center snaps the ball to halfback directly. This has become particular in teams that use the [[Wildcat formation]], most prominently the [[Miami Dolphins]], where running back [[Ronnie Brown]] would run, pass, and receive out of this set.
