An '''All-Pro''' is an [[American football]] player in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) voted as one of the best players of their [[American football positions|position]] during a given season. All-Pro players for each position are selected to form an All-Pro team.

Beginning in the early 1920s, All-Pro teams have traditionally been assembled from press polls of individually voting sportswriters.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Bob|title=All-Pros from the Detroit News, 1958-72, Part 1|work=The Coffin Corner|publisher=Pro Football Researchers Association|year=2000|volume=22|issue=2|url=http://profootballresearchers.com/archives/Website_Files/Coffin_Corner/22-02-843.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6f9y00qZu|archivedate=February 9, 2016|deadurl=no}}</ref>  After polling the writers, the votes are tallied to determine the selected players and the results have historically been published through various news syndicates.  From 1931 through 1942, the NFL selected its own official All-Pros.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hogrogian|first=John|title=All-Pros of the Early NFL|work=The Coffin Corner|publisher=Pro Football Researchers Association|year=1982|volume=4|issue=11|url=http://profootballresearchers.com/archives/Website_Files/Coffin_Corner/04-11-114.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6f9yk1W47|archivedate=February 9, 2016|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=goska>{{cite book|last=Goska|first=Eric|title=Green Bay Packers - A Measure of Greatness|page=441|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rc6CNLBVbI4C&lpg=PA441&dq=%22all-pro%22%20%22associated%20press%22%20official%201940&pg=PA441#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780873499200|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}</ref> Today, the teams are mostly published online or announced on various televised sports programs.  Some organizations also include "second-team" All-Pros, designating the runners-up at each position.

The [[Associated Press]] (AP) and its All-Pro selections are the most widely recognized today.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Michael David|title=Associated Press will re-examine the makeup of All-Pro teams|date=January 8, 2016|work=Pro Football Talk|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/01/08/associated-press-will-re-examine-the-makeup-of-all-pro-teams/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6f9zCWP29|archivedate=February 9, 2016|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wywrot|first=Chrissie|title=Suh Named to AP All-Pro Team|date=January 24, 2011|website=DetroitLions.com|url=http://www.detroitlions.com/news/article-1/Suh-Named-to-AP-All-Pro-Team/f7da3e22-2d83-42a6-bc99-dd96e000247f|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6f9zK03S1|archivedate=February 9, 2016|deadurl=no}}</ref> Other polls include the [[United Press International]] All-Pro poll, which began in the 1940s and continued in various forms until 1997, the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] All-Pro team, which ran from 1954 until 1996, the [[Pro Football Writers Association]] All-Pro teams, which were inaugurated in 1966 and continue to be released annually, and the [[Pro Football Focus]] All-Pro teams, which began in 2009.

== Associated Press All-Pro ==
The [[Associated Press|AP]] began selecting All-Pros in 1940, and is the longest running annual selector of the top NFL players.<ref name=goska/><ref>{{cite news|title=Jake Long Named Associated Press All-Pro|date=January 25, 2011|website=miami.cbslocal.com|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/01/25/jake-long-named-associated-press-all-pro/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6f9vDLiIk|archivedate=February 8, 2016|deadurl=no}}</ref> The All-Pro Team is an annual selection of the best players in the [[National Football League|NFL]] by position as selected by a national panel of AP media members.  Unlike selection to the [[Pro Bowl]]s prior to 2014, votes are cast for outstanding players by position without consideration for whether the player competes in the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) or [[National Football Conference]] (NFC).

The First Team consists of the top one or two players at each position; the Second Team consists of the runners-up at each position. One player is selected at quarterback, fullback, tight end, center, punter, place kicker, and kick returner, while two players are selected at running back, wide receiver, offensive tackle, offensive guard, outside linebacker, inside/middle linebacker, defensive end, defensive tackle, cornerback, and safety.

There is controversy in some NFL cities about how the voters are selected by the AP.  The AP claims that the selection panel is national one, but some NFL media markets such as Detroit, a city who has had an NFL team since 1934, does not have a vote.<ref name="Detroit Lions Official Team Website">{{cite web|last=O'Hara|first=Mike|title=Why Calvin Johnson wasn't a unanimous All-Pro selection|url=http://www.detroitlions.com/news/article-1/OHaras-Monday-Countdown-Why-Calvin-Johnson-wasnt-a-unanimous-All-Pro-selection/5e8873fb-7fac-4b88-a8a3-679b8e9905e4|publisher=detroitlions.com|accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>

The PFWA All-NFL Team was inaugurated in 1966 and is still released each year.
