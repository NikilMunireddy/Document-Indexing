'''Cossidae''', the '''cossid millers''' or '''carpenter millers''', make up a [[family (biology)|family]] of mostly large [[Miller (moth)|miller moth]]s. Ths family contains over 110 [[genera]] with almost 700 known [[species]], and many more species await description. Carpenter millers are [[nocturnal]] [[Lepidoptera]] found worldwide, except the [[Southeast Asia]]n [[subfamily]] [[Ratardinae]] which is mostly active during the day.

This family includes many species with large [[caterpillar]]s and [[moth]]s with a [[wingspan]] from {{convert|9|-|24|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}. These moths are mostly grey in color; some have long narrow wings and resemble [[hawkmoth]]s (Sphingidae) which are more advanced [[Macrolepidoptera]] however. Many are twig, bark or leaf [[mimic]]s, and Cossidae often have some sort of large marking at the tip of the forewing uppersides, conspicuous in flight but resembling a broken-off twig when the animals are resting. Most cossid caterpillars are tree borers, in some species taking up to three years to mature. The caterpillars [[pupa]]te within their tunnels; they often have an unpleasant smell, hence another colloquial name is '''goat moths'''.

The family includes the [[Carpenterworm]] (''[[Prionoxystus robiniae]]'') and the [[goat moth]] (''Cossus cossus'') which have gained notoriety as [[pest (organism)|pest]]s. On the other hand, the large caterpillars of species that do not smell badly are often [[Entomophagy|edible]]. [[Witchetty grub]]s &ndash; among the [[Outback]]'s most famous [[bush tucker]] &ndash; are most commonly the caterpillars of ''[[Endoxyla leucomochla]]'', one of the more than 80 cossid species in [[Australia]]. In [[Chile]], the sweet-smelling caterpillars of the [[Chilean Moth]] (''[[Chilecomadia moorei]]'') are harvested in quantity and internationally traded as [[butterworm]]s, for use as [[pet food]] and [[fishing bait]].

==Systematics==
Some other families, such as [[Dudgeoneidae]], [[Metarbelidae]] and [[Ratardidae]], have been included within this one time and again. The first is considered a distinct family of the [[Cossoidea]] today recognizable by their [[abdominal]] [[tympanal organ]]s which the Cossidae lack, whereas the other two are usually kept in the Cossidae as [[subfamilies]]. Some unrelated millers were included in the Cossidae in error too, such as the [[genus]] ''[[Holcoceroides]]'' which are more primitive [[Ditrysia]], or the [[Andesianidae]] which are even more ancient [[Heteroneura]].

The Cossidae were usually divided into six [[subfamilies]].<ref>Pitkin & Jenkins (2004) and see references in Savela (2006)</ref> However, numerous new [[subfamilies]] have been described recently, the current taxonomy is:
