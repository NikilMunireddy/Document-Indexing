'''History''' (originally '''The History Channel''' from 1995 to 2008) is an [[United States|American]] [[Cable channel|basic cable]] and [[satellite television]] channel that is owned by [[A&E Networks]], a [[joint venture]] between the [[Hearst Corporation]] and the [[Disney–ABC Television Group]] division of [[the Walt Disney Company]].

The channel originally broadcast documentary programs and historical fiction series. However, since 2008, it has mostly broadcast a variety of [[reality television]] series such as ''[[Pawn Stars]]'', ''[[Ax Men]]'', and other non-history related content. Additionally, the network is frequently criticized by scientists, historians, and skeptics for broadcasting pseudo-documentaries, unsubstantiated and sensational investigative programming, such as ''[[Ancient Aliens]]'', ''[[UFO Hunters]]'',  ''[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]'' and the ''[[Nostradamus Effect]]''.

As of February 2015, approximately 96,149,000 American households (82.6% of households with television) receive History.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref> International localized versions of History are available, in various forms, in [[India]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]]. The first European version was launched in Scandinavia in 1997 by Viasat which now operates their own channel, Viasat History.

On February 16, 2008, a new logo was launched on the U.S. network as part of a major rebranding effort. While the trademark "H" was kept, the triangle shape on the left acts as a play button for animation and flyouts during commercials and shows. On March 20, 2008, as part of that same rebranding effort, The History Channel dropped "The" and "Channel" from its name to become simply "History."<ref>International Herald Tribune [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/20/arts/TV-History-Channel.php Television's The History Channel Drops 'The' and 'Channel' from Its Name, Keeps History] March 20, 2008</ref>

On June 1, 2015, the History logo was slightly updated, completely removing the triangle shape on the left.

== Programming ==

[[File:History HD Logo.svg|thumb|right|190px|History HD logo, 2008-2015]]
Programming on History has covered a wide range of historical [[History by period|periods]] and topics, while similar themed topics are often organized into themed weeks or daily marathons. Subjects include [[warfare]], [[invention]]s, [[aviation]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[civil engineering]], [[technology]], [[mythical creatures]], [[monster]]s, [[unidentified flying object|UFO]], [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]], [[religion|religious beliefs]], [[disaster]] scenarios, [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] "after man" scenarios, [[End time|doomsday]], and [[2012 Phenomenon|2012]] superstitions. Programming also includes mainstream [[reality television]]-style shows involving truck drivers, alligator hunters, pawn stores, antique and collectible "pickers", car restorers, photography, and others. Occasionally some programs compare contemporary culture and technology with that of the past.<ref name="EdgertonRollins2001">Gary Richard Edgerton; Peter C. Rollins.

==Criticism and evaluation==
History has in the past, particularly during the 1990s, been jokingly referred to as "The [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] Channel"<ref>Schone, Mark. [http://www.salon.com/1997/05/08/media_90/ "All Hitler, All the Time"], [[Salon.com]], May 8, 1997).</ref> for its extensive coverage of [[World War II]]. Recently, however, much of its military-themed programming has now been shifted to its sister network [[Military History (TV channel)|Military History]].

The network has also been criticized for having a bias towards [[History of the United States|US history]]. Another former sister network, [[History International]], more extensively covered history outside the US until in 2011 it was rebranded as [[History 2]] and started broadcasting more material that had to do with US history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide03/explore1.html|title=Time traveler's guide to the Roman Empire|publisher=Channel4.com|quote=The History Channel: The website of the American cable channel has a bias towards American history, as evidenced by Extreme History with Roger Daltrey|accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref>

The network was also criticized by Stanley Kutner for airing the controversial series ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' in 2003. Kutner was one of three historians commissioned to review the documentary, which the channel disavowed and never aired again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/4504.html|title=Why the History Channel Had to Apologize for the Documentary that Blamed LBJ for JFK's Murder|author=Stanley Kutner|publisher=History News Network|date=July 4, 2004|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=The History Channel has made a start in the right direction as it has totally disavowed the program and publicly promised it never will be shown again.}}</ref> On the other hand, programs such as ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' have been praised for their presentation of detailed information in an entertaining format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=28158|title=Modern Marvels: Technology|author=Scott Weinberg|work=DVD Talk|date=May 29, 2007|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=If you're trying to throw your kids a little education, but in a fast-paced and colorful presentation, these "Modern Marvels" series come pretty highly recommended. Then again, I'm a mid-30s guy and I'm learning tons of new stuff from these programs.}}</ref>

Some of the network's series, including ''[[Ice Road Truckers]]'', ''[[Ax Men]]'', and ''[[Pawn Stars]]'', garnered ratings in the U.S. while receiving criticism over the series' [[Channel drift|non-historical nature]]. [[Forbes|Forbes.com]] contributor Brad Lockwood criticized the History Channel's addition of "programs devoted to monsters, aliens and conspiracies" and wrote that ratings trends have influenced the network to [[Channel drift|focus on entertainment rather than actual historical programming]].<ref name="Forbes">{{cite news|last=Lockwood|first=Brad|title=High Ratings Aside, Where's the History on History?|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/bradlockwood/2011/10/17/high-ratings-aside-wheres-the-history-on-history/|work=Forbes|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref> U.S. Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] is a frequent critic of the channel and its lack of historical or educational programming, showing particular disdain for ''Ax Men'' and ''Pawn Stars''.<ref>Malone, Noreen (March 20, 2012).

''New York'' magazine. Retrieved April 2, 2012.</ref>

In his book ''2012: It's Not the End of the World'', Peter Lemesurier describes the channel's ''[[Nostradamus]]'' series, in which he was invited to participate, as "largely fiction" and "lurid nonsense."<ref>For summaries and reviews, see [http://nostraeffect.blogspot.com/ here].</ref> He also lists numerous suggestions made in its films on the alleged Mayan "end of the world" and the "rare" galactic alignment that was supposed by [[John Major Jenkins]] to accompany it in [[2012 Phenomenon|2012]],<ref>Lemesurier, Derwen Publishing, 2011</ref> while Jenkins himself has described ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' as "45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism."<ref>See his online comments on "How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" [http://www.alignment2012.com/historychannel.html here]</ref>

In December 2011, [[Politifact]] gave the History Channel's claim that the [[United States Congress]] stayed open on [[Christmas Day]] for most of its first 67 years of existence a "pants on fire" rating, the lowest of its ratings, noting that its own research showed that both the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House|House]] had only convened once in those 67 years on a Christmas Day and adding that, since there's a 1/7 chance of Christmas falling on a Sunday (when Congress did not meet in order to attend church), the claim that they would have convened almost every Christmas is "ridiculous."<ref name="Pf">{{cite web|title=Comic Jon Stewart says Congress met most Christmas Days in its early years|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/09/jon-stewart/comic-jon-stewart-says-early-congress-met-most-chr/|publisher=[[Politifact]]|accessdate=January 21, 2012|date=December 11, 2011}}</ref> The claim had first been broadcast on the History Channel program ''Christmas Unwrapped – The History of Christmas'' before being subsequently picked up by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s website on the "Origins of Christmas" and by the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[The Daily Show]]''.<ref name="Pf" /> ''Daily Show'' host [[Jon Stewart]] responded the next day by stating it was their fault for trusting the History Channel and satirized a clip from the History Channel about UFOs and Nazis by stating, "The next thing you know we'll all find out the Nazis did not employ alien technology in their quest for world domination."<ref name="HP">{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart Fires Back At Politifact Over War On Christmas|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/13/jon-stewart-politifact-war-on-christmas_n_1146118.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=January 21, 2012|date=December 13, 2011|first=Katherine|last=Fung}}</ref><ref name="Daily">{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Jon|title=War on Christmas - Historical Fact-Checking|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-december-12-2011/war-on-christmas---historical-fact-checking|work=[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=December 12, 2011}}</ref>

The History Channel was also singled out for ridicule by [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian magazine]]. The article took issue with the show ''Ancient Aliens'' for postulating the "idea that aliens caused the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Switek|first1=Brian|title=The Idiocy, Fabrications and Lies of Ancient Aliens|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-idiocy-fabrications-and-lies-of-ancient-aliens-86294030/?no-ist|website=Smithsonian|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref> The online magazine Cracked also lampooned the channel for its strange definition of history.

==== Canada ====
{{Main|History (Canada)}}
The History Channel (as it was then known) was not initially related to a similar Canadian service, History Television, which launched in 1999. During the Canadian channel's first several years of operation, despite sharing a similar programming focus, the channels would rarely if ever share programming. Indeed, the phrase "Not available in Canada" became a ''de facto'' slogan for the U.S. channel in its early years as a result of its use in promotional ads on American channels that were imported to Canadian pay television providers, particularly A&E.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lisnews.com/index.pl?issue=20040722&mode=|title=Librarian and Information Science News|publisher=LIS News|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=I always wondered why the History Channel commercials said not available in Canada.}}</ref>

As late as the late [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], flagship History (U.S.) series were slow to reach Canadian viewers (if they aired in that country at all); ''[[Ice Road Truckers]]'' debuted in 2007, but did not join the History Television schedule until early 2009. However, the relationship between the two has improved since then. On May 30, 2012, History Television's current owner [[Shaw Media]] announced that it would rebrand the channel as a Canadian version of History in the fall of 2012, through a licensing agreement with A+E Networks.<ref>[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/shaw-media-and-a-e-to-launch-two-new-specialty-channels/1001418951/ Shaw Media and A&E to Launch Two New Specialty Channels], ''Broadcaster Magazine'', May 30, 2012.</ref> History Television relaunched as History on August 12, 2012; shortly thereafter, another Shaw-owned specialty channel was relaunched as a [[H2 (Canada)|Canadian version of H2]].

On October 21, 2014, [[Corus Entertainment]] reached an agreement to acquire [[Canadian French]]-language rights to History programming for its own channel, [[Historia (TV channel)|Historia]]. On March 9, 2015, the network was re-launched under History's logo and branding, although the network still carries the Historia name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corusent.com/home/Corporate/PressReleases/tabid/1697/Default.aspx?Id=2936|title=Historia: new logo, new look, new shows! |publisher=Corus Entertainment |date=2015-03-09 |accessdate=2014-03-09}}</ref> Historia was previously owned as a joint venture between Shaw and [[Astral Media]] (merged with [[Bell Media]] in 2013), which made it a sister to History; Corus purchased the network in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corusent.com/home/Corporate/PressReleases/tabid/1697/Default.aspx?Id=2455|title=Corus Entertainment Expands Interests in French-language Specialty Television Market through Major Deals with Bell and Shaw Media|author=[[Corus Entertainment]]|date=2013-03-04|accessdate=2013-03-31}}</ref>

On April 1, 2016, Corus Entertainment acquired Shaw Media and as a result, now co-owns both History Canada and the [[Canadian English]]-language rights to the History library of original programming with Historia and the Canadian French-language rights to the History library of original programming.
