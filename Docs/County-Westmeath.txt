'''County Westmeath''' ({{IPAc-en|w|ɛ|s|t|ˈ|m|iː|ð}} {{Respell|west|MEEDH|'}}; {{lang-ga|Contae na hIarmhí}} or simply ''An Iarmhí'') is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]] and is part of the [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midlands Region]]. It originally formed part of the historic [[Kingdom of Meath]] ({{lang|ga|''Midhe''|middle}}). [[Westmeath County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county. The population of the county is 86,164 according to the 2011 census.

== History ==
Following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], the territory of the Kingdom of Meath was subsumed into the [[Lordship of Meath]] and granted by King [[Henry II of England]], in his capacity as [[Lordship of Ireland|Lord of Ireland]], to [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]] in 1172. Following the failure of male heirs, the Lordship was split between de Lacy's great-granddaughters. The western part was awarded to Margery and her husband, [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|John de Verdun, son of Walter de Lacy]] while the eastern part, centred on [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], was awarded to [[Maud de Lacy, Baroness Geneville|Maud]].

== Geography and political subdivisions ==
Westmeath is the 20th largest of Ireland's 32 counties by area and the 22nd largest in terms of population.<ref>{{Cite book| first=Eoghan| last=Corry| title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland| year=2005| id= | pages=186–191}}</ref> It is the sixth largest of Leinster’s 12 counties in size and eighth largest in terms of population. It was named after the historic kingdom and province of Meath, of which the county was the most western part. Westmeath was shired under ''The Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act'' of 1543. The [[Hill of Uisneach]] in the barony of Moycashel is sometimes regarded as the notional geographical centre of Ireland although the actual [[geographic centre of Ireland]] lies in neighbouring [[County Roscommon]].

==Local government and politics==
The head office of Westmeath County Council is located in [[Mullingar]]. There are currently 20 councillors. The three electoral areas of Westmeath are Athlone (7 seats), Mullingar-Coole (7 seats) and Mullingar-Kilbeggan (6 seats).<ref>http://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/media/Local%20Electoral%20Area%20Boundaries%202014.pdf</ref> The [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], provided the framework for the establishment of County Councils throughout Ireland. The first meeting of Westmeath County Council was held on 22 April 1899.<ref name="WC">{{cite web| title=About Us | work=Westmeath County Council | url=http://www.westmeathcoco.ie/aboutUs/index.asp | accessdate=2008-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080507185720/http://www.westmeathcoco.ie/aboutUs/index.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-07}}</ref>

==Demography==
Westmeath's population growth has been stronger than the national average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Demographic context |work=Offaly County Council Development Plan 2009 - 2015 |url=http://www.offaly.ie/NR/rdonlyres/A4AD027E-87E4-4353-917B-47C75D92768F/1095/Chapter2ContextandChallenges_FEB08.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081030030920/http://www.offaly.ie/NR/rdonlyres/A4AD027E-87E4-4353-917B-47C75D92768F/1095/Chapter2ContextandChallenges_FEB08.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2008 }}</ref> After the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], the population of Westmeath declined dramatically. It stabilized in the middle of the 20th century, and has continued to grow. Westmeath's proximity to [[Dublin]] with good motorway facilities and frequent rail service has made commuting popular.

The largest town in the county is [[Athlone]], followed by the County town [[Mullingar]]. Westmeath is the largest county by population in the [[Irish Midlands]]. Important commercial and marketing centres include [[Moate]], [[Kilbeggan]], [[Kinnegad]], [[Ballinahown]], [[Delvin]], [[Rochfortbridge]], [[Killucan]] and [[Castlepollard]]. According to the 2011 census 51.9% of Westmeath households have at least one Irish speaker.<ref>http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/saveselections.asp</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Canal Mullingar 01.JPG|thumb|left|Canal at Mullingar]]
[[File:Chevaux de Westmeath.JPG|thumb|left|Barbavilla Stud Horses]]

Westmeath has a strong agricultural economy. Initially, development occurred around the major market centres of Mullingar, Moate, and Kinnegad. Athlone developed due to its military significance, and its strategic location on the main Dublin–Galway route across the [[River Shannon]]. Mullingar gained considerable advantage from the development of the [[Royal Canal]]. The canal facilitated cheap transport of produce to Dublin, Britain and Europe. Athlone and Mullingar expanded further with the coming of the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] network in the nineteenth century.

Tourism in Westmeath is generally based on its many water amenities. The county lakes include [[Lough Derravaragh]], [[Lough Ennell]], [[Lough Owel]], [[Lough Lene]], and [[Lough Ree]]. Both the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]], and the Royal Canal flow through Westmeath, and the [[River Shannon]] (Ireland's key tourism waterway) has a modern inland harbour in Athlone.

Two major "Greenway" projects are intended to improve cycling facilities.  The Westmeath Section of the Dublin – Galway Greenway is currently under construction and is anticipated to be completed as far as Athlone by summer 2015. This section of greenway travels along the old railway corridor between Athlone and Mullingar. 
<ref>[https://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/ourservices/tourismartsrecreation/greenway/ Westmeath County Council - Westmeath Royal Canal Greenway<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
The Royal Canal Greenway takes tourists from the county boundary to Mullingar, and then on towards Longford.  Those wishing to use the Dublin-Galway Greenway will be able to transfer from the Royal Canal route to the old rail corridor on towards Athlone.

The development of industry in Westmeath was mainly based on food processing and consumer products. Whiskey is distilled in Kilbeggan and tobacco is processed in Mullingar. The county has an extensive beef and dairy trade. In recent times, the  manufacturer [[Élan]] has located in Athlone. The eastern part of the county is home to commuters many of whom work at the technology parks on the western side of [[Dublin]].

Mullingar is renowned for the high quality of its beef and veal. Weaned cattle from the west of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] are fattened for market on the lush [[grassland]]s of Meath and Westmeath. The cattle are also used to maintain grassland to help sustain wildlife in the areas fringing the [[Bog of Allen]].

Westmeath is home to many stud farms. The plains of Westmeath, covered in calcium-rich [[marl]], contribute significantly to calcification of foal bones during their formative years. Westmeath mares are usually put into foal in spring to facilitate summer growth. Pregnancy lasts for approximately 335–340 days and usually results in one foal. Horses mature when they are around four years old.

==Railways==
Westmeath also has railway infrastructure with a number of trains passing through towns in the county. The [[Dublin–Westport/Galway railway line]] runs though the county, with services from  [[Dublin Heuston]] to [[Galway railway station|Galway]]/[[Westport railway station, Mayo|Westport]]/[[Ballina railway station|Ballina]] inter-city train service stops at [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]], while the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]] service stops at [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]].  The line from [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]] via [[Moate railway station]] to [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]] could be reopened for trains from [[Galway railway station|Galway]] to [[Dublin Connolly]]. Other major infrastructural projects and plans for the county include [[Transport 21]].

==Road transport==
Roads are of good quality in the county. As part of the [[Transport 21]] infrastructure programme undertaken by the government, both the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4]] and [[N6 road (Ireland)|N6]] roads have been upgraded to [[motorway]] or [[dual carriageway]] standard. All towns that these roads passed through are now bypassed, such as [[Mullingar]], [[Athlone]], [[Moate]] and [[Kinnegad]]. Both [[Dublin]] and [[Galway]] are within commuting distance from Westmeath following the completion of the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6 motorway]] in December 2009.
