'''Aldershot Town Football Club''' is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], England. The club participates in the [[National League (division)|National League]], the fifth tier of English football. The club was founded in the spring of 1992 after the closure of debt-ridden [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] club [[Aldershot F.C.]].

Aldershot Town play at the [[Recreation Ground (Aldershot)|Recreation Ground]] in Aldershot. They competed in [[Football League Two]] from 2008 to 2013 but were relegated from the Football League at the end of the 2012–13 season. Aldershot Town entered administration on 2 May 2013.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22383276|title=BBC Sport – Aldershot Town: Relegated club goes into administration|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|List of Aldershot Town F.C. seasons}}

===Formation and the Isthmian years===
In March 1992, the town of Aldershot was without a football club after [[Aldershot F.C.]] became the first Football League team to fold during the football season since [[Accrington Stanley F.C. (1891)|Accrington Stanley]] in 1962. Aldershot Town was born later the same year, and began life competing in the [[Isthmian League]] Division Three. Despite Aldershot Town playing five divisions lower than the Football League, the attendance for their first competitive fixture was higher than the old team's last home tie. Ten successive victories were recorded under the guidance of former player [[Steve Wignall]] and Aldershot won the championship by an 18-point margin.

A further [[promotion (sports)|promotion]] and an [[FA Vase]] quarter-final placing was achieved in the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]] season. When Steve Wignall departed to take charge of [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] mid-way through the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] season, former [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] winger [[Steve Wigley]] took over. The club finished the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] season with a run of six successive victories, but missed out on promotion by [[goal difference]]. After narrowly missing out during the next two seasons Wigley left in July 1997 to become Youth Development Officer at Nottingham Forest. He was replaced by [[George Borg (football manager)|George Borg]]. Attendances continued to rise during this period and the final fixture of the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] Isthmian League First Division championship-winning season, at home to [[Berkhamsted Town F.C.|Berkhamsted Town]], attracted 4,289 people to the Recreation Ground&nbsp;– a league record. The success under Borg continued with an [[Isthmian League]] Cup, two [[Hampshire Senior Cup]]s and a runners-up spot in the [[Isthmian League]] Premier Division.

The club's reserves were reinstated in [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]] and entered the Suburban League. The FA Cup in 2000–01 saw Aldershot take on league opposition at The Recreation Ground for the first time since reforming, when [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] visited for a 1st Round tie in November and a record attendance of 7,500 saw the league team win. In the following season's FA Cup the Shots held [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] to a home draw in the First Round, but again missed out on the Second Round after losing the replay in Bristol.

George Borg resigned as manager in November 2001 after pressure from supporters and was replaced by Terry Brown. He won his first game in charge beating [[Newport IOW F.C.|Newport IOW]] 1–0 in the Hampshire Senior Cup Semi-final Second Leg, taking The Shots on to win the final against [[Havant & Waterlooville F.C.|Havant & Waterlooville]]. In Brown's first full season in charge he overhauled the squad, and by mid-November the Shots were top of the table, a position they did not relinquish for the remainder of the season, winning promotion to the [[Football Conference]]. The club also retained the Hampshire Senior Cup with a 2–1 win over [[Bashley F.C.|Bashley]].

===Conference years===
A crowd of 3,680 saw Aldershot's first game in the Conference, a 2–1 win over [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]]. The club went on to stay in the play-off positions in the league table for all but 3 days of the season. The Shots equalled their best ever run in the FA Cup, reaching the 2nd Round and losing 1–0 to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] at [[Layer Road]]. The club reached their first [[FA Trophy]] semi-final, losing to eventual winners [[Hednesford Town F.C.|Hednesford Town]] and the average attendance for league matches at The Rec ended on a record high of 3,303.

A 1–1 draw against [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] on the last day of the season carried the Shots into the play-offs for a place in the Football League. Over two legs the Shots held their own against favourites [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], drawing 1–1 at The Rec and 0–0 at [[Edgar Street]]. Extra time finished without any further score and the tie was concluded on penalties with the Shots winning 4–2. The 2004 Conference play-off Final against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] finished 1–1 after extra time. Shrewsbury returned to the league with a 3–0 win in the penalty shoot-out.

In May 2004 the club officers made the decision to convert Aldershot Town to full-time professional status from the following July. In [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] the Shots once again equalled their best ever run in the FA Cup as they reached the 2nd Round proper, where they lost 5–1 to [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]]. After a slow start in the league, Aldershot improved their form and reached the play-offs after beating [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] in the last game of the season. The Shots won the first leg against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] 1–0 at home, but lost the away leg 2–1, giving a 2–2 aggregate score. Extra time could not separate the sides and the tie went to penalties, with Carlsle winning the shootout.

The next two seasons were less successful for the Shots. [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] saw Aldershot's team suffer numerous injuries, and they struggled to 13th in the table. The team made it to the 2nd round of the FA Cup, losing 1–0 at home to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. The next season was equally disappointing, with the side never really getting close enough to the aim of finishing in the playoff positions. The club eventually made it to 9th in the reformed 24 club [[Conference Premier]], finishing 13 points off the playoffs. Terry Brown resigned, citing the poor health of his wife as the primary reason, although his position may have been untenable with regards to the season's performance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Martin Kuhl]] took over as caretaker manager. They made it to the Third round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 4–2 at [[Bloomfield Road]] to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]

====Promotion to the Football League====
In May 2007 [[Gary Waddock]] was appointed the new manager, with Martin Kuhl reverting to his coaching position. The Shots started the season strongly, losing few games before the turn of the year. [[Jonny Dixon]] was sold to Brighton and Hove Albion in the January Transfer window for a then club record of £56,000.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/7217266.stm| title=Brighton complete deal for Dixon | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=31 January 2008  | date=31 January 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080203200443/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/7217266.stm| archivedate= 3 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Shots finished top of the [[Conference Premier]] with a record 101 points, and were promoted to [[the Football League]], for the first time since the club was reformed<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/7344140.stm | title=Exeter 1–1 Aldershot | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=15 April 2008  | date=15 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080420085142/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/7344140.stm| archivedate= 20 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> ending the season on an 18-match undefeated run.

The Shots also made it to the [[Conference League Cup]] Final after a 4–3 penalty shoot out victory over near neighbours [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] in the semi-final. The final, played at the Recreation Ground on 3 April, was against [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]]. With the scores 1–1 at full-time, then 3–3 after extra time, Aldershot won 4–3 on penalties.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/6903365.stm | title=Aldershot Town win Setanta Shield | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=4 April 2008  | date=4 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080219022248/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/6903365.stm| archivedate= 19 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Football League===
Sixteen years after the demise of Aldershot F.C., the town of Aldershot had a Football League team again. The club retained many of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] promotion winning team, and added several signings, both permanent and on loan. Gary Waddock and Martin Kuhl also committed their futures to the club by signing new three-year contracts.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aldershot/7471799.stm| title=Waddock signs new Aldershot deal  | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=24 June 2008  | date=24 June 2008}}</ref> [[Joel Grant]] was sold to [[Crewe Alexandra]] for £130,000, a club record.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crewe_alexandra/7473894.stm| title=Crewe sign Aldershot winger Grant | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=25 June 2008 | date=25 June 2008}}</ref> On the opening day of the 2008–09 season, Aldershot Town won their first league game on their return to the Football League at [[Accrington Stanley]] 1–0.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theshots.co.uk/newspage.ink?nid=30107&newstype=m&matchid=8254| title=Accrington Stanley 0–1 Aldershot Town | publisher=www.theshots.co.uk | accessdate=9 August 2008 }}</ref> This was followed four days later by the club's first ever [[Football League Cup]] game, against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] at the [[Ricoh Arena]], which the Shots lost 3–1. The Shots finished fifteenth in League Two in their first season in the Football League.

Two months into the [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10]] season, manager Gary Waddock and assistant Martin Kuhl accepted offers to join [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]]. [[Jason Dodd]] was appointed as [[Caretaker manager|Caretaker Manager]], assisted by [[Paul Williams (footballer born 1971)|Paul Williams]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aldershot/8308014.stm| title=Dodd named Shots caretaker boss | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=14 October 2009  | date=14 October 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091018010220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aldershot/8308014.stm| archivedate= 18 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> before [[Kevin Dillon (English footballer)|Kevin Dillon]], the former first-team coach of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], was appointed as Waddock's permanent successor in November 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aldershot/8348697.stm| title=Dillon named as Aldershot manager | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=9 November 2009  | date=9 November 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091110130605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aldershot/8348697.stm| archivedate= 10 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Two days later Dillon appointed [[Gary Owers]] as his assistant manager.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theshots.co.uk/NewsPage.ink?nid=31914|title=Assistant Manager Named  |publisher=Theshots.co.uk |date=11 November 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2009}}</ref> Under the new management team Aldershot finished the season in sixth place,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/DivisionalLeagueTable/0,,10794~200926,00.html|title= League Tables|publisher=[[The Football League]]|accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref> qualifying them for the play-offs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8630051.stm|title=Aldershot 3&nbsp;– 1 Lincoln City|date=1 May 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=21 May 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100504025117/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8630051.stm| archivedate= 4 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> where they lost 3–0 on aggregate to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8682172.stm|title=Rotherham 2&nbsp;– 0 Aldershot (agg 3&nbsp;– 0)|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=21 May 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100522124434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8682172.stm| archivedate= 22 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Records==

===Appearances and goals===
Jason Chewins holds the record for the most number of appearances for the club, playing 489 times between August 1994 and May 2004. This led to the left-back being the first and, to date, only player to receive a [[testimonial match]], which was played against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in July 2004.

Before Chewins, the record was held by Mark Butler, who joined the club at its inception in 1992. Butler played 303 times between August 1992 and May 1998, also holding the all-time goal scoring record by netting 155 times, a record he still currently holds. Former goalkeeper [[Nikki Bull]] made his 300th appearance for the Shots in November 2008 and eventually made 313 appearances before moving to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in July 2009. Three others have played more than 200 times for the club, Stuart Udal, whose brother [[Shaun Udal|Shaun]] was an [[England cricket team|England]] international cricketer, played 236 times for the club. Winger Jimmy Sugrue has also reached the landmark. Most recently current captain [[Anthony Charles]] reached the landmark in October 2010.

Gary Abbott is, apart from Butler, the only Shots player to have ever scored over 100 goals for the club. Over the course of three seasons, between August 1998 and May 2001, he scored 120 goals.
