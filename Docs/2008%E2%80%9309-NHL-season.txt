The '''2008–09 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|92nd]] season of operation (91st [[Season (sport)|season]] of play) of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). It was the first season since prior to the [[2004–05 NHL lockout|2004–05 lockout]] in which every team played each other at least once during the season, following three seasons where teams only played against two divisions in the other conference (one division at home and one on the road.)<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3134834 NHL teams will play each other at least once per season]</ref> It began on October 4, with the regular season ending on April 12.  The [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] ended on June 12, with the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] taking the championship. The [[Montreal Canadiens]] hosted the [[57th National Hockey League All-Star Game|57th NHL All-Star Game]] at the [[Bell Centre]] on January 25, 2009, part of the [[Montreal Canadiens centennial|Canadiens' 100th season celebration]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2740485 Montreal to host '09 All-Star Game]</ref>

==League business==

===Increase in salary cap===
National Hockey League announced that the regular season salary cap would be going up for the fourth straight season. The 2008–09 salary cap is being increased by $6,400,000 (US) per team to bring the salary cap up to $56,700,000 (US). The salary floor is at $40,700,000 (US), which is higher than the salary cap on 2005–06 season.

===Rule changes===
The NHL brought in a number of rule changes for the start of the 2008–09 NHL season aimed at increasing offence and safety. The first rule change was to Rule 76.2 on faceoffs. The first faceoff of a power play will now be in the defending zone of the team that committed the foul, regardless of where the play was stopped. The second rule dealt with the issue of safety while players are pursuing the puck on a potential icing call. Rule 81.1 states that, ''"Any contact between opposing players while pursuing the puck on an icing must be for the sole purpose of playing the puck and not for eliminating the opponent from playing the puck. Unnecessary or dangerous contact could result in penalties being assessed to the offending player."'' The third rule change also dealt with faceoff position: if a puck is shot off the goal frame, goal post or crossbar, the subsequent faceoff will remain in the end zone where the puck went out of play.<ref>[http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=241045 rule changes]</ref> Another rule change prohibits TV commercials, game breaks, and any line changes immediately after an icing call.

===Season schedule===
The 2008–09 schedule returns to the pre-lockout schedule. The new schedule eliminates the three-year rotation where teams would only play teams in two of the three divisions of the opposite conference; instead the new schedule guarantees that each team plays every other team at least once.  In this new schedule, each team will play their divisional rivals six times for a total of 24 games; they will play all other conference teams four times for a total of 40 games, and will play every team in the opposite conference at least once for a total of 15 games. To obtain a total of 82 games there are an additional three-wild card games; for the Canadian teams, the three-wild card games are composed of playing the three Canadian teams in the opposite conference an additional time.<ref>{{cite web | title = NHL owners finally approve schedule change; Nashville sale approved | author = Canadian Press | url = http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/11483-NHL-owners-finally-approve-schedule-change-Nashville-sale-approved.html | date = November 29, 2007  | accessdate =October 11, 2009 | publisher = The Hockey News}}</ref>

===European openers===
{{wikinewspar|National Hockey League to open 2008–09 season in Stockholm and Prague|National Hockey League to open 2008–09 season in Stockholm and Prague}}The 'regular season' started with four games played in Europe.  The [[Ottawa Senators]] and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] played each other twice in [[Stockholm]], Sweden the 2 teams split a 2-game premiere, and the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] played each other twice in [[Prague]], Czech Republic The Rangers swept Tampa Bay 2–0. The New York Rangers represented the NHL in the [[2008 Victoria Cup|inaugural Victoria Cup]] challenge game as part of the club's pre-season schedule. The four teams also played some pre-season exhibition games in Europe.<ref>[http://www.tsn.ca/ctvnews/sportsstory.asp?story_id=228084  NHL's European plans finalized]</ref>

Other than the four overseas 'regular season' games starting October 4, '''October 9''' was the actual first day of regular season games as far as widespread continental North American broadcast from most providers, including pay per view hockey packages. Other teams still played preseason games between October 4 and 6.

By February 23, 2009, all four teams who started the season in Europe had fired their coaches.

=== Winter Classic ===
{{main|2009 NHL Winter Classic}}
Because of the success of the [[AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic|2008 Winter Classic]], another outdoor game was held in the 2008–09 NHL season. While [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] was considered an early favorite, in a game to be hosted by the Rangers, cold-weather issues involving the old stadium put that location out of the mix. Another site considered was [[Beaver Stadium]] at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]], with that game to likely involve the Penguins and the Flyers.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/rangers/ny-spoutgame175689605may17,0,2205392.story | title=Going, going, gone? |work=Newsday | last=Staple | first=Arthur | date=May 17, 2008 | accessdate=May 18, 2008}}</ref>

On May 29, 2008, [[The Sports Network|TSN]] reported that the [[2009 NHL Winter Classic]] would be held in Chicago, Illinois on January 1, 2009, played between the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and defending champion [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=239172 | title = Blackhawks to host next season's Winter Classic | publisher = TSN | date = May 29, 2008 | accessdate =May 29, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080601220625/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=239172| archivedate= June 1, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Soldier Field]] was considered an early candidate, however the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Chicago Bears]] objected, citing a possible home game for the [[NFL playoffs, 2008–09|2008 NFL playoffs]] that weekend (January 3–4); ironically, the Bears ended up being eliminated from contention in the last week. It was decided that the game would be played at [[Wrigley Field]], the [[Neighborhoods of Chicago#North Side|North Side]] home of the [[Chicago Cubs]], as confirmed by the ''[[Minneapolis Star-Tribune]]'' on July 6. Ten days afterward, the NHL confirmed the reports that the game would officially be held on New Year's Day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=368489 |title=Blackhawks, Red Wings meet in the great outdoors |publisher=NHL.com |date=July 16, 2008 |accessdate=July 26, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Faceoff was scheduled for 1&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (12 noon [[Central Time Zone|CST]]).  The Red Wings won the game 6–4.

===Trade deadline===
The NHL and [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) agreed to move the [[trade deadline]] from Tuesday, March 3, 2009, to Wednesday, March 4, 2009. This was done mainly because the schedule has twelve games on March 3 and only two on March 4.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=254055&lid=sublink07&lpos=headlines_main|title=NHL moves trade deadline back one day|accessdate=October 28, 2008|publisher=TSN.ca| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081031124401/http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=254055&lid=sublink07&lpos=headlines_main| archivedate= October 31, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===General Managers' Meeting===
At the meeting, held in [[Naples, Florida]] from March 9–11, 2009, general managers of the teams discussed issues that concerned them. Consensus on any topic would lead to action by the Board of Governors or the Competition committee in later meetings. Paul Kelly, president of the NHLPA, made a presentation on the topic of dangerous hits to the head, proposing new rules to penalize intentional hits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=413099&cmpid=rss |title=NHL Players' Association urges GM to consider penalizing hits to the head  |date=March 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 12, 2009 |publisher=NHL}}</ref> The general managers could not agree on the planned rule change and took no further action. Kelly intends to review the issue at the future Competition committee meeting, which is held after the Stanley Cup final. The general managers also discussed the topic of fighting in hockey, and agreed to penalize further players who start fights directly after face-offs and to further enforce the existing 'instigator' rule.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHL general managers acknowledge economic crisis |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=413373&cmpid=rss |date=March 11, 2009 |accessdate=March 12, 2009 |publisher=NHL}}</ref> The managers agreed to award a second-round [[NHL compensatory draft selection|compensatory pick]] in the [[2009 NHL Entry Draft|2009 entry draft]] to the [[New York Rangers]] due to the death of [[Alexei Cherepanov]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=413511&cmpid=rss-News%20in%20English |title=Rangers receive compensatory pick for Cherepanov |publisher=NHL |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=March 12, 2009}}</ref>

On November 3, 2008, in a game between the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] and the [[New York Islanders]], Islanders forward [[Chris Campoli]] scored twice in one overtime. First, Campoli retrieved a loose puck and fired a shot past Jacket's goaltender [[Fredrik Norrena]]. The shot went through the net and, while Campoli celebrated, the game continued. Campoli then received a pass in front of the goal and shot the puck again into the net.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081103.wspt_roundup03/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081103.wspt_roundup03 |title=Campoli gives Isles OT win |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |publisher=globesports.com |date=November 4, 2008 |accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref>

[[Tampa Bay Lightning]] head coach [[Barry Melrose]] would record his first win as a head coach in over 13 years on October 21, 2008, with a 3–2 victory over the [[Atlanta Thrashers]]. However, the Lightning did not get off to a great start as hoped, and Melrose was fired by the Lightning with a 5–7–4 record. [[Rick Tocchet]], who had been hired as assistant coach during the previous offseason, was promoted to interim head coach. Melrose subsequently re-signed with broadcaster [[ESPN]]. Melrose proceeded to get into a war of words with the Lightning management, accusing the management of interference during an interview on a Toronto radio station.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tampa takes first step up the mountain |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081211.wspttampa12/BNStory/GlobeSportsHockey/ |last=Gordon |first=Sean |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=December 16, 2008 |location=Toronto |work=Globe and Mail }}

On December 2, 2008, [[Carolina Hurricanes]]' head coach [[Peter Laviolette]] was fired and [[Paul Maurice]] was rehired in his place. [[Ron Francis]] became the team's associate head coach.

During the annual December board of governors' meeting, the issue of the state of the economy was raised. The [[Phoenix Coyotes]] were reported  to lose up to $35 million on the 2008–09 season. Asked to comment on Phoenix's loss, Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] was quoted as saying "They're going to get through the season just fine."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081209.wspt_nhlearly09/BNStory/GlobeSportsHockey/ |work=Globe and Mail |date=December 9, 2008 |last=Gordon |first=Sean |title=Optimism reigns despite economic woes |location=Toronto| accessdate=May 22, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The [[Buffalo Sabres]], while not for sale, had been approached for purchase.

On December 5, [[Sean Avery]] of the [[Dallas Stars]] was suspended six games for 'off-colour' remarks prior to a game against the [[Calgary Flames]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Avery handed six-game suspension by NHL  |publisher=NHL.com |url=http://stars.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=396356&page=NewsPage&service=page |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=December 16, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081224054910/http://stars.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=396356&page=NewsPage&service=page| archivedate= December 24, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref> On December 14, the Stars' management announced that he would not be returning to the team. After Avery's reinstatement by the league, he reported to the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]]. He was placed on re-entry waivers and was claimed by the [[New York Rangers]], his team in 2007–08.

On December 23, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported that the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] team is receiving financial assistance from the league in the form of advances on league revenues. The Coyotes have pledged all of their assets to New York company SOF Investments LP to cover an estimated debt of $80 million. The team has lost an estimated $200 million since 2001 and may lose $30 million this season. One of the team's owners, [[Jerry Moyes]]' principal source of revenue, Swift Transportation is also in financial difficulty.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081223.wsptcoyotes23/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081223.wsptcoyotes23 |title=globesports.com: Coyotes' financial situation gets uglier |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date=December 23, 2008 |accessdate=December 24, 2008 |last=Shoalts |first=David}}</ref> ESPN reported that the league has gotten involved with the operations of the Coyotes and their revenues. The NHL reportedly wants to work with the city of [[Glendale, Arizona]], which owns the arena and receives revenues from the team.

In February 2009, three head coaches were relieved from their duties. On February 1, [[Craig Hartsburg]] was fired as head coach of the [[Ottawa Senators]] following a 17–24–7 start to the season and was immediately replaced by [[Binghamton Senators]] head coach [[Cory Clouston]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/story/?id=265548&hubname=nhl-senators | title= Struggling Senators fire coach Hartsburg| date = February 1, 2009|accessdate =February 17, 2009|work=TSN}}</ref> On February 15, [[Dan Bylsma]] of the [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]] was promoted to replace [[Michel Therrien]] of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] as interim head coach.

In March, goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] returned to the [[New Jersey Devils]] after a long injury. He became the winningest goaltender in league history, surpassing the record of [[Patrick Roy]]. [[Guy Carbonneau]] was also fired as the head coach of the Canadiens when the team was in danger of being eliminated from the playoffs.

In April, the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. The [[Carolina Hurricanes]] qualified for the playoffs for the first time since their 2006 Stanley Cup victory. The [[Ottawa Senators]] missed the playoffs for the first time since the 1995–96 season.

In an ironic twist, considering his injury woes of past seasons, [[Jordan Leopold]] played in all 64 games for the [[Colorado Avalanche]].  Upon being traded to the [[Calgary Flames]] Leopold played in all 19 remaining games for the Flames becoming the only NHL player to play 83 games of the 82 game 2008–2009 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8467917&view=stats#&navid=nhl-keymatch |title=NHL.com – Players: Jordan Leopold, Flames – Stats |publisher =nhl.com | date = April 27, 2009 | accessdate =April 27, 2009}}</ref> [[Jacques Lemaire]] resigned as the first head coach of the [[Minnesota Wild]] on April 11 after missing the playoffs.

Scoring in the regular season improved somewhat from 2007–08, with an average of 5.7 goals scored per game (7,006 goals scored over 1,230 games).<ref>http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2009_skaters.html</ref> Goaltenders combined for 156 shutouts.<ref>http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2009_goalies.html</ref>

In May 2009, it was revealed that the NHL had taken control of the Phoenix Coyotes from the start of the season and had known of the financial difficulties of the team prior to the start of the 2008–09 season. After owner Jerry Moyes petitioned the club into bankruptcy against the league's wishes, so as to sell the team to [[Jim Balsillie]] who plans to move the team to [[Hamilton, Ontario]], the league challenged the right of Moyes to file for bankruptcy. In the documents filed with the Phoenix bankruptcy court, the NHL stated that the league took official control of the team on November 14, 2008. The league then began advancing money to the club from league revenues, and made a loan to the club in February 2009, for a combined estimated total of $44.5 million over the full season. During the season, commissioner Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly had made a series of denials and obfuscations, while firing the Coyotes CEO and laying off 18 Coyotes employees. Moyes' documents filed with the court indicated that the team had lost $73 million over the last three years, and that the projected loss was $45 million for 2008–09.<ref>{{cite news |work=Globe and Mail |date=May 14, 2009 |author=Shoalts, David |title=A Season of Contradictions |url=http://sports.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090514.wsptshoalts15/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20090514.wsptshoalts15 |location=Toronto| accessdate=May 22, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

After the regular season, the standard of 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The [[San Jose Sharks]] won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for having the best record in the league, at 117 points. Division champions maintain their relative ranking during the entire playoffs while the remaining teams get reseeded below them after each round.

====Eastern Conference====

===Playoff bracket===
In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice is determined based on regular season points. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team will play at home for games 1 and 2 (plus 5 and 7 if necessary), and the lower-seeded team will be at home for game 3, 4 and 6 (if necessary).
