The Arabian '''Sea''' (Also Persian Sea) is a region of the northern [[Indian Ocean]] bounded on the north by [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]], on the west by northeastern [[Somalia]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and on the east by [[India]]. Historically the sea has been known by other names including the [[Erythraean Sea]] and the Persian Sea. Its total area is {{convert|3862000|km2|sqmi|-3|abbr=on}} and its maximum depth is {{convert|4652|m|ft|0}}. The [[Gulf of Aden]] is in the southwest, connecting the Arabian Sea to the [[Red Sea]] through the strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], and the [[Gulf of Oman]] is in the northwest, connecting it to the [[Persian Gulf]].

The Arabian Sea has been crossed by important marine trade routes since the third or second millennium BCE. Major seaports include [[Jawaharlal Nehru Port]] in [[Mumbai]], the [[Port of Karachi]] and the [[Gwadar Port]] in [[Pakistan]] and the Port of Salalah in [[Oman]]. Other important ports include in India, [[Kandla|Kandla Port]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru Port]], [[Vizhinjam Port]], [[Trivandrum]], [[Mumbai Port]], and [[Mormugao]] in [[Goa]]. The largest islands in the Arabian Sea include [[Socotra]] (Yemen), [[Masirah Island]] (Oman), [[Astola Island]] (Pakistan) and [[Andrott]] (India).

==Geography==
[[File:Arabian Sea - October 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Arabian Sea from space]]
The Arabian Sea's surface area is about {{convert|3862000|km2|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31653/Arabian-Sea Arabian Sea], Encyclopædia Britannica</ref> The maximum width of the Sea is approximately {{convert|2400|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}, and its maximum depth is {{convert|4652|m|ft|0}}. The biggest river flowing into the Sea is the [[Indus River]].

The Arabian Sea has two important branches&nbsp;— the [[Gulf of Aden]] in the southwest, connecting with the [[Red Sea]] through the strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]]; and the [[Gulf of Oman]] to the northwest, connecting with the [[Persian Gulf]]. There are also the gulfs of [[Gulf of Khambhat|Khambhat]] and [[Gulf of Kutch|Kutch]] on the Indian coast.

==Trade routes==

The Arabian Sea has been an important [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[trade route]] since the era of the ''coastal sailing vessels'' from possibly as early as the 3rd millennium BCE, certainly the late 2nd millennium BCE through the later days known as the [[Age of Sail]]. By the time of [[Julius Caesar]], several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon [[water transport]] through the Sea around the rough inland [[terrain feature]]s to its north.
[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|left|thumb|Names, routes and locations of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']]
These routes usually began in the [[Far East]] or down river from [[Madhya Pradesh]] with [[transshipment]] via historic [[Bharuch]] (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's [[Iran]] then split around [[Hadhramaut]] into two streams north into the [[Gulf of Aden]] and thence into the [[Levant]], or south into [[Alexandria]] via [[Red Sea]] ports such as [[Axum]]. Each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan, travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates.

This southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern [[Arabian peninsula]] ([[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] today) was significant, and the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]]s built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's [[Suez canal]], and another from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Nile River]], both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge [[sand storm]]s in antiquity. Later the [[kingdom of Axum]] arose in [[Ethiopia]] to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with Europe via Alexandria.

===Major ports===
[[File:Container terminal.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Kochi Port]] located on the south-west coast of India is the nearest Indian port to the international shipping routes, as well as one of the largest and busiest ports serving the Arabian Sea. Seen here is the [[International Container Transshipment Terminal, Kochi|International Container Transshipment Terminal]], the only such facility in India.]]

[[Jawaharlal Nehru Port]] in [[Mumbai]] is the largest port in Arabian sea, and the largest container port in India.

The [[Port of Karachi]] (Urdu: بندر گاہ كراچى, ''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|Bandargāh-i Karācī}}'') is [[Pakistan]]'s largest and busiest seaport, handling about 60% of the nation's cargo (25 million tons per annum). It is located between the Karachi towns of [[Kiamari]] and [[Saddar]], close to the main business district and several industrial areas. The geographic position of the port places it in close proximity to major shipping routes such as the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. The history of the port is intertwined with that of the city of Karachi. Several ancient ports have been attributed in the area including "Krokola", "Morontobara" (Woman's Harbour) (mentioned by [[Nearchus]]), [[Barbarikon]] (the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], and [[Debal]] (a city invaded and captured by the Muslim general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] in 712 AD). There is a reference to the early existence of the port of Karachi in the "[[Umdah]]", by the Arab navigator [[Sulaiman al Mahri]] (AD 1511), who mentions "[[Ras al Karazi]]" and "[[Ras Karashi]]" while describing a route along the coast from [[Pasni City|Pasni]] to Ras Karashi.

Karachi is also mentioned in the sixteenth century [[Turkish language|Turkish]] treatise [[Mirat ul Memalik]] (Mirror of Countries, 1557) by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] captain [[Seydi Ali Reis]], which is a compilation of sailing directions from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] island of [[Diu Island|Diu]] to [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. It warns sailors about whirlpools and advises them to seek safety in "[[Kaurashi]]" harbour if they found themselves drifting dangerously.

The gate facing the sea was called "Kharadar" (salt gate), and the gate facing the [[Lyari River]] was called "[[Mithadar]]" (sweet gate). The modern neighbourhoods around the location of the gates are called [[Mithadar]] and Kharadar. Surrounded by mangrove swamps to the east, the sea to the southwest, and the [[Lyari River]] to the north, the town was well defended and engaged in a profitable trade with Muscat and Bahrain.

The [[Gwadar Port]] is a warm-water, deep-sea port situated at [[Gwadar]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan]] at the apex of the Arabian Sea and at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, about 460&nbsp;km west of [[Karachi]] and approximately 75&nbsp;km (47&nbsp;mi) east of Pakistan's border with [[Iran]]. The port is located on the eastern bay of a natural hammerhead-shaped peninsula jutting out into the Arabian Sea from the coastline.

[[Port of Salalah]] in [[Salalah]], [[Oman]] is also a major port in the area. From a modest start in 1997, the Omani container transhipment port has achieved consistent growth. For a growing number of ships’ crew, the port of Salalah is a welcome sight after an unpleasant and often prolonged encounter with pirates.
The [[Port of Salalah]] is a key container transhipment hub on the Arabian Sea and is often used as the first port of call for vessels whose crew have just been released from the clutches of [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]] following ransom payments for withheld vessels and crew.
The port also plays host as a supply base for the visiting warships that provide protective escorts for merchant shipping in the sea lanes.
From that dual role has emerged another, one as an intelligence network&nbsp;— both military and civilian&nbsp;— to exchange information on possible pirate sightings and near misses.  Also, the International Task Force often uses the port as a base. There is a significant number of warships of all nations coming in and out of the port, which makes it a very safe bubble. The port handled just under 3.5m teu{{clarify|date=December 2012}} in 2009<ref>[http://www.portofsalalah.com/port_news_item.aspx?id=16655 Salalah’s versatility beats the slump], Port of Salalah</ref>

Major [[India]]n ports in the Arabian Sea are [[Kandla Port]], [[Nava Sheva]], [[Trivandrum]], [[Mumbai Port]], and  [[Mormugão]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shipping.gov.in/writereaddata/l892s/7yearsTRAFFIC-42175832.pdf|format=PDF|title=TRAFFIC HANDLED AT MAJOR PORTS (LAST 7 YEARS)|website=shipping.gov.in}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%202009.pdf|format=PDF|title=WORLD PORT RANKINGS|year=2009|website=aapa.files.cms-plus.com}}</ref>

==Islands==
There are several islands in the Arabian Sea, with the largest being [[Socotra]] ([[Yemen]]), [[Masirah]] ([[Oman]]), [[Astola Island]] ([[Pakistan]]) and [[Andrott]] ([[India]]).

[[File:Astola Island.jpg|thumb|left|[[Astola Island|Astola]] is a Pakistani island just off the coast of [[Balochistan, Pakistan]]]]
'''Astola Island''', also known as ''Jezira Haft Talar'' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جزیرہ ہفت تلار}}}}) or 'Island of the Seven Hills', is a small, uninhabited island in the northern tip of the Arabian Sea in [[Pakistan]]'s territorial waters. It is a popular [[eco-tourism]] destination in the region. Overnight tourists camp on the island and bring their own provisions. Camping, fishing and scuba-diving expeditions are popular. It is also a site for observing turtle breeding. Endangered animals such as the [[Green sea turtle|green turtle]] (''Chelonia mydas'') and the [[Hawksbill turtle]] (''Eretmochelys imbracata'') nest on the beach at the foot of the cliffs. The island is also a very important area for endemic reptiles such as the Astola [[Viperidae|Viper]] (''Echis carinatus astolae'').

[[File:Socotra satview.jpg|thumb|right|Landsat view over [[Socotra]], a Yemeni island.]]
'''Socotra''' ({{lang-ar|سُقُطْرَى}} ''{{transl|ar|Suquṭra}}''), also spelled '''Soqotra''', is the largest island, being part of a small [[archipelago]] of four islands. It lies some {{convert|240|km|mi}} east of the [[Horn of Africa]] and {{convert|380|km|mi}} south of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The island is very isolated and through the process of [[speciation]], a third of its plant life is found nowhere else on the planet. It has been described as the most alien-looking place on Earth.

'''Masirah''' ({{lang-ar|مصيرة}}) is an island off the East coast of [[Oman]].  The main industries here are [[fishing]] and traditional textile manufacturing. Formerly, traditional ship building was important. The rugged terrain of the island and surrounding rough coastline has led to the appearance of many wrecked [[dhow]]s on the beaches of the island, most of them well preserved by the salt water and intense heat.  The ocean bottom environment surrounding Masirah is hostile as the majority of the area is covered in either sand or hard rock. Despite the poor quality ocean bottom, the area is very productive with marine fisheries, and any hard objects (barrels, engines) are immediately colonized by local fauna.
