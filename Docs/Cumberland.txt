'''Cumberland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|m|b|əl|ən|d}} {{respell|KUM|bə-lənd}}; [[Cumbrian dialect|locally]] {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊ|m|b|əl|ən|d}} {{respell|KUUM|bə-lənd}}) is a [[historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[North West England]] that had an administrative function from the 12th century until 1974. It was bordered by [[Northumberland]] to the east, [[County Durham]] to the southeast, [[Westmorland]] and [[Lancashire]] to the south, and [[Dumfriesshire]] in [[Scotland]] to the north. It formed an [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] from 1889 to 1974 (excluding Carlisle from 1914) and now forms part of [[Cumbria]]. (In rhotic varieties of English,<ref>http://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/Cumberland</ref> the pronunciation is kəmbərlənd, that is, with a plain "r" sound in the middle syllable.)

==Early history ==
The first record of the term "Cumberland" appears in 945, when the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded that the area was ceded to [[Malcolm I of Scotland]] by King [[Edmund I of England|Edmund of England]]. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086 most of the future county remained part of Scotland although some villages in the ancient district of Millom, which were the possessions of the [[Earl of Northumbria]], were included in the [[Yorkshire]] section with the [[Furness]] region.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Kingdom of the Scots: Government, Church and Society from the Eleventh to the Fourteenth Century, 2nd edition |last=Barrow |first=G W S |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-7486-1803-1 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

In 1092 King [[William Rufus]] of England invaded the Carlisle district, settling it with colonists. He created an Earldom of Carlisle, and granted the territory to [[Ranulf le Meschin|Ranulf Meschyn]]. In 1133 Carlisle was made the see of a new [[Diocese of Carlisle|diocese]], identical with the area of the earldom. However, on the death of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] in 1135, the area was regained by Scotland's [[David I of Scotland|King David I]]. He was able to consolidate his power and made Carlisle one of his chief seats of government, while England descended into a lengthy [[The Anarchy|civil war]]. In 1157 [[Henry II of England]] resumed possession of the area from [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]], and formed two new counties from the former earldom: [[Westmorland]] and "Carliol". The silver-mining area of [[Alston Moor|Alston]], previously associated with the [[Liberty of Durham]], was also added to the new county of Carliol for financial reasons.<ref>''Carlisle Diocese: History and Description'' in "CCEd, the [[Clergy of the Church of England database]]" (Accessed [http://theclergydatabase.org.uk/reference/diocesan-resources/a-z-list-of-dioceses/carlisle-diocese-resources/carlisle-diocese-history-and-description/ online], 2 February 2014)</ref> By 1177 the county of Carliol was known as Cumberland.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cambridge County Geographies: Cumberland |last=Marr |first=J E |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1910 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> The border between England and Scotland was made permanent by the [[Treaty of York]] in 1237.

==Boundaries and subdivisions==
The boundaries formed in the 12th century did not change substantially over the county's existence. It bordered four English counties and two Scottish counties. These were [[Northumberland]] and [[County Durham]] to the east; [[Westmorland]] to the south, the [[Furness]] part of [[Lancashire]] to the southwest; [[Dumfriesshire]] to the north and [[Roxburghshire]] to the northeast.

To the west the county was bounded by the [[Solway Firth]] and the [[Irish Sea]]. The northern boundary was formed by the [[Solway Firth|Solway Estuary]] and the border with Scotland running east to Scotch Knowe at Kershope Burn. The boundary ran south from Scotch Knowe along the [[Cheviot Hills]], then followed a tributary of the [[River Irthing]] and crossed Denton Fell to the [[River Tees]]. From Tees Head the boundary crossed the [[Pennines]] to descend Crowdundale Beck, from where it followed the [[River Eden, Cumbria|rivers Eden]] and [[River Eamont|Eamont]] to the centre of [[Ullswater]]. The line then followed the Glencoin Beck to the top of the [[Helvellyn]] ridge, thence to [[Wrynose Pass]] and along the [[River Duddon]] to the sea near [[Millom]].

The highest point of the county was [[Scafell Pike]], at 3,208 feet (978 m) the highest mountain in England. [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] was the [[county town]].

===Division into wards===
[[File:Gray1824.cumberland.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of Cumberland showing wards, 1824]] The Earldom of Carlisle was divided into baronies, but on the creation of the county these were replaced by [[ward (politics)|ward]]s. These took the place of [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s found in most other English counties, and originated in military subdivisions organised for the defence of the county from incursions by Scottish troops.<ref>{{cite web |author=W L Warren |authorlink=W. L. Warren |title=The Myth of Norman Administrative Efficiency: The Prothero Lecture |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0080-4401%281984%295%3A34%3C113%3ATMONAE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C |year=1984 |work=''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', 5th Ser., Vol. 34 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |accessdate=19 June 2009}}</ref> Each ward was composed of a number of parishes, areas originally formed for ecclesiastical administration. In common with other counties of northern England, many parishes in Cumberland were very large, often consisting of a number of distinct townships and hamlets. Many of these subdivisions were eventually to become [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es and form the lowest level of local government.
The wards and their constituent parishes in 1821 were:<ref>{{cite book |last=Youngs |first= Frederic A, Jr. |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol.2: Northern England |year=1991 |publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]] |location=London |isbn=0-86193-127-0 |pages=648–649}}{{cite book |last=Whillier |first= Thomas |title=A General Directory to all the Counties, Hundreds, Ridings, Wapentakes, Divisions, Cities, Boroughs, Liberties, Parishes, Townships, Tythings, Hamlets, Precincts, Chapelries &c. &c. in England |year=1825 |publisher=Joseph Butterworth & Son |location=London |isbn= |pages=28–31}}</ref>

† Parts or all of these parishes and townships constituted the City of Carlisle, and were largely outside the jurisdiction of Cumberland Ward.

=== Ward of Cumberland ===
The [[ward (politics)|ward]] of '''Cumberland''' was one of the ancient divisions of the [[historic counties of England|historic county]] of Cumberland, [[England]].  In most other counties these divisions were called [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]] or [[Wapentakes]].

The ward included [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and [[Wigton]] and took in parts of [[Inglewood Forest]].  It was bounded on the north and east by [[Eskdale (ward)|Eskdale]] Ward, on the south by [[Leath]] Ward and the west by [[Allerdale-below-Derwent]] Ward.

The [[parish]] of [[Stanwix]] just to the north of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] was partly in both Eskdale and Cumberland wards.

==Local government from the 19th century==
During the 19th century a series of reforms reshaped the local government of the county, creating a system of districts with directly-elected councils.

===Poor law and municipal reform===
[[File:Cumberland Lewis.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of Cumberland in 1845 showing poor law unions and parliamentary divisions]]
The first changes concerned the administration of the [[poor law]], which was carried at parish level. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] provided for the grouping of parishes into [[poor law union]]s, each with a central [[workhouse]] and an elected [[board of guardians]]. Cumberland was divided into nine unions: Alston with Garrigill, Bootle, Brampton, Carlisle, Cockermouth, Longtown, Penrith, Whitehaven and Wigton.

In the following year the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] was passed, reforming boroughs and cities in [[England and Wales]] as [[municipal borough]]s with a uniform constitution. The corporation of the City of Carlisle was accordingly remodelled with a popularly elected council consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors.

===Local boards and sanitary districts===

Outside of municipal boroughs, there was no effective local government until the 1840s. In response to poor sanitary conditions and outbreaks of [[cholera]], the Public Health Act 1848 and the Local Government Act 1858 allowed for the formation of [[local board of health|local boards of health]] in populous areas. Local boards were responsible ''[[inter alia]]'' for water supply, drainage, sewerage, paving and cleansing. Eleven local boards were initially formed at Brampton, Cleator Moor, Cockermouth, Egremont, Holme Cultram, Keswick, Maryport, Millom, Penrith, Whitehaven, Wigton and Workington.

Further reform under the Public Health Act 1875 saw the creation of [[sanitary district]]s throughout England and Wales. The existing municipal boroughs and local boards became "urban sanitary districts", while "rural sanitary districts" were formed from the remaining areas of the poor law unions.

Three more local boards were formed: Arlecdon and Frizington in 1882, Harrington in 1891 and Aspatria in 1892. In addition Workington and Whitehaven received charters of incorporation to become municipal boroughs in 1883 and 1894 respectively.

===Local government acts of 1888 and 1894===
{{Main|Cumberland County Council, England}}
In 1889, under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], the [[Cumberland County Council, England|Cumberland County Council]] was created as the [[county council]] for Cumberland, taking over administrative functions from the Court of [[Quarter Sessions]]. The [[Local Government Act 1894]] reconstituted the existing sanitary districts as [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] and [[rural district]]s, each with an elected council.

The Act of 1888 also allowed any municipal borough with a population of 50,000 people or more to become a "[[county borough]]", independent of county council control. In 1914, Carlisle successfully applied for this status, ceasing to form part of the [[administrative county]], although remaining within Cumberland for the purposes such as [[Lord Lieutenant|Lieutenancy]] and [[High Sheriff|shrievalty]].

===Reform in 1934===

The [[Local Government Act 1929]] imposed the duty on county councils of reviewing the districts within their administrative county so as to form more efficient units of local government. In general, this meant the merging of small or lightly populated areas into larger units. A review was carried in Cumberland in 1934. The following table lists the urban and rural districts before and after the changes.

In 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the administrative county and county borough were abolished and their former area was combined with [[Westmorland]] and parts of [[Lancashire]] and the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] to form the new county of [[Cumbria]]. The area from Cumberland went on to form the districts of [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Allerdale]], [[Copeland, Cumbria|Copeland]] and part of [[Eden, Cumbria|Eden]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Local government in England and Wales: A Guide to the New System |year=1974 |publisher=[[HMSO]] |location=London |isbn=0-11-750847-0 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Cumberland flag.svg|right|thumb|The [[flag of Cumberland]], adopted in 2012]]
The name continues in use as a geographical and cultural term, and it survives in [[Cumberland sausages]]; [[HMS Cumberland (F85)|HMS ''Cumberland'']], which was nicknamed "the fighting sausage"; [[Cumberland County Cricket Club]]; the Cumberland Fell Runners Club; the Cumberland Athletics Club; and various organisations and companies, such as the local newspapers ''The Cumberland News'', and ''The West Cumberland Times and Star'', and the [[Cumberland Building Society]].

In June 1994, during the [[1990s UK local government reform]], the Local Government Commission published draft recommendations, suggesting as one option a North Cumbria [[unitary authority]] (also including [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]], the historic county town of Westmorland).  It also suggested that Cumberland could be reinstated as an independent [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]].  The final recommendations, published in October 1994, did not include such recommendations, apparently due to lack of expression of support for the proposal to the commission.

As part of a 2002 marketing campaign, the plant conservation charity [[Plantlife]] chose the [[Parnassia palustris|Grass-of-Parnassus]] as the [[county flower]]. Parnassus flowers had been associated with the county since 1951, when they were included in the [[coat of arms]] granted to the Cumberland County Council. They subsequently featured in the arms granted to Cumbria County Council and [[Copeland, Cumbria|Copeland Borough Council]], in both cases to represent Cumberland.

In 2012, a flag based on the arms of the former Cumberland County Council was registered as the [[flag of Cumberland]] with the [[Flag Institute]].
