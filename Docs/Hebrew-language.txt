The second stage begins with the ''[[Amoraim]]'' and sees RH being replaced by Aramaic as the spoken vernacular, surviving only as a literary language.

[[Modern Hebrew]] is one of the two [[official language]]s of Israel (the other being [[Modern Standard Arabic]]), while premodern Hebrew is used for prayer or study in [[Jews|Jewish]] communities around the world today. Ancient Hebrew is also the liturgical tongue of the [[Samaritans]], while modern Hebrew or Arabic is their vernacular. As a foreign language, it is studied mostly by Jews and students of Judaism and Israel, and by archaeologists and linguists specializing in the [[Middle East]] and its civilizations, as well as by theologians in Christian seminaries.

The [[Torah]] (the first five books), and most of the rest of the [[Hebrew Bible]], is written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with much of its present form specifically in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, around the time of the [[Babylonian captivity]]. For this reason, Hebrew has been referred to by Jews as ''{{transl|he|[[Leshon Hakodesh]]}}'' ({{lang|he|לשון הקדש}}), "the Holy Language", since ancient times.

== Etymology ==
The modern word "Hebrew" is derived from the word "Ibri" (plural "Ibrim"), one of several names for the Israelite (Jewish and Samaritan) people. It is traditionally understood to be an adjective based on the name of Abraham's ancestor, [[Eber]] ("Ebr" {{lang|he|עבר}} in Hebrew), mentioned in {{bibleref2|Genesis|10:21}}. This name is possibly based upon the root "ʕ-b-r" ({{lang|he|עבר}}) meaning "to cross over". Interpretations of the term "ʕibrim" link it to this verb; cross over and [[Homiletics|homiletical]] or the people who crossed over the river [[Euphrates]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=12606 |title=הספריה של מט"ח |publisher=Lib.cet.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref>

In the Bible, the Hebrew language is called ''{{transl|he|Yәhudit}}'' ({{lang|he|יהודית}}) because [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (''{{transl|he|Yәhuda}}'') was the surviving kingdom at the time of the quotation (late 8th century BCE (Is 36, 2 Kings 18)). In {{bibleref2|Isaiah|19:18}} it is called the "Language of Canaan" ({{lang|he|שפת כנען)}}.

== History ==
Hebrew belongs to the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite group of languages]]. In turn, the Canaanite languages are a branch of the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] family of languages.<ref>Ross, Allen P. Introducing Biblical Hebrew, Baker Academic, 2001.</ref>

According to [[Avraham ben-Yosef]], Hebrew flourished as a spoken language in the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdoms of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] during about 1200 to 586 BCE.<ref>
אברהם בן יוסף ,מבוא לתולדות הלשון העברית (Avraham ben-Yosef, Introduction to the History of the Hebrew Language), page  38, אור-עם, Tel-Aviv, 1981.</ref> Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew was a spoken vernacular in ancient times following the [[Babylonian exile]], when the predominant international language in the region was [[Old Aramaic]].

Hebrew was nearly extinct as a spoken language by [[Late Antiquity]], but it continued to be used as a literary language and as the liturgical language of Judaism, evolving various dialects of literary [[Medieval Hebrew]], until its [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revival as a spoken language]] in the late 19th century.

=== Oldest Hebrew inscriptions ===
In July 2008 Israeli archaeologist [[Yosef Garfinkel|Yossi Garfinkel]] discovered a ceramic shard at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]] which he claimed may be the earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, dating around 3000 years ago.<ref>BBC News, 30 October 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7700037.stm 'Oldest Hebrew script' is found], Retrieved 3 March 2010</ref><ref>Mail Online, 31 October 2008, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1081850/Proof-David-slew-Goliath-Israeli-archaeologists-unearth-oldest-Hebrew-text.html Daily Mail], Retrieved 3 March 2010</ref> Hebrew University archaeologist Amihai Mazar said that the inscription was “proto-Canaanite" but cautioned that, "The differentiation between the scripts, and between the languages themselves in that period, remains unclear,” and suggested that calling the text Hebrew might be going too far.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/have-israeli-archaeologists-found-world-s-oldest-hebrew-inscription-1.256305 Haaretz, 30.10.08, Retrieved 8 November 2010] {{wayback|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/have-israeli-archaeologists-found-world-s-oldest-hebrew-inscription-1.256305 |date=20110806071612 }}</ref>

The [[Gezer calendar]] also dates back to the 10th century BCE at the beginning of the Monarchic Period, the traditional time of the reign of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. Classified as Archaic Biblical Hebrew, the calendar presents a list of seasons and related agricultural activities. The [[Gezer]] calendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] one that through the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] later became the [[Roman script]]. The Gezer calendar is written without any vowels, and it does not use [[Mater lectionis|consonants to imply vowels]] even in the places where later Hebrew spelling requires it.

[[File:Silwan-inscr.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Shebna Inscription]], from the tomb of a royal steward found in [[Siloam]], dates to the 7th century BCE.]]
Numerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example [[Protosinaitic]]. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back to [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the [[acrophonic]] principle. The common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is called [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], and was the first to use a Semitic alphabet distinct from Egyptian. One ancient document is the famous [[Moabite Stone]] written in the Moabite dialect; the [[Siloam Inscription]], found near [[Jerusalem]], is an early example of Hebrew. Less ancient samples of Archaic Hebrew include the [[ostracon|ostraca]] found near [[Lachish]] which describe events preceding the final capture of Jerusalem by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] and the Babylonian captivity of 586 BCE.

=== Biblical Hebrew ===
{{main|Biblical Hebrew}}
In its widest sense, Biblical Hebrew means the spoken language of ancient Israel flourishing between the 10th century BCE and the turn of the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]].<ref name="dvbrbw">[http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_36.pdf William M. Schniedewind, "Prolegomena for the Sociolinguistics of Classical Hebrew", The Journal of Hebrew Scriptures vol. 5 article 6] {{wayback|url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_36.pdf |date=20140712201335 }}</ref> It comprises several evolving and overlapping dialects. The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works associated with them.
* [[Archaic Biblical Hebrew]] from the 10th to the 6th century BCE, corresponding to the Monarchic Period until the Babylonian Exile and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanach]]), notably the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). Also called Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew. It was written in a form of the [[Phoenician alphabet|Canaanite script]].  (A script descended from this is still used by the [[Samaritans]], see [[Samaritan Hebrew language]].)
[[File:Sefer-torah-vayehi-binsoa.jpg|thumb|Hebrew script used in writing a Torah scroll. Note ornamental "crowns" on tops of certain letters.]]
* [[Biblical Hebrew|Standard Biblical Hebrew]] around the 8th to 6th centuries BCE, corresponding to the late Monarchic period and the Babylonian Exile. It is represented by the bulk of the Hebrew Bible that attains much of its present form around this time. Also called Biblical Hebrew, Early Biblical Hebrew, Classical Biblical Hebrew (or Classical Hebrew in the narrowest sense).
* [[Late Biblical Hebrew]], from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BCE, that corresponds to the Persian Period and is represented by certain texts in the [[Hebrew Bible]], notably the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Basically similar to Classical Biblical Hebrew, apart from a few foreign words adopted for mainly governmental terms, and some syntactical innovations such as the use of the particle ''shel'' (of, belonging to). It adopted the [[Aramaic alphabet|Imperial Aramaic script]] (from which the modern Hebrew script descends).
* [[Israelian Hebrew]] is a proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew, attested in all eras of the language, in some cases competing with late biblical Hebrew as an explanation for non-standard linguistic features of biblical texts.
* [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Scroll]] Hebrew from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, corresponding to the Hellenistic and Roman Periods before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and represented by the Qumran Scrolls that form most (but not all) of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Commonly abbreviated as DSS Hebrew, also called Qumran Hebrew. The Imperial Aramaic script of the earlier scrolls in the 3rd century BCE evolved into the [[Hebrew square script]] of the later scrolls in the 1st century CE, also known as ''ketav Ashuri'' (Assyrian script), still in use today.
* [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] from the 1st to the 3rd or 4th century CE, corresponding to the Roman Period after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and represented by the bulk of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]] within the [[Talmud]] and by the Dead Sea Scrolls, notably the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba]] letters and the [[Copper Scroll]]. Also called Tannaitic Hebrew or Early Rabbinic Hebrew.

Sometimes the above phases of spoken Classical Hebrew are simplified into "Biblical Hebrew" (including several dialects from the 10th century BCE to 2nd century BCE and extant in certain Dead Sea Scrolls) and "Mishnaic Hebrew" (including several dialects from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE and extant in certain other Dead Sea Scrolls).<ref name=Segal>M. Segal, ''A Grammar of Mishnaic Hebrew'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927).</ref> However, today, most Hebrew linguists classify Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew as a set of dialects evolving out of Late Biblical Hebrew and into Mishnaic Hebrew, thus including elements from both but remaining distinct from either.<ref name=Qimron>Elisha Qimron, ''The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Harvard Semitic Studies 29 (Atlanta: Scholars Press 1986).</ref> By the start of the Byzantine Period in the 4th century CE, Classical Hebrew ceases as a regularly spoken language, roughly a century after the publication of the Mishnah, apparently declining since the aftermath of the catastrophic [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba War]] around 135 CE.

Around the 6th century BCE, the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] conquered the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]], destroying much of [[Jerusalem]] and exiling its population far to the East in [[Babylon]]. During the [[Babylonian captivity]], many [[Israelites]] learned Aramaic, the closely related Semitic language of their captors. Thus for a significant period, the [[Jewish]] elite became influenced by Aramaic.<ref>Nicholas Ostler, ''Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World'', Harper Perennial, London, New York, Toronto, Sydney 2006 p80</ref>

After [[Cyrus the Great]] conquered Babylon, he allowed the Jewish people to return from captivity. As a result, {{synthesis inline|date=September 2015}} a local version of Aramaic came to be spoken in Israel alongside Hebrew. By the beginning of the [[Common Era]], Aramaic was the primary colloquial language of [[Samaria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Galilee]]an Jews, and western and intellectual Jews spoke [[Greek language|Greek]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} but a form of so-called [[Rabbinic Hebrew]] continued to be used as a vernacular in Judea until it was displaced by Aramaic, probably in the 3rd century CE. Certain [[Sadducees|Sadducee]], [[Pharisees|Pharisee]], [[Scribe#Judaism|Scribe]], Hermit, Zealot and Priest classes maintained an insistence on Hebrew, and all Jews maintained their identity with Hebrew songs and simple quotations from Hebrew texts.<ref name="Sáenz-Badillos 1996.

The languages of Israel: policy, ideology and practice. P.9</ref><ref name=Fernandez/>

While there is no doubt that at a certain point, Hebrew was displaced as the everyday spoken language of most Jews, and that its chief successor in the Middle East was the closely related Aramaic language, then [[Greek language|Greek]],<ref name="Spolsky P.9"/>{{refn|name="Sáenz-BadillosRH"|group="note"}} scholarly opinions on the exact dating of that shift have changed very much.<ref name=OxfordDictionaryChristianChurch>"Hebrew" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', edit. F.L. Cross, first edition (Oxford, 1958), 3rd edition (Oxford 1997). ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' which once said, in 1958 in its first edition, that Hebrew "ceased to be a spoken language around the fourth century BCE", now says, in its 1997 (third) edition, that Hebrew "continued to be used as a spoken and written language in the New Testament period".</ref> In the first half of the 20th century, most scholars followed Geiger and Dalman in thinking that Aramaic became a spoken language in the land of Israel as early as the beginning of Israel's [[History of Palestine#Hellenic kingdoms period|Hellenistic Period]] in the 4th century BCE, and that as a corollary Hebrew ceased to function as a spoken language around the same time. Segal, Klausner, and Ben Yehuda are notable exceptions to this view. During the latter half of the 20th century, accumulating archaeological evidence and especially linguistic analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls has disproven that view. The Dead Sea Scrolls, uncovered in 1946-1948 near [[Qumran]] revealed ancient Jewish texts overwhelmingly in Hebrew, not Aramaic.

The Qumran scrolls indicate that Hebrew texts were readily understandable to the average Israelite, and that the language had evolved since Biblical times as spoken languages do.{{refn|Fernández & Elwolde: "It is generally believed that the Dead Sea Scrolls, specifically the Copper Scroll and also the Bar Kokhba letters, have furnished clear evidence of the popular character of MH [Mishnaic Hebrew]."<ref>''An Introductory Grammar of Rabbinic Hebrew'' (Fernández & Elwolde 1999, p.2)</ref>|group="note"}} Recent scholarship recognizes that reports of Jews speaking in Aramaic indicates a multilingual society, not necessarily the primary language spoken.

Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century. P.3</ref> It continued on as a literary language down through the [[History of Palestine#Byzantine period|Byzantine Period]] from the 4th century CE.

The exact roles of Aramaic and Hebrew remain hotly debated. A trilingual scenario has been proposed for the land of Israel. Hebrew functioned as the local [[mother tongue]] with powerful ties to Israel's history, origins, and golden age and as the language of Israel's religion;  Aramaic functioned as the international language with the rest of the Middle East; and eventually Greek functioned as another international language with the eastern areas of the Roman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}<!--Refers to the entire "role distribution" indicated above.--> According to another summary, Greek was the language of government, Hebrew the language of prayer, study and religious texts, and Aramaic was the language of legal contracts and trade.<ref name=spolsky/> There was also a geographic pattern: according to Spolsky, by the beginning of the Common Era, "[[Judeo-Aramaic]] was mainly used in Galilee in the north, Greek was concentrated in the former colonies and around governmental centers, and Hebrew monolingualism continued mainly in the southern villages of Judea."<ref name="Spolsky P.9"/> In other words, "in terms of dialect geography, at the time of the tannaim Palestine could be divided into the Aramaic-speaking regions of Galilee and Samaria and a smaller area, Judaea, in which [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Rabbinic Hebrew]] was used among the descendants of returning exiles."<ref name="Sáenz-Badillos 1996.

The term "Mishnaic Hebrew" generally refers to the Hebrew dialects found in the [[Talmud]], excepting quotations from the Hebrew Bible. The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also called [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew I), which was a [[spoken language]], and [[Amora]]ic Hebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a [[literary language]]. The earlier section of the Talmud is the [[Mishnah]] that was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and was written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered  to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the [[Midrash halakha|halachic]] [[Midrash]]im ([[Sifra]], [[Sifre]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mechilta]] etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the [[Tosefta]]. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is ''[[Baraita|Baraitot]]''. The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.

About a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. The later section of the Talmud, the [[Gemara]], generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later [[Amora]]ic Hebrew, which sometimes occurs in the text of the Gemara.

Because as early as the Torah's transcription the Scribe has been the highest position in Judaism, Hebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel's religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries.<ref>[http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html Languages of the World (Hebrew)] {{wayback|url=http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html |date=20090117194849 }}</ref> After the 2nd century CE when the [[Roman Empire]] exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry, and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.

=== Medieval Hebrew ===

After the Talmud, various regional literary dialects of [[Medieval Hebrew]] evolved. The most important is [[Tiberian Hebrew]] or Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect of [[Tiberias]] in [[Galilee]] that became the standard for vocalizing the [[Hebrew Bible]] and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called "Biblical Hebrew" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the remarkable scholarship of the [[Masoretes]] (from ''masoret'' meaning "tradition"), who added [[niqqud|vowel points]] and [[Cantillation|grammar points]] to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. The [[Syriac alphabet]], precursor to the [[Arabic alphabet]], also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. The [[Aleppo Codex]], a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely in [[Tiberias]], and survives to this day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.

During the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]], important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the [[Islamic grammatical tradition|grammarians]] of [[Classical Arabic]].  Important Hebrew grammarians were [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]], [[Jonah ibn Janah]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]<ref>Abraham ibn Ezra, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/19685 ''Hebrew Grammar''], Venice 1546 (Hebrew)</ref> and later (in Provence) [[David Kimhi]].  A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as [[Dunash ben Labrat]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Judah ha-Levi]] and the two [[Ibn Ezra (disambiguation)|Ibn Ezra]]s, in a "purified" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters.  This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.<ref>T. Carmi, ''Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse''.</ref>

The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from [[Classical Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Medieval Arabic]] motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by the [[Ibn Tibbon]] family. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.) Another important influence was [[Maimonides]], who developed a simple style based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] for use in his law code, the [[Mishneh Torah]].  Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.

Hebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses—not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been, of course, many deviations from this generalization such as [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]]'s letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic,<ref>Safrai, Shmuel, Shemuel Safrai, M. Stern. 1976. The Jewish people in the first century. P.1036</ref> and [[Maimonides]]' writings, which were mostly in [[Arabic]];<ref>Fox, Marvin. 1995. Interpreting Maimonides. P.326</ref> but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of  the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi [[Avraham Danzig]] wrote the ''[[Chayei Adam]]'' in Hebrew, as opposed to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], as a guide to ''[[Halacha]]'' for the "''average'' 17-year old" (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, the [[Chofetz Chaim]],  Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]]’s  purpose in writing the ''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' was to “produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute”.  The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, “the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble.”<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=onNwsw0akyoC&pg=PR14&lpg=PR14&dq=mishnah+berurah+written+in+simple+hebrew#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Mishnah B'rurah - Israel Meir (ha-Kohen), Aharon Feldman, Aviel Orenstein - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-03|isbn=9780873061988|year=1980}}</ref>

=== Revival ===
{{Main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}
Hebrew has been revived several times as a literary language, most significantly by the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. Near the end of that century the Jewish activist [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], owing to the ideology of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] (''Shivat Tziyon'' [({{lang|he|שיבת ציון}})], later [[Zionism]]), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the [[Second Aliyah]], it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including [[Judaeo-Spanish]] (also called "Judezmo" and "Ladino"), Yiddish, [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]], and [[Bukhori dialect|Bukhori]] (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the [[Jewish diaspora]] such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

The major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as [[neologism]]s from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declared [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.

In the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variously ''Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Hebrew'', ''New Hebrew'', ''Israeli Standard Hebrew'', ''Standard Hebrew'', and so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features of [[Sephardic Hebrew]] from its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.

[[File:Eliezer Ben-Yehuda at his desk in Jerusalem - c1912.jpg|thumb|[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]]]
The literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew, ''[[Hameassef]]'' (The Gatherer), was published by [[Maskilim literati]] in [[Königsberg]] (today's [[Kaliningrad]]) from 1783 onwards.<ref>[[Shalom Spiegel]],''Hebrew Reborn'',(1930) Meridian Books reprint 1962, New York p.56</ref> In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g. ''[[HaMagid]]'', founded in [[Ełk]] in 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets were [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]]; there were also novels written in the language.

The [[revival of the Hebrew language]] as a [[first language|mother tongue]] was initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. He joined the [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and in 1881 immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] "[[shtetl]]" lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the [[literary language|literary]] and [[sacred language|liturgical language]] into everyday [[spoken language]]. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in [[Eastern Europe]] by different grammar and style, in the writings of people like [[Ahad Ha'am]] and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the [[vernacular]]ization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904-1914 [[Second Aliyah]] that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in [[phonology]], was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.

While many saw his work as fanciful or even [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]<ref>[http://www.jewishmag.com/43mag/ben-yehuda/ben-yehuda.htm Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Resurgence of the Hebrew Language] by Libby Kantorwitz</ref> (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (''The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew''). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of the [[Yishuv|Old Yishuv]] and a very few [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] sects, most notably those under the auspices of [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.

In the [[Soviet Union]], the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew "reactionary" since it was associated with [[Zionism]], and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] as early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming to [[secularization|secularize]] education (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |title=The Transformation of Jewish Culture in the USSR from 1930 to the Present (in Russian) |publisher=Jewish-heritage.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref>).

Later in the 1980s in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], Hebrew studies reappeared due to people struggling for permission to go to Israel ([[refusenik]]s). Several of the teachers were imprisoned, e.g. [[Iosif Begun|Yosef Begun]], [[Ephraim Kholmyansky]], [[Yevgeny Korostyshevsky]] and others responsible for a Hebrew learning network connecting many cities of the USSR.

[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language Hebrew and English keyboard]]
Standard Hebrew, as developed by [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], was based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Mishnaic]] spelling and [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation.  However, the earliest speakers of Modern Hebrew had Yiddish as their native language and often brought into Hebrew idioms and [[calque]]s from Yiddish.

The pronunciation of modern Israeli Hebrew is based mostly on the Sephardic Hebrew pronunciation. However, the language has adapted to [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] [[phonology]] in some respects, mainly the following:

* the elimination of [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal articulation]] in the letters ''chet'' (<big>{{Hebrew|[[ח]]}}</big>) and ''ayin'' ({{nbsp}}<big>{{Hebrew|[[ע]]}}</big>) by many speakers.
* the conversion of (<big>[[Resh|{{Hebrew|ר}}]]</big>) {{IPA|/r/}} from an [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} to a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} or [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}, by most of the speakers, like in most varieties of standard German or Yiddish. ''see [[Guttural R]]''
* the pronunciation (by many speakers) of ''[[Zeire|tzere]]'' {{Hebrew| ֵ }} as {{IPA|[eɪ]}} in some contexts (''sifréj'' and ''téjša'' instead of Sephardic ''sifré'' and ''tésha'')
* the partial elimination of vocal ''[[Shva]]'' {{Hebrew| ְ }} (''zmán'' instead of Sephardic ''zĕman'')<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Rosén|title=A Textbook of Israeli Hebrew|year=1966|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago & London|isbn=0-226-72603-7|pages=0.161}}</ref>

The vocabulary used within the Hebrew language has been altered from its original form due to its reintroduction to various cultures of organic life throughout time. The mouth to ear pedagogical method used in transmitting Hebrew to generations of children has undergone Europeanization in each attempt resulting in the radically unique and unpredictable course that maintains its current form under the classification of Modern Hebrew.  This "course that Modern Hebrew has embarked upon is the sure sign that Hebrew has been reborn."<ref name=Greenberg>{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Moshe|title=Introduction to Hebrew|year=1965|publisher=Prentice-Hall, INC.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0134844696|pages=8–9}}</ref>

In Israel, Modern Hebrew is currently taught in institutions called [[Ulpan]]im (singular: Ulpan). There are government owned as well as private Ulpanim offering online courses and face-to-face programs.

== Phonology ==
{{IPA notice}}
{{further|Biblical Hebrew#Phonology|Modern Hebrew phonology}}

[[Biblical Hebrew]] had a typical Semitic consonant inventory, with pharyngeal /ʕ ħ/, a series of "emphatic" consonants (possibly [[ejective consonant|ejective]], but this is debated), lateral fricative /ɬ/, and in its older stages also uvular /χ ʁ/. /χ ʁ/ merged into /ħ ʕ/ in later Biblical Hebrew, and /b ɡ d k p t/ underwent allophonic spirantization to [v ɣ ð x f θ] (known as [[begadkefat]]). The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels /a aː i iː u uː/ as well as /oː/, but this system changed dramatically over time.

By the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, /ɬ/ had shifted to /s/ in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with /ʃ/ instead. (Elisha Qimron 1986. ''Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', 29). The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system /a ɛ e i ɔ o u ă ɔ̆ ɛ̆/, though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.

A number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental ([[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi]]) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and [[Torah reading]]), and show the shift of /w/ to /v/. The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]] tradition has a complex vowel system which does not correspond closely to the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] systems.

Modern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. Emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, /w/ to /v/, and [ɣ ð θ] are not present. Many Israelis merge /ʕ ħ/ with /ʔ χ/, do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce /r/ as a uvular trill [ʀ] (or voiced uvular fricative) rather than an alveolar trill, as in many varieties of Ashkenazi Hebrew. The consonants /tʃ dʒ/ have become phonemic due to loan words, and /w/ has similarly been re-introduced.

== Hebrew grammar ==
{{Main|Modern Hebrew grammar}}
Hebrew grammar is partly [[analytic language|analytic]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[grammatical case]]s. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of the verbs and nouns. E.g. nouns have a [[construct state]], called "smikhut", to denote the relationship of "belonging to": this is the converse of the [[genitive case]] of more inflected languages. Words in smikhut are often combined with [[hyphen]]s.  In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition "shel", meaning "of".  There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and "person"-[[enclitic]]s are widely used to "decline" prepositions.

=== Morphology ===
Like all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of "[[triliteral]]", or 3-consonant [[Triliteral|consonantal roots]] (4-consonant roots also exist), from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels, and/or adding prefixes, suffixes, or [[infix]]es.

Hebrew uses a number of [[Prefixes and suffixes in Hebrew|one-letter prefixes]] that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or "Letters of Use" (''[[Hebrew]]: אותיות השימוש, Otiyot HaShimush''). Such items include: the definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''ha-'' ({{IPA|/ha/}}) (="the"); [[preposition]]s ''be-'' ({{IPA|/bə/}}) (="in"), ''le-'' ({{IPA|/lə/}}) (="to"; a shortened version of the preposition ''el''), ''mi-'' ({{IPA|/mi/}}) (="from"; a shortened version of the preposition ''min''); [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] ''ve-'' ({{IPA|/və/}}) (="and"), ''she-'' ({{IPA|/ʃe/}}) (="that"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction ''asher''), ''ke-'' ({{IPA|/kə/}}) (="as", "like"; a shortened version of the conjunction ''kmo'').

The vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes, hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form, may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word which begins with a moving [[Shva]], then the preposition takes the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial ''be-kfar'' (="in a village") corresponds to the more formal ''bi-khfar''.

The definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like ''mé-ha-kfar'' (="from the village"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of ''mi-''. With ''be'' and ''le'', the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes ''ba'' or ''la''. Thus *''be-ha-matos'' becomes ''ba-matos'' (="in the plane"). Note that this does not happen to ''mé'' (the form of "min" or "mi-" used before the letter "he"), therefore ''mé-ha-matos'' is a valid form, which means "from the airplane".

:''* indicates that the given example is grammatically [[standard language|non-standard]]''.

=== Syntax ===
Like most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives, and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject, and so on. However, speakers of languages such as English, French, [[Urdu]] or [[Persian language|Persian]] may find the structure of Hebrew sentences quite surprising.
* Many Hebrew sentences have several correct orders of words. One can change the order of the words in the sentence and keep the same meaning. For example, the sentence "Dad went working", in Hebrew, includes a word for ''Dad'' ({{lang|he|אבא}} ''{{transl|he|aba}}''), for ''went'' ({{lang|he|הלך}} ''{{transl|he|halaḵ}}''), and for ''working'' (to the working place = {{lang|he|לעבודה}} ''{{transl|he|la-ʿavoda}}''). However, unlike in English, you can put those three words almost in any combination ({{lang|he|אבא&nbsp;הלך&nbsp;לעבודה/ לעבודה&nbsp;אבא&nbsp;הלך/ לעבודה&nbsp;הלך&nbsp;אבא/ הלך&nbsp;אבא&nbsp;לעבודה}} and so on).
* In Hebrew, there is no word that is supposed to come before every singular noun (i.e. an [[Article (grammar)|article]]).
* Hebrew sentences do not have to include verbs; the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in the [[present tense]] is omitted (although might be implied). For example, the sentence "I am here" ({{lang|he|אני&nbsp;פה}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;po}}'') has only two words; one for I ({{lang|he|אני}}) and one for here ({{lang|he|פה}}). In the sentence "I am that  person" ({{lang|he|אני&nbsp;הוא&nbsp;אדם&nbsp;זה}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;hu&nbsp;adam&nbsp;ze}}''), the word for "am" corresponds to the word for "he" ({{lang|he|הוא}}). However, this may also be omitted. Thus, the sentence ({{lang|he|אני&nbsp;אדם&nbsp;זה}}) is identical in meaning.
* Unlike the verb "to have" in English, none of the possession terms in Hebrew is a verb.
* Though early [[Biblical Hebrew]] had a verb-subject-object ordering, this gradually transitioned to a subject-verb-object ordering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/basic-word-order-in-the-biblical-hebrew-verbal-clause-part-6/ |title=Basic Word Order in the Biblical Hebrew Verbal Clause, Part 6 &#124; Ancient Hebrew Grammar |publisher=Ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref>
* In Hebrew there is a specific preposition ({{lang|he|את}} ''{{transl|he|et}}'') for direct objects that would not have a preposition marker in English. The English phrase "he ate the cake" would in Hebrew be {{lang|he|הוא&nbsp;אכל&nbsp;את&nbsp;העוגה}} ''{{transl|he|hu&nbsp;akhal&nbsp;et&nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' (literally, "He ate {{lang|he|את}} the cake").

[[File:Frank-ruehl.png|thumb|[[Hebrew alphabet]]]]
Modern Hebrew is written from right to left using the [[Hebrew alphabet]], which is an [[abjad]], or consonant-only script of 22 letters. The ancient [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] is similar to those used for [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Modern scripts are based on the "square" letter form, known as ''Ashurit'' (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A [[cursive Hebrew]] script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to be more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents.  The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as [[Rashi script]].  When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of ''[[matres lectionis]]'', which are consonantal letters used as vowels.  Further diacritics are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. ''bet''/''vet'', ''shin''/''sin''); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation, and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see [[Cantillation]]).

Hebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.

[[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in the [[Haredi]] and other [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]  communities. It was influenced by the Yiddish language.

[[Sephardi Hebrew]] is the traditional pronunciation of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] and [[Sephardi Jews]] in the countries of the former [[Ottoman Empire]], with the exception of [[Yemenite Hebrew]].  This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of the [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]] of Israeli native speakers. It was influenced by the [[Judezmo]] language.

[[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew]] is actually a collection of dialects  spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the [[Arab]] and [[Islam]]ic world. It was possibly influenced by the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Arabic language]]s, and in some cases by [[Sephardi Hebrew]], although some linguists maintain that it is the direct heir of [[Biblical Hebrew]] and thus represents the true dialect of Hebrew.  The same claim is sometimes made for [[Yemenite Hebrew]] or ''Temanit'', which differs from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and "ghimel".)

These pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study, in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew, though some traditionalist Israelis are bi-dialectal.

Many synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the "Sephardic" pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction between [[Niqqud|tsere]] and [[Niqqud|segol]].
