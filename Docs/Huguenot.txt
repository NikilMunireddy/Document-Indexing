A '''Huguenot''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|ɡ|ən|ɒ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|h|juː|ɡ|ə|ˈ|n|oʊ}}; {{IPA-fr|yɡ(ə)no|lang}}) is a member of a French [[Protestantism|Protestant denomination]] with origins in the 16th or 17th centuries. Historically, Huguenots were French Protestants inspired by the writings of [[John Calvin]] (''Jean Cauvin'' in French) in the 1530s, who became known by that originally derisive designation by the end of the 16th century. The majority of Huguenots endorsed the [[Reformed|Reformed tradition]] of Protestantism.

Huguenot numbers peaked near an estimated two million by 1562, concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France, about one-eighth the number of French [[Catholics]]. As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] and edicts of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The wars finally ended with the granting of the [[Edict of Nantes]], signed probably on 30 April 1598, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.

[[Huguenot rebellions|Renewed religious warfare in the 1620s]] caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat. They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] (1685), which abolished all legal recognition of Protestantism in France, and forced the Huguenots to convert. While nearly three-quarters eventually were killed<ref>{{cite book |last1=LeFevre |first1=George |last2=LeFevre |first2=George |date=1952 |edition=1998 |title=The Pennsylvania LeFevres |url=http://www.pennsylvanialefevres.org/book/title.html |location=Strasburg, PA |publisher=THE LEFEVRE CEMETERY AND HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION |page= |isbn=9780740422331}}</ref> or submitted, roughly 500,000 Huguenots had fled France by the early 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The bulk of Huguenot émigrés relocated to Protestant European nations such as England, [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] and [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Duchy of Prussia]], the [[Channel Islands]], and Ireland. They also spread beyond Europe to the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] in South Africa, the [[Dutch East Indies]], the [[Caribbean]], [[New Netherland]], several of the [[13 colonies|English colonies]] in North America, and [[Quebec]], where they were generally accepted and allowed to worship freely.

Persecution of Protestants diminished in France after the death of Louis XIV in 1715, and officially ended with the [[Edict of Versailles]], commonly called the [[Edict of Tolerance]], signed by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1787. Two years later, with the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]], Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.<ref name="Aston, 2000 pp 245-50">Aston, ''Religion and Revolution in France, 1780–1804'' (2000) pp 245–50</ref>

Today, most Huguenots have been assimilated into various societies and cultures, but remnant communities in [[Alsace]] and the [[Cévennes]] in France and a [[diaspora]] of Huguenots in England and [[French Australian]]s still retain their Huguenot religious tradition.

==Etymology==
A term used originally in derision, ''Huguenot'' has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician [[Besançon Hugues]] (died 1532) and the [[Reformation in Switzerland|religiously conflicted]] nature of [[Early Modern Switzerland|Swiss republicanism]] in his time, using a clever derogatory [[pun]] on the name ''Hugues'' by way of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''Huisgenoten'' (literally ''housemates''), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German ''[[Eidgenosse]]'' (''Confederates'' as in "a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy").<ref name="EB11">''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed, Frank Puaux, ''Huguenot''</ref> Geneva was [[John Calvin]]'s adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In [[Geneva]], Hugues, though [[Catholic]], was a leader of the "Confederate Party", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an [[Military alliance|alliance]] between the city-state of Geneva and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]]. The label ''Huguenot'' was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the [[Amboise plot]] of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential [[House of Guise]]. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, ''Hugues'' plus ''Eidgenosse'' by way of ''Huisgenoten'' supposedly became ''Huguenot,'' a nickname associating the [[Protestant]] cause with politics unpopular in France.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Huguenot cross.svg|thumbnail|The Huguenot cross]]

A version of this complex hypothesis is promoted by O.I.A. Roche, who writes in his book, ''The Days of the Upright, A History of the Huguenots'' (1965), that "Huguenot" is:

<blockquote>"a combination of a Dutch and a German word. In the Dutch-speaking North of France, Bible students who gathered in each other's houses to study secretly were called ''Huis Genooten'' ('housemates') while on the Swiss and German borders they were termed ''Eid Genossen,'' or 'oath fellows,' that is, persons bound to each other by an oath. Gallicised into 'Huguenot', often used deprecatingly, the word became, during two and a half centuries of terror and triumph, a badge of enduring honour and courage."</blockquote>

Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language. The "Hugues hypothesis" argues that the name was derived by association with [[Hugh Capet|Hugues Capet, king of France]],<ref name="Gray">{{cite book |first=Janet G. |last=Gray |title=The Origin of the Word Huguenot |journal=[[Sixteenth Century Journal]] |volume=14 |year=1983 |issue=3 |pages=349–359 |jstor=2540193 }}</ref> who reigned long before the Reformation. He was regarded by the Gallicans and Protestants as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name ''huguenote'' would be roughly equivalent to ''little Hugos'', or ''those who want Hugo''.<ref name="Gray" />

In this last connection, the name could suggest the derogatory inference of superstitious worship; popular fancy held that ''Huguon,'' the gate of [[King Hugo]], was haunted by the ghost of ''le roi Huguet'' (regarded by Roman Catholics as an infamous scoundrel) and other spirits, who instead of being in [[Purgatory]] came back to harm the living at night.<ref name="CathEnc_Huguenot">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07527b.htm Antoine Dégert, "Huguenots"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1911</ref> It was in this place in [[Tours]] that the ''prétendus réformés'' ("these supposedly 'reformed'") habitually gathered at night, both for political purposes, and for prayer and singing [[psalms]].<ref>[http://www.huguenot.netnation.com/general/huguenot.htm "Who Were the Huguenots?"], The National Huguenot Society</ref> Such explanations have been traced to the contemporary, Reguier de la Plancha (d. 1560), who in ''De l'Estat de France'' offered the following account as to the origin of the name, as cited by ''The Cape Monthly'':

<blockquote>The origin of the name is curious; it is not from the German ''Eidegenossen'' as has been supposed. Reguier de la Plancha accounts for it as follows: — "The name ''huguenand'' was given to those of the religion during the affair of Amboyse, and they were to retail it ever since. I'll say a word about it to settle the doubts of those who have strayed in seeking its origin. The superstition of our ancestors, to within twenty or thirty years thereabouts, was such that in almost all the towns in the kingdom they had a notion that certain spirits underwent their Purgatory in this world after death, and that they went about the town at night, striking and outraging many people whom they found in the streets. But the light of the Gospel has made them vanish, and teaches us that these spirits were street-strollers and ruffians. In Paris the spirit was called ''le moine bourré''; at Orleans, ''le mulet odet''; at Blois ''le loup garon''; at Tours, ''le Roy Huguet''; and so on in other places. Now, it happens that those whom they called Lutherans were at that time so narrowly watched during the day that they were forced to wait till night to assemble, for the purpose of praying God, for preaching and receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that although they did not frighten nor hurt anybody, the priests, through mockery, made them the successors of those spirits which roam the night; and thus that name being quite common in the mouth of the populace, to designate the evangelical ''huguenands'' in the country of Tourraine and Amboyse, it became in vogue after that enterprise."<ref name="capemonthly">''De l'Estat de France'' 1560, by Reguier de la Plancha, quoted by ''The Cape Monthly'' (February 1877) No. 82 Vol. XIV on page 126|{{Internet Archive|id=capemonthlymagaz00cape|name=The Cape Monthly}}</ref></blockquote>

Some have suggested the name was derived, with similar intended scorn, from ''les guenon de Hus'' (the monkeys or apes of [[Jan Hus]]).<ref>''Bibliothèque d'humanisme et Renaissance'', by Association d'humanisme et renaissance, 1958, p 217</ref><ref>William Gilmore Simms, ''The Huguenots in Florida; Or, The Lily and the Totem'', 1854, p. 470</ref> While this and the many other theories offer their own measure of plausibility, attesting at least to the wit of later partisans and historians, "no one of the several theories advanced has afforded satisfaction."<ref>[https://books.google.com/?vid=OCLC05203528&id=KKAR2MEwKRoC&pg=RA1-PA241&lpg=RA1-PA241&dq=Origin+Huguenot#PRA1-PA241,M1 George Lunt, "Huguenot – The origin and meaning of the name"], ''New England Historical & Genealogical Register'', Boston, 1908/1911, 241–246</ref>

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

===Origins===
[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|Persecution of the [[Waldensians]] in the [[Massacre of Mérindol]] in 1545.]]
The availability of the Bible in [[vernacular]] languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France. The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy by the time the [[Protestant Reformation]] finally arrived. Around 1294, a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest, [[Guyart des Moulins|Guyard des Moulins]]. A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript, by Jean de Rély, was printed in Paris in 1487.<ref>{{cite book|last=Darling|first=Charles William|title=Historical account of some of the more important versions and editions of the Bible|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison|year=1894|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WHVbAAAAMAAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bullen|first=G.|publisher=N.

The first known translation of the Bible into one of France's regional languages, [[Franco-Provençal language|Arpitan or Franco-Provençal]], had been prepared by the 12th-century pre-reformer [[Peter Waldo]] (Pierre de Vaux).<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20140512214216/http://www.foucachon.com/Huguenots_Waldensians.pdf</ref> The Waldensians became more militant, creating fortified areas, as in [[Cabrières-d'Avignon|Cabrières]], perhaps attacking an abbey.<ref name="Lambert 389">[https://books.google.com/?id=m76JkwMZjgcC&pg=PA389 Malcolm D. Lambert, ''Medieval Heresy: Popular Movements from the Gregorian Reform to the Reformation''], p. 389</ref> They were suppressed by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1545 in the [[Massacre of Mérindol]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|title=The wars of the Huguenots|publisher=Robert Carter & Brothers|location=New York|year=1872|page=27|url=https://archive.org/details/warsofhuguenots00hannuoft|accessdate=7 September 2009}}</ref>

Other predecessors of the Reformed church included the pro-reform and [[Gallicanism|Gallican]] Roman Catholics, such as [[Jacques Lefevre]] (c. 1455–1536). The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power.<ref>Margaret Ruth Miles, ''The Word Made Flesh: A History of Christian Thought,'' Blackwell Publishing, 2005, pg 381</ref> During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the [[University of Paris]], published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530.<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juhász, Guido Latré (eds) ''Tyndale's Testament'', Turnhout: Brepols, 2002, ISBN 2-503-51411-1, pp. 130–135</ref> [[William Farel]] was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin ([[John Calvin]]), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French [[Waldensians]], then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join [[William Farel]], Calvin and the Reformation, and [[Pierre Robert Olivétan|Olivetan]] published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly [[Calvinism|Calvinistic influence]].<ref>{{cite web|author=John Calvin, tr. Emily O. Butler |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/frconf.htm |title=The French Confession of Faith of 1559 |publisher=Creeds.net |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as ''Huguenots''.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Although usually Huguenots are lumped into one group, there were actually two types of Huguenots that emerged. Since the Huguenots had political and religious goals it was commonplace to refer to the Calvinists as "Huguenots of religion" and those who opposed the monarchy as "Huguenots of the state", who were mostly nobles. 
The Huguenots had not only religious, but also political interests. A distinction was made between two groups of them, the "Huguenots of religion" and the "Huguenots of state." 
* The Huguenots of religion were influenced by John Calvin's works and established Calvinist synods. They were determined to end religious oppression.
* The Huguenots of the state opposed the monopoly of power the Guise family had and wanted to attack the authority of the crown. This group of Huguenots from Southern France had frequent issues with the strict Calvinist tenets that are outlined in many of John Calvin's letters to the synods of the Languedoc.

===Criticisms of the Catholic Church===
{{See also|Criticism of the Catholic Church}}
Like other religious reformers of the time, they felt that the Catholic church needed radical cleansing of its impurities, and that the Pope represented a worldly kingdom, which sat in mocking tyranny over the things of God, and was ultimately doomed. Rhetoric like this became fiercer as events unfolded, and eventually stirred up a reaction in the Catholic establishment.

Fanatically opposed to the Catholic Church, the Huguenots attacked priests, monks, nuns, monasticism, images, and church buildings. Most of the cities in which the Huguenots gained a hold saw iconoclast riots in which altars and images in churches, and sometimes the buildings themselves were torn down. Ancient relics and texts were destroyed; the bodies of saints exhumed and burned. The cities of Bourges, Montauban and Orleans saw substantial activity in this regard.

The Huguenots transformed themselves into a definitive political movement thereafter. Protestant preachers rallied a considerable army and a formidable cavalry, which came under the leadership of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny. Henry of Navarre and the House of Bourbon allied themselves to the Huguenots, adding wealth and holdings to the Protestant strength, which at its height grew to sixty fortified cities, and posed a serious threat to the Catholic crown and Paris over the next three decades.

The Catholic Church in France and many of its members opposed the Huguenots. Some Huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship.<ref>{{cite web|author=margaret kilner |url=http://www.orange-street-church.org/text/huguenot.htm |title=Huguenots |publisher=Orange-street-church.org |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> The height of this persecution was the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed, although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well, as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centres of power in southern France. Retaliating against the French Catholics, the Huguenots had their own militia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lucien Bély|title=The History of France|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ltzav890zpIC&pg=PA48|year=2001|publisher=Editions Jean-paul Gisserot|page=48|isbn=9782877475631}}</ref>

===Reform and growth===
Huguenots faced persecution from the outset of the Reformation, but [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (reign 1515–1547) initially protected the dissidents from [[Parlement]]ary measures seeking to exterminate them. After the 1534 [[Affair of the Placards]]<ref>[http://www.renaissance-amboise.com/dossier_renaissance/ses_evenements/affaire_des_placards/affaire_des_placards.htm L'affaire des placards, la fin de la belle Renaissance] {{wayback|url=http://www.renaissance-amboise.com/dossier_renaissance/ses_evenements/affaire_des_placards/affaire_des_placards.htm |date=20130607042828 |df=y }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herodote.net/histoire/evenement.php?jour=15341018 |title=18 octobre 1534 : l'affaire des placards |publisher=Herodote.net |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> he distanced himself from Huguenots and their protection.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Huguenot numbers grew rapidly between 1555 and 1561, chiefly amongst nobles and city dwellers. During this time, their opponents first dubbed the Protestants ''Huguenots''; but they called themselves ''reformés'', or "Reformed". They organised their first national synod in 1558 in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07527b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Huguenots |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

By 1562, the estimated number of Huguenots peaked at approximately two million, concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France, compared to approximately sixteen million Catholics during the same period. Persecution diminished the number of Huguenots who remained in France, as many fled to Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, and England.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Wars of religion===
{{Main|French Wars of Religion}}
As the Huguenots gained influence and displayed their faith more openly, Roman Catholic hostility to them grew, even though the French crown offered increasingly liberal [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] and edicts of toleration.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Following the accidental death of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] in 1559, his son succeeded as King [[Francis II of France|Francis II]] along with his wife, the Queen Consort, also known as [[Mary Queen of Scots]]. During the eighteen months of the reign of Francis II, Mary encouraged a policy of rounding up French Huguenots on charges of heresy, in front of Catholic judges, and employing torture and burning as punishments for dissenters. Mary returned to Scotland a widow, in the summer of 1561.<ref>Fischer, David Hackett, "Champlain's Dream", 2008, Alfred A. Knopf Canada</ref>

In 1561, the Edict of Orléans declared an end to the persecution, and the [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] of January 1562 formally recognised the Huguenots for the first time. However, these measures disguised the growing tensions between Protestants and Catholics.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Civil wars===
[[File:Print entitled Horribles cruautes des Huguenot en France 16th century.jpg|thumb|Propaganda print depicting Huguenot aggression against Catholics at sea, ''Horribles cruautés des Huguenots'', 16th century.]]
These tensions spurred eight civil wars, interrupted by periods of relative calm, between 1562 and 1598. With each break in peace, the Huguenots' trust in the Catholic throne diminished, and the violence became more severe, and Protestant demands became grander, until a lasting cessation of open hostility finally occurred in 1598.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The wars gradually took on a dynastic character, developing into an extended feud between the Houses of [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]] and [[House of Guise|Guise]], both of which—in addition to holding rival religious views—staked a claim to the French throne. The crown, occupied by the [[House of Valois]], generally supported the Catholic side, but on occasion switched over to the Protestant cause when politically expedient.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The [[French Wars of Religion]] began with the [[Massacre of Vassy]] on 1 March 1562, when dozens<ref name="CathEnc_Huguenot" /> (some sources say hundreds<ref>Thomas Martin Lindsay, ''A History of the Reformation,'' 1907, p 190: "six or seven hundred Protestants were slain"</ref>) of Huguenots were killed, and about 200 were wounded. It was in this year that some Huguenots destroyed the tomb and remains of Saint [[Irenaeus]] (d. 202), an early Church father and bishop who was a disciple of [[Polycarp]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The Huguenots became organised as a definitive political movement thereafter. Protestant preachers rallied a considerable army and a formidable cavalry, which came under the leadership of Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]]. [[Henry of Navarre]] and the House of Bourbon allied with the Huguenots, adding wealth and holdings to the Protestant strength.

In what became known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August – 3 October 1572, Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots in Paris.

===Edict of Nantes===
{{main|Edict of Nantes}}

The pattern of warfare, followed by brief periods of peace, continued for nearly another quarter-century. The warfare was definitively quelled in 1598, when Henry of Navarre, having [[Henry IV of France's succession|succeeded to the French throne]] as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism, issued the [[Edict of Nantes]]. The Edict reaffirmed Catholicism as the state religion of France, but granted the Protestants equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains. The Edict simultaneously protected Catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

With the proclamation of the Edict of Nantes, and the subsequent protection of Huguenot rights, pressures to leave France abated. However, enforcement of the Edict grew increasingly irregular over time, making life so intolerable that many fled the country. The Huguenot population of France dropped to 856,000 by the mid-1660s, of which a plurality lived in rural areas. The greatest concentrations of Huguenots at this time resided in the regions of [[Guienne]], Saintonge-[[Aunis]]-[[Angoumois]] and [[Poitou]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Huguenot Population of France, 1600–1685: The Demographic Fate and Customs of a Religious Minority |last=Benedict |first=Philip |isbn=0-87169-815-3 |year=1991 |publisher=The American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia |page=8 }}</ref>

[[Montpellier]] was among the most important of the 66 "villes de sûreté" that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots. The city's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots. Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622. Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city's fortifications. A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party. Even before the Edict of Alès (1629), Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

By 1620 the Huguenots were on the defensive, and the government increasingly applied pressure. A series of three small civil wars known as the [[Huguenot rebellions]] broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629. revolted against royal authority. The uprising occurred a decade following the death of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism, who had protected Protestants through the [[Edict of Nantes]]. His successor [[Louis XIII]], under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother [[Marie de' Medici]], became more intolerant of Protestantism. The Huguenots respond by establishing independent political and military structures, establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revolting against central power. The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French Crown.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Edict of Fontainebleau===
[[Louis XIV]] gained the throne in 1643 and acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert. At first he sent [[missionaries]], backed by a fund to financially reward converts to Catholicism. Then he imposed penalties, closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favoured professions. Escalating, he instituted [[dragonnades]], which included the occupation and looting of Huguenot homes by military troops, in an effort to forcibly convert them. In 1685, he issued the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], revoking the Edict of Nantes and declaring Protestantism illegal.<ref>see article: – [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]]</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The revocation forbade Protestant services, required education of children as Catholics, and prohibited emigration. It proved disastrous to the Huguenots and costly for France.  It precipitated civil bloodshed, ruined commerce, and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of Protestants, many of whom became intellectuals, doctors and business leaders in Britain as well as Holland, Prussia, and South Africa.  Four thousand emigrated to the North American colonies, where they settled in New York and Virginia, especially. The English welcomed the French refugees, providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation.  Those Huguenots who stayed in France became Catholics and were called "new converts".<ref>John Wolf, ''Louis XIV'', ch 24; Bertrand Van Ruymbeke, "Escape from Babylon", ''Christian History'' 2001 20(3): 38–42. {{ISSN|0891-9666}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]</ref>

After this, Huguenots (with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000<ref name="EB11" />) fled to surrounding Protestant countries: England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, and [[Prussia]] – whose Calvinist Great Elector [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and underpopulated country.  Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged [[Cévennes]] region in the south.  In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the [[Camisard]]s who were [[Huguenots]] rioted against the Catholic Church in the region, burning churches and killing clergy.  It took French troops years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards, between 1702 and 1709.<ref>Pierre-Jean Ruff, 2008. ''Le temple du Rouve, lieu de mémoire des Camisards''.

===End of persecution===

[[File:CalasChapbook.jpg|thumb|The death of [[Jean Calas]], who was [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]] at Toulouse, 9 March 1762.]]
By the 1760s, Protestants comprised about 700,000 people, or 2% of the population. It was no longer a favourite religion of the elite; most Protestants were peasants. It was still illegal and, although the law was seldom enforced, it could be a threat or a nuisance to Protestants. Calvinist lived primarily in the Midi; about 200,000 Lutherans lived in Alsace, where the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia still protected them.<ref>Nigel Aston, ''Religion and Revolution in France, 1780–1804'' (2000) pp 61–72</ref>

Persecution of Protestants diminished in France after 1724, finally ending with the [[Edict of Versailles]], commonly called the [[Edict of Tolerance]], signed by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1787. Two years later, with the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]], Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.<ref name="Aston, 2000 pp 245-50"/>

The government encouraged descendants of exiles to return, offering them French citizenship in a 15 December 1790 Law: 
<blockquote>
"All persons born in a foreign country and descending in any degree of a French man or woman expatriated for religious reason are declared French nationals (''naturels français'') and will benefit from rights attached to that quality if they come back to France, establish their domicile there and take the civic oath."<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Thomas Barclay|title=Nationality, domicile and residence in France: Decree of October 2, 1888 concerning foreigners, with notes and instructions and the laws of France relating to nationality, admission to domicile, naturalization and the sojourn in France of foreigners generally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99QNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA23|year=1888|pages=23–}}</ref>
</blockquote>

This is the first law offering the [[right of return]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Article 4 of 26 June 1889 Nationality Law stated: "Descendants of families proscribed by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes will continue to benefit from the benefit of 15 December 1790 Law, but on the condition that a nominal decree should be issued for every petitioner. That decree will only produce its effects for the future."<ref>{{cite book|author=Great Britain.

Stationery Office|page=47}}</ref>

Foreign descendants of Huguenots lost the automatic right to French citizenship in 1945 (by force of the ''Ordonnance du 19 octobre 1945'', which revoked the 1889 Nationality Law). It states in article 3: "This application does not, however, affect the validity of past acts by the person or rights acquired by third parties on the basis of previous laws."{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Modern times===
In the 1920s and 1930s, members of the extreme-right [[Action Française]] movement expressed strong animus against Huguenots and other [[Protestant]]s in general, as well as against [[Jews]] and [[Freemasons]]. They were regarded as groups supporting the French Republic, which Action Française sought to overthrow.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In [[World War II]], [[Huguenots]] led by André Trocmé in the village of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]] in [[Cévennes]] helped save many [[Jews]]. They hid them in secret places or helped them get out of [[Vichy|Vichy France]]. [[André and Magda Trocmé|André Trocmé]] preached against discrimination as the [[Nazis]] were gaining power in neighbouring Germany and urged his Protestant Huguenot congregation to hide [[Jewish]] refugees from the [[Holocaust]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Exodus==
Most French Huguenots were either unable or unwilling to emigrate to avoid forced conversion to Catholicism. As a result, more than three-quarters of the Protestant population accepted the change in faith; some 500,000 fled in exodus.<ref name="EB11" />

===Early emigration===
{{See also|France Antarctique|French Florida}}
[[File:Fort caroline.jpg|thumb|Etching of Fort Caroline]]
The first Huguenots to leave France sought freedom from persecution in Switzerland and the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} A group of Huguenots was part of the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found ''[[France Antarctique]]''. A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]], and settled in a small island. A fort, named [[Fort Coligny]], was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence. This document, the [[Guanabara Confession of Faith]], became the first Protestant confession of faith in the whole of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1564 a group of Norman Huguenots under the leadership of [[Jean Ribault]] established the small colony of [[Fort Caroline]] on the banks of the [[St. Johns River]] in what is today [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. The effort was the first at any permanent European settlement in the present-day [[continental United States]], but survived only a short time. A September 1565 French naval attack against the new Spanish colony at [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] failed when its ships were hit by a hurricane on their way to the Spanish encampment at Fort Matanzas. Hundreds of French soldiers were stranded and surrendered to the numerically inferior Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez. Menendez proceeded to massacre the defenceless Huguenots, after which he wiped out the [[Fort Caroline#History|Fort Caroline]] garrison.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/timu/historyculture/foca_end_colony.htm "The End of the Colony"], National Park Service</ref>

===South Africa===
{{Main|Huguenots in South Africa}}

Individual Huguenots settled at the Cape of Good Hope from as early as 1671 with the arrival of François Villion (Viljoen). The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was however Maria de la Queillerie, wife of commander Jan van Riebeeck (and daughter of a Walloon church minister), who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town. The couple left for the Far East ten years later. On 31 December 1687 the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref name="FRC-7">{{cite book|last=Botha|first=Colin Graham|title=The French refugees at the Cape|page=7|url=https://archive.org/stream/frenchrefugeesat00both#page/7/mode/1up|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.<ref name="FRC-10">{{cite book|last=Botha|first=Colin Graham|title=The French refugees at the Cape|page=7|url=https://archive.org/stream/frenchrefugeesat00both#page/10/mode/1up|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref>
[[File:HuguenotMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|The [[Huguenot Monument]] of [[Franschhoek]], Western Cape, South Africa]]

Many of these settlers were settled in an area that was later called [[Franschhoek]] (Dutch for French Corner), in the present-day [[Western Cape]] province of South Africa. A large monument to commemorate the arrival of the Huguenots in South Africa was inaugurated on 7 April 1948 at [[Franschhoek, Western Cape|Franschhoek]], where the Huguenot Memorial Museum was erected in 1957.

The official policy in the Dutch East India governors was to integrate the Huguenot and the Dutch communities. When Paul Roux, a pastor who arrived with the main group of Huguenots, died in 1724, the Dutch administration, as a special concession, permitted another French cleric to take his place "for the benefit of the elderly who spoke only French".<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric|last=Walker|title=A History of Southern Africa|publisher=Longmans|year=1968|chapter=Chapter IV – The Diaspora}}</ref> However, within three generations French was replaced by Dutch as the home language of most of the Huguenot descendants.

Many of the farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names. Many families, today mostly [[Afrikaans]]-speaking, have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry. Examples include: Blignaut, Cilliers,  de Klerk (Le Clercq), [[De Villiers (disambiguation)|de Villiers]], du Plessis, Du Preez (Des Pres), du Randt (Durand), du Toit, Duvenhage(Du Vinage), Franck, Fouche, Fourie (Fleurit), Gervais, Giliomee (Guilliaume), Gous/Gouws (Gauch), Hugo, Jordaan (Jourdan), [[Joubert]], Kriek, Labuschagne (la Buscagne), [[Leroux (surname)|le Roux]], Lombard, [[Malan (disambiguation)|Malan]], [[Malherbe]], Marais, Maree, Minnaar (Mesnard), Nel (Nell),Naude', Nortje (Nortier), [[Pienaar]] (Pinard), Retief (Retif), Rossouw ([[Rousseau (surname)|Rousseau]]), Taljaard (Taillard), TerBlanche, [[Theron]], [[Viljoen]] (Villion) and Visagie (Visage).<ref>''Ces Francais Qui Ont Fait L'Afrique Du Sud''.

ISBN 2-84100-086-9']</ref> The wine industry in South Africa owes a significant debt to the Huguenots, some of whom had [[vineyards]] in France, or were brandy distillers, and used their skills in their new home.

===North America===
{{details|Fort Caroline}}
[[File:WalloonMonumentNYC.gif|thumb|right|Walloon Monument in [[Battery Park]], [[Manhattan]], New York City]]
French Huguenots made two attempts to establish a haven in North America. In 1562, naval officer [[Jean Ribault]] led an expedition that explored Florida and the present-day Southeastern US, and founded the outpost of [[Charlesfort]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]]. The Wars of Religion precluded a return voyage, and the outpost was abandoned. In 1564, Ribault's former lieutenant [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière]] launched a second voyage to build a colony; he established [[Fort Caroline]] in what is now [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. War at home again precluded a resupply mission, and the colony struggled. In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to ''[[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]'', and sent [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], who established the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] near Fort Caroline. Menéndez' forces routed the French and executed most of the Protestant captives.

Barred by the government from settling in [[New France]], Huguenots led by [[Jessé de Forest]], sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain's colonies, including [[Nova Scotia]]. A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as ''L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam'' (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as ''L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit'', part of the Episcopal (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world. Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbour at the end of [[Newtown Creek]], becoming the first Europeans to live in [[Brooklyn]], then known as Boschwick, in the neighbourhood now known as [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]].

[[File:Jean Hasbrouck House.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Hasbrouck House]] (1721) on [[Huguenot Street]] in [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz, New York]]]]

Huguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country, but rather, formed three societies or congregations; one in the city of New York, another 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], and a third further upstate in [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]]. The "[[Huguenot Street Historic District]]" in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site and contains the oldest street in the United States of America. A small group of Huguenots also settled on the [[Rossville, Staten Island|south shore]] of [[Staten Island]] along the [[New York Harbor]], for which the current neighbourhood of [[Huguenot, Staten Island|Huguenot]] was named.

[[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], located in the county of [[Westchester, New York|Westchester]] on the north shore of [[Long Island Sound]], seemed to be the great location of the Huguenots in New York. It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called "Bauffet's Point" after travelling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution, four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They purchased from John Pell, Lord of [[Pelham Manor, New York|Pelham Manor]], a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of [[Jacob Leisler]]. It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold in France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that built of stone.  Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced by a third, [[Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church (New Rochelle, New York)|Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church]], which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church "Eglise du St. Esperit" on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room. The Huguenot cemetery, or "Huguenot Burial Ground", has since been recognised as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders, early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries.

Some Huguenot immigrants settled in Central and Eastern Pennsylvania, such as Philip Woodring born 1741 in Alsace, France, and died 1819 in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. They assimilated with the predominantly [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania German]] settlers of the area.

In 1700 several hundred French Huguenots migrated from England to the colony of Virginia, where the English Crown had promised them land grants in [[Lower Norfolk County]]. When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the James River, at the abandoned [[Monacan people|Monacan]] village known as [[Manakintown, Virginia|Manakin Town]], now in [[Powhatan County, Virginia|Powhatan County]]. Some settlers landed in present-day [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]]. On 12 May 1705, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwehave/notes/rn9_natural1657.pdf |title=Huguenots in Manakintown |publisher=Library of Virginia|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbours. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the [[Appalachian Mountains]] into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the [[Huguenot Memorial Bridge]] across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and Huguenot Road were named in their honour, as were many local features, including several schools, including [[Huguenot High School]].

[[File:FrenchProtestantChurch.jpg|left|thumb|[[Huguenot Church|French Huguenot Church]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]]]

In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of [[Pons, Charente-Maritime|Pons]] in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, several Huguenot families of [[Normans|Norman]] and [[Carolingian]] nobility and descent, including [[Edmund Bohun]] of Suffolk England from the [[Humphrey de Bohun (disambiguation)|Humphrey de Bohun]] line of French royalty descended from [[Charlemagne]], [[Jean Postell]] of Dieppe France, [[Alexander Pepin]], [[Antoine Poitevin]] of Orsement France, and [[Jacques de Bordeaux]] of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave [[Edmund Bellinger]]. Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.

The [[French Huguenot Church]] of Charleston, which remains independent, is the oldest continuously active Huguenot congregation in the United States. ''L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit'' in New York, founded in 1628, is older, but it left the French Reformed movement in 1804 to become part of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].

Most of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members. The Huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities, which led to their assimilation.<ref>Gevinson, Alan. "[http://www.teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/23448 Protestant Immigration to Louisiana]." [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org], accessed 2 September 2011.</ref> Their descendants in many families continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century. Assimilated, the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods. For example, [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont|E.I. du Pont]], a former student of [[Lavoisier]], established the [[Eleutherian Mills|Eleutherian gunpowder mills]].<ref>article on EIDupont says he did not even emigrate to the US and establish the mills until after the French Revolution, so the mills were not operating for theAmerican revolution</ref>

[[Paul Revere]] was descended from Huguenot refugees, as was [[Henry Laurens]], who signed the Articles of Confederation for South Carolina; [[Jack Jouett]], who made the ride from Cuckoo Tavern to warn [[Thomas Jefferson]] and others that Tarleton and his men were on their way to arrest him for crimes against the king; [[Francis Marion]], and a number of other leaders of the American Revolution and later statesmen. The last active Huguenot congregation in North America worships in Charleston, South Carolina, at a church that dates to 1844. The Huguenot Society of America maintains [[Manakin Episcopal Church]] in Virginia as an historic shrine with occasional services. The Society has chapters in numerous states, with the one in Texas being the largest.

===The Netherlands===
Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1568–1609). The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the "Apologie" of [[William the Silent]], [[Historical revision of the Inquisition|condemning the Spanish Inquisition]], which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. [[Louise de Coligny]], daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the [[Prinsenhof]] in [[Delft]] held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active [[Walloons|Walloon]] churches of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies. They settled at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in South Africa and [[New Netherland]] in North America.

Stadtholder [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], who later became King of England, emerged as the strongest opponent of king [[Louis XIV]] after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672. William formed the [[League of Augsburg]] as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state. Consequently, many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist Dutch Republic, which led the opposition to Louis XIV, as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there.

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the [[Cévennes]], for instance, the village of [[Fraissinet-de-Lozère]].<ref>Ghislain Baury,[http://sites.google.com/site/dynastierouviere/ ''La dynastie Rouvière de Fraissinet-de-Lozère. Les élites villageoises dans les Cévennes protestantes d'après un fonds d'archives inédit (1403–1908)'', t. 1: ''La chronique'', t. 2: ''L'inventaire''], Sète, Les Nouvelles Presses du Languedoc, 2011.</ref> This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2&nbsp;million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715. Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset.

One of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was [[Pierre Bayle]]. He started teaching in [[Rotterdam]], where he finished writing and publishing his multi-volume masterpiece, ''[[Historical and Critical Dictionary]]''. It became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US [[Library of Congress]]. Some Huguenot descendants in the Netherlands may be noted by French family names, although they typically use Dutch given names. Due to the Huguenots' early ties with the leadership of the Dutch Revolt and their own participation, some of the Dutch [[List of Dutch patrician families|patriciate]] are of part-Huguenot descent. Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions, such as the celebration and feast of their patron ''[[Saint Nicholas|Saint Nicolas]]'', similar to the Dutch ''[[Sint Nicolaas]]'' ([[Sinterklaas]]) feast.

===Wales===
A number of French Huguenots settled in Wales, in the upper [[Rhymney]] valley of the current [[Caerphilly County Borough]]. The community they created there is still known as ''Fleur de Lys'' (the symbol of France), an unusual French village name in the heart of the valleys of Wales. Nearby villages are [[Hengoed]], and [[Ystrad Mynach]]. Apart from the French village name and that of the local rugby team, [[Fleur De Lys RFC]], little remains of the French heritage.

Both before and after the 1708 passage of the [[Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708|Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act]], an estimated 50,000 Protestant [[Walloons]] and Huguenots fled to England, with many moving on to Ireland and elsewhere. In relative terms, this was one of the largest waves of immigration ever of a single ethnic community to Britain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12010095 |title=The Huguenots in England |work=The Economist|date= 28 August 2008|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> [[Andrew Lortie]] (born André Lortie), a leading Huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in London, became known for articulating their criticism of the Pope and the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] during Mass.

Of the refugees who arrived on the [[Kent]] coast, many gravitated towards [[Canterbury]], then the county's [[Calvinist]] hub. Many Walloon and Huguenot families were granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] there. [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] granted them the whole of the western crypt of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] for worship. In 1825, this privilege was reduced to the south aisle and in 1895 to the former [[chantry]] chapel of the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]]. Services are still held there in French according to the Reformed tradition every Sunday at 3&nbsp;pm.

Other evidence of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane, where [[weavers' windows]] survive on the top floor, as many Huguenots worked as weavers. The Weavers, a [[timber framing|half-timbered]] house by the river, was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830. (It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above. The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Others refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population. Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees' initial acceptance in the City.<!-- dead link<ref>[http://www.digiserve.com/peter/weavers.htm "Huguenot Weavers"], Digiserve</ref> --> They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Faversham, Kent|Faversham]] and [[Maidstone]]—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.

The [[French Protestant Church of London]] was established by [[Royal Charter]] in 1550. It is now located at [[Soho Square]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egliseprotestantelondres.org |title=French Protestant Church of London |publisher=Egliseprotestantelondres.org |date= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> Huguenot refugees flocked to [[Shoreditch]], London.

The [[Old Truman Brewery]], then known as the Black Eagle Brewery, was founded in 1724. The flight of Huguenot refugees from [[Tours]], France drew off most of the workers of its great silk mills which they had built.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Some of these immigrants moved to [[Norwich]], which had accommodated an earlier settlement of Walloon weavers. The French added to the existing immigrant population, then comprising about a third of the population of the city.

Some Huguenots settled in Bedfordshire, one of the main centres of the British lace industry at the time.

===Ireland===
Following the French Crown's revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], many Huguenots settled in Ireland in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants' settling in Ireland.<ref>Grace Lawless Lee (2009), ''The Huguenot Settlements in Ireland,'' Page 169</ref><ref>Raymond Hylton (2005), ''Ireland's Huguenots and Their Refuge, 1662–1745: An Unlikely Haven,'' p. 194, Quote:  "The Bishop of Kildare did come to Portarlington to consecrate the churches, backed by two prominent Huguenot Deans of ...

Smaller settlements, which included [[Killeshandra]] in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the Irish linen industry.

For over 150 years, Huguenots were allowed to hold their services in Lady Chapel in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]]. A [[Huguenot cemetery, Dublin|Huguenot cemetery]] is located in the centre of Dublin, off St. Stephen's Green. Prior to its establishment, Huguenots used the [[The Cabbage Garden, Dublin|Cabbage Garden]] near the Cathedral.

A number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries. Numerous signs of Huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use, and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there. Examples include the Huguenot District and French Church Street in [[Cork City]]; and [[D'Olier Street]] in Dublin, named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland. A French church in Portarlington dates back to 1696,<ref>[http://www.iol.ie/~offaly/stpauls.htm ''300 years of the French Church''], St. Paul's Church, Portarlington.</ref> and was built to serve the significant new Huguenot community in the town. At the time, they constituted the majority of the townspeople.<ref>[http://www.grantonline.com/grant-family-individuals/blong-george-1790/portarlington/portarlington.htm Portarlington], Grant Family Onliine</ref>

One of the more notable Huguenot descendants in Ireland was [[Seán Lemass]] (1899–1971), who was appointed as ''[[Taoiseach]],'' serving from 1959 until 1966.

===Germany and Scandinavia===
[[File:Huguenot obelisk.jpg|thumb|right|Obelisk commemorating the Huguenots in [[Fredericia|Fredericia, Denmark]]]]

Around 1685, Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], where they were granted special privileges ([[Edict of Potsdam]]) and churches in which to worship (such as the [[Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Angermünde]]) by [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] and [[Duke of Prussia]]. The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No. 13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich).
Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of [[Baden]], [[Franconia]] ([[Principality of Bayreuth]], [[Principality of Ansbach]]), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]], [[Duchy of Württemberg]], in the [[Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts]], in [[Electorate of the Palatinate|the Palatinate]] and [[Palatinate-Zweibrücken]], in the Rhine-Main-Area ([[Frankfurt]]), in modern-day [[Saarland]]; and 1,500 found refuge in [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of [[George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] in [[Celle]].

[[File:Relief 1885.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Relief by [[Johannes Boese]], 1885: The great Prince-elector of Brandenburg-Prussia welcomes arriving Huguenots]]
In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods: [[Dorotheenstadt]] and [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]]. By 1700, one-fifth of the city's population was French speaking. The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1806–07. Many of their descendents rose to positions of prominence. Several congregations were founded, such as those of [[Fredericia]] (Denmark), Berlin, [[Stockholm]], Hamburg, [[Frankfurt]], Helsinki, and [[Emden]].

Prince Louis de Condé, along with his sons Daniel and Osias,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} arranged with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day [[Saarland]] in 1604. The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands, regardless of their religion. The Condés established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years. Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France. The community and its congregation remain active to this day, with descendants of many of the founding families still living in the region. Some members of this community emigrated to the United States in the 1890s.

In [[Bad Karlshafen]], Hessen, Germany is the Huguenot Museum and Huguenot archive. The collection includes family histories, a library, and a picture archive.

===Effects===
The exodus of Huguenots from France created a [[brain drain]], as many Huguenots had occupied important places in society. The kingdom did not fully recover for years. The French crown's refusal to allow non-Catholics to settle in [[New France]] may help to explain that colony's slow rate of population growth compared to that of the neighbouring British colonies, which opened settlement to religious dissenters. By the time of the [[French and Indian War]] (the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]]), a sizeable population of Huguenot descent lived in the British colonies, and many participated in the British defeat of New France in 1759–60.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-5876486_ITM |title=Cooperative religion in Quebec |work=Journal of Ecumenical Studies |publisher=Goliath |date=22 March 2004 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

[[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], invited Huguenots to settle in his realms, and a number of their descendants rose to positions of prominence in Prussia. Several prominent German military, cultural, and political figures were ethnic Huguenot, including poet [[Theodor Fontane]],<ref>Steinhauer, Harry. ''Twelve German Novellas'', p. 315. University of California Press, 1977. ISBN 0-520-03002-8</ref> General [[Hermann von François]],<ref>Pawly, Ronald. ''The Kaiser's Warlords'', p.44. Osprey Publishing, 2003.

ISBN 0-313-29969-2</ref> is also a descendant of a Huguenot family, as is the German [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Minister of the Interior]], [[Thomas de Maizière]].

The persecution and flight of the Huguenots greatly damaged the reputation of Louis XIV abroad, particularly in England. The two kingdoms, which had enjoyed peaceful relations prior to 1685, became bitter enemies and fought against each other in a series of wars (called the "[[Second Hundred Years' War]]" by some historians) from 1689 onward.

==Symbol==
[[File:Croix huguenote.svg|thumb|100px|right|The Huguenot Cross]]
The [[Huguenot cross]] is the distinctive emblem of the Huguenots (''croix huguenote'').<ref>[[:fr:Croix huguenote|croix huguenote]]</ref> It is now an official symbol of the ''Église des Protestants réformés'' (French Protestant church). Huguenot descendants sometimes display this symbol as a sign of ''reconnaissance'' (recognition) between them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Apology and honours==
In October 1985, to commemorate the tricentenary of the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]], President [[François Mitterrand]] of France announced a formal apology to the descendents of Huguenots around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/857015500.html|title=Allocution de M.

====Ireland====
* [[Sean Francis Lemass]], [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland from 1959–1966, was of Huguenot descent.

==== South Africa ====
{{Main|Huguenots in South Africa}}
* Most South African Huguenots settled in the [[Cape Colony]], where they became assimilated into the [[Afrikaner]] and [[Afrikaans]] population. Many modern Afrikaners have French surnames, which are given Afrikaans pronunciation and orthography. The early immigrants settled in ''[[Franschhoek]]'' ("French Corner") near [[Cape Town]]. The Huguenots contributed greatly to the [[South African wine|wine industry in South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingapartheid.msu.edu/unit.php?id=11|title=Paths to Pluralism: South Africa’s Early History|publisher=[[Michigan State University]]|accessdate=21 April 2009}}</ref>

====Australia====
{{Main|French Australian}}
* The majority of Australians with French ancestry are descended from Huguenots.  Some of the earliest to arrive in Australia held prominent positions in English society, notably [[Jane Franklin]] and [[Charles La Trobe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenotsaustralia.org.au/famous.html|title=Famous people|author=The Huguenot Society of Australia|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>
* Others who came later were from poorer families, migrating from England in the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape the poverty of London's East End Huguenot enclaves of [[Spitalfields]] and [[Bethnal Green]]. Their impoverishment had been brought on by the Industrial Revolution, which caused the collapse of the Huguenot-dominated silk-weaving industry. Many [[French Australian]] descendants of Huguenots still consider themselves very much Huguenots or French, even in the twenty-first century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenotsaustralia.org.au/who.html|title=Who were the Huguenots?|author=The Huguenot Society of Australia|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>
