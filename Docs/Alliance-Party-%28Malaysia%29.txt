{{Politics of Malaysia}}

The '''Alliance Party''' ({{lang-ms|Parti Perikatan}}) was a political [[coalition]] in [[Malaysia]]. The Alliance Party, whose membership comprised [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA) and [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC), was formally registered as a political organisation on 30 October 1957.  It was the ruling coalition until it became the [[Barisan National]] in 1973.

==History==
The Alliance Party started off as an ''ad hoc'' and temporary electoral arrangement between the local branches of [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] and [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] to contest the [[Kuala Lumpur]] municipal election in 1952.  The UMNO-MCA candidates won in 9 of the 12 seats contested, and their success led a firmer association between the two parties.  The alliance was then joined by [[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]] in 1954.<ref name=ency>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Volume 1 |editor= Keat Gin Ooi |pages=138–139 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year= 2004 |isbn=978-1576077702 }}</ref>

In 1955, in the first [[Malayan general election, 1955|general election]] for the [[Federal Legislative Council]] in what was then the British [[protectorate]] of the [[Federation of Malaya]], the UMNO-MCA-MIC Alliance successfully gained the great majority of seats available for contest, winning 51 of the 52 seats contested. It formally registered as a political organisation on 30 October 1957.

The Alliance played an important role in negotiating the transition to independence from British rule, and facilitating the preparation of its constitution. In the [[Malayan general election, 1959|General Election]] held in 1959, after the Malaya had gained independence on 31 August 1957, the Alliance won 74 of the 104 seats contested.

The Alliance is also credited with securing the formation of the [[Federation of Malaysia]] on 16 September 1963. After Malaysia came into being, the Alliance Party of the [[Malay peninsula]] became closely associated with other alliance parties in Sabah and Sarawak.

In the [[Malaysian general election, 1969|1969 general election]], although the Alliance Party won the most seats, it garnered less than half the popular vote due to strong challenges from the opposition parties, in particular the newly formed [[Democratic Action Party]] and [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Gerakan]].  The unease and anxiety after the election led to the [[13 May Incident|May 13 riots]], and the declaration of a state of emergency.  After the Malaysian Parliament reconvened in 1971, negotiations began with former opposition parties such as Gerakan and [[People's Progressive Party (Malaysia)|People's Progressive Party]], both of which joined the Alliance in 1972, quickly followed by [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]]. In 1973, the Alliance Party, was formally replaced by [[Barisan Nasional]], a coalition of 9 parties, and the Barisan Nasional was registered in June 1974 to contest the [[Malaysian general election, 1974|1974 general election]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BkUORUDN4ysC&pg=PR67#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The A to Z of Malaysia|author= Keat Gin Ooi |publisher=Scarecrow Press |pages=ixvi-ixvii |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0810876415 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G5KLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of Southeast Asia |author= Joseph Liow, Michael Leifer |publisher=Routledge |edition= 4th |date= 18 November 2014 |isbn=978-0415625326 }}</ref>
