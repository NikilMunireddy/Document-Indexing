'''Iceland''' ({{IPAc-en|audio = en-us-Iceland.ogg|ˈ|aɪ|s|l|æ|n|d}}; {{Lang-is|Ísland}} {{IPA-is|ˈistlant|}}), also called the '''Republic of Iceland''',<ref group="Note" name="Republic">While sometimes referred to as the "'''Republic of Iceland'''" ([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/281235/Iceland] [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/26th-gegn-docs/WP/WP54_UNGEGN%20WG%20Country%20Names%20Document%202011.pdf]) and sometimes its counterpart ''Lýðveldið Ísland'' in Icelandic, the official name of the country is simply Iceland.

Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is [[volcanic island|volcanically]] and [[geothermal (geology)|geologically active]]. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and [[lava field]]s, mountains and glaciers, while many [[river|glacial rivers]] flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the [[Arctic Circle]]. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a [[tundra climate]].

According to ''[[Landnámabók]]'', the [[settlement of Iceland]] began in the year 874&nbsp;AD when the [[Norway|Norwegian]] chieftain [[Ingólfr Arnarson]] became the first permanent settler on the island.<ref name = tomasson/> In the following centuries, mainly [[Norwegians]] and to a smaller extent other [[Scandinavia]]ns settled Iceland, bringing with them [[thrall]]s of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} From 1262 to 1814, Iceland was ruled by [[Norway]] and afterwards by [[Denmark]]. Until the 20th century, the country relied largely on fishing and agriculture. Iceland became [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union|independent in 1918]] and a [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|republic in 1944]]. Industrialisation of the fisheries and [[Marshall Plan]] aid following [[World War II]] brought prosperity and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the [[European Economic Area]], which supported diversification into economic and financial services.

According to both [[Landnámabók]] and [[Íslendingabók]], Celtic monks known as the [[Papar]] lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly members of a [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]. Recent [[archaeological]] excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in [[Hafnir]] on the [[Reykjanes|Reykjanes peninsula]]. [[Carbon dating]] indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880.<ref>[http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/A_New_View_on_the_Origin_of_First_Settlers_in_Iceland_0_378670.news.aspx New View on the Origin of First Settlers in Iceland], ''Iceland Review Online'', 4 June 2011.

Garðar departed the following summer but one of his men, [[Náttfari]], decided to stay behind with two slaves. Náttfari settled in what is now known as Náttfaravík and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of Iceland.<ref>[http://www.gardarsholmur.is/iceland-and-the-history/ Iceland and the history], ''The Gardarsholm Project'', 29 July 2012.

The Norse chieftain [[Ingólfr Arnarson]] built his homestead in present-day [[Reykjavík]] in the year 874.

{{See also|Age of the Sturlungs}}

The [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] lasted until the 13th century, when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://dannyreviews.com/h/Iceland.html|title = The History of Iceland (Gunnar Karlsson)&nbsp;– book review|publisher = Dannyreviews.com|accessdate = 10 February 2010}}</ref> The internal struggles and civil strife of the [[Age of the Sturlungs]] led to the signing of the [[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Old Covenant]] in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown. Possession of Iceland passed from the [[Norwegian Empire]] to the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark and [[Sweden]] were united. After the break-up of the union in 1523, it remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of [[Denmark–Norway]].

In the ensuing centuries, Iceland became one of the poorest countries in Europe. Infertile soil, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture. The [[Black Death]] swept Iceland twice, first in 1402–04 and again in 1494–95.<ref>Pulsiano, Phillip and Wolf, Kirsten (1993) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=d-XiZO8V4qUC&pg=PA312 Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia]''.

===Reformation and the Early Modern period===
{{See also|Icelandic Reformation|Danish-Icelandic Trade Monopoly|Móðuharðindin}}
Around the middle of the 16th century, as part of the [[Protestant Reformation]], King [[Christian III of Denmark]] began to impose [[Lutheranism]] on all his subjects. [[Jón Arason]], the last Catholic bishop of [[Hólar]], was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons. The country subsequently became officially Lutheran and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Denmark imposed [[Danish–Icelandic Trade Monopoly|harsh trade restrictions]] on Iceland. Natural disasters, including volcanic eruption and disease, contributed to a decreasing population. Pirates from several countries, including the Barbary Coast, raided its coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery.<ref>{{Cite book|author = Davis, Robert C.|title = Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C&pg=PA7|year = 2003|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|isbn = 978-0-333-71966-4|pages = 7–}}</ref><ref>One slaving expedition is inaccurately termed the [[Turkish Abductions]] in Icelandic historiography.

===Independence movement 1814–1918===
{{See also|Icelandic independence movement|Fjölnir (journal)}}
In 1814, following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the [[Treaty of Kiel]] but Iceland remained a Danish dependency. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow colder, resulting in mass emigration to the [[New World]], particularly to the region of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], [[Manitoba]] in [[Canada]], which was sometimes referred to as [[New Iceland]]. About 15,000 people emigrated, out of a total population of 70,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/05/business/iceland.php |title=For Iceland, an exodus of workers |work=The New York Times |date=5 December 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081211074725/http://www.iht.com:80/articles/2008/12/05/business/iceland.php? |archivedate=11 December 2008 }}</ref>

A national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century, inspired by [[romanticism|romantic]] and [[nationalism|nationalist]] ideas from mainland [[Europe]]. An Icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of [[Jón Sigurðsson]], based on the burgeoning Icelandic nationalism inspired by the ''[[Fjölnismenn]]'' and other Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule. This was expanded in 1904, and [[Hannes Hafstein]] served as the first [[Minister for Iceland]] in the Danish cabinet.

===Kingdom of Iceland 1918–1944===
{{See also|Kingdom of Iceland|Invasion of Iceland|Iceland in World War II}}
[[File:HMS Berwick (65).jpg|right|thumb|{{HMS|Berwick|65|6}} led the British [[invasion of Iceland]]]]

The [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union]], an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25&nbsp;years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign state in a [[personal union]] with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark handle Icelandic foreign policy. Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the [[Kingdom of Iceland]].

During World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the [[German occupation of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government would take control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by Denmark. A month later, British armed forces [[Operation Fork|invaded and occupied the country]], violating Icelandic [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. In 1941, the occupation was taken over by the United States so that Britain could use its troops elsewhere, an arrangement reluctantly agreed to by the Icelandic authorities.

===Independent republic 1944–present===

On 31 December 1943, the [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union]] expired after 25&nbsp;years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic. The vote was 97% to end the union, and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution.<ref>{{Cite video|year = 1944|title = Video: Allies Study Post-War Security Etc.

In 1946, the Allied occupation force left Iceland. The nation formally became a member of [[NATO]] on 30 March 1949, amid [[1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland|domestic controversy and riots]]. On 5 May 1951, a defence agreement was signed with the United States. American troops returned to Iceland as the [[Iceland Defence Force]], and remained throughout the [[Cold War]]. The US withdrew the last of its forces on 30 September 2006.

Iceland had prospered during the war. The immediate post-war period was followed by substantial [[economic growth]], driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the US [[Marshall Plan]] programme, through which Icelanders received the most aid per capita of any European country (at USD 209, with the war-ravaged [[Netherlands]] a distant second at USD 109).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://visindavefur.hi.is/svar.asp?id=3411|title=Vísindavefurinn: '&#39;Hversu há var Marshallaðstoðin sem Ísland fékk eftir seinni heimsstyrjöld?'&#39;|date= 13 May 2003|work=Vísindavefurinn|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author1=Müller, Margrit  |author2=Myllyntaus, Timo|title = Pathbreakers: Small European Countries Responding to Globalisation and Deglobalisation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zdXTV8xO3xQC&pg=PA385|year = 2007|publisher = Peter Lang|isbn = 978-3-03911-214-2|pages = 385–}}</ref>

The 1970s were marked by the [[Cod Wars]]&nbsp;— several disputes with the [[United Kingdom]] over Iceland's extension of its fishing limits to 200&nbsp;miles offshore. Iceland hosted a [[Reykjavík Summit|summit in Reykjavík in 1986]] between United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], during which they took significant steps toward [[nuclear disarmament]]. A few years later, Iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] as they [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|broke away]] from the USSR. Throughout the 1990s, the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes. To that end, Iceland provided aid and expertise to various NATO-led interventions in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], and [[First Gulf War|Iraq]].<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 29</ref>

Iceland joined the [[European Economic Area]] in 1994, after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised. International economic relations increased further after 2001, when Iceland's newly deregulated banks began to raise massive amounts of [[external debt]], contributing to a 32% increase in Iceland's [[Gross national income]] between 2002 and 2007.<ref name=jackson>{{cite journal|journal=[[Financial Times]]|author=Robert Jackson|title=The Big Chill|date=15 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://statice.is/?PageID=1267&src=https://rannsokn.hagstofa.is/pxen/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=THJ01000%26ti=Overview+of+Gross+Domestic+Product+and+Gross+National+Product+1945%2D2013%26path=../Database/thjodhagsreikningar/landsframleidsla/%26lang=1%26units=Index/percent/number|title=Home - Hagstofa|work=Hagstofa}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Map of Iceland.svg|thumb|right|General topographic map]]
{{Details|Geography of Iceland}}

Iceland is located at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The main island is entirely south of the [[Arctic Circle]], which passes through the small Icelandic island of [[Grímsey]] off the main island's northern coast. The country lies between latitudes [[63rd parallel north|63°]] and [[68th parallel north|68° N]], and longitudes [[25th meridian west|25°]] and [[13th meridian west|13° W]].

Iceland is closer to [[continental Europe]] than to mainland North America; thus, the island is generally included in Europe for historical, political, cultural, and practical reasons. Geologically the island includes parts of both continental plates. The closest body of land is [[Greenland]] ({{Convert|290|km|-1|abbr=on|disp=comma}}). The closest bodies of land in Europe are the [[Faroe Islands]] ({{Convert|420|km|-1|abbr=on|disp=comma}}); [[Jan Mayen]] Island ({{Convert|570|km|-1|abbr=on|disp=comma}}); [[Shetland]] and the [[Outer Hebrides]], both about {{Convert|740|km|-1|abbr = on}}; and the Scottish mainland and [[Orkney]], both about {{Convert|750|km|-1|abbr=on}}. The mainland of Norway is about {{Convert|970|km|-1|abbr=on}} away.

[[File:Icelandic landscapes.jpg|thumb|left|A sample of three typical Icelandic landscapes.]]
Iceland is the [[List of islands by area|world's 18th largest island]], and Europe's second largest island after Great Britain. The main island is {{Convert|101826|km²|0|abbr = on}}, but the entire country is {{Convert|103000|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} in size, of which 62.7% is [[tundra]]. There are thirty minor islands in Iceland, including the lightly populated Grímsey and the [[Vestmannaeyjar]] archipelago. Lakes and glaciers cover 14.3% of its surface; only 23% is vegetated.<ref name="NLS">{{cite web|title=Iceland in statistics |publisher=Landmælingar Íslands [National Land Survey of Iceland] |url=http://www.lmi.is/english/iceland-in-statistics/ |accessdate=22 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100406053831/http://www.lmi.is:80/english/iceland-in-statistics/ |archivedate=6 April 2010 }}</ref> The largest lakes are [[Þórisvatn]] reservoir: {{Convert|83|–|88|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and [[Þingvallavatn]]: {{Convert|82|km2|sqmi|r|abbr=on}}; other important lakes include [[Lagarfljót]] and [[Mývatn]].

Geologically, Iceland is part of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a ridge along which the [[oceanic crust]] spreads and forms new oceanic crust. This part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume, causing Iceland to be [[subaerial]] (above the surface of the sea). The ridge marks the boundary between the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[North American Plate]]s, and Iceland was created by [[rift]]ing and [[accretion (geology)|accretion]] through volcanism along the ridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.is/country-and-nature/nature/Geology/ |title=Geology of Iceland |publisher=Iceland.is |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090414113144/http://www.iceland.is:80/country-and-nature/nature/Geology/ |archivedate=14 April 2009 }}</ref>

Many [[fjord]]s punctuate Iceland's 4,970-kilometre (3,088-mile) long coastline, which is also where most settlements are situated. The island's interior, the [[Highlands of Iceland]], is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand, mountains and [[lava field]]s. The major towns are the capital city of [[Reykjavík]], along with its outlying towns of [[Kópavogur]], [[Hafnarfjörður]] and [[Garðabær]], nearby [[Reykjanesbær]] where the international airport is located, and the town of [[Akureyri]] in northern Iceland.

A geologically young land, Iceland is located on both the [[Iceland hotspot]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], which runs right through it.

Iceland has many [[geyser]]s, including [[Geysir]], from which the English word is derived, and the famous [[Strokkur]], which erupts every 8–10&nbsp;minutes. After a phase of inactivity, Geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000. Geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

With the widespread availability of [[geothermal power]], and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for [[hydroelectricity]], most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating and electricity. The island is composed primarily of [[basalt]], a low-[[silica]] [[lava]] associated with [[effusive eruption|effusive volcanism]] as has occurred also in [[Hawaii]]. Iceland, however, has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure), many producing more evolved lavas such as [[rhyolite]] and [[andesite]]. Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with approx. 30 volcanic systems active.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Carmichael, I.S.E. |year=1964 |title=The Petrology of Thingmuli, a Tertiary Volcano in Eastern Iceland |journal=J.

{{Main|Climate of Iceland}}

The climate of Iceland's coast is subpolar [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. The warm [[North Atlantic Current]] ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world. Regions in the world with similar climates include the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Alaska Peninsula]], and [[Tierra del Fuego]], although these regions are closer to the equator. Despite its proximity to the Arctic, the island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter. Ice incursions are rare, the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lamb H. |year=1995 |title=Climate, History and the Modern World |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415127351 }}</ref>

The climate varies between different parts of the island. Generally speaking, the south coast is warmer, wetter and windier than the north. The Central Highlands are the coldest part of the country. Low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid. Snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south.

The highest air temperature recorded was {{Convert|30.5|°C|°F}} on 22 June 1939 at Teigarhorn on the southeastern coast. The lowest was {{Convert|−38|°C|°F|1}} on 22 January 1918 at Grímsstaðir and Möðrudalur in the northeastern hinterland. The temperature records for Reykjavík are {{Convert|26.2|°C|°F}} on 30 July 2008, and {{Convert|−24.5|°C|°F|1}} on 21 January 1918.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. Approximately three quarters of the island are barren of vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland, which is regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Iceland is the northern birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]''), which formerly formed forests over much of Iceland, along with aspens (''[[Populus tremula]]''), rowans (''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]''), common junipers (''[[Juniperus communis]]'') and other smaller trees, mainly willows.

When the island was first settled, it was extensively forested. In the late 12th century, [[Ari the Wise]] described it in the [[Íslendingabók]] as "forested from mountain to sea shore".<ref name="Dirt">{{cite book |author=David R. Montgomery |title=Dirt: The Erosion of Civilisations |publisher=University of California Press |year=2007 |pages=224–225 }}</ref> Permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin, volcanic soils and limited [[species richness|species diversity]]. The forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber.<ref name="wildlife"/> [[Deforestation]], climatic deterioration during the [[Little Ice Age]] and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to [[erosion]].

The animals of Iceland include the [[Icelandic sheep]], [[Icelandic cattle|cattle]], [[Icelandic chicken|chicken]]s, [[Icelandic goat|goat]]s, the sturdy [[Icelandic horse]], and the [[Icelandic Sheepdog]], all descendants of animals imported by Europeans. Wild mammals include the Arctic fox, [[mink]], mice, rats, rabbits and [[reindeer]]. [[Polar bear]]s occasionally visit the island, travelling on icebergs from Greenland.

[[File:Politics Of Iceland.svg|thumb|450px|The political system of Iceland]]

Iceland has a [[left–right politics|left–right]] [[multi-party system]]. Following the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 parliamentary election]], the biggest parties are the centre-right [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] (''Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn'') and the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] (''Framsóknarflokkurinn''). Other political parties with seats in the Althing are the centre-left [[Social Democratic Alliance]] (''Samfylkingin''), [[Left-Green Movement]] (''Vinstrihreyfingin&nbsp;– grænt framboð''), [[Bright Future (Iceland)|Bright Future]] (''Björt framtíð''), and the [[Pirate Party Iceland|Pirate Party of Iceland]] (''Píratar''). Many other parties exist on the municipal level, most of which run only locally in a single municipality.

Iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 34</ref> Known as the Women's List or Women's Alliance (''Kvennalistinn''), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women.

Iceland is a [[representative democracy]] and a [[parliamentary republic]]. The modern parliament, ''Alþingi'' (English: [[Althing]]), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch. It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period and suspended in 1799. Consequently, "it is arguably the world's oldest [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]."<ref>Del Giudice, Marguerite (March 2008) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2008/03/iceland/del-giudice-text "Power Struggle"]. ''National Geographic''. p. 85.</ref> It currently has 63 members, elected for a maximum period of four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/ |title=Government & Politics |publisher=Iceland.is |accessdate=10 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100118153818/http://www.iceland.is:80/government-and-politics/ |archivedate=18 January 2010 }}</ref> The president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years, with no term limit.

The [[president of Iceland]] is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat, but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum. The current president is [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]]. The head of government is the prime minister who, together with the [[Cabinet of Iceland|cabinet]], is responsible for [[executive (government)|executive]] government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent [[Sveinn Björnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944.

The governments of Iceland have always been coalition governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently. In 1980, Icelanders elected [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state. She retired from office in 1996. In 2009, Iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] became prime minister.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/11/us-iceland-gaymarriage-idUSTRE65A3V020100611 "Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote"]. Retrieved 30 March 2012</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Iceland}}
Iceland is divided into regions, constituencies and municipalities. There are eight regions which are primarily used for statistical purposes; the district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division.<ref name = "CIA Govt"/> Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution, they were changed to the current six constituencies:
:* ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Reykjavík North]]'' and ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Reykjavík South]]'' (city regions);
:* ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Southwest]]'' (four [[Enclave and exclave|non-contiguous]] suburban areas around Reykjavík);
:* ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Northwest]]'' and ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|Northeast]]'' (northern half of Iceland, split); and,
:* ''[[Constituencies of Iceland|South]]'' (southern half of Iceland, excluding Reykjavík and suburbs).

The redistricting change was made in order to balance the weight of different districts of the country, since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjavík city area. The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system, but still exists.<ref name = "CIA Govt"/>

There are 74 municipalities in Iceland which govern local matters like schools, transport and zoning.{{Citation needed|date = May 2012}} These are the actual [[Administrative division|second-level subdivision]]s of Iceland, as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes. Reykjavík is by far the most populous municipality, about four times more populous than [[Kópavogur]], the second one.<ref name = "CIA Govt"/>

{{Main|Foreign relations of Iceland|Accession of Iceland to the European Union}}

Iceland, which is a member of the [[UN]], [[NATO]], [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] and [[OECD]], maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with the Nordic countries, Germany, the United States, Canada and the other NATO nations are particularly close. Historically, due to cultural, economic and linguistic similarities, Iceland is a [[Nordic country]], and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the [[Nordic Council]].

Iceland is a member of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), which allows the country access to the single market of the European Union (EU). It was not a member of the EU, but in July 2009 the Icelandic parliament, the Althing, voted in favour of application for EU membership<ref>{{Cite news|author = Associated Press in Reykjavík|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/16/iceland-parliament-votes-eu-membership|title = Icelandic parliament votes for EU membership |work = The Guardian|date = 16 July 2009|accessdate = 10 February 2010|location = London}}</ref> and officially applied on 17 July 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/07/17/iceland.eu.application/index.html?eref=edition_business|publisher = CNN|title = Iceland applies to join European Union|date = 17 July 2009}}</ref> However, in 2013, opinion polls showed that many Icelanders were now against joining the EU; following [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|recent elections]] the two parties that formed the island's new government – the centrist Progressive Party and the right-wing Independence Party – announced they would hold a referendum on EU membership.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22624110|title = Icelanders to get a referendum on joining the EU|publisher = BBC News|date = 22 May 2013T}}</ref>

Icelanders remain especially proud of their role in hosting the historic 1986 [[Reykjavík Summit|Reagan–Gorbachev summit]] in Reykjavík, which set the stage for the end of the [[Cold War]]. Iceland's principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over [[fishing rights]]. Conflict with the United Kingdom led to a series of so-called Cod Wars in 1952–1956 due to the extension of Iceland's fishing zone from {{Convert|3|to|4|nmi|km mi|1|abbr = on|lk = in}}, 1958–61 following a further extension to {{Convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr = on}}, 1972–73 with another extension to {{Convert|50|nmi|km mi|1|abbr = on}}; and in 1975–76 another extension to {{Convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr = on}}.

According to the [[Global Peace Index]], Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world, due to its lack of armed forces, low crime rate, and high level of socio-political stability.<ref>[http://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/PDF/2011/2011%20GPI%20Results%20Report.pdf 2011 METHODOLOGY, RESULTS & FINDINGS]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}.

Historically, Iceland's economy depended heavily on fishing, which still provides 40% of export earnings and employs 7% of the work force.<ref name = "CIA Govt"/> The economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports: fish and fish products, aluminium, and [[ferrosilicon]]. [[Whaling in Iceland]] has been historically significant. Iceland still relies heavily on fishing, but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90% in the 1960s to 40% in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.org/us/the-embassy/trade-economy/ |title=Trade and Economy, Embassy of Iceland, Undated.

Until the 20th century, Iceland was among the poorest countries in Western Europe. Currently, it remains one of the most developed countries in the world.

On 28 October 2008, the Icelandic government raised interest rates to 18% (as of August 2010, it was 7%), a move which was forced in part by the terms of acquiring a loan from [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).

On 26 January 2009, the coalition government collapsed due to the public dissent over the handling of the financial crisis. A new left-wing government was formed a week later and immediately set about removing Central Bank governor Davíð Oddsson and his aides from the bank through changes in law. Davíð was removed on 26 February 2009 in the wake of protests outside the Central Bank.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5811719.ece|title = Iceland’s central bank chief David Oddsson is forced out|last = Gilmore|first = Gráinne|date = 27 February 2009|work = [[The Times]]|accessdate = 22 April 2010|location = London}}</ref>

[[Route 1 (Iceland)|Route 1]], or the Ring Road (Icelandic: ''Þjóðvegur 1'' or ''Hringvegur''), was completed in 1974, and is a main road that runs around Iceland and connects all the inhabited parts of the island, with the interior of the island being uninhabited. This paved road is {{Convert|1337|km|0|abbr = on}} long with one lane in each direction, except near larger towns and cities and in the [[Hvalfjörður Tunnel]] (also the site of a toll) where it has more lanes. Many bridges on it, especially in the north and east, are single lane and made of timber and/or steel.

The main hub for international transport is [[Keflavík International Airport]], which serves Reykjavík and the country in general. It is {{Convert|48|km|0|abbr = on}} to the west of Reykjavík. Domestic flights, flights to [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], and business flights operate mostly out of [[Reykjavík Airport]], which lies in the city centre. Most general aviation traffic is also in Reykjavík. There are 103 registered airports and airfields in Iceland; most of them are unpaved and located in rural areas. The biggest airport in Iceland is Keflavík International Airport and the biggest airfield is Geitamelur, a four-runway field around {{Convert|100|km|0|abbr = on}} east of Reykjavík, dedicated exclusively to gliding.

===Education and science===
{{See also|Education in Iceland}}
[[File:Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík (main building, 2004).jpg|thumb|Reykjavík Junior College (''[[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík]]''), located in downtown Reykjavík, is the oldest [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Iceland]]

The [[Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Ministry of Education, Science and Culture]] is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. However, playschools, primary schools, and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities. The government does allow citizens to [[Homeschooling|Home educate]] their children, however under a very strict set of demands.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/Mayor-Does-Not-Feel-School-Should-Be-Mandatory|title = ReadArticle / Mayor Does Not Feel School Should Be Mandatory|language = Is|publisher = Grapevine.is|date = 25 August 2011|accessdate = 22 September 2012}}</ref> Students must adhere closely to the government mandated curriculum, and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate.

Nursery school, or ''leikskóli'', is non-compulsory education for children younger than six years, and is the first step in the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 1994. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible.

[[File:Haskoli Islands main building.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the [[University of Iceland]]]]

Compulsory education, or ''grunnskóli'', comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often is conducted at the same institution. Education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16&nbsp;years. The school year lasts nine months, beginning between 21 August and 1 September, ending between 31 May and 10 June. The minimum number of school days was once 170, but after a new teachers' wage contract, it increased to 180. Lessons take place five days a week. All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity, although an exemption may be considered by the [[Minister of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Minister of Education]].<ref name = "Jonathan Fox">{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=rE0NcgxNaKEC&pg=PA118|author = Fox, Jonathan|title = A World Survey of Religion and the State (Cambridge Studies in Social Theory, Religion and Politics)|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|quote = All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity. Formally, only the Minister of Education has the power to exempt students from this but individual schools usually grant informal exemptions.|isbn = 978-0-521-70758-9|year = 2008}}</ref>

Upper secondary education, or ''framhaldsskóli'', follows lower secondary education. These schools are also known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]] in English. Though not compulsory, everyone who has had a compulsory education has the right to upper secondary education. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 1996. All schools in Iceland are mixed sex schools. The largest seat of higher education is the [[University of Iceland]], which has its main campus in central Reykjavík. Other schools offering university-level instruction include [[Reykjavík University]], [[University of Akureyri]], [[Agricultural University of Iceland]] and [[Bifröst University]].

An OECD assessment found 64% of Icelanders aged 25–64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, which is lower than the OECD average of 73%. Among 25- to 34-year-olds, only 69% have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, significantly lower than the OECD average of 80%.<ref name = "Iceland – OECD Better Life Index"/> Nevertheless, Iceland's education system is considered to be of excellent quality: the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] currently ranks it as the 16th best performing, above the OECD average.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf|title = What Students Know and Can Do: Student Performance in Reading, Mathematics and Science 2010|publisher = OECD.org|accessdate = 24 April 2012}}</ref> Students were particularly proficient in reading and mathematics.

According to a 2013 [[Eurostat]] report by the [[European Commission]], Iceland spends around 3.11% of its GDP on scientific research and development (R&D), over 1 percentage point higher than the EU average of 2.03%, and has set a target of 4% to be reached by 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/pdf/state-of-the-union/2012/countries/iceland_2013.pdf |title=Research and innovation in Iceland, country profile |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=24 March 2015 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A 2010 [[UNESCO]] report found that out of 72 countries that spend the most on R&D (100&nbsp;million US dollars or more), Iceland ranked 9th by proportion of GDP, tied with Taiwan, Switzerland, and Germany and ahead of France, the UK, and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001899/189958E.pdf|title = UNESCO science report, 2010: the current status of science around the world; 2010|format = PDF}}</ref>

The original population of Iceland was of [[Nordic race|Nordic]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin. This is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as [[blood type]] and genetic analyses. One such genetics study has indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin, meaning many settlers of Iceland were indeed Norwegian Viking warriors who brought Gaelic slaves with them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Helgason|first1 = Agnar|year = 2000|title = Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic Ancestry in the Male Settlers of Iceland|pmc = 1287529|journal = American Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 67|issue = 3|pages = 697–717|doi = 10.1086/303046|pmid = 10931763|last2 = Sigureth Ardóttir|first2 = S|last3 = Nicholson|first3 = J|last4 = Sykes|first4 = B|last5 = Hill|first5 = EW|last6 = Bradley|first6 = DG|last7 = Bosnes|first7 = V|last8 = Gulcher|first8 = JR|last9 = Ward|first9 = R|displayauthors = 9|last10 = Stefánsson|first10 = Kári}}

Iceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the [[Settlement of Iceland|Age of Settlement]]. The biopharmaceutical company [[deCODE genetics]] has funded the creation of a [[genealogy]] database which attempts to cover all of Iceland's known inhabitants. It views the database, called ''[[Íslendingabók (genealogical database)|Íslendingabók]]'', as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases, given the relative isolation of Iceland's population.

The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000–60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and [[bubonic plague]]s adversely affected the population several times.<ref name = tomasson>{{Cite book|last = Tomasson|first = Richard F.|title = Iceland, the first new society|publisher = U of Minnesota Press|year = 1980|isbn = 0-8166-0913-6|page = 63}}</ref> There were 37 [[famine]] years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lancaster|first=H.

In December 2007, 33,678 people (13.5% of the total population) living in Iceland had been born abroad, including children of Icelandic parents living abroad. Around 19,000 people (6% of the population) held foreign citizenship. [[Polish diaspora|Polish]] people make up the largest minority group by a considerable margin, and still form the bulk of the foreign workforce. About 8,000 Poles now live in Iceland, 1,500 of them in [[Fjarðabyggð]] where they make up 75% of the workforce who are constructing the Fjarðarál aluminium plant.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35572|title = Iceland: Migration Appears Here Too&nbsp;– IPS|publisher = Ipsnews.net|accessdate = 10 February 2010}}</ref> The recent increase in [[immigration]] has been credited{{by whom|date=November 2014}} to a [[labour shortage]] due to the booming economy at the time, as well as to the lifting of restrictions on the movement of people from the countries that were a part of the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Large-scale construction projects in the east of Iceland (see [[Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant]]) have also brought in many people whose stay is expected to be temporary.

The southwest corner of Iceland is the most densely populated region. It is also the location of the capital Reykjavík, the northernmost national capital in the world. The largest towns outside the Greater Reykjavík area are [[Akureyri]] and [[Reykjanesbær]], although the latter is relatively close to the capital.

Iceland's official written and spoken language is [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] descended from [[Old Norse]]. In grammar and vocabulary, it has changed less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages; Icelandic has preserved more verb and noun [[inflection]], and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages. The puristic tendency in the development of Icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning, in addition to centuries of isolation. Icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the [[runic]] letter [[Þ]] in [[Latin script]]. The closest living relative of the Icelandic language is [[Faroese language|Faroese]].

[[Icelandic Sign Language]] was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011. In education, its use for Iceland's deaf community is [[Legal recognition of sign languages|regulated]] by the ''National Curriculum Guide''.

[[English language|English]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] are compulsory subjects in the school curriculum. Both languages are widely understood and spoken.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.icelandexport.is/english/about_iceland/icelandic_language/|title = Icelandic Language|work = Iceland Trade Directory|publisher = icelandexport.is|accessdate = 22 April 2010}}</ref> Other commonly spoken languages are [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. Danish is mostly spoken in a way largely comprehensible to Swedes and Norwegians—it is often referred to as ''skandinavíska'' (i. e. ''Scandinavian'') in Iceland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heimur.is/heimur/leit/frettir/Default.asp?ew_1_a_id=138249 |title=Heimur&nbsp;– Útgáfufyrirtækið |publisher=Heimur.is |accessdate=8 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110511213824/http://www.heimur.is/heimur/leit/frettir/Default.asp?ew_1_a_id=138249 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}</ref>

Rather than using family names, as is the usual custom in most western nations, Icelanders carry [[patronymic]]/[[matronymic]] surnames, patronyms being far more commonly practiced. Patronymic last names are based on the first name of the father, while matronymic names are based on the first name of the mother. These follow the person's given name, e.g. ''Elísabet Jónsdóttir'' ("Elísabet, Jón's daughter" (Jón, being the father)) or ''Ólafur Katrínarson'' ("Ólafur, Katrín's son" (Katrín being the mother)).<ref>[http://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/Surnames Surnames – Nordic Names Wiki – Name Origin, Meaning and Statistics].

Icelanders have freedom of religion under the [[Constitution of Iceland]], though the [[Church of Iceland]], a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] body, is the [[state church]]. The Registers Iceland keeps account of the religious affiliation of every Icelandic citizen. In 2015, Icelanders were divided into religious groups as follows:
*73.8% members of the [[Church of Iceland]].
*11.7% members of some other [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination.
*7.1% other and not specified
*5.6% unaffiliated
*1.5% members of non-[[Christianity|Christian]] denomination.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Iceland}}
Icelandic culture has its roots in North Germanic traditions. [[Icelandic literature]] is popular, in particular the [[sagas of Icelanders|sagas]] and [[edda]]s that were written during the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]]. Centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the country's Nordic culture from external influence; a prominent example is the preservation of the [[Icelandic language]], which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Scandinavian languages.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In contrast to other Nordic countries, Icelanders place relatively great importance on independence and self-sufficiency; in a public opinion analysis conducted by the [[European Commission]], over 85% of Icelanders found independence to be "very important," compared to 47% of Norwegians, 49% of Danes, and an average of 53% for the EU25.<ref name = "europeancommission">{{Cite book|url = http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|title = Social values, Science and Technology analysis|publisher = European Commission Eurobarometer|date = June 2005|page = 35|format = PDF}}</ref> Icelanders also have a very strong work ethic, working some of the longest hours of any industrialised nation.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], pp. 65, 70.</ref>

According to a poll conducted by the OECD, 66% of Icelanders were satisfied with their lives, while 70% believed that their lives will be satisfying in the future. Similarly, 83% of people in Iceland reported having more positive experiences in an average day than negative ones, compared to an OECD average of 72%, which makes Iceland one of the [[happiest country|happiest countries]] in the OECD.<ref name = "Iceland – OECD Better Life Index"/> A more recent 2012 survey found that around three quarters of respondents stated they were satisfied with their lives, compared to a global average of about 53%.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2012/01/05/iceland-among-the-happiest-nations/|title = Iceland among the happiest nations|publisher = Icenews.is|date = 5 January 2012}}</ref>

Iceland is liberal with regard to [[LGBT]] rights issues. In 1996, the Icelandic parliament passed legislation to create [[registered partnership]]s for same-sex couples, conferring nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage. In 2006, parliament voted unanimously to grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in adoption, parenting and assisted insemination treatment. On 11 June 2010, the [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Icelandic parliament amended the marriage law]], making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals, making Iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise [[same-sex marriage]]. The law took effect on 27 June 2010.<ref name = "gaymarriage">{{cite web|title = Iceland parliament votes for gay marriage|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/11/iceland-parliament-votes-for-gay-marriage/|publisher = Icenews.is|accessdate = 9 July 2010}}</ref> The amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for same-sex couples are now no longer possible, and marriage is their only option—identical to the existing situation for opposite-sex couples.<ref name = "gaymarriage"/>

Icelanders are known for their deep sense of community: an OECD survey found that 98% believe they know someone they could rely on in a time of need, higher than in any other industrialised country. Similarly, only 6% reported "rarely" or "never" socializing with others.<ref name = "Iceland – OECD Better Life Index"/> This high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population, as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment, which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], pp. 66–67.</ref>

[[Egalitarianism]] is highly valued among the people of Iceland, with income inequality being among the lowest in the world.<ref name = "autogenerated1"/> The constitution explicitly prohibits the enactment of noble privileges, titles, and ranks.<ref name = "autogenerated60">[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], pp. 60–61.</ref> Everyone is addressed by their first name.

===Literature===
{{Main|Icelandic literature}}
[[File:Möðruvallabók f13r.jpg|thumb|A page of [[Njáls saga]] from [[Möðruvallabók]]. The sagas are a significant part of the Icelandic heritage]]
Iceland's best-known classical works of literature are the [[Icelanders' sagas]], prose epics set in Iceland's age of settlement. The most famous of these include ''[[Njáls saga]]'', about an epic blood feud, and ''[[Grænlendinga saga]]'' and ''[[Saga of Erik the Red|Eiríks saga]]'', describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (modern [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]). ''[[Egils saga]]'', ''[[Laxdæla saga]]'', ''[[Grettis saga]]'', ''[[Gísla saga]]'' and ''[[Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu]]'' are also notable and popular Icelanders' sagas.

A translation of the Bible was published in the 16th century. Important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse, most famously the [[Passion Hymns]] of [[Hallgrímur Pétursson]], and ''[[rímur]]'', rhyming epic poems. Originating in the 14th century, ''rímur'' were popular into the 19th century, when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential, [[Romantic nationalism|National-Romantic]] writer [[Jónas Hallgrímsson]]. In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably [[Halldór Laxness]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). [[Steinn Steinarr]] was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.

Icelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world. For its size, Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation.<ref name = "autogenerated60"/> Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3396.htm|title = Cultural Achievements|publisher = State.gov|date = 15 June 2012|accessdate = 12 October 2012}}</ref> and around 10% of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 61.</ref> Because of its rich literary tradition, Iceland has many educational opportunities for writers.[http://www.icelandwritersretreat.com/]

===Art===
{{Main|Icelandic art}}
The distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for [[History of Iceland#Home rule and sovereignty|home rule and independence]], which was very active in the mid-19th century.

Contemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of [[Þórarinn Þorláksson]], who, following formal training in art in the 1890s in [[Copenhagen]], returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924, almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape. Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] at that time, including [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]], who together with Þórarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of Þórarinn and Ásgrímur. These included [[Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval|Jóhannes Kjarval]] and [[Júlíana Sveinsdóttir]]. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic [[volcanic rock]] that dominates the Icelandic environment. [[Einar Hákonarson]] is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.

In the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://this.is/klingogbang/text.php?lang=en&|title=Kling & Bang Gallery, This.is|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> [[The Living Art Museum]], Reykjavík Municipal Art Museum, [[Reykjavík Art Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Iceland]] are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Iceland}}
Much Icelandic music is related to [[Nordic music]], and includes vibrant [[folk music|folk]] and pop traditions, medieval music group [[Voces Thules]], alternative and indie rock bands [[The Sugarcubes]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], jazz fusion band [[Mezzoforte (band)|Mezzoforte]], musicians [[Björk]] and [[Emilíana Torrini]], and [[post-rock]] band [[Sigur Rós]]. The [[national anthem]] of Iceland is ''[[Lofsöngur]]'', written by [[Matthías Jochumsson]], with music by [[Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson]].<ref>{{cite web|title = The Icelandic National Anthem|work = musik og saga|accessdate = 11 November 2005|url = http://www.musik.is/Lof/E/lofe.html}}</ref>

[[File:Bjork Hurricane.jpg|thumb|Musician [[Björk]], the best-known Icelandic musician]]
Traditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by [[Pump organ|harmonium]]s. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur. Rímur are epic tales, usually [[a cappella]], which can be traced back to [[skald]]ic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes.<ref>Cronshaw, Andrew. (1999) "Iceland". In ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: Rough Guides Ltd. pp.&nbsp;168–69.</ref> The best known rímur poet of the 19th century was [[Sigurður Breiðfjörð]] (1798–1846). A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of Iðunn.{{Clarify|reason = What is Iðunn? Since it began in 1929, it must be something different from the goddess Iðunn.|date = October 2012}}

Icelandic contemporary music consists of a big group of bands, ranging from [[pop-rock]] groups such as [[Bang Gang]], [[Quarashi]] and [[Amiina]] to solo ballad singers like [[Bubbi Morthens]], [[Megas]] and [[Björgvin Halldórsson]]. [[Independent music]] is very strong in Iceland, with bands such as [[múm]], The Sugarcubes, [[HAM (band)|HAM]], [[Of Monsters and Men]], [[Sigur Rós]], [[Sóley]] and Viking metal band [[Skálmöld]], as well as solo artists [[Emilíana Torrini]] and [[Mugison]].

Some Icelandic jazz musicians and jazz bands have earned a reputation outside Iceland. Perhaps best known is the jazz fusion band Mezzoforte and Los Angeles-based jazz vocalist [[Anna Mjöll]]. Many Icelandic artists and bands have enjoyed international success, most notably Björk and Sigur Rós but also Quarashi, [[Hera Hjartardóttir|Hera]], [[Ampop]], [[Mínus]] and múm. The main music festival is arguably [[Iceland Airwaves]], an annual event on the Icelandic music scene, where Icelandic bands along with foreign ones play in the clubs of Reykjavík for a week. [[Electronic music]]ians include ones such as Thor and [[GusGus]].

Among Iceland's best-known classical composers are [[Daníel Bjarnason]] and [[Anna S. Þorvaldsdóttir]] (Anna Thorvaldsdottir), who in 2012 received the [[Nordic Council Music Prize]] and in 2015 was chosen the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s Kravis Emerging Composer, an honor that includes a $50,000 cash prize and a commission to write a composition for the orchestra; she is the second recipient.<ref>Michael Cooper, "Philharmonic Chooses Anna Thorvaldsdottir for Emerging Composer Program," New York Times, June 5, 2015, URL=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/philharmonic-chooses-anna-thorvaldsdottir-for-emerging-composer-porgram/</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Icelandic cuisine|Þorramatur}}
[[File:Thorramatur.jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[Þorramatur]] assortment]]
Much of Iceland's cuisine is based on fish, [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], and [[dairy product]]s, with little to no utilization of herbs or spices. Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food. [[Þorramatur]] is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes, and is usually consumed around the month of [[Month#Germanic calendar|Þorri]], which begins on the first Friday after 19 January. Traditional dishes also include [[skyr]], [[hákarl]] (cured shark), cured ram, singed sheep heads, and [[black pudding]]. [[Puffin]] is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.

Breakfast usually consists of pancakes, cereal, fruit, and coffee, while lunch may take the form of a [[smörgåsbord]]. The main meal of the day for most Icelanders is dinner, which usually involves fish or lamb as the main course. Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly [[cod]] and [[haddock]] but also [[salmon]], [[herring]], and [[halibut]]. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as ''[[hangikjöt]]'') or salt-preserved (''saltkjöt''). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as ''[[slátur]]'', which consists of [[offal]] (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach. Additionally, boiled or mashed potatoes, pickled cabbage, green beans, and rye bread are prevalent side dishes.

Coffee is a popular beverage in Iceland, and is drunk at breakfast, after meals, and with a light snack in mid-afternoon. [[Coca-Cola]] is also widely consumed, to the extent that the country is said to have one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 126</ref> Iceland's signature alcoholic beverage is ''[[Brennivín]]'' (literally "burnt (i.e. distilled) wine"), which is similar to Scandinavian [[akvavit]]. It is a type of [[vodka]] made from distilled potatoes and flavoured with either [[caraway]] seeds or [[angelica]]. Its potency has earned it the nickname ''svarti dauði'' ("Black Death").

===Sports===

[[Team handball|Handball]] is considered Iceland's national sport.<ref name=handball/>]]
Sport is an important part of Icelandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 109</ref> The main traditional sport in Iceland is ''[[Glíma]]'', a form of [[wrestling]] thought to have originated in medieval times.

Popular sports include association football, [[track and field]], [[Team handball|handball]] and [[basketball]]. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,<ref name=handball>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 110</ref> and [[Iceland national handball team|Iceland's men's national team]] is ranked among the top 12 in the world. The [[Iceland national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] football championship for the first time. Icelandic women excel at football relative to the size of the country, with the [[Iceland women's national football team|national team]] ranked 15th by [[FIFA]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=f/fullranking.html|title = FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking|publisher = FIFA|date = 2 August 2013|accessdate = 23 September 2013}}</ref> In 2014 [[Iceland national basketball team|Iceland men's national basketball team]] qualified into the [[EuroBasket 2015]] for the first time in the country history.

Iceland has excellent conditions for [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ice climbing]] and [[rock climbing]], although [[mountain climbing]] and [[hiking]] are preferred by the general public. Iceland is also a world-class destination for alpine ski touring and [[Telemark skiing]], with the Troll Peninsula in Northern Iceland being the main centre of activity. Although the country's environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there are nevertheless lots of golf courses throughout the island, and Iceland has a greater percentage of the population playing golf than Scotland with over 17,000 registered golfers out of a population of approximately 300,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tee Off In The Midnight Sun of Reykjavik|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/sport/other-sport/golf/tee-midnight-sun-reykjavik-4449000|accessdate=4 May 2016|date=25 Jun 2013}}</ref> Iceland hosts an annual international golf tournament known as the Arctic Open played through the night during the summer solstice at [[Akureyri Golf Club]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Daley|first1=Paul|title=Golf Architecture:  A Worldwide Perspective, Volume 4|date=2008|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781589806160|page=92}}</ref><ref name = w111>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 111</ref> Iceland has also won the most competitions for [[World's Strongest Man]], with eight titles shared evenly between [[Magnús Ver Magnússon]] and [[Jón Páll Sigmarsson]].

Swimming is popular in Iceland. Geothermally heated outdoor pools are widespread, and swimming courses are a mandatory part of the national curriculum.<ref name = w111/> [[Horseback riding]], which was historically the most prevalent form of transportation on the island, remains a common pursuit for many Icelanders.

The oldest sport association in Iceland is the Reykjavík Shooting Association, founded in 1867. Rifle shooting became very popular in the 19th century with the encouragement of politicians and nationalists who were pushing for Icelandic independence. To this day, it remains a significant pastime.<ref>{{cite web|title = Skotfélag Reykjavíkur|accessdate = 2 September 2007|url = http://sr.is/Stofnun_og_saga_SR.htm|archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071013013843/http://sr.is/Stofnun_og_saga_SR.htm|archivedate = 13 October 2007}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>

Iceland has also produced many chess masters and hosted the historic [[World Chess Championship 1972]] in Reykjavík during the height of the [[Cold War]]. {{As of|2008}}, there have been nine Icelandic chess grandmasters, a considerable number given the small size of the population.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 112</ref> [[Bridge (card game)|Bridge]] is also popular, with Iceland participating in a number of international tournaments. Iceland won the world bridge championship (the [[Bermuda Bowl]]) in Yokohama, Japan, in 1991 and took second place (with Sweden) in Hamilton, Bermuda, in 1950.
