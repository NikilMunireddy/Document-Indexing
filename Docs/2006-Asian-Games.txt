The '''2006 [[Asian Games]]''', officially known as the '''XV Asiad''', was an [[Asia]]n multi-sport event held in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] from December 1 to December 15, 2006 with 424 events in 39 sports and disciplines featured in the games. Doha was the first city in its region and only the second in [[West Asia]] (following [[Tehran]] in [[1974 Asian Games|1974]]) to host the games.

It was the first time that all 45 member nations of the Olympic Council of Asia took part in this event. Also, [[Eurosport]] broadcast the event, marking the first time that the [[Europe]]an continent could watch this Asian sporting event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/160751/the-asian-games-live-on-eurosport |title=The Asian Games Live On Eurosport |publisher=Sportbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110526122058/http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/160751/the-asian-games-live-on-eurosport| archivedate= 26 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The final medal tally was led by [[China at the 2006 Asian Games|China]] followed by [[South Korea at the 2006 Asian Games|South Korea]] and [[Japan at the 2006 Asian Games|Japan]] with host [[Qatar at the 2006 Asian Games|Qatar]] at 9th place. Several world and Asian records were broken during the games. Though there were several controversies such as the death of [[South Korea]]n equestrian rider [[Kim Hyung-chil]] in a fatal accident during the competition, the games were deemed generally successful with the rising standard of competition amongst the Asian nations.

==Bid==
On November 12, 2000,  voting for the 2006 venue took place in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]. The voting involved the 41 members of the [[Olympic Council of Asia]] and consisted of three rounds, each round eliminating one of the bidding cities.<ref>"申辦亞運香港慘敗", Page A1, ''Apple Daily'', November 13, 2000, quoting Dato’ Sieh Kok Chi, Honorary Secretary of the Olympic Council of Malaysia.</ref><ref>[http://sports.sina.com.cn/o/1394173.shtml 香港申亚失败心不服], ''体育周报'', November 13, 2000</ref> After the first round, [[New Delhi]] was eliminated, with only two votes. The second round of voting, with three remaining candidates, gave Doha as the result.<ref name=one>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/137753/malaysia-amazed-at-losing-asian-games-to-qatar |title=Malaysia Amazed at Losing Asian Games to Qatar |publisher=Sportbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110526122028/http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/137753/malaysia-amazed-at-losing-asian-games-to-qatar| archivedate= 26 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Under the regulations of the OCA, a candidate which gains half of the available votes will automatically be selected as the host, and the remaining rounds of voting will be cancelled. When Doha gained 22 out of 41 votes this meant they were selected to host the 2006 Asian Games. Most of Qatar's votes came from the unanimous support from [[West Asia]]n countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com.cn/BIG5/paper68/1983/318416.html |title=People's Daily |publisher=People.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02}}</ref>

After the major upset, Malaysia and Hong Kong, China expressed their disappointment. Malaysia said that the selection of Doha was ridiculous and that the selection of Doha was influenced by Qatar's economic wealth.<ref name=one/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/13/asian.games/index.html |title=Choice of Qatar for Asian Games prompts cries of foul |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date=2000-11-13 |accessdate=2011-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110520082824/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/13/asian.games/index.html| archivedate= 20 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

According to South Korea National Olympic Committee president Kim Jung Kil, sources on the course said that the horse mistimed his jump in the wet conditions and slipped. South Korean officials are asking for an inquiry to determine if mismanagement or rain was the cause of the death.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/sports/view_article.php?article_id=36949 Koreans demand probe into death fall] {{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref>

"In my professional opinion, neither the weather nor the footing had any bearing on this accident. If the horse falls, it's like two tons of bricks falling on you. There is nothing you can do about it," said Andy Griffiths, the Games event's technical overseer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SPORT/12/08/asia.games/index.html |title=Asia Games death 'tragic accident' |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2011-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110521224925/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SPORT/12/08/asia.games/index.html| archivedate= 21 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Closing ceremony===
The closing ceremony featured the [[Arabic]] stories of a thousand years ago. It started with the same young boy as the "Seeker" in the opening ceremony. He flew on a ''[[magic carpet]]'' to a book of Arabian stories. "''A Thousand and One Nights''" featured stories such as ''Haroun Al-Raschid and the Dervish'', ''[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]'', ''[[Sinbad the Sailor]]'' and ''Aladdin and his Marvellous Lamp''. The show used an array of dancers, horses, and special effects to portray the different stories. After that, the segment of "''Land of the Oryx''" was shown with the whirling of dance.

All 45 nations' athletes entered the stadium after the show's end. [[Park Tae-hwan]] was announced as the best athlete of the Games, having won seven medals, three of them being golds from the swimming competitions. The ceremony also included a minute of silence in homage to the South Korean equestrian rider [[Kim Hyung-chil]], who died during the competition.

After that, the OCA President [[Sheikh]] [[Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah|Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah]] officially announced the Games closed and passed the OCA flag to the mayor of [[Guangzhou]], Zhang Guangning, as the host of the next Asian Games in 2010.

A special 10&nbsp;minutes in the final part of the closing ceremony showed a new China, known as "''Oriental Charm''", which featured Chinese culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200612/12/eng20061212_331681.html |title=Chinese culture to take spot at closing ceremony of Doha Asiad |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2011-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110605230051/http://english.people.com.cn/200612/12/eng20061212_331681.html| archivedate= 5 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Followed by the theme song of the Game "Triumph of the One" sung by [[Lea Salonga]] from the [[Philippines]]. Afterwards, fireworks blazed around the stadium and brought the curtains down on the Games. The breath-taking fireworks display is also one of the most expensive fireworks display in multi-sports event.

==Problems==

===Criticism===
Despite the spectacular opening ceremony, which received high praise, there was some criticism by some delegations and athletes. Heavy rain poured down just after the end of opening ceremony, and many believed that the organizers did not have plans to deal with it, creating a chaotic situation. Chef de Mission of the Philippines, Butch Ramirez, said that some of the members of the Philippine delegation, including athletes, were soaked in the rain because the organising officials did not allow them to re-enter the covered stadium for shelter; instead they had to stay in the heavy rain for more than 30&nbsp;minutes. He went on to say that the breakdown in transportation protocols due to the rain caused the athletes to rush to the nearest bus station, exposing them to rain. Ramirez said that he himself was a victim of pushing and shoving due to this chaos, and that because of it, he suffered from an [[asthma]] attack.<ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/12/03/SPRT2006120381405.html Rains spoil ‘best’ opening ceremony]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>

According to one IOC insider who arrived back at his hotel soaked, this incident hurt the chances of Doha hosting the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], which Doha applied for on 25 October 2007, and lost on 4 June 2008 when they were eliminated from the pool. Transportation was one of the crucial factors involved in the decision process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1165157932 |title=Rain Could Dampen Qatar’s 2016 Bid |publisher=Gamesbids.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518165934/http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1165157932| archivedate= 18 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Name dispute===
Iran threatened to boycott the event after a brochure was published in December 2004, in which the [[Persian Gulf]] was misnamed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=12277|title=Iran threatens to boycott 2006 Doha Asian Games|publisher=middle-east-online.com|date=28 December 2004|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

===Bed shortage===
The Games' organizers faced significant bed shortages due to the record number of more than 13,000 athletes and officials who attended the 2006 Games. The Athletes' Village had space for only 10,500 people and was not large enough to accommodate the record amount of attendees. To resolve the problem, organizers contracted with three cruise ships to provide sleeping quarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200611/24/eng20061124_324929.html |title=Doha Asian Games faces bed shortage |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2011-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606035629/http://english.people.com.cn/200611/24/eng20061124_324929.html| archivedate= 6 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Last minute withdrawals===
The Football competition lost three teams due to withdrawals and a suspension, which resulted rescheduling of the format and draws. Following the withdrawal of [[Maldives]] women's football team in early November, the women's football competition was forced to redraw to ensure both groups had an equal number of teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=115520&version=1&template_id=49&parent_id=29 |title=Men’s and women’s football draw held |publisher=Gulf-times.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02}}</ref> Not much later, [[Turkmenistan national football team|Turkmenistan]] announced their withdrawal due to the lack of options available in Qatar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/16/sports/AS_SPT_SOC_Asian_Games_Turkmenistan_Withdraws.php |title=Turkmenistan soccer team withdraws from Asian Games |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2011-05-02}}</ref> [[Yemen national football team|Yemen]] also withdrew because the team was unable to afford a drug test after some of their players were accused of doping.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061127232814/http://football.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-6237831,00.html Yemen withdrew following doping concerns – AFC]</ref>

India made big changes to its team close to the opening ceremonies. On November 22, 2006, the Indian sports dropped eight of the 32 events they had previously announced that they would be contesting in the Games.  The dropped events were football, basketball, handball, [[sepak takraw]], triathlon, ten-pin bowling and rugby sevens. The events were dropped due to the lack of medal hopes and to cut costs. As a result, 387 athletes were sent to Doha instead of the original 589 proposed by the [[Indian Olympic Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/11/23/spt14.htm |title=Indian government cuts jumbo Asiad squad |publisher=Dawn.com |date=2006-11-23 |accessdate=2011-05-02}}</ref>

While volleyball also had three teams withdraw from the Games, Palestine withdrew due to the travelling difficulties caused by the closure of the [[Gaza Strip]] border. Indonesia and Turkmenistan also withdrew from the tournament, for unknown reasons, just hours before their first preliminary round match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200611/27/eng20061127_325405.html |title=Palestine quits men's volleyball event at Doha Asia |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2006-11-27 |accessdate=2011-05-02}}</ref>
