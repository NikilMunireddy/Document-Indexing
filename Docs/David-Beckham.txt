His parents were fanatical [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] supporters who would frequently travel to [[Old Trafford]] from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of [[Bobby Charlton]]'s football schools in [[Manchester]] and won the chance to take part in a training session at [[FC Barcelona]], as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers&nbsp;– coached by his father, Stuart Underwood and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and attended [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for [[Brimsdown Rovers F.C.|Brimsdown Rovers]]' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|title=Becks' Brimsdown boost, article from 24 September 2004|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFAVase/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/09/BecksBrimsdownBoost.htm|work=TheFA.com|accessdate=7 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308012358/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFAVase/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/09/BecksBrimsdownBoost.htm|archivedate=8 March 2008}}</ref> He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a [[Youth Training Scheme]] contract on 8 July 1991.<ref name="YTS">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A1138600|title=David Beckham - Rise of a Footballer|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>

==Club career==

===Manchester United===

====Youth and early career====
Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,<ref name="H2G2">{{cite web| url=http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A1138600| title=David Beckham - Rise of a Footballer| website=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition| publisher=Not Panicking Ltd| accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref> Beckham was part of a group of young players, including [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Gary Neville]], [[Phil Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]], who were coached by [[Eric Harrison (footballer)|Eric Harrison]], and helped the club win the [[FA Youth Cup]] in [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1990s#1991/92: Manchester United v. Crystal Palace (3-1 and 3-2, 6-3 Aggregate)|May 1992]]. Known as the 'Class of '92', all six players came through Manchester United ranks together and went on to be teammates for over a decade.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2496231/Manchester-Uniteds-Class-92-film-trailer-featuring-David-Beckham-Gary-Neville-Ryan-Giggs-Paul-Scholes-Phil-Neville-Nicky-Butt.html "Watch the newly released 'Class of '92' trailer as Beckham, Giggs, Scholes, Butt and the Nevilles get together for new film"]. Mail Online. Retrieved 9 November 2015</ref> Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.<ref name="H2G2" />

Manchester United would again reach the [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1990s#1992/93: Leeds United v. Manchester United (2-0 and 2-1, 4-1 Aggregate)|final of the FA Youth Cup]], where they would face [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute [[Robbie Savage]]. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham would also receive honours with the club's reserve team, when the squad would win the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham went on to gain his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his [[UEFA Champions League]] debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] in the final game of the group stage. However, despite the victory they finished third out of four in their group behind [[FC Barcelona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1994/standings/index.html|title=Champions League 1994/95 Standings|author=uefa.com|work=UEFA.com|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>

====Preston North End (loan)====
He then went to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on loan for part of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]] to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a [[corner kick]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2988104.stm |title=Beckham's pride at OBE |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2003 |accessdate=4 March 2011 }}</ref>

====Return to Manchester United====
Beckham returned to Manchester and finally made his [[Premier League]] debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995, in a goal-less draw against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and missed a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for the [[1995 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 20 May, which they lost 1–0 and were left without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.<ref>Graham Hart (1995). "The Guinness football encyclopedia". p. 69. Guinness</ref>

United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as "[[Fergie's Fledglings]]"), which included [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Gary Neville|Gary]] and [[Phil Neville]]. When experienced players [[Paul Ince]], [[Mark Hughes]], and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] left the club after the end of the 1994–95 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including [[Darren Anderton]], [[Marc Overmars]], and [[Roberto Baggio]], but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3–1 defeat at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],<ref>The most famous comment was [[Alan Hansen]]'s "You can't win anything with kids", quoted in ''The Boss'' 405. Beckham scored United's goal (his first for them in the league) from a distance of around 30&nbsp;metres.</ref> with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game; however, United would recover from this early season defeat and the young players performed well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Sir-Alex-25-Years/Trophies/Trophy-Articles/League-199596.aspx|title=Man Utd season review 1995/96|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>

Beckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and [[FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and also provided the [[corner kick|corner]] that [[Eric Cantona]] scored from in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his team-mates had overhauled the [[Tyneside]]rs at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly (and to a consistently high standard) for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Euro 96 stars going strong |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/01/Euro96_Feature.htm |work=The Football Association |date=21 January 2005 |accessdate=16 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308012323/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/01/Euro96_Feature.htm |archivedate=8 March 2008}}</ref>

At the beginning of the [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]] season David Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the [[Premier League]] season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper [[Neil Sullivan]] was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.<ref>[[Sky Sports]]' commentator [[Martin Tyler]]'s words ''"You'll see that over and over again"'' proved prophetic as the goal was voted Premier League Goal of the Decade in 2003.</ref>

When Beckham scored his famous goal, he did so in [[Adidas Predator]] shoes custom-made for [[Charlie Miller]] ("Charlie" embroidered on boots), which had been given to Beckham by mistake.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://specials.rediff.com/sports/2004/apr/27pic2.htm|title=Beckham's Golden Boots|publisher=Rediff.com|date=27 April 2004}}</ref> In a UK poll conducted by [[Channel 4]] in 2002, the British public voted the goal No.18 in the list of the [[100 Greatest Sporting Moments]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest_sporting/results.html|title=100 GREATEST SPORTING MOMENTS – RESULTS|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> During the 1996–97 season, Beckham became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United helping them to retain the Premier League championship, and was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] by his peers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/football/awards/pfayoung.php|title=English PFA Young Player of the Year Award|publisher=napit.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2007}}</ref>

On 18 May 1997, Eric Cantona retired as a player and left the coveted number 7 shirt free, and with Teddy Sheringham arriving from Tottenham Hotspur as Cantona's successor, Beckham left his number 10 shirt for Sheringham and picked up the iconic number 7 shirt, famously worn by club legends [[George Best]], [[Bryan Robson]], and [[Eric Cantona]], and subsequently by [[Cristiano Ronaldo]].<ref>{{cite news |last=McDonnell |first=David |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/cristiano-ronaldo-exclusive-716711 |title=Cristiano Ronaldo exclusive |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=18 December 2014 |work=The Mirror}}</ref> Manchester United started the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98 season]] well but erratic performances in the second half of the season saw United finish second behind [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Track/5880/fix1998.html|title=Fixture List for 1997/98 Season|publisher=geocities.com|accessdate=16 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731113715/http://geocities.com/Colosseum/Track/5880/fix1998.html|archivedate=31 July 2009}}</ref>

[[File:1999 FA Cup Final Beckham corner.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham preparing to take a corner kick for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] during the [[1999 FA Cup Final]] at Wembley Stadium]]
In the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]], he was part of the United team that won [[The Treble]] of the Premier League, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], a unique feat in English football.<ref name="treble"/> There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham decided to stay at Manchester United.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Legends/David-Beckham.aspx?pageNo=2|title=Manchester United Legends: David Beckham|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>

To ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to [[Tottenham Hotspur]] (with reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be easily beaten to prevent their deadly local rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] from retaining the title), but Tottenham took an early lead in the match.<ref name="treble"/> Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United went on to win the match and the league.<ref name="treble"/>

Beckham played in central midfield in United's win over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]], since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and [[Roy Keane]] were suspended for the match.<ref name="treble">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_treble_triumph/354262.stm|title=The Kings of Europe|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> United were losing the match 1–0 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham.<ref name="treble"/> Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to [[Rivaldo]] for 1999's [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] and [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/ballondor/archive/edition=1999901999/|title=Rivalso on top of the world|author=FIFA.com|work=FIFA.com|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>

Despite Beckham's achievements in the 1998–99 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's [[FIFA Club World Cup|World Club Championship]] match against [[Club Necaxa|Necaxa]]. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Man Utd's flawed genius? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/593905.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=6 October 2005 }}</ref> but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000]] by an 18-point margin – after being pushed by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/738587.stm|title=Man Utd celebrate in style|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>

By the early 2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had [[gastroenteritis]], but Ferguson was furious when [[Victoria Beckham]] was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages – then £50,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been ''"fair to his teammates"''<ref>''The Boss'' 469.</ref> Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin.
<blockquote>
"He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part."' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ferguson-will-never-talk-to-the-bbc-again-401487.html|title=Ferguson will never talk to the BBC again|last=Harris|first=Nick|date=6 September 2007|work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=30 April 2009 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

He was a key player in United's third successive league title in [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]] – only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League.

On 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]], breaking the second [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] bone in his left foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine [[Aldo Duscher]], and [[England national football team|England]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] were due to meet in that year's World Cup.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did 'hatchet man' target Beckham? |publisher=ESPN Socernet |date=2 April 2002 |url=http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2002/0402/20020411featwright.html |accessdate=7 October 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716052613/http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2002/0402/20020411featwright.html |archivedate=16 July 2006}}</ref> The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] by [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the world at the time.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Beckham signs new contract |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/newsid_1976000/1976699.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2002 |accessdate=7 October 2005 }}</ref> Despite the injury, 2001–02 was arguably Beckham's best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best of his career.

Following an injury early in the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]], Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an [[FA Cup]] defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/2778985.stm|title=Man Utd play down Arsenal rift|date=19 February 2003|publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Matrix: Milan are favourites|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia//dec21o.html|work=Football Italia|publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=21 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224070722/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia//dec21o.html|archivedate=24 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/04/28/1234261/silvestre-reminisces-about-fergusons-infamous-boot-throwing-at-be |title=Silvestre Reminisces About Ferguson's Infamous Boot-Throwing at Beckham Incident |publisher=Goal.com |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?Revealed:_What_happened_when_Beckham_was_hit_by_a_boot_in_the_face&in_article_id=638192&in_page_id=43 |title=Revealed: What happened when Beckham was hit by a boot in the face |work=Metro |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/18653/Silvestre_relives_Ferguson_throwing_boot_at_Beckham.aspx |title=Silvestre relives Ferguson throwing boot at Beckham |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>

Beckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], one Intercontinental Cup, and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind [[Ryan Giggs]] (having joined them at the same time as [[Nicky Butt]], [[Gary Neville]] and [[Paul Scholes]]).

[[File:Beckham zidane.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beckham (top) and [[Zinedine Zidane]] at Real Madrid in August 2003]]
In the week before Beckham presentation, Real named [[Carlos Queiroz]] as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham got reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid since Queiroz spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of the pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons; however, the presence of global marketing icon such as Beckham made this particular tour a financial smash for ''los Merengues''.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Did the Real Madrid Leave behind for Asia? |work=China Daily |date=21 August 2003 |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-08/15/content_255106.htm |accessdate=25 July 2010 }}</ref>

Shortly after his Real switch, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of [[Live Nation Entertainment|SFX Europe]] who had guided him through his career up until this point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with [[Simon Fuller]] and his company [[19 Entertainment]] that already managed the career of Victoria.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.77</ref> Beckham also appointed close friend [[Terry Byrne]] to be his personal manager.<ref name=galaxy-millions/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3229703.stm |title=Beckham bags Watford man |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 October 2003 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>

In late August 2003, Real Madrid won the [[2003 Supercopa de España|Spanish Super Cup]] over two legs versus [[RCD Mallorca]], with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3–0 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing on a star-laden team which included three former [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] recipients, [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Ronaldo]] and [[Luís Figo]], in addition to [[Roberto Carlos (footballer)|Roberto Carlos]], Raúl and [[Iker Casillas]], Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5–3–2 formation with two fullbacks [[Michel Salgado]] and Roberto Carlos often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield alongside Zidane and Figo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t2003-042.html |title=2003–04 Real Madrid |publisher=Bdfutbol.com |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}</ref>

Real Madrid were runners-up in the [[2003–04 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president Pérez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of [[gasoline|petrol]]. Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.<ref>{{cite web |title=Intruder alert for Victoria Beckham |publisher=Manchester Online |date=20 July 2004 |url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/124/124434_intruder_alert_for_victoria_beckham.html |accessdate=9 October 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222010135/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/124/124434_intruder_alert_for_victoria_beckham.html |archivedate=22 February 2006}}</ref>

The league season began with new head coach [[José Antonio Camacho]] behind the bench, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant [[Mariano García Remón]] took over on temporary basis as Real leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling [[Ben Thatcher]] in an England match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next [[Yellow card (sports)|caution]], and had picked up an injury, which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. [[The Football Association]] asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had "made a mistake" and apologised.<ref>{{Cite news |title=FA wants explanation from Beckham |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/3735276.stm |accessdate=6 October 2005 |date=14 October 2004}}</ref> He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. Having received a [[Misconduct (football)|yellow card]], he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.

By Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second league spot, García Remón was gone as [[Vanderlei Luxemburgo]] became the new head coach. However, the well-traveled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in the runner-up spot. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against [[Getafe CF]]. One day later Luxemburgo got the axe and was replaced with [[Juan Ramón López Caro]]. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists.

[[File:Beckham warmingup.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Warming up with Real Madrid in August 2006]]
During the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and he was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maul|first=Kimberly|title=David Beckham: Soccer Star and Book Judge|url=http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001842661|publisher=The Book Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212115110/http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001842661|archivedate=12 December 2007|date=11 January 2006}}</ref> 
Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005–06 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and reached the last 16 only in the Champions League after losing to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as Pérez resigned his president post in January 2006 with [[Vicente Boluda]] named as replacement on interim basis until the end of the season.

The summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as club president elections were held. [[Ramón Calderón]] became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials that served under the previous president were kept, including head coach López Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach [[Fabio Capello]], Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier [[José Antonio Reyes]] was normally preferred on the right wing. In the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contract negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director [[Predrag Mijatović]] announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/10/sports/web.0110beckham.php |title=Uncertainty over Beckham's future at Real Madrid |work=International Herald Tribune |date=10 January 2007 |accessdate=10 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080220071830/http://www.iht.com:80/articles/2007/01/10/sports/web.0110beckham.php |archivedate=20 February 2008 }}</ref>

On 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for [[LA Galaxy]] beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he would continue to train with the team.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6259063.stm|title=Real coach calls time on Beckham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2007|accessdate=13 January 2007}}</ref> A few days later while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calderón said that Beckham is "going to Hollywood to be half a film star", adding "our technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except Los Angeles".<ref>{{Cite news |first=Jack |last=Bell |title=Real Madrid Club President Says a Mouthful

However, about a month later, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against [[Real Sociedad]] on 10 February 2007.

On 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3–1 win over [[RCD Mallorca]], which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0–1 Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by [[José Antonio Reyes]] who scored two goals leading the team to that season's [[2006–07 La Liga|La Liga title]], their first since Beckham had signed with them and [[Real Madrid C.F.#Domestic competitions|30th overall in the club's history]]. Although Real and Barca both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham.<ref name="Liga"/> With his wife and children along with celebrity friends [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Katie Holmes]] watching from a luxury box at Bernabeu Stadium, it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.<ref name="Liga">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6759697.stm|title=Beckham bows out with Liga title|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>

Towards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, [[Real Madrid]] announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Millward |first=Robert |title=Agent: Beckham Sticking to Galaxy Deal |work=The Washington Post |date=10 June 2007 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/10/AR2007061000751.html |accessdate=14 August 2008 }}</ref> Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival to the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.36</ref>

A month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600&nbsp;million during Beckham's four years at the club.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Paul |last=Maidment |title=Becks And Bucks |url=http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/sports/2007/07/07/beckham-soccer-marketing-face-markets-cx_pm_0707autofacescan01.html |work=Forbes |date=7 July 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101184121/http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/sports/2007/07/07/beckham-soccer-marketing-face-markets-cx_pm_0707autofacescan01.html|archivedate=1 November 2008 }}</ref>

Beckham's involvement with [[Major League Soccer]] began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] side [[LA Galaxy]]. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the [[2007 MLS SuperDraft]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Halpin |first=Jason |title=Events surround MLS SuperDraft |url=http://la.galaxy.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070110&content_id=81545&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp|publisher=MLSnet.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527211351/http://la.galaxy.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070110&content_id=81545&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp |archivedate=27 May 2008 |date=1 October 2007}}</ref>
[[File:Beckham first goal LA Galaxy.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham scores his first goal for LA Galaxy with a trademark free-kick.]]
The announcement made top news all across the globe. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250&nbsp;million,<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/01/11/beckham.mls/ Beckham will play for MLS' L.A. Galaxy in $250M deal]; ''Sports Illustrated'', 11 January 2007 {{wayback|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/01/11/beckham.mls/ |date=20130725000850 }}</ref> the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency [[19 Entertainment]]).<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.43</ref> To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the 5-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a 5-year contract worth US$32.5&nbsp;million in total or $6.5&nbsp;million per year.<ref name="galaxy-millions">{{Cite news |title=Beckham rejected Milan and Inter to take Galaxy millions |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/beckham-rejected-milan-and-inter-to-take-galaxy-millions-431736.html |work=The Independent |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=9 September 2008 |location=London |first=Sam |last=Wallace }}</ref><ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.42</ref>

The high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new 5-year shirt sponsorship deal with [[Herbalife]] nutrition company worth US$20&nbsp;million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home ground, the [[StubHub Center|Home Depot Center]]).<ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.44">''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.44</ref> Even the LA Galaxy owners [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) saw an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as China, where the company had been working aggressively in Shanghai and Beijing for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO [[Tim Leiweke]] put it as follows: "Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed".<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.45</ref>

In the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|MLS expansion]] franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25&nbsp;million whenever he stopped playing in the league<ref name="Kennedy">{{cite news|url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/51723/beckham-is-mls-expansion-story-du-jour.html|title=Beckham is MLS expansion story du jour|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|date=20 May 2013|work=Soccer Business Insider}}</ref> – an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his 5-year contract.<ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.44"/> In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2&nbsp;million home on San Ysidro Drive in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.66">''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.66</ref>

Beckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the famous Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.16</ref> Beckham chose to wear number 23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.socceramerica.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&s=22622&Nid=32279&p=406999|title=The Beckham has Landed|publisher=socceramerica.com|accessdate=14 July 2007|date=13 July 2007}}</ref>

In parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', a few weeks earlier [[Adidas]] launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign "Fútbol meets Football" starring Beckham and NFL running back [[Reggie Bush]], and ''W'' magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]]. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running "Hello, Goodbye" promotional campaign and it also agreed to air ''David Beckham: New Beginnings'' documentary produced by 19 Entertainment and directed by Gary Brooks before the friendly match versus [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by [[Simon Fuller]], who in turn has a business relationship with the [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big a splash as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&nbsp;million headquarters in [[Century City]] with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.67</ref> That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special ''[[Victoria Beckham: Coming to America]]'' aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, pp.69–70</ref>

[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007 Direction.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Beckham became the LA Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team]]
On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for [[Alan Gordon (soccer)|Alan Gordon]] in the 78th minute of a 0–1 friendly loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as part of the [[World Series of Soccer (MLS)|World Series of Soccer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|title=David Beckham's First Match in Major League Soccer Live on ESPN Saturday, 21&nbsp;July|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=14 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224213616/http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|archivedate=24 December 2008}}</ref> With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, [[Eva Longoria]], [[Mary-Kate Olsen]], governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], [[Alicia Silverstone]] and [[Drew Carey]] among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play completely took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Michael Ballack]], [[Frank Lampard]], and [[John Terry]], the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by [[Steve Sidwell]] whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN. For comparison [[ESPN2]]'s weekly MLS broadcasts on Thursdays drew a consistent 0.2 rating on virtually no promotion while [[Freddy Adu]]'s MLS debut televised on ABC back in 2004 earned a 1.3 rating.<ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.66"/> As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than [[2007 Open Championship|British Open]] golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the [[2007 IndyCar Series season|Indy Racing League]]'s [[2007 Honda 200|Honda 200]] motor race.<ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.66"/>

The day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood [[A-list]]ers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]''.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.68–70</ref>

Beckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the [[North American SuperLiga]] and an MLS game away at [[Toronto FC]] though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star [[King Edward Hotel (Toronto)|Le Méridien King Edward]] in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.85–87</ref>
[[File:Beckham LA Galaxy cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008]]
Two weeks after his 12-minute appearance vs. Chelsea, still not fully healed Beckham finally made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus [[D.C. United|DC United]] in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average DC United home crowd) at the [[RFK Stadium]], coming on for [[Quavas Kirk]] in the 71st minute.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/2007-08-09-beckham-debut_N.htm |title=Beckham makes MLS debut but Galaxy stumbles in D.C. |work=USA Today |accessdate=15 August 2007 |first=Beau |last=Dure |date=12 August 2007 }}</ref> Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, even if only 70 percent fit, Beckham left a mark during the remaining twenty plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that [[Carlos Pavón]] failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Donovan's path that United's keeper [[Troy Perkins]] managed to break up in the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was at [[New England Revolution]] and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the [[Gillette Stadium]]'s artificial surface.

Beckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing DC United, in the [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]] semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=453684&root=mls&cc=5901|title=Beckham takes captain's armband to great effect|publisher=ESPN |date=16 August 2007}}</ref> He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for [[Landon Donovan]] in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2–0 victory, and a place in the [[2007 North American SuperLiga|North American SuperLiga]] final versus [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] on 29 August.

During the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan revealing that he had sprained his [[medial collateral ligament]] and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1–0 loss to the [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]]. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league).

Beckham trained with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] from 4 January 2008 for three weeks, until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7171836.stm |title=Beckham begins Arsenal training |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref> Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in the ninth minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&cc=5901 |title=Beckham, Donovan propel L.A. past Quakes |publisher=ESPN |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080408050045/http://soccernet.espn.go.com:80/report?id=237757&cc=5901 |archivedate=8 April 2008 }}</ref> On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the [[Kansas City Wizards]] 3–1, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70&nbsp;yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] at [[Selhurst Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=538785&root=mls&cc=5901 |title=ESPNsoccernet – MLS – Canales: Beckham shows scoring touch against Wizards |publisher=ESPN |first=Andrea |last=Canales |accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref> Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.

In 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under [[Fabio Capello]] led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying matches]] in 2009.

Beckham was unveiled at Milan's [[Milanello|training facility]] by the club's chief executive [[Adriano Galliani]] on 20 December 2008. The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by [[Christian Vieri]], as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by [[Alexandre Pato]] and club captain [[Massimo Ambrosini]], respectively.

He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4–1 victory over [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=612673&&cc=5901 |title=Beckham scores first goal for AC Milan |publisher=ESPN |date=25 January 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}</ref> Though Beckham was expected to return to L.A. in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan, in a bid to sustain his England career through the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. However, Milan failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10–15&nbsp;million range.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=616973&cc=5901 |title=Galaxy reject AC Milan's opening gambit for Becks |publisher=ESPN |date=7 February 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}</ref>

===Return to Galaxy===
After his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying "Go home fraud", and "Part-time player".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Beckham booed by furious fans |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8159287.stm |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref> However, the Galaxy had [[2009 Los Angeles Galaxy season|a much more successful season]] than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 [[Western Conference (MLS)|Western Conference final]] after a 2–0 overtime victory over the [[Houston Dynamo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/sports/soccer/15galaxy.html|title=Two Blackouts and Two Goals Send Galaxy to M.L.S.

In the [[2009 MLS Cup|final]] on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to [[Real Salt Lake]] by 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw.

====Return to Milan (loan)====
In November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/nov/02/david-beckham-milan-loan|title=David Beckham's loan move to Milan from LA Galaxy is confirmed|date=2 November 2009|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return in a Milan shirt, playing 75&nbsp;minutes of a 5–2 victory over [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8444755.stm|title=David Beckham makes winning return for AC Milan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 January 2010|accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref> On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for the first time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76&nbsp;minutes of the match at the [[San Siro]] – which ended 3–2 to Manchester United – before being substituted for [[Clarence Seedorf]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Lyon |title=AC Milan 2–3 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8515983.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2010 }}</ref>

Beckham returned to [[Old Trafford]] for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for [[Ignazio Abate]] in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 4–0 AC Milan (agg 7–2) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8558023.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2010 }}</ref> Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner [[Malcolm Glazer]]. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around [[Manchester United Supporters' Trust]] gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. However, when asked about it later Beckham responded that protests are not his business.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Beckham shows true colours |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2010/03/beckham_shows_true_colours.html |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2010 }}</ref>

In Milan's next game, against [[A.C.

===Second return to Galaxy===
[[File:David Beckham 2010 LA Galaxy.jpg|thumb|upright|Beckham in 2010]]
On 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3–1 win over [[Columbus Crew]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8991596.stm|title=David Beckham returns to action after Achilles injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2010|accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> On 4 October, Beckham scored a trademark free kick in a 2–1 win over [[C.D.

During January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager [[Harry Redknapp]], the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11675_6742492,00.html |work=Sky Sports |title=AEG blocked Becks switch | date=9 February 2011}}</ref> As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier.

====MLS Cup champion====
[[File:David Beckham 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham with LA Galaxy in 2012]]
On 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4–1 victory over [[Sporting Kansas City]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/los-angeles/soccer/post/_/id/8106/galaxy-donovan-possession-spark-big-win|title=Donovan, possession spark big win|publisher=ESPN Los Angeles|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner in a 2–1 win over [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], repeating a feat he also achieved while playing for [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2011-07-10-948918221_x.htm|title=Beckham scores from corner to give Galaxy victory|work=USA Today|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref>

After having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won three league titles in three different countries, when Los Angeles won their third [[MLS Cup]] against [[Houston Dynamo]], winning 1–0 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player, [[Robbie Keane]].<ref name="MLS final">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7263458/mls-cup-landon-donovan-goal-powers-galaxy-third-mls-title |title=MLS Cup – Landon Donovan's goal powers Galaxy to third MLS title |publisher=ESPN |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Grant|last=Wahl|title=Hollywood Ending: If this was indeed David Beckham's final game in MLS, he went out in style, carrying the Galaxy to a championship and affirming the value of star power in America|date=28 November 2011|publisher=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1192446/index.htm|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> Had it been Beckham's final match for the Galaxy, it would have been the third time he has won a league championship in his final match for a club, repeating the feat he accomplished with Manchester United in 2003 and Real Madrid in 2007.<ref name="MLS final"/>

Following the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive [[Supporters' Shield]], having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011.

==International career==

Beckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], starring in an impressive 5–1 victory over [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened in England's final qualifying game against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] on 6 October 2001.<ref name="Greece">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2002/1575190.stm|title=England reach World Cup finals|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2–1 with little time remaining.

Beckham was partially fit by the time of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] held in Japan and South Korea, and played in the first match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. After the events of four years earlier, Beckham achieved a degree of revenge over Argentina by scoring the winning goal with a penalty, causing Argentina to fail to qualify for the knockout stage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/argentina_v_england/default.stm|title=England's revenge|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> England defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in the second round with Beckham providing an assist in a 3-0 win.

The following month, at the opening ceremony of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester, Beckham escorted [[Kirsty Howard]] as she presented the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Jubilee Baton to the Queen]]. Beckham played in all of England's matches at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]].

In England's opening game at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an [[own-goal]] by [[Carlos Gamarra]] as England won 1–0.

Having stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach [[Steve McClaren]] on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was "looking to go in a different direction" with the team, and that Beckham "wasn't included within that."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4782613.stm|title=McLaren ends Beckham England era|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future.

On 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in England's first match at the new [[Wembley Stadium]] and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain [[John Terry]]. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer [[Diego Ribas da Cunha|Diego]] equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], Beckham sent two trademark assists for [[Michael Owen]] and [[Peter Crouch]], helping England to prevail 3–0.

==Personal life==
[[File:David y Victoria Beckham.jpg|thumb|upright|Beckham and his wife [[Victoria Beckham]] at the 2007 British Grand Prix at Silverstone]]
In 1997, Beckham started dating [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria Adams]], after she attended a Manchester United match. She was famously known as "Posh Spice" of the pop music group [[Spice Girls]], one of the world's top pop groups at the time, and his team was also enjoying a great run of success. Therefore, their relationship instantly attracted a great deal of media attention. The couple were dubbed "[[Posh and Becks]]" by the media. He proposed to her on 24 January 1998 in a restaurant in [[Cheshunt]], England.

On 4 July 1999, David and Victoria married at [[Luttrellstown Castle]] in Ireland. The wedding attracted tremendous media coverage.

Beckham appeared in ''[[Goal! 3: Taking on the World]]'', which was released [[straight to DVD]] on 15 June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0065743/ |title=David Beckham |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref> Despite moving to Los Angeles, California, Beckham has expressed no personal interest in pursuit of acting roles, saying he is too "stiff".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/gossip/david-beckham/david-beckham-hollywood-snub.html|title=David Beckham's Hollywood snub|publisher=askmen.com|accessdate=15 August 2007|date=2 March 2007}}</ref> Beckham appears as a projectionist in the [[Guy Ritchie]] action film ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

==Records==
Beckham captained [[England national football team|England]] 59 times,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/WorldCup2006/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2006/06/BeckhamStandsDown.htm|title=Beckham stands down|date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=14 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228070225/http://www.thefa.com/WorldCup2006/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2006/06/BeckhamStandsDown.htm|archivedate=28 February 2009}}</ref> the fourth highest after [[Bobby Moore]] (90), [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] (90) and [[Bryan Robson]] (65). With his free kick goal against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] in the second round of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], Beckham gained membership into two of football's exclusive clubs: he became the only English player – and the 21st player regardless of nationality – to score in three world cups; [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] teammate [[Raúl González|Raúl]] also achieved this feat a few days earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991536.stm |title=England 1–0 Ecuador |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> It also made him only the fifth player in World Cup history to score twice from a direct free kick; the other four were [[Pelé]], [[Roberto Rivelino]], [[Teófilo Cubillas]], and [[Bernard Genghini]] (Beckham had previously scored this way against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] in the first round of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]). All three goals were against South American teams (Colombia, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and Ecuador) and from set pieces (the two aforementioned free kicks and a penalty against Argentina).<ref name="Colombia"/><ref name="Ecuador"/>

==Tattoos==
As of 2013, Beckham had a total of 32 tattoos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a480787/david-beckham-i-dont-regret-any-of-my-32-tattoos.html|title=I don't regret any of my 32 tattoos|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref> There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and the name of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in [[Hindi]] script because Beckham thought it would be "tacky" to have it in English. Unfortunately, this was misspelt as the equivalent of 'Vihctoria'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1044797.stm |title=Beckham's tattoo misspelt |publisher=BBC News |date=28 November 2000 |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> Another tattoo is a Bible verse written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], reads אני לדודי ודודי לי הרעה בשושנים, translated into: "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine, that shepherds among the lilies." In his autobiography "David Beckham: My Side", he revealed some of his thoughts on tattoos: "The idea came to me much later, a little while after Brooklyn was born. I was talking to [[Melanie Brown|Mel B]] and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar, and the subject of tattoos came up. I ended up going to this Dutch guy who'd done all of Jimmy's. I'd finally realised what I wanted a tattoo to represent. Mine are all about the people in my life, my wife and sons, who I want with me always. When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me."<ref>Beckham, David (2010). "David Beckham: My Side". HarperCollins</ref>
