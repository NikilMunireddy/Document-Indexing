The '''Primera División''' ({{IPA-es|pɾiˈmeɾa ðiβiˈsjon}}; {{lang-en|'''First Division'''}}) is a professional [[association football|football]] league in Argentina.<ref>[http://www.goalazo.com/category/argentina-primera-division/ "Argentina Primera Division"]</ref> It is the country's premier football division and is at the top of the [[Argentine football league system]]. Contested by thirty clubs, it operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the [[Primera B Nacional]] (second division), with the team placed lowest at the end of the season being relegated. The season runs from February to May.<ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/news/4455/primera-divisi%C3%B3n/2015/12/30/17151032/as%C3%AD-ser%C3%A1-el-torneo-de-primera-divisi%C3%B3n-en-2016 "Así será el torneo de Primera División"], Goal.com, 28 Dec 2015</ref>

In 1891 Argentina was the first country outside the [[United Kingdom]] to establish a football league. In the early years, only teams from [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] and  [[Rosario, Argentina|Rosario]]<ref>[http://historiayfutbol.obolog.es/argentina-1ra-division-1894-161838 Argentina - 1ra. División 1894] by José Carluccio, 19 Nov 2008</ref> were affiliated to the national association. Teams from other cities would join in later years.

The Primera División turned professional in [[1931 Argentine Primera División|1931]] when 18 clubs broke away from the amateur leagues to form a professional one. Since then, the season has been contested annually in four different formats and calendars. The league has been under its current format since the [[2014 Argentine Primera División|2014]] season.

The Argentine championship was ranked in the top 10 as one of the strongest leagues in the world (for the 2001-2012 period) by the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics]] (IFFHS). Argentina placed 7th after [[Premier League]] (England), [[La Liga]] (Spain), [[Serie A]] (Italy), [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] (Brazil), [[Bundesliga]] (Germany) and [[Ligue 1]] (France).<ref>[http://www.iffhs.de/?b883e8c00bddad5384f02785fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeed200 "The strongest Leagues of  the World of the 21st Century", IFFHS], retrieved 2013-08-12</ref>

==Format==

===Championship===
The [[2016 Argentine Primera División|2016 season]] is played with 30 teams in two zones of 15 teams, Each team will play 14 times in one [[round-robin tournament]] against the other teams in zone and two more times against the rivalry in the "[[Football rivalries in Argentina|Fecha de Clásicos]]".

The champion gains a place to play the [[Supercopa Argentina]] v. the winner of [[Copa Argentina]].

===Relegation===
Relegation is based on an [[average|averaging]] system.<ref>[http://southamerican-futbol.blogspot.com/2011/03/promedios-argentine-relegation-system.html "Promedios: The Argentine relegation system explained"]</ref> At the end of the season, the team with the worst three-year averages is relegated, while the winner of [[Primera B Nacional]] championship is promoted to Primera.

Averaging was instituted in 1983, two years after [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] were relegated in 1981. That year, [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] finished 18th out of 19 teams and would have been relegated under the old system. [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]] and [[Club Atlético Nueva Chicago|Nueva Chicago]] were the first teams to be relegated on average.<ref name=autogenerated1/> [[Boca Juniors]] was also struggling at that time and had a dismal [[1984 Argentine Primera División|1984]] season. These facts have led to speculation that the averaging system was instituted to minimize the chance of big teams being relegated.

===International Competitions===
{{main|Qualifying method of Copa Libertadores in Argentina}}

As of 2016, five teams from Argentina are eligible to play the [[Copa Libertadores]]. The champion and runner-up of Primera División automatically qualify to play the tournament. The other teams that gain a place are the runner-up of [[Copa Argentina]], the winner of "Liguilla Pre-Libertadores" (a small tournament played by teams placed 3rd. to 6th. in Primera División) and the Argentine representative best placed at [[Copa Sudamericana]].

For [[Copa Sudamericana]], six teams are elegible to play the tournament. Teams placed 7th. to 18th. in Primera División qualify to play the "Liguilla Pre-Sudamericana", where four teams will gain a place for Copa Sudamericana. The [[Supercopa Argentina]] champion and the runner-up of Liguilla Pre-Libertadores are also elegible to play the Cup.

==History==

===Round-robin tournaments (1891–1966)===
[[File:Copa Campeonato.JPG|thumb|right|170px|The ''Copa Campeonato'' was the first trophy awarded by the [[Argentine Football Association|AFA]], then abandoned <ref>[http://biblioteca.afa.org.ar/libros/libro_12/ ''Memoria y Balance 1935'' - Argentine Football Association Library]</ref> and re-issued from 2013<ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/deportes/Un-Copa-con-mucha-historia-20130627-0024.html "Una Copa con mucha historia", ''Diario Uno'', 27 June 2013]</ref> to 2015.]]

In 1891 the ''Association Argentine Football League'' was established by Alex Lamont of [[St. Andrew's Scots School]],<ref>''Historia del Fútbol Amateur en la Argentina'', by Jorge Iwanczuk. Published by Autores Editores (1992) – ISBN 9504343848</ref> being the first football league outside of the British Isles.,<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2006/jun/04/worldcup2006.football3 "Salvation Army", ''The Guardian'', 4 June 2006]</ref>  to establish a football league. The first Primera División matches were played on 12 April 1891: Buenos Aires FC vs. [[St. Andrew's Scots School|St. Andrew's]] and Old Caledonians vs. Belgrano FC.<ref name="clarin120"/><ref name="rsssf"/>

A single double [[round-robin tournament]] was played each year, and the team with the most points was crowned as champion, except for [[1936 Argentine Primera División|1936]], during that year the winners of ''Copa de Honor'' and the ''Campeonato'' played a match for the championship title. The single tournament arrangement lasted until 1966.

During this period, the traditional "big five" clubs, namely, [[Club Atlético Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]], [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]], [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]] and [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] dominated Argentine football. No other team besides them had won the league championship in these 36 years.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arghist-pro1930s.html "Final Tables Argentina 1931-1940 (Professional)" at RSSSF]</ref><ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arghist-pro1940s.html "Final Tables Argentina 1941–1950" at RSSSF]</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arghist-pro1950s.html "Final Tables Argentina 1951–1960" at RSSSF]</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arghist-pro1960s.html "Final Tables Argentina 1961-1970" at RSSSF]</ref> The most serious title challenge came from [[Club Atlético Banfield|Banfield]] in 1951, when they gained the same points with Racing Club in the league table. However, they lost 1–0 in the two-legged first place playoffs and gave the title to Racing.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

===Metropolitano and Nacional (1967–1985)===
In 1967, the single tournament format was abandoned and replaced by two championships in each year: the [[Metropolitano championship|Metropolitano]] and the [[Nacional championship|Nacional]]. The Metropolitano only allowed clubs competing the old tournament to participate, while the Nacional was open to teams from regional tournaments.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The format of competition was also altered, with the double round-robin tournament replaced by the two-group championship Metropolitano and single round-robin Nacional in that year.

This change brought about a revolution in Argentine football, as small teams, like [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] at first, and [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]], [[Chacarita Juniors]] and others in later years, broke down the hegemony of the five clubs who had won all the championships up to that date.

Between 1967 and 1969, the Metropolitano and Nacional had gone through several format changes. In the first three years, the Metropolitano was a two-group championship, with the best two teams from each group competing the semi-finals of the knock-out stage.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

The six best teams of each group would advance to the Nacional, with four more teams coming from regional tournaments, to compete for the Nacional championship in a single round-robin format. The seventh and eighth team of each group, alongside four teams from regional tournaments, played the Promocional tournament, which, in 1969, was replaced by the Petit tournament contested without regional teams. The ninth to twelfth teams of each group entered the Reclasificatorio tournament to determine the relegating teams.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

In 1970, the format of the Metropolitano and Nacional underwent a reform. Since that year, and until 1985, the Nacional had become a group tournament with playoffs, while the Metropolitano had been competed under a single or double round-robin system, except for the 1974, 1976 and 1979 edition, which were also contested as a group tournament with playoffs.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arghist-pro1970s.html "Final Tables Argentina 1971-1980" at RSSSF]</ref>

Despite the format change in 1970, teams still entered the Nacional championship, Petit tournament and Reclasificatorio tournament according to their rankings in the Metropolitano in that year. However, in 1971, the tournaments were separated. Teams did not enter the Nacional by finishing at the top ranks of Metropolitano. On the other hand, the Petit tournament and Reclasificatorio tournament were abandoned. The Metropolitano and Nacional became two truly individual tournaments. Although the old system was reused in 1972, the separation was instituted again in 1973 and was adopted throughout the remaining Metropolitano and Nacional era.

The Metropolitano was always played first, until the order of the tournaments was reversed in 1982.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arghist-pro1980s.html "Final Tables Argentina 1981-1990" at RSSSF]</ref>

===European-styled seasons (1985–1991)===
Following the advice of [[Argentina national football team]]'s then coach [[Carlos Salvador Bilardo]], the structure of play was modified in 1985. Traditionally, like other countries in Southern Hemisphere, football season began and ended according to the calendar year. However, upon the reform, European style season was adopted for the first time among all the South American countries. Moreover, instead of holding two championships every year, only one double [[round-robin tournament]] was contested, like football leagues in Europe. The team topping the table at the end of season was crowned the champion.

In 1985, after the Nacional was played, the Metropolitano was not held, while the new single tournament (1985/86) was played for the first time.

In 1988–89 season, three points were given to match winners. If a draw occurred, [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] was taken place and the winner of the shootout would get two points while the loser still had one. This format was waived in the following season.

===Apertura and Clausura (1991–2012)===
Five years later, the single championship was split into two single-round tournaments, giving birth to the [[Apertura and Clausura in Argentine football|Apertura and Clausura]] arrangement. In 1991 the two champions played winner-take-all matches. This practice was very controversial, especially since one of the biggest teams [[Boca Juniors]] lost the finals against [[Newell's Old Boys]], costing them their first official championship since 1981 despite an unbeaten run in the ''Clausura''. In 1992 the game was held as well (this time between [[Newell's Old Boys]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]), but regardless of the result (which favored [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]) both teams were awarded the title of ''Champion''. After 1992, the practice was quickly abandoned, so that two champions (on equal footing) were crowned every season and no deciding game is played.

Originally, two points were given to match winners except the 1989/90 season. In 1995/96, the rule was changed and three points were given for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss since then.

Even though the current structure provides provincial teams a road to promotion, teams from the Buenos Aires-Rosario axis still dominate. Only one team from outside this axis has ever won a title ([[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes (LP)]], 5 times), and a reversal of this trend is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.

===Inicial and Final (2012–14)===
For the 2012–13 season, the Torneo Apertura and Clausura became "Torneo Inicial" and "Torneo Final," being disputed with the same format as before but proclaiming only one champion each season, unlike the last format that had two champions (Apertura and Clausura, respectively).<ref>[http://www.continental.com.ar/noticias/deportes/afa-se-aprobaron-los-cambios-en-los-torneos-de-futbol/20120509/nota/1684705.aspx "AFA: Se aprobaron los cambios en los torneos de fútbol", Radio Continental web, 9 May 2012]</ref>

Before those changes, a controversial project for the 2012–13 season had been proposed: it consisted in a new tournament that would contain both the Primera División and Primera B Nacional teams: the former was not going to have any relegated team in its 2011–12 season and include sixteen teams from the latter, Primera B Nacional. The tournament would also include a team from the Primera B Metropolitana and one from the Torneo Argentino A, creating a thirty-eight team league. These changes were strongly opposed by the media and the people, and finally the tournament was called off. However, the project for the new format was successfully picked up starting from the 2015 season.

=== Superfinal (2013-14) ===
{{main|Copa Campeonato}}

Once Inicial and Final tournaments have finished, both winners had to play a match for the [[Copa Campeonato]] (familiarly known as ''Superfinal''). The [[Argentine Football Association|AFA]] had previously determined that the first edition (played in 2013) would be considered as a Primera División official title (2012-13 season), therefore [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]] awarded its 10th official championship after defeating [[Newell's Old Boys|Newell's]].<ref name=firstsuper>[http://deportes.clarin.com/Supercampeon_0_946705641.html "Vélez venció a Newell's y es el Supercampeón", ''Clarín'', 29 Dec 2013]</ref>

Nevertheless, from the 2014 edition it was determined that the ''Superfinal'' would not be considered as a Primera División title but an official cup.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1695307-la-afa-homologo-la-superfinal-de-river-como-una-copa-nacional "La AFA homologó la final de River como una copa nacional", Cancha Llena, 28 May 2014]</ref>

Due to this the 2015 and 2016 seasons were played as single tournaments with only one champion per season, the Copa Campeonato has not held since then.

=== 2014-present: One tournament again ===
Starting August 2014, the "Torneo de Transición" was held, with 20 teams participating (17 from the [[2013–14 Argentine Primera División season|2013–14 season]] and 3 promoted from the [[2013–14 Primera B Nacional]]). No teams were relegated at the end of the championship.<ref>[http://www.infobae.com/2014/06/03/1569964-se-sorteo-el-fixture-del-torneo-transicion-que-arrancara-agosto-y-el-super-la-10 Se sorteó el Fixture del Torneo de Transición, que arrancará en agosto y el 'Súper' en la 10ª]</ref>

In 2015 the format switched to a tournament with 30 teams. The first five clubs of the Zonas A & B of [[2014 Primera B Nacional]] season promoted to the Primera División. Those 10 teams, with the addition of the 20 clubs currently participating in the top division, qualified to contest the next season.<ref>[http://442.perfil.com/2014-11-11-320121-confirmado-el-proximo-torneo-de-afa-sera-con-30-equipos/ "Confirmado: El próximo torneo será con 30 equipos" on Perfil.com], 11 Nov 2014</ref>

That same year, the [[Argentine Football Association|AFA]] announced the format for the next five seasons of the Primera División:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afa.org.ar/upload/boletines/BOL_Comite_Ejecutivo_4978.pdf|title=Asociación del Fútbol Argentino Boletín 4978|accessdate=14 October 2015 |publisher=AFA |language=Spanish}}</ref>
