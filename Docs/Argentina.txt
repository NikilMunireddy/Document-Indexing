'''Argentina''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Argentina.ogg|ˌ|ɑr|dʒ|ən|ˈ|t|iː|n|ə}}; {{IPA-es|aɾxenˈtina|lang}}), officially the '''Argentine Republic'''{{efn-ua|name=altnames}} ({{lang-es|link=no|República Argentina}}),<!-- {{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika aɾxenˈtina|}} --> is a [[federal republic]] located in southeastern [[South America]]. Sharing the bulk of the [[Southern Cone]] with its neighbour [[Chile]], it is bordered by [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] to the north; [[Brazil]] to the northeast; [[Uruguay]] and the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to the east; Chile to the west and the [[Drake Passage]] to the south.

With a mainland area of {{convert|2780400|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},{{efn-ua|name=excl_area}} Argentina is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|eighth-largest country]] in the world, the second-largest in [[Latin America]], and the largest [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] one.
Argentina claims sovereignty over [[Argentine Antarctica|part of Antarctica]], the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|Falkland Islands]] ({{lang-es|Islas Malvinas|links=no}}), [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands sovereignty dispute|South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. The country is subdivided into twenty-three [[province]]s ({{lang-es|provincias}}, singular ''provincia'') and one [[autonomous city]] (''ciudad autónoma''), [[Buenos Aires]],  which is the [[federal capital]] of the nation ({{lang-es|Capital Federal|links=no}}) as decided by [[Argentine Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 3}}
The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a [[federal system]].

The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] period.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|p=17}} The country has its roots in [[Spanish empire|Spanish colonization]] of the region during the 16th century.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=128}} Argentina rose as the successor state of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]],{{sfnm|1a1=Levene|1y=1948|1p=11|1ps=: "[After the Viceroyalty became] a new period that commenced with the revolution of 1810, whose plan consisted in declaring the independence of a nation, thus turning the legal bond of vassalage into one of citizenship as a component of sovereignty and, in addition, organizing the democratic republic."|2a1=Sánchez Viamonte|2y=1948|2pp=196–197|2ps=: "The Argentine nation was a unity in colonial times, during the Viceroyalty, and remained so after the revolution of May 1810.

The [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration]] and [[Argentine War of Independence|fight for independence]] (1810–1818) was followed by an [[Argentine Civil Wars|extended civil war]] that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a [[federation]] of [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] with [[Buenos Aires]] as its capital city. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with [[Immigration in Argentina|massive waves of European immigration]] radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook.

==Name and etymology==
The name "Argentina" is derived from [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ("silver", ''plata'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), a noun associated with the [[Sierra de la Plata|silver mountains legend]], widespread among the first European explorers of the [[La Plata Basin]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rock|1y=1987|1pp=6, 8|2a1=Edwards|2y=2008|2p=7}}

The first written use of the name can be traced to ''[[La Argentina (poem)|La Argentina]]'',{{efn-ua|The poem's full name is ''La Argentina y conquista del Río de la Plata, con otros acaecimientos de los reinos del Perú, Tucumán y estado del Brasil''.}} a 1602 poem by [[Martín del Barco Centenera]] describing the region and the foundation of Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Traba|1985|pp=15, 71}}
Although "Argentina" was already in common usage by the 18th century, the country was formally named "Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata" by the Spanish Empire, and "United Provinces of the Río de la Plata" after independence.

The [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826 constitution]] included the first use of the name "Argentine Republic" in legal documents.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1826, art. 1}}
The name "Argentine Confederation" was also commonly used and was formalized in the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1853, Preamble}}
In 1860 a presidential decree settled the country's name as "Argentine Republic",{{sfn|Rosenblat|1964|p=78}} and that year's constitutional amendment ruled all the names since 1810 as legally valid.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1860 amd., art. 35}}{{efn-ua|Also stated in article 35 of all subsequent amendments: 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957, 1972 and 1994 (current)}}

In the [[English language]] the country was traditionally called "the Argentine", mimicking the typical Spanish usage ''la Argentina''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Argentina|title=Definition of Argentina in Oxford Dictionaries (British & World English)|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|place=Oxford, UK|date=6 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305011413/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Argentina|archivedate=5 March 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> This fell out of fashion during the mid-to-late 20th century, and now the country is simply referred to as "Argentina".

In the [[Spanish language]] "Argentina" is [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] ("''La [República] Argentina''"), taking the feminine [[article (grammar)|article]] "La" as the initial syllable of "Argentina" is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]].<ref>[http://www.studyspanish.com/lessons/defart2.htm "The Definite Article: Part II"], Study Spanish</ref>

The earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the [[Paleolithic]] period, with further traces in the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]].{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|p=17}}
Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations,{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}} which can be divided into three main groups.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=18–19}} The first group are basic hunters and food gatherers without development of [[pottery]], such as the [[Selknam]] and [[Yaghan]] in the extreme south. The second group are advanced hunters and food gatherers which include the [[Puelche]], [[Querandí]] and Serranos in the center-east; and the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] in the south—all of them conquered by the [[Mapuche]] spreading from [[Chile]]{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=13}}—and the [[Kom people (South America)|Kom]] and [[Wichi]] in the north. The last group are farmers with pottery, like the [[Charrúa]], [[Minuane]] and [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] in the northeast, with [[slash and burn agriculture|slash and burn]] semisedentary existence;{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}} the advanced [[Diaguita]] sedentary [[trade|trading culture]] in the northwest, which was conquered by the [[Inca Empire]] around 1480; the [[Toconoté]] and [[Comechingones|Hênîa and Kâmîare]] in the country's center, and the [[Huarpe]] in the center-west, a culture that raised [[llama]] cattle and was strongly influenced by the Incas.{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}}

===Colonial era===
{{main|Colonial Argentina}}
{{see also|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:La Reconquista de Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|200px|The surrender of Beresford to [[Santiago de Liniers]] during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]]]
Europeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of [[Amerigo Vespucci (explorer)|Amerigo Vespucci]]. The Spanish navigators [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] and [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=128}} In 1536 [[Pedro de Mendoza]] founded the small settlement of [[Buenos Aires]], which was abandoned in 1541.{{sfn|Crow|1992|pp=129–132}}

Further colonization efforts came from [[Paraguay]]—establishing the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata]]—[[Peru]] and Chile.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=96–140}}
[[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]] founded [[Santiago del Estero]] in 1553. [[Londres, Catamarca|Londres]] was founded in 1558; [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], in 1561; [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], in 1562; [[San Miguel de Tucumán]], in 1565.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=353}} [[Juan de Garay]] founded [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] in 1573 and the same year [[Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera]] set up [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=134}} Garay went further south to re-found Buenos Aires in 1580.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=135}} [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]] was established in 1596.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=353}}

The [[Spanish Empire]] subordinated the economic potential of the Argentine territory to the immediate wealth of the silver and gold mines in [[Bolivia]] and Peru, and as such it became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] until the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776 with Buenos Aires as its capital.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=347}}

Buenos Aires repelled [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|two ill-fated British invasions]] in 1806 and 1807.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=421}} The ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the example of the first [[Atlantic Revolutions]] generated criticism of the [[absolutist monarchy]] that ruled the country. As in the rest of Spanish America, the overthrow of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] during the [[Peninsular War]] created great concern.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=194ff}}

In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist [[Liniers Counter-revolution|counter-revolution in Córdoba]],{{sfn|Rock|1987|p=81}} but failed to overcome those of the [[Banda Oriental]], [[First Upper Peru campaign|Upper Peru]] and [[Paraguay campaign|Paraguay]], which later became independent states.{{sfn|Rock|1987|pp=82–83}}

Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the [[Unitarian Party|Centralists]] and the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalists]]—a move that would define Argentina's first decades of independence.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=39–40}} The [[Assembly of the Year XIII]] appointed [[Gervasio Antonio de Posadas]] as Argentina's first [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Director]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=39–40}}

In 1816 the [[Congress of Tucumán]] formalized the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rock|1y=1987|1p=92|2a1=Lewis|2y=2003|2p=41}} One year later General [[Martín Miguel de Güemes]] stopped royalists on the north, and General [[José de San Martín]] took an army [[Crossing of the Andes|across the Andes]] and secured the [[independence of Chile]]; then he led the fight to the Spanish stronghold of [[Lima]] and proclaimed the [[independence of Peru]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

The 1820 [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]], fought between the Centralists and the Federalists, resulted in the ''end of the Supreme Director rule''. In 1826 Buenos Aires enacted another [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|centralist constitution]], with [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] being appointed as the first president of the country. However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forced his resignation and discarded the constitution.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=43}} Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war; the latter prevailed and formed the [[Argentine Confederation]] in 1831, led by [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=45}} During his regime he faced a [[French blockade to the Río de la Plata|French blockade]] (1838–1840), the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836–1839), and a combined [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata|Anglo-French blockade]] (1845–1850), but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=46–47}} His trade restriction policies, however, angered the interior provinces and in 1852 [[Justo José de Urquiza]], another powerful [[caudillo]], [[Battle of Caseros|beat him out of power]]. As new president of the Confederation, Urquiza enacted the [[liberalism|liberal]] and federal 1853 Constitution.

[[File:El General Roca ante el Congreso Nacional.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Julio Argentino Roca]] giving his constitutionally mandated annual report to Congress, 1886|alt=]]
Overpowering Urquiza in the 1861 [[Battle of Pavón]], [[Bartolomé Mitre]] secured Buenos Aires predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country. He was followed by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] and [[Nicolás Avellaneda]]; these three presidencies set up the bases of the modern Argentine State.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. I|pp=363–541}}

Starting with [[Julio Argentino Roca]] in 1880, ten consecutive federal governments emphasized [[economic liberalism|liberal economic policies]]. The [[Immigration in Argentina|massive wave of European immigration]] they promoted—second only to the United States'—led to a near-reinvention of Argentine society and economy that by 1908 had placed the country as the seventh wealthiest{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} developed nation{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|p=1}} in the world.
Driven by this [[immigration]] wave and decreasing mortality, the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15-fold:{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=18–30}} from 1870 to 1910 Argentina's [[wheat]] exports went from {{convert|100000|to|2500000|MT|ST|abbr=on}} per year, while frozen beef exports increased from {{convert|25000|to|365000|MT|ST|abbr=on}} per year,{{sfn|Mosk|1990|pp=88–89}} placing Argentina as one of the world's top five exporters.{{sfn|Cruz|1990|p=10}} Its railway mileage rose from {{convert|503|to|31104|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|pp=2–3}} Fostered by a new [[Argentine Law 1420|public, compulsory, free and secular education]] system, [[literacy]] skyrocketed from 22% to 65%, a level higher than most [[Latin America]]n nations would reach even fifty years later.{{sfn|Cruz|1990|p=10}} Furthermore, real [[GDP]] grew so fast that despite the huge immigration influx, [[per capita income]] between 1862 and 1920 went from 67% of developed country levels to 100%:{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|pp=2–3}} In 1865, Argentina was already one of the top 25 nations by per capita income which by 1908, it had surpassed Denmark, Canada and The Netherlands to reach 7th place—behind Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium. Argentina's per capita income was 70% higher than Italy's, 90% higher than Spain's, 180% higher than Japan's and 400% higher than [[Brazil]]'s.{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} Despite these unique achievements, the country was slow to meet its original goals of industrialization:{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. I|pp=567–625}} after steep development of capital-intensive local industries in the 1920s, a significant part of the manufacture sector remained labor-intensive in the 1930s.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=37–38}}

In 1912, President [[Roque Sáenz Peña]] enacted [[Saenz Peña Law|universal and secret male suffrage]], which allowed [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]], leader of the [[Radical Civic Union]] (or UCR), to win [[Argentine general election, 1916|the 1916 election]]. He enacted social and economic reforms and extended assistance to family farmers and small businesses. Argentina stayed neutral during [[World War I]]. The second administration of Yrigoyen faced an economic crisis, influenced by the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=7–178}}

===Infamous Decade===

[[File:Museo del Bicentenario - "Retrato de Juan Domingo Perón y Eva Duarte", Numa Ayrinhac.jpg|thumb|175px|Official presidential portrait of [[Juan Domingo Perón]] and his wife [[Eva Perón]], 1948|alt=]]
In 1930, Yrigoyen [[1930 Argentine coup d'état|was ousted from power]] by the military led by [[José Félix Uriburu]]. Although Argentina remained among the fifteen richest countries until mid-century,{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} this [[coup d'état]] marks the start of the steady economic and social decline that pushed the country back into underdevelopment.<ref name=developed/>

Uriburu ruled for two years; then [[Agustín Pedro Justo]] was elected in a [[Argentine general election, 1931|fraudulent election]], and signed a controversial [[Roca-Runciman Treaty|treaty with the United Kingdom]]. Argentina [[Argentina in World War II|stayed neutral during World War II]], a decision that had full British support but was rejected by the [[United States]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. A new [[Revolution of '43|military coup toppled the government]], and Argentina declared war on the Axis Powers a month before the [[end of World War II in Europe]]. The minister of welfare, [[Juan Domingo Perón]], was fired and jailed because of his high popularity among workers. His liberation was forced by a [[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|massive popular demonstration]], and he went on to win the [[Argentine general election, 1946|1946 election]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=181–302}}

===Peronism===
{{main|Peronism}}
Perón created a political movement known as Peronism. He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Perón]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Perón [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], even surpassing his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revolución Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=303–351}}

The new head of State, [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]], [[proscription|proscribed]] Peronism and banned all of its manifestations; nevertheless, Peronists kept organized underground. [[Arturo Frondizi]] from the UCR won the [[Argentine general election, 1958|following elections]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=353–379}} He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency, reversed a chronic [[trade deficit]] and lifted Peronism proscription; yet his efforts to stay in good terms with Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=34}} But Senate Chief [[José María Guido]] reacted swiftly and applied the anti-[[power vacuum]] legislation, becoming president instead; elections were repealed and Peronism proscribed again. [[Arturo Illia]] was [[Argentine general election, 1963|elected in 1963]] and led to an overall increase in prosperity; however his attempts to legalize Peronism resulted in his overthrow in 1966 by the [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]-led [[coup d'état]] called the [[Argentine Revolution]], a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

===Dirty War===
{{main|Dirty War}}
The "Dirty War" ({{lang-es|Guerra Sucia|links=no}}) was the name used by the Argentine Government for a period of [[state terrorism]] in Argentina against political dissidents, with military and security forces conducting urban and rural guerrilla violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism.<ref>''Political Violence and Trauma in Argentina,'' Antonius C.

Declassified documents of the Chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601]] of 22,000 killed or "disappeared" between 1975 and mid-1978. During this period, in which it was later revealed 8,625 "disappeared" in the form of PEN (''Poder Ejecutivo Nacional'', anglicized as "National Executive Power") detainees who were held in clandestine detention camps throughout Argentina before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure.<ref>''Political Injustice: Authoritarianism and the Rule of Law in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina,'' Anthony W. Pereira, p. 134, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2005</ref> The number of people believed to have been killed or "disappeared," depending on the source, range from 9,089 to 30,000 in the period from 1976 to 1983, when the military was forced from power following Argentina's defeat in the [[Falklands War]].<ref name="The Guardian, Thursday 2 April 2009">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/02/obituary-raul-alfonsin Obituary] ''The Guardian'', Thursday 2 April 2009</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Estimate of Deaths and Disappearances by 601st Intelligence Battalion|date=July 1978|publisher=DINA Headquarters, Buenos Aires, Argentina|pages=A8|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB185/19780715%20%5BReport%20on%20Argentina%27s%20dissappeared%5D%20A0000514c.pdf}}</ref> The [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] estimates that around 13,000 were disappeared.<ref name="edant.clarin.com">[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/10/06/p-00801.htm "Una duda histórica: no se sabe cuántos son los desaparecidos"], ''Clarin'', 10 June 2003</ref>

After democratic government was restored, Congress passed legislation to provide compensation to victims' families. Some 11,000 Argentines have applied to the relevant authorities and received up to US $200,000 each as monetary compensation for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship.<ref name="Wright, Thomas C. p. 158">Wright, Thomas C. ''State terrorism in Latin America'', p. 158, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007</ref>

The exact chronology of the [[political repression|repression]] is still debated, however, as in some senses the long political war started in 1969. Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitary as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]]'s "annihilation decrees" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.

Onganía shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[Héctor José Cámpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Perón. Cámpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Perón's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423–465}}

On the day Perón returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions—[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros—resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. Cámpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Perón won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76–77}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[José López Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).
Perón died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to "annihilate" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucumán province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Perón was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general  [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. They initiated the [[National Reorganization Process]], often shortened to ''Proceso''.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=467–504}}

The ''Proceso'' shut down Congress, removed the judges of the Supreme Court, banned political parties and unions, and resorted to the [[forced disappearance]] of suspected guerrilla members and of anyone believed to be associated with the left-wing. By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power. Then head of state General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] launched [[Operation Rosario]], which escalated into the [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|link=no|Guerra de Malvinas}}); within two months Argentina was defeated by the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Reynaldo Bignone]] replaced Galtieri and began to organize the transition to democratic rule.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=505–532}}

[[Raúl Alfonsín]] won the [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983 elections]] campaigning for the prosecution of those responsible for [[human rights]] violations during the ''Proceso'': the [[Trial of the Juntas]] and other martial courts sentenced all the coup's leaders but, under military pressure, he also enacted the [[Full Stop Law|Full Stop]] and [[Law of Due Obedience|Due Obedience]] laws,<ref>{{cite Argentine law|l=23492|date=29 December 1986|bo=26058}}</ref><ref>{{cite Argentine law|l=23521|date=9 June 1987|bo=26155}}</ref> which halted prosecutions further down the [[chain of command]]. The worsening economic crisis and [[hyperinflation]] reduced his popular support and the Peronist [[Carlos Menem]] won the [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 election]]. Soon after, [[1989 riots in Argentina|riots forced Alfonsín to an early resignation]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=533–549}}

{{main|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}

Although the most populated areas are generally [[temperate climate|temperate]], Argentina has an exceptional climate diversity,<ref name = FAO>{{cite web |url= http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/AGPC/doc/Counprof/Argentina/argentina.htm |title= Argentina |work= Country Pasture/Forage Resource Profiles |publisher= Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate= 7 June 2015}}</ref> ranging from [[subtropical]] in the north to [[Oceanic climate#Subpolar variety|subpolar]] in the far south.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.turismo.gov.ar/eng/Information/fsinformations.htm |title=General Information |publisher= Ministerio de Turismo |accessdate= 21 August 2015}}</ref> The average annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|150|mm|in|0}} in the driest parts of Patagonia to over {{convert|2000|mm|in|0}} in the westernmost parts of Patagonia and the northeastern parts of the country.<ref name = FAO/> Mean annual temperatures range from {{convert|5|C|1}} in the far south to {{convert|25|C|1}} in the north.<ref name=FAO />

Major wind currents include the cool [[Pampero Winds]] blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the Pampas; following the cold front, warm currents blow from the north in middle and late winter, creating mild conditions.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=69}}
The [[Sudestada]] usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains, rough seas and coastal flooding. It is most common in late autumn and winter along the central coast and in the Río de la Plata estuary.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=69}}
The [[Zonda wind|Zonda]], a [[foehn wind|hot dry wind]], affects Cuyo and the central Pampas. Squeezed of all moisture during the {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=on}} descent from the Andes, Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to {{convert|120|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, fueling wildfires and causing damage; between June and November, when the Zonda blows, snowstorms and [[blizzard]] (''viento blanco'') conditions usually affect higher elevations.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=53}}

Argentina is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[constitutional republic]] and [[representative democracy]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 1}} The government is regulated by a system of [[separation of powers|checks and balances]] defined by the [[Constitution of Argentina]], the country's supreme legal document. The [[seat of government]] is the city of [[Buenos Aires]], as designated by [[Argentine National Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 3}} Suffrage is [[Universal suffrage|universal]], [[Equal suffrage|equal]], [[Secret ballot|secret]] and [[Compulsory voting|mandatory]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 37}}{{efn-ua|Since 2012 suffrage is optional for ages 16 and 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/11/01/argentina-voting-age/|title=Argentina lowers its voting age to 16|work=The Washington Post|place=Washington, D. C.|date=1 November 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>}}

The federal government is composed of three branches:

The [[Legislature|Legislative]] branch consists of the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] Congress, made up of the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] and [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Deputy]] chambers, which makes [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves [[treaty|treaties]] and has the [[power of the purse]] and of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove sitting members of the government.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 53, 59, 75}} The Chamber of Deputies represents the people and has 257 voting members elected to a four-year term. Seats are apportioned among the provinces by population every tenth year.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 45, 47, 50}} {{As of|2014}} ten provinces have just five deputies while the [[Buenos Aires Province]], being the most populous one, has 70. The Chamber of Senators represents the provinces, has 72 members elected [[at-large]] to six-year terms, with each province having three seats; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 54, 56}} At least one-third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.

In the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] branch, the [[President of Argentina|President]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can [[veto]] [[bill (law)|legislative bills]] before they become law—subject to Congressional override—and appoints the [[Cabinet of Argentina|members of the Cabinet]] and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 99}} The President is elected [[direct vote|directly]] by the vote of the people, serves a four-year term and may be elected to office no more than twice in a row.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 90}}

The [[Judiciary|Judicial]] branch includes the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]] and lower [[Law of Argentina|federal courts]] interpret laws and [[judicial review|overturn those]] they find [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 116}} The Judicial is independent of the Executive and the Legislative. The Supreme Court has seven members appointed by the President—subject to Senate approval—who serve for life. The lower courts' judges are proposed by the [[Council of Magistrates of the Nation|Council of Magistrates]] (a secretariat composed of representatives of judges, lawyers, researchers, the Executive and the Legislative), and appointed by the President on Senate approval.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 99, 114}}

===Provinces===
{{main|Provinces of Argentina}}
{{see also|List of Argentine provinces by population}}
{{Argentina imagemap with province names|float=right|size=300px}}
Argentina is a federation of twenty-three provinces and one [[autonomous city]], Buenos Aires. Provinces are divided for administration purposes into [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] and [[Municipalities of Argentina|municipalities]], except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into [[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partido]]s. The City of Buenos Aires is divided into [[Barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|communes]].

Provinces hold all the power that they chose not to delegate to the federal government;{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 121}} they must be representative republics and must not contradict the Constitution.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 5–6}} Beyond this they are fully autonomous: they enact their own constitutions,{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 123}} freely organize their local governments,{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 122}} and own and manage their natural and financial resources.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 124–125}} Some provinces have bicameral legislatures, while others have [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] ones.{{efn-ua|Although not a province, the [[City of Buenos Aires]] is a federally [[autonomous city]], and as such its local organization has similarities with provinces: it has its own constitution, an elected mayor and representatives to the Senate and Deputy chambers.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 129}} As [[federal capital]] of the nation it holds the status of [[federal district]].}}

During the War of Independence the main cities and their surrounding countrysides became provinces though the intervention of their [[cabildo (council)|cabildos]]. The Anarchy of the Year XX completed this process, shaping the original thirteen provinces. Jujuy seceded from [[Salta Province|Salta]] in 1834, and the thirteen provinces became fourteen.
After seceding for a decade, Buenos Aires accepted the 1853 Constitution of Argentina in 1861, and was made a federal territory in 1880.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}}

An 1862 law designated as [[national territory|national territories]] those under federal control but outside the frontiers of the provinces. In 1884 they served as bases for the establishment of the [[governorate]]s of Misiones, Formosa, Chaco, La Pampa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego.{{sfn|Rock|1987|p=155}}
The agreement about a frontier dispute with Chile in 1900 created the [[National Territory of Los Andes]]; its lands were incorporated into Jujuy, Salta and [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]] in 1943.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}} [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] and Santa Cruz, in 1955. The last national territory, Tierra del Fuego, became the Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur Province in 1990.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}}

{{Main|Science and technology in Argentina}}

[[File:Aquarius SAC-D Launch.jpg|thumb|170px|[[SAC-D]] is an Argentine earth science [[satellite]] built by [[INVAP]] and launched in 2011]]

Argentines have three [[Nobel Prize]] laureates in the Sciences. [[Bernardo Houssay]], the first Latin American among them, discovered the role of [[pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] in regulating [[glucose]] in animals. [[César Milstein]] did extensive research in [[antibody|antibodies]]. [[Luis Leloir]] discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into [[glycogen]] and the compounds which are fundamental in [[metabolism|metabolizing]] [[carbohydrate]]s. Argentine research has led to the treatment of [[heart disease]]s and several forms of cancer. [[Domingo Liotta]] designed and developed the first [[artificial heart]] successfully implanted in a human being in 1969. [[René Favaloro]] developed the techniques and performed the world's first ever coronary [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

Argentina's nuclear programme has been highly successful. In 1957 Argentina was the first country in Latin America to design and build a [[research reactor]] with homegrown technology, the [[RA-1 Enrico Fermi]]. This reliance in the development of own nuclear related technologies, instead of simply buying them abroad, was a constant of Argentina's nuclear programme conducted by the civilian [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA). Nuclear facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru, Algeria, Australia and Egypt. In 1983, the country admitted having the capability of producing weapon-grade [[uranium]], a major step needed to assemble [[nuclear weapon]]s; since then, however, Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://carnegieendowment.org/2009/01/08/brazil-and-argentina-s-nuclear-cooperation/3jqa|title= Brazil and Argentina's Nuclear Cooperation|author= Argüello, Irma |date= 8 January 2009|publisher= Carnegie Endowment for international peace}}</ref> As a member of the Board of Governors of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], Argentina has been a strong voice in support of nuclear non-proliferation efforts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26516.htm |title=Background Note: Argentina |publisher=State.gov}}</ref> and is highly committed to global nuclear security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/04/140130.htm |title=Hillary Clinton: Argentina is on the forefront of the fight for nuclear security |publisher=State.gov |date=13 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416054220/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/04/140130.htm |archivedate=16 April 2010}}</ref> In 1974 it was the first country in Latin America to put in-line a commercial nuclear power plant, [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha I]].

Despite its modest budget and numerous setbacks, academics and the sciences in Argentina have enjoyed an international respect since the turn of the 1900s, when Dr. [[Luis Agote]] devised the first safe and effective means of [[blood transfusion]] as well as [[René Favaloro]], who was a pioneer in the improvement of the [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]. Argentine scientists are still on the cutting edge in fields such as [[nanotechnology]], [[physics]], [[computer science]]s, molecular biology, oncology, ecology, and cardiology. [[Juan Maldacena]], an Argentine-American scientist, is a leading figure in [[string theory]].

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Argentina}}
{{See also|Water privatization in Argentina|Water resources management in Argentina}}
The tariffs for water supply and sanitation in Argentina are relatively low, the service quality reasonable. However, according to the [[WHO]], 21% of the total population remains without access to house connections and 52% of the urban population do not have access to [[sewerage]].

Between 1991 and 1999, as part of one of the world's largest privatization programs, water and sanitation
concessions with the private sector were signed. After the 2001 economic crisis, many concessions were renegotiated.

Most service providers barely recover operation and maintenance costs and have no capacity to self-finance investments. While private 
operators were able to achieve higher levels of cost recovery, since the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|Argentine financial crisis]] in 2002 tariffs have been frozen and the self-financing capacity of utilities has disappeared.

Health care is provided through a combination of employer and labor union-sponsored plans (''Obras Sociales''), government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans. Health care cooperatives number over 300 (of which 200 are related to [[Trade union|labor unions]]) and provide health care for half the population; the national INSSJP (popularly known as PAMI) covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens.<ref name=iadb>{{cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/sds/doc/Desregulacion.pdf |title=IADB |publisher=IADB}}</ref>

Argentina is a [[multiculturalism|multicultural country]] with significant European influences. Its cities are largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of European styles in fashion, architecture and design. Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and other European immigration like [[France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], [[Germany]] among others.

Argentine writer [[Ernesto Sabato]] has reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:
{{Cquote|With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat dual with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of our European roots, we deeply link the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; because of our condition of Americans we link ourselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies us, feeling somehow the vocation of the ''Patria Grande'' San Martín and Bolívar once imagined.

Although Argentina's rich literary history began around 1550,{{sfn|Rivas|1989|p=11}} it reached full independence with [[Esteban Echeverría]]'s ''El Matadero'', a [[Romantic literature|romantic]] landmark that played a significant role in the development of 19th century's Argentine narrative,{{sfn|Foster|Lockhart|Lockhart|1998|p=99}} split by the ideological divide between the popular, federalist epic of [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]]' ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' and the elitist and cultured discourse of [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento]]'s masterpiece, ''[[Facundo]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Foster|1a2=Lockhart|1a3=Lockhart|1y=1998|1pp=13, 101|2a1=Young|2a2=Cisneros|2y=2010|2p=51}}

The [[Modernist literature|Modernist]] movement advanced into the 20th century including exponents such as [[Leopoldo Lugones]] and poet [[Alfonsina Storni]];{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=51–52}} it was followed by [[Vanguardism]], with [[Ricardo Güiraldes]]'s ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]'' as an important reference.{{sfnm|1a1=Foster|1a2=Lockhart|1a3=Lockhart|1y=1998|1pp=104, 107–109|2a1=Young|2a2=Cisneros|2y=2010|2p=223}}

[[Jorge Luis Borges]], Argentina's most acclaimed writer and one of the foremost figures in the [[history of literature]],{{sfn|Bloom|1994|p=2}} found new ways of looking at the modern world in [[metaphor]] and philosophical debate and his influence has extended to authors all over the globe. Short stories such as ''[[Ficciones]]'' and ''[[The Aleph (short story collection)|The Aleph]]'' are among his most famous books. He was a friend and collaborator with [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], who wrote one of the most praised [[science fiction]] [[novel]]s, ''[[The Invention of Morel]]''.{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=52, 80}}
[[Julio Cortázar]], one of the leading members of the [[Latin American Boom]] and a major name in 20th century literature,{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=79, 144}} influenced an entire generation of writers in the Americas and Europe.{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=3, 144}}

===Music===

[[File:Gardel color.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Carlos Gardel]], the most prominent figure in the [[history of tango]]]]
[[Tango]], a ''[[Río de la Plata|Rioplatense]]'' musical genre with European and African influences,{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=86}} is one of Argentina's international cultural symbols.{{sfn|Foster|Lockhart|Lockhart|1998|p=121}}
The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of [[jazz]] and [[swing music|swing]] in the United States, featuring large orchestras like those of [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], [[Aníbal Troilo]], [[Francisco Canaro]], [[Julio de Caro]] and [[Juan d'Arienzo]].{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}
After 1955, virtuoso [[Ástor Piazzolla]] popularized ''[[Nuevo tango]]'', a subtler and more intellectual trend for the genre.{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}
Tango enjoys worldwide popularity nowadays with groups like [[Gotan Project]], [[Bajofondo]] and [[Tanghetto]].

Argentina developed strong classical music and dance scenes that gave rise to renowned artists such as [[Alberto Ginastera]], composer; [[Alberto Lysy]], violinist; [[Martha Argerich]] and [[Eduardo Delgado]], pianists; [[Daniel Barenboim]], pianist and [[symphonic orchestra]] director; [[José Cura]] and [[Marcelo Álvarez]], tenors; and to [[ballet dancer]]s [[Jorge Donn]], [[José Neglia]], [[Norma Fontenla]], ''Maximiliano Guerra'', [[Paloma Herrera]], [[Marianela Núñez]], [[Iñaki Urlezaga]] and [[Julio Bocca]].{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}

A national Argentine folk style emerged in the 1930s from dozens of regional musical genres and went to influence the entirety of [[Latin American music]]. Some of its interpreters, like [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]] and [[Mercedes Sosa]], achieved worldwide acclaim.

The [[romantic ballad]] genre included singers of international fame such as [[Sandro de América]].

[[Argentine rock]] developed as a distinct musical style in the mid-1960s, when Buenos Aires and Rosario became cradles of aspiring musicians.
Founding bands like [[Los Gatos]], [[Sui Generis]], [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]] and [[Manal]] were followed by [[Seru Giran]], [[Los Abuelos de la Nada]], [[Soda Stereo]] and [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota]], with prominent artists including [[Gustavo Cerati]], [[Litto Nebbia]], [[Andrés Calamaro]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], [[Charly García]], [[Fito Paez]] and [[León Gieco]].{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}

[[Tenor saxophone|Tenor saxophonist]] [[Gato Barbieri|Leandro "Gato" Barbieri]] and composer and [[big band]] conductor [[Lalo Schifrin]] are among the most internationally successful Argentine jazz musicians.

[[Griselda Gambaro]], [[Copi]], [[Roberto Cossa]], [[Marco Denevi]], [[Carlos Gorostiza]], and [[Alberto Vaccarezza]] are a few of the most prominent Argentine playwrights.

Argentine theatre traces its origins to Viceroy [[Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo]]'s creation of the colony's first theatre, ''La Ranchería'', in 1783. In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel José de Lavardén, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[Río de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Ranchería'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Colón Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.

Tomás Maldonado was one of the main theorists of the [[Ulm School of Design|Ulm Model]] of design education, still highly influential globally.

Other Argentine artists of worldwide fame include [[Adolfo Bellocq]], whose [[lithograph]]s have been influential since the 1920s, and [[Benito Quinquela Martín]], the quintessential port painter, inspired by the immigrant-bound [[La Boca]] neighborhood.

Internationally laureate sculptors [[Erminio Blotta]], [[Lola Mora]] and [[Rogelio Yrurtia]] authored many of the classical evocative monuments of the Argentine cityscape.

The colonization brought the [[Spanish Baroque architecture]], which can still be appreciated in its simpler ''Rioplatense'' style in the [[Indian Reductions|reduction]] of [[San Ignacio Miní]], the [[Cathedral of Córdoba (Argentina)|Cathedral of Córdoba]], and the Cabildo of Luján. Italian and French influences increased at the beginning of the 19th century with strong [[Eclectic architecture|eclectic]] overtones that gave the local architecture a unique feeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20130226-preserving-history-in-buenos-aires|title=Preserving history in Buenos Aires|last=Martínez-Carter|first=Karina|publisher=BBC Travel|date=14 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123055257/http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20130226-preserving-history-in-buenos-aires|archivedate=23 January 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Numerous Argentine architects have enriched their own country's cityscape and those around the world: [[Juan Antonio Buschiazzo]] helped popularize [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] and [[Francisco Gianotti]] combined [[Art Nouveau]] with [[Italianate]] styles, each adding flair to Argentine cities during the early 20th century. [[Francisco Salamone]] and [[Viktor Sulčič]] left an [[Art Deco]] legacy, and [[Alejandro Bustillo]] created a prolific body of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Rationalist architecture]]. [[Alberto Prebisch]] and [[Amancio Williams]] were highly influenced by [[Le Corbusier]], while [[Clorindo Testa]] introduced [[Brutalist architecture]] locally. [[César Pelli]]'s and [[Patricio Pouchulu]]'s [[Futurist architecture|Futurist]] creations have graced cities worldwide: Pelli's 1980s throwbacks to the Art Deco glory of the 1920s made him one of the world's most prestigious architects, with the [[Norwest Center]] and the [[Petronas Towers]] among his most celebrated creations.
