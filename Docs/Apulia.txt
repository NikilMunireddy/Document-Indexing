'''Apulia''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|uː|l|i|ə}} {{respell|ə|POO|lee-ə}}; {{lang-it|Puglia}}, {{Lang-nap|Pùglia}}, {{Lang-sq|Pulia}})<ref group="note">From [[Greek language|Greek]] Ἀπουλία; in {{lang-it|Puglia}}, {{IPA-it|ˈpuʎʎa|pron}} (Demonym: ''Pugliese'' {{IPA-it|puʎˈʎeːze|}}).</ref> is a [[region of Italy]] in [[Southern Italy]] bordering the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the east, the [[Ionian Sea]] to the southeast, and the [[Strait of Otranto|Strait of Òtranto]] and [[Gulf of Taranto]] in the south. Its southernmost portion, known as [[Salento]] peninsula, forms a high heel on the "boot" of Italy. The region comprises {{convert|19345|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us}}, and its population is about 4.1 million. It is bordered by the other Italian regions of [[Molise]] to the north, [[Campania]] to the west, and [[Basilicata]] to the southwest. Across the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, it faces [[Albania]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], and [[Montenegro]], The Apulia region extends as far north as [[Monte Gargano]]. Its capital city is [[Bari]].

==Geography==
[[File:Acquaviva di Marittima.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Marina di Marittima]], [[Salento]]]]
Situated at the south-eastern tip of the Italian peninsula, Apulia covers over {{convert|19000|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us}} in a succession of broad plains and low-lying hills. The central area of the region is occupied by the [[Murge]], a vast [[karst]] plateau, and [[Itria Valley]]. The only mountainous areas, the [[Gargano]] promontory and the [[Monti Dauni]], do not exceed {{convert|1150|m|ft}} and are to be found in the north of Apulia, which is the least mountainous region in Italy. {{convert|32|km|mi}} north-east of the town [[Peschici]] is the Croatian Island of [[Palagruža]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Castel del Monte - Apulia.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Castel del Monte (Apulia)|Castel del Monte]], built by the [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II]] between 1240 and 1250 in [[Andria, Italy|Andria]]]]

Apulia is one of the richest archaeological regions in Italy. It was first colonized by [[Mycenaean Greeks]].<ref>Elizabeth A. Fisher, ''The Mycenaeans and Apulia. An Examination of Aegean Bronze Age Contacts with Apulia in Eastern Magna Grecia'', Astrom, 1998</ref> In the 8th century BC, the [[Ancient Greeks]] expanded until they reached the area of [[Taranto]] and [[Salento]] in [[Magna Graecia]]. In the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the Greek settlement at [[Taranto|Taras]] produced a distinctive style of pottery known as [[Apulian vase painting]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Apulia was an important area for the ancient [[ancient Rome|Romans]], who conquered it during the course of wars against the [[Samnites]] and against [[Pyrrhic War|Pyrrhus]] in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, but who also suffered a crushing defeat here in the [[battle of Cannae]] against [[Hannibal]]. After the Carthaginians left the region, the Romans captured the ports of Brindisi and Taranto and established dominion over the region. During the Imperial age, Apulia was a flourishing area for production of grain and oil, becoming the most important exporter to the Eastern provinces.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Robert Guiscard]] set up the [[Duchy of Apulia]] in 1059. After the Norman conquest of [[Sicily]] in the late 11th century, [[Palermo]] replaced [[Melfi]] (just west of present-day Apulia) as the center of Norman power.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

From the late 12th to early 13th centuries, it was a favorite residence of the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors, notably [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} A number of castles were built in the area by Frederick, including [[Castel del Monte, Apulia|Castel del Monte]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/italy/puglia/|title=Italy: Puglia|publisher=Rough Guides|accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>

After 1282, when the island of [[Sicily]] was lost, Apulia was part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] (confusingly known also as the Kingdom of Sicily), and remained so until the unification of Italy in the 1860s. This kingdom was independent under the House of Anjou from 1282 to 1442, then was part of [[Aragon]] until 1458, after which it was again independent under a cadet branch of the [[House of Trastámara]] until 1501. As a result of the French–Spanish war of 1501–1504, Naples again came under the rule of Aragon and the Spanish Empire from 1504 to 1714. When [[Barbary pirates]] of North Africa sacked [[Vieste]] in 1554, they took an estimated 7,000 slaves, and the coast of Apulia was [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto|occupied]] at times by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and at other times by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]].

With the rest of the Kingdom of Naples, Apulia was part of the [[Austrian Empire]] from 1714 until 1735. The [[Battle of Bitonto]] of 1734 was a Spanish victory over the Austrian forces, and Apulia was held by a branch of the Spanish Bourbons from 1735 to 1806, when Naples became a [[client state]] of [[Napoleon]]'s [[First French Empire|French Empire]] until his final overthrow in 1815. The effective French control of the region resulted in the abolition of feudalism and a reform of the justice system.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1861 the region became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/puglia|title=Puglia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=8 September 2013}}</ref>

==Economy==
The region's contribution to Italy's [[gross value added]] was around 4.6% in 2000, while its population was 7% of the total. The per capita GDP is low compared to the national average and represents about 68.1% of the EU average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreport.it/contenuti/leggi.php?id_cont=11969 |title=Eurostat |publisher=Greenreport |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140424084354/http://www.greenreport.it/contenuti/leggi.php?id_cont=11969 |archivedate=April 24, 2014 }}</ref>

In comparison with the country as a whole, the economy of Apulia is characterised by a greater emphasis on agriculture and services and a smaller part played by industry. The share of gross value added generated by the agricultural and services sectors in the total gross value added of the region is above the national average in 2000, whereas the share of industry is below.<ref name="c.europa.eu">{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf4_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=c.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090821143316/http://circa.europa.eu:80/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf4_eco.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2009 }}</ref>

In the last 20 years the industrial base of the region's economy has changed radically. Alongside highly capital-intensive large-scale plants – such as [[Gruppo Riva|ILVA]] (steel-making) in [[Taranto]] and [[Eni]] (petrochemicals) in [[Brindisi]] and [[Manfredonia]] – a network of small and medium-sized firms has gradually expanded, and these now provide approximately 70% of the jobs in the region.

The majority of such firms are financed by local capital. As a result, highly specialised areas have developed, producing on a scale not only of domestic but also of international significance: food processing and vehicles in the province of [[Foggia]]; footwear, textiles, wood and furniture in the [[Barletta]] area north of [[Bari]]; wood and furniture in the Murge area to the west; engineering, rubber, wood and furniture and computer software around Bari itself; textiles and clothing at [[Monopoli]]-[[Putignano]] to the south; and footwear and textiles in the [[Casarano]] area. In certain of these sectors – especially textiles, clothing, footwear, vehicles and food products – the region has attained a significant degree of competitiveness with foreign producers. A major contribution to the competitiveness of the region's economy stems from the existence of important research and development centres such as Tecnopolis-CSATA near Bari, the Cittadella della ricerca (Centre for research and new materials) near Brindisi and the new software development centres, again near Bari.<ref name="c.europa.eu" />

The region has a good network of roads but the railway network is somewhat inadequate, particularly in the south. Apulia's {{convert|800|km|mi|0|sp=us}} of coastline is studded with ports, which make this region an important terminal for transport and tourism to [[Greece]] and the eastern [[Mediterranean]].<ref name="c.europa.eu" />

In 2011 the economy expanded, to a greater extent than the rest of southern Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/econo/ecore/2012/analisi_s_r/1218_puglia;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en|title=NO. 18 - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN PUGLIA|date=June 2012|work=Regional Economies: Analysis by Region|publisher=Banca D'Italia|accessdate=8 September 2013}}</ref>

The region was served by [[Intesa Sanpaolo]], [[UniCredit]], [[Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena]], [[Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna]], [[Banca Carime]] (93 branches), [[Banco di Napoli]], [[Banca Popolare di Bari]] (80 branches), [[Banca Popolare di Puglia e Basilicata]] (75 branches), [[Banca Popolare Pugliese]], [[Banca Apulia]], member cooperative banks of [[Federazione delle Banche di Credito Cooperativo di Puglia e Basilicata]] and other banks.

The population density in Apulia is just above the national average. In 2008 it was equal to 211 inhabitants per km². Foggia is by far the least densely populated province (96 inhabitants per km² in 2008), whereas Bari is the most densely populated province (308 inhabitants per km² in 2008). {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Emigration from the region's depressed areas to northern Italy and the rest of Europe was very intense in the years between 1956 and 1971. Subsequently the trend declined as economic conditions improved, to the point where there was net immigration in the years between 1982 and 1985. Since 1986 the stagnation in employment has led to a new inversion of the trend, caused by a decrease in immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf4_pop.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=c.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110721132805/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf4_pop.htm |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Apulia}}
At the [[Italian general election, 2006|April 2006 elections]], Apulia gave about 51.54% of its votes to [[Silvio Berlusconi]], and at the [[Italian general election, 2008|April 2008 election]] Apulians gave about 47% of their votes to the [[People of Freedom]]-led coalition, eleven points more than to the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]-led coalition. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Despite this, locally the region has been governed by a Left-wing coalition led by the Democratic Party and the [[Left Ecology Freedom]] party since 2005. [[Nichi Vendola]] of the Refoundation Communist Party was elected president, becoming the first openly gay president of an Italian region. Vendola was re-elected at the 2010 elections this time representing the Left Ecology freedom party. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Administrative divisions===
Apulia is divided into six provinces (official data for the 6th province ([[Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani|Barletta-Andria-Trani]]), instituted in 2009, has only recently become available after the 2011 census):

==Culture==
===Cuisine===
Cuisine plays an important role throughout Apulia. The key locally produced ingredients used there include [[olive oil]], artichokes, tomatoes, and mushrooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/puglia|title=Introducing Puglia|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>

===Language===
As with the other regions of Italy, the national language (since 1861) is Italian. However, as a consequence of its long and varied history, other historical languages have been spoken in this region for centuries. In the northern and central sections, some dialects of the [[Neapolitan language]] are spoken: the [[Bari dialect]] is spoken in the central section, [[Foggia|Foggiano]] in the northern section and [[Tarantino language|Tarantino]] in the city of Taranto. In the southern part of the region the [[Salentino]] dialect of [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] is spoken. The language has been observed to have similarities to that of the Calabrian dialect, spoken in the region west of Apulia.

In isolated pockets of the Southern part of [[Salento]], a dialect of modern Greek called [[Griko]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ell |title=Ethnologue report for language code:ell |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528151907/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ell| archivedate= 28 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> is spoken by just a few thousand people. A rare dialect of the [[Franco-Provençal language]] called [[Faetar]] is spoken in two isolated towns, Faeto and Celle Di San Vito, in the [[Province of Foggia]]. In a couple of villages, the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aae |title=Ethnologue report for language code:aae |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-22}}</ref> dialect of the [[Albanian language]] has been spoken by a small community since a wave of refugees settled there in the 15th century.
