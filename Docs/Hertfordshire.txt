'''Hertfordshire''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=UK-Herts.ogg|ˈ|h|ɑr|t|f|ər|d|ʃ|ɪər}}{{refn|group=n|Less commonly today also {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑr|t|f|ər|d|ʃ|ər}} }}; abbreviated '''Herts''') is a [[Counties of England|county]] in southern England, bordered by [[Bedfordshire]] to the north, [[Cambridgeshire]] to the north-east, [[Essex]] to the east, [[Buckinghamshire]] to the west and [[Greater London]] to the south.

Four towns have between 50,000 and 100,000 residents: [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Stevenage]], [[Watford]] and [[St Albans]]. The [[county town]], [[Hertford]], once the main [[market town]] for the medieval agricultural county ranks 13th in population today deriving its name from a [[wikt:hart|hart]] (stag) and a [[ford (crossing)|ford]] used as the components of the county's coat of arms and flag.  Elevations are high for the region in the north and west.  These reach over 240m in the western projection around [[Tring]] which is in the [[Chilterns]].  The county's borders are approximately the [[drainage divide|watershed]]s of the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]] and [[River Lea|Lea]], which flow southwards each accompanied by a canal. Hertfordshire is at the edge of the [[London Basin]] and most of its undeveloped land is agricultural and protected as [[Metropolitan Green Belt]].  The volume of intact medieval and [[Tudor architecture|Tudor buildings]] surpasses London, in places in well-preserved [[conservation area]]s, especially in [[St Albans]] which includes some remains of [[Verulamium]], the town where in the third century [[Anno Domini|AD]] an early recorded British martyrdom took place. [[Saint Alban]], a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill. His martyr's cross of a yellow saltire on a blue background is reflected in the [[Flag of Hertfordshire|flag and coat of arms of Hertfordshire]].

The county's landmarks span many centuries, ranging from the [[Six Hills|six 'Hills']], next to the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] of [[Stevenage]] built by inhabitants during the [[Roman Britain]] centuries, to [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]].  Leavesden filmed much of the UK-based $7.7&nbsp;Bn box office ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series and has the country's studio tour.  The largest sector of the economy of the county is services and it has a large proportion of residents who are [[London Commuter Belt|City of London commuters]].  Ten railway lines and three motorways pass through or reach into the county.

In 2013, the county had a population of 1,140,700<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Hertfordshire Local Information System|url=http://www.hertslis.org/peoppla/pop/respop/|title=Resident Population|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> living in an area of {{convert|634|sqmi|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hertslis.org/geog/areameas/|publisher=Hertfordshire Local Information System|title=Area Measurements|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of Hertfordshire}}

Hertfordshire was the area assigned to a fortress constructed at [[Hertford]] under the rule of [[Edward the Elder]] in 913. Hertford is derived from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''heort ford,'' meaning [[deer]] crossing (of a watercourse). The name Hertfordshire is first recorded in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 1011. Deer feature in many county emblems.

There is evidence of humans living in Hertfordshire from the [[Mesolithic period]]. It was first farmed during the [[Neolithic period]] and permanent habitation appeared at the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]]. This was followed by tribes settling in the area during the [[Iron Age]].

Following the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43]], the aboriginal [[Catuvellauni]] quickly submitted and adapted to the Roman life; resulting in the development of several new towns, including [[Verulamium]] (St Albans) where in c. 293 the first recorded British martyrdom is traditionally believed to have taken place. [[Saint Alban]], a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill. His martyr's cross of a yellow saltire on a blue background is reflected in the [[Flag of Hertfordshire|flag and coat of arms of Hertfordshire]] as the yellow background to the stag or Hart representing the county. He is the Patron Saint of Hertfordshire.

With the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departure of the Roman Legions in the early 5th century]], the now unprotected territory was invaded and colonised by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. By the 6th century the majority of the modern county was part of the [[East Saxon]] kingdom. This relatively short lived kingdom collapsed in the 9th century, ceding the territory of Hertfordshire to the control of the West Anglians of [[Mercia]]. The region finally became an English shire in the 10th century, on the merger of the West Saxon and Mercian kingdoms.

A century later the victorious [[William the Conqueror|William of Normandy]] received the surrender of the surviving senior English Lords and Clergy, at [[Berkhamsted]], resulting in a new Anglicised title of [[William the Conqueror]]. He then embarked on an uncontested entry into London and coronation at [[Westminster]].

After the Norman conquest, Hertfordshire was used for some of the new Norman castles at [[Bishop's Stortford]] and at the royal residence of [[Berkhamsted]] and at [[Kings Langley|King's Langley]], a staging post between London and the royal residence of [[Berkhamsted]].

The [[Domesday Book]] recorded the county as having nine [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]]. [[Tring]] and [[Danais (hundred)|Danais]] became one{{mdash}}[[Dacorum (hundred)|Dacorum]]{{mdash}}from Danis Corum or Danish rule harking back to a [[Viking]] not [[Saxons|Saxon]] past. The other seven were [[Braughing]], [[Broadwater (hundred)|Broadwater]], [[Liberty of St Albans|Cashio]], [[Edwinstree (hundred)|Edwinstree]], [[Hertford (hundred)|Hertford]], [[Hitchin (hundred)|Hitchin]] and [[Odsey (hundred)|Odsey]].

[[File:De Wint, Peter, Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire, 1847.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter de Wint]], ''Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire'', 1847, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

As London grew, Hertfordshire became conveniently close to the English capital; much of the area was owned by the [[nobility]] and [[aristocracy]], this [[patronage]] helped to boost the local economy. However, the greatest boost to Hertfordshire came during the [[Industrial Revolution]], after which the population rose dramatically. In 1903, [[Letchworth]] became the world's first [[Garden city movement|garden city]] and [[Stevenage]] became the first town to redevelop under the [[New Towns Act 1946]].

From the [[1920s in film|1920s]] until the late [[1980s in film|1980s]], the town of [[Borehamwood]] was home to one of the major British [[film studio]] complexes, including the [[MGM-British Studios]]. Many well-known films were made here including the first three [[Star Wars]] movies ([[Star Wars (film)|IV]], [[The Empire Strikes Back|V]], & [[Return of the Jedi|VI]]). The studios generally used the name of [[Elstree]] (the adjoining village). American director [[Stanley Kubrick]] not only used to shoot in those studios but also lived in the area until his death. In more recent times, Elstree has had the likes of [[Big Brother UK]] and [[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]] filmed there, whilst [[EastEnders]] is also filmed at the studios. Also Hertfordshire has seen development in other [[film studio]] complexes, [[Leavesden Film Studios]] were developed on the Leavesden Aerodome site, north of [[Watford]]. The [[Harry Potter]] series was filmed at the studios, whilst the 1995 James Bond film [[GoldenEye]] was also filmed there.<ref>[http://www.filmlondon.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=836 ] {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.filmlondon.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=836 |date=20150603094612 }}</ref>

On 17 October 2000, the [[Hatfield rail crash]] killed four people with 170 injured. The crash exposed the shortcomings of [[Railtrack]], which consequently saw speed restrictions and major track replacement. On 10 May 2002, the second of the [[Potters Bar rail accidents]] occurred killing seven people; the train was at high speed when it derailed and flipped into the air when one of the carriages slid along the platform where it came to rest.

In early December 2005, the [[2005 Hemel Hempstead fuel depot explosions]] occurred at the [[Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal]].

In 2012, the [[Broxbourne (canoeing venue)|canoe and kayak slalom]] events of the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]] took place in the town of [[Waltham Cross]], within the borough of [[Broxbourne (borough)|Broxbourne]].

Following a proposal put forward by The Welwyn Garden Heritage Trust, town-planner [[Andrés Duany]] has suggested that designated "Garden Villages" could be built within Hertfordshire to relieve some of the pressure for new homes, with perhaps a third Garden City to follow.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

== Geography ==
Hertfordshire is the county immediately north of London and is part of the East of England [[Government Office Region|region, a mainly statistical unit]].<ref name="eelga">{{cite web|url=http://www.eelga.gov.uk/corporate/ |title=The East of England |accessdate=23 January 2012 |publisher=[[East of England Local Government Association]] }}</ref> A significant minority of the population across all districts are [[London commuter belt|City of London commuters]]. To the east is [[Essex]], to the west is [[Buckinghamshire]] and to the north are [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Cambridgeshire]].

The county's boundaries were roughly fixed by the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844#Hertfordshire|Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]] which eliminated [[exclave]]s; amended when, in 1965 under the [[London Government Act 1963]], [[East Barnet Urban District]] and [[Barnet Urban District]] were abolished, their area was transferred to form part of the present-day [[London Borough of Barnet]] and the [[Potters Bar Urban District]] of [[Middlesex]] was transferred to Hertfordshire.

The highest point in the county is at 245m ([[above sea level|AOD]]) on [[the Ridgeway]] long distance national path, on the border of [[Hastoe]] near [[Tring]] with [[Drayton Beauchamp]], Buckinghamshire.

As at the 2011 census of the ten Districts, [[East Hertfordshire]] had the minimal, 290 people per km², whereas Watford had the maximal 4210 people per km²

An unofficial status, the purple star-shaped flower with yellow stamens, the [[Pulsatilla vulgaris|Pasqueflower]] is among endemic [[county flower]]s.<ref>[http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/pasqueflower "Wild Plants: Pasqueflower"] [[Plantlife]]. Retrieved 26 February 2015</ref>

=== Geology ===
{{main|Geology of Hertfordshire}}

The rocks of Hertfordshire belong to the great shallow [[syncline]] known as the [[London Basin]]. The beds dip in a south-easterly direction towards the syncline's lowest point roughly under the [[River Thames]]. The most important formations are the [[Cretaceous]] [[Chalk]], exposed as the high ground in the north and west of the county, forming the [[Chiltern Hills]] and the younger [[Palaeocene]], [[Reading Beds]] and [[Eocene]], [[London Clay]] which occupy the remaining southern part. The eastern half of the county was covered by glaciers during the [[Ice Age]] and has a superficial layer of glacial [[boulder clay]]s.

=== Natural resources and environment ===
Despite the spread of built areas, much of the county is given over to agriculture. One product, now largely defunct, was [[water-cress]], based in [[Hemel Hempstead]] and [[Berkhamsted]] supported by reliable, clean chalk rivers. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Some [[quarry]]ing of sand and gravel occurs in the St Albans area. In the past, clay has supplied local brick-making and still does in [[Bovingdon]], just south-west of Hemel Hempstead. The chalk that is the bedrock of much of the county provides an [[aquifer]] that feeds streams and is also exploited to provide water supplies for much of the county and beyond. Chalk has also been used as a building material and, once fired, the resultant lime was spread on agricultural land to improve fertility. The mining of chalk since the early 18th century has left unrecorded underground galleries that occasionally collapse unexpectedly and endanger buildings.<ref>{{cite web

Fresh water is supplied to London from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], using the [[New River (England)|New River]] built by [[Hugh Myddleton]] and opened in 1613. Local rivers, although small, supported developing industries such as paper production at [[Nash Mills]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Hertfordshire affords habitat for a variety of flora and fauna. One bird common in the shire is the [[Royston crow]], which is the eponymous name of the regional newspaper, the [[Royston Crow (newspaper)|''Royston Crow'']] published in [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]].

[[File:Rooks Nest House, Stevenage.JPG|thumb|Rooks Nest House, Stevenage, typical of many local cottages]]
Hertfordshire is the location of [[Jack Worthing]]'s country house in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.

[[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' is primarily set in Hertfordshire. Topographical scholars place the town of Meryton either as [[Hertford]] or [[Hemel Hempstead]], based on how far Mr Collins travels on the post from [[Watford]], in either an easterly or westerly direction. The former location places the Bennet family home Longbourn as the town of [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]].

The location of Mr Jarndyce's Bleak House in [[Charles Dickens]]'s [[Bleak House]] is near St. Albans in Hertfordshire.

The eponymous residence in E. M. Forster's novel, ''[[Howards End]]'' was based on [[Rooks Nest House]] just outside [[Stevenage]]. In the novel, Forster describes Hertfordshire as "England at its quietest".<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/hoend10h.htm Gutenberg etext]</ref>

[[George Orwell]] based his book ''[[Animal Farm]]'' on the village of [[Wallington, Hertfordshire]] where he lived between 1936 and 1940. Manor Farm and The Great Barn both feature in the novel.
