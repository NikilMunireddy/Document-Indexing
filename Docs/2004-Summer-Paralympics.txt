The '''2004 Summer Paralympics''' ({{lang-el|Θερινοί Παραολυμπιακοί Αγώνες 2004}}) were held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], from September 17 to September 28. The twelfth [[Paralympic Games]], an estimated 4,000 athletes took part in the Athens programme, with ages ranging from 11 to 66. Paralympic events had already taken place during the 2004 Summer Olympics as [[demonstration sport]]s – women's 800 m and men's 1500 m wheelchair races. These races were open to able-bodied people and were without disability classification – as such, they did not form part of the official Paralympic programme. ''See [[Wheelchair racing at the 2004 Summer Olympics]] for more details.''

Athletes with [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]] were excluded from the games due to the difficulties in testing for and classifying these disabilities. The exclusion was introduced after the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Sydney]], the first games with events exclusively for people with learning difficulties (and the second with such athletes), after it was found that the majority of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[basketball]] team were not disabled. The [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) stated that the exclusion would continue until there are sufficient tests for the disabilities and a way to measure the effect they have on a sport. [[Exhibition match]]es for these categories were featured in the Games in basketball and [[table tennis]], and the [[Special Olympics]] remains the major sporting event specifically designed for athletes with learning difficulties.

==Medal count==
{{Main|2004 Summer Paralympics medal table}}

Among the top individual medal winners was [[Mayumi Narita]] of Japan, who took seven golds and one bronze medal in swimming, setting six world records in the process and bringing her overall Paralympic gold medal total to fifteen. [[Chantal Petitclerc]] of Canada won five golds and set three world records in wheelchair racing, while Swedish shooter [[Jonas Jacobsson]] took four gold medals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Athens 2004 – General Information |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.paralympic.org/Paralympic_Games/Past_Games/Athens_2004/ |accessdate=2011-07-12 }}</ref> France's [[Béatrice Hess]] won her nineteenth and twentieth Paralympic gold medals in swimming.

== Opening ceremony ==
[[File:Paralympics Opening Ceremony.jpg|thumb|300px|From the Paralympics opening ceremony]]
The opening ceremony for the 2004 Summer Paralympics took place on September 17, 2004. The show started with children passing on knowledge and raising their lights to the sky. This was a reference to [[Hippocrates]], who transferred knowledge to the children. A 26 meters tall [[olive]] tree (with more than 195,000 leaves) symbolising life stood in the middle of the arena. The opening ceremony also featured a performance with human drama, with light and with music, in an [[allegory]] about obstacles and limits.
The Parade of Delegations was accompanied by the music of French composers [[Yves Stepping]] and [[Jean Christophe]]. The music told the legend of [[Hephaestos]], god of fire and son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]]. An athlete from [[Turkmenistan]] propelled himself around the stadium by doing somersaults. Greece, the home team, received a strong cheer. After that, fireworks erupted at the stadium.
There were 150 local support staff involved and 400 volunteers. The children were from ages 8 to 17, coming from [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]] and [[Germany]].
The Games were officially declared opened by Greek president [[Costis Stephanopoulos]] and [[Phil Craven]], the president of the International Paralympic Committee. They were accompanied by the head of the organizing committee [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who told the athletes and the audience: ''"The Olympic flame illuminates athletes. Many of you will leave Athens with medals, but all of you will leave as champions."'' Phil Craven quoted [[Democritus]] in his speech: ''"Two thousand years ago, Democritus said 'To win oneself is the first and best of all victories.' This holds true for all athletes, but especially for Paralympians. Recognising and cultivating your unique abilities and mastering challenges – you set standards and give expression for many people, young and old, around the world."'' The [[Paralympic flame]] was lit by Greek athlete [[Georgios Toptsis]].

== Closing ceremony ==
The closing ceremony for the 2004 [[Summer Paralympics]] took place on September 28, 2004. The traditional cultural display was removed from the ceremony as a mark of respect for the deaths of seven teenagers from [[Farkadona]], travelling to Athens, whose bus collided with a truck near the town of [[Kamena Vourla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/sep/28/sport.samjones|title=Seven children die in Paralympics bus crash|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|first=Sam|last=Jones|date=28 September 2004|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3693934.stm|title=Games finale cut after bus deaths|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 September 2004|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref>

:''"The [[Athens Olympics Organising Committee]] <nowiki>[ATHOC]</nowiki> has decided to cancel the closing ceremony of the 12th Athens Paralympics as initially planned and scheduled because of the tragic accident that cost the life of pupils. The artistic and entertainment part of the ceremony will not take place."'' (official statement)<ref name="bbc"/>

Flags were flown at half mast and a minute's silence was observed. In contrast with the formal nature of the opening ceremony, the athletes entered the stadium for the final time as a collective. The flag of the IPC was then officially handed over to the 2008 hosts, [[Beijing]]. An artistic presentation to acknowledge Beijing as the next host was still shown, which also unveiled the IPC's new logo.  A procession of young people then made their way to join the athletes in the centre of the stadium carrying [[paper lantern]]s, before the Paralympic flame was extinguished, the final moment of the Paralympic Games.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3693934.stm "Games finale cut after bus deaths"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 2004-09-27</ref>

==Media coverage controversy==
Although the Paralympic Games were broadcast to around 1.6 billion viewers throughout 49 countries,<ref>[http://www.paralympic.org/export/sites/default/IPC/Reference_Documents/2004_Annual_Report_web.pdf "International Paralympic Committee Annual report 2004"], [[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]]</ref> some controversy was caused when no American television network stayed to broadcast the event.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/3699650.stm "Athens advance Paralympics"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 2004-09-24</ref> This resulted in some US viewers having to wait almost 2 months until the coverage was broadcast, compared with live feeds in the UK and other countries.<ref>[http://www.paralympics.com/News_articles_archive/us_tv.htm "US TV Coverage of the Paralympics – starts November ..."], ''[[paralympics.com]]'', 2004-09-20</ref>
