The '''[[Allied powers|Allied Powers]]''' were the countries that opposed the [[Central Powers]] in the [[First World War]].

The members of the original [[Triple Entente|Entente Alliance]] of 1907 were the [[French Third Republic|French Republic]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] ended [[Triple Alliance (1882)|its alliance]] with the [[Central Powers]], arguing that Germany and Austria-Hungary started the war and that the alliance was only defensive in nature; it entered the war on the side of the Entente in 1915. [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] was another important member. [[Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]<ref>Karel Schelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4lsOsKQz3AQC&pg=PA24 The First World War and the Paris Peace Agreement], GRIN Verlag, 2009, p. 24</ref> were affiliated members of the Entente.<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/origins/causes.htm First World War.com – Feature Articles – The Causes of World War One<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] defines the '''Principal Allied Powers''' as the British Empire, French Republic, Italy and Japan. The '''Allied Powers''' comprised, together with the Principal Allied Powers, [[Armenia]], Belgium, Greece, [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Portugal]], Romania, Serb-Croat-Slovene state and [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]].<ref>[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Section_I,_Articles_1_-_260 ''The Treaty of Sèvres, 1920'']</ref>

The [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1917)|U.S. declaration of war]] on [[German Empire|Germany]] in April 1917 was on the grounds that Germany had violated its neutrality by [[unrestricted submarine warfare|attacking international shipping]] and the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] sent to [[Mexico]].<ref name="US Declaration of War">[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/usawardeclaration.htm US Declaration of War]</ref> It [[declared war]] on [[American entry into World War I#Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary]] in December 1917.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications]</ref><ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/image/HJRes169_WWI_Austria-Hungary.htm H.J.Res.169: Declaration of War with Austria-Hungary, WWI], United States Senate</ref> The U.S. entered the war as an "associated power", rather than as a formal ally of France and the [[United Kingdom]], in order to avoid "foreign entanglements".<ref name="Tucker&Roberts pp. 1232, 1264">Tucker&Roberts pp. 1232, 1264</ref> Although the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] severed relations with the United States, neither declared war on her.<ref name="Tucker&Roberts p. 1559">Tucker&Roberts p. 1559</ref>

The [[Dominion]]s and [[Crown colony|Crown Colonies]] of the [[British Empire]] made great contributions to the Allied war effort, but did not have [[Statute of Westminster 1931|independent foreign policies]] in World War I with the [[War Cabinet#First World War|British War Cabinet]] exercising operational control of British Empire forces. The Dominion governments did control recruiting, and removed personnel from front-line duties as they saw fit. From early 1917, the War Cabinet was superseded by the [[Imperial War Cabinet]], which had Dominion representation. The [[Australian Corps]] and [[Canadian Corps]] were placed under the command of Australian and Canadian [[Lieutenant General]]s [[John Monash]] and [[Arthur Currie]],<ref>Perry (2004), p.xiii</ref> respectively, who reported in turn to British generals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In April 1918, operational control of all Entente forces on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] passed to the new supreme commander, [[Ferdinand Foch]] of France.

==History==
[[File:Triple Entente.jpg|250px|thumb|A 1914 Russian poster depicting the Triple Entente.]]
The original alliance opposed to the [[Central Powers]] was the [[Triple Entente]], which was formed by three Great European Powers:
*{{flag|British Empire|name=British Empire}}
*{{flagicon|France}} [[French Third Republic|French Republic]]
*{{flag|Russian Empire}}
The war began with the Austrian attack invasion of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] on 28 July 1914, in response to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The Austrian Empire followed with an attack on the Serbian ally [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] on 8 August.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} On the Western Front, the two neutral States of [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] were immediately occupied by German troops as part of the German [[Schlieffen Plan]].

Of the two [[Low Countries]] involved in the war, Luxembourg chose to capitulate, and was viewed as a [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] state by the Entente powers: Luxembourg never became part of the Allies, and only narrowly avoided Belgium's efforts of annexation, at the conclusion of hostilities in 1919. On 23 August [[Japan]] joined the Entente, which then counted seven members. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The entrance of the British Empire brought [[Nepal]] into the war.

On 23 May 1915, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] entered the war on the Entente side and declared war on Austria;  previously, [[Italy]] had been a member of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] but had remained neutral since the beginning of the conflict. In 1916, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] capitulated and left the Entente, and two nations joined, [[Portuguese First Republic|Portugal]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

On 6 April 1917, the United States entered the war. [[Liberia]], [[History of Thailand (1768-1932)#Vajiravhud and the ascent of elite nationalism|Siam]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] also became allies. After the [[October Revolution]], Russia left the alliance and ended formal involvement in the war, by the signing of the treaty of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest Litovsk]] in November effectively creating a [[separate peace]] with the Central Powers. This was followed by Romanian cessation of hostilities, however the Balkan State declared war on Central Powers again on 10 November 1918. The Russian withdrawal allowed for the final structure of the alliance, which was based on five [[Great Powers]]:
*{{flagicon|France}} [[French Third Republic|French Republic]]
*{{flag|British Empire|name=British Empire}}
*{{flag|United States|1912}}
*{{flagcountry|Kingdom of Italy}}
*{{flagcountry|Empire of Japan}}
Following the [[Versailles conference]], Britain, France, Italy and Japan became the permanent members of the [[League of Nations]] council. The United States, meant to be the fifth permanent member, left because the US Senate voted on 19 March 1920 against the ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], thus preventing American participation in the League.

====War justifications====
In response to Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914.<ref>Tucker, Spencer C. A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East. ABC-CLIO. 2009. P1562.</ref> The [[British Empire]] held several semi-autonomous dominions that were automatically brought into the war effort as a result of the British declaration of war, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and [[South Africa]].

====Colonies and dependencies====
{{main|British Empire}}

=====In Europe=====
[[Gibraltar]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]] were British dependencies in Europe.

=====In Africa=====
The UK held several colonies, protectorates, and semi-autonomous dependencies at the time of World War I. In Eastern Africa the [[East Africa Protectorate]], [[Nyasaland]], both [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], the [[Uganda Protectorate]], were involved in conflict with German forces in [[German East Africa]]. In Western Africa, the colonies of [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] were involved in military actions against German forces from [[Togoland]] and [[Kamerun]]. In Southwestern Africa, the semi-autonomous dominion of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] was involved in military actions against German forces in [[German South-West Africa]].

=====In North America=====
[[Canada]] and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were two autonomous dominions during the war that made major military contributions to the British war effort.

Other British dependent territories in the Americas included: [[British Honduras]], the [[Falkland Islands]], [[British Guiana]], and [[Jamaica]].

=====In Asia=====
The UK held large possessions in Asia, including the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]] which was an assortment of British imperial authorities in the territory now defined as [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Sri Lanka]].

Other British territories at the time included: [[British Malaya]] – referring to several Malay states under British control as a result of the [[Straits Settlements]]; [[North Borneo]]; and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]].

=====In Oceania=====
[[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were two autonomous dominions of the UK in Oceania during the war. Australia had become an independent nation state in 1901.  Having strong cultural ties with the United Kingdom, the nations declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914.

===Russia===
{{main|Russian Empire}}
[[File:Russian battery WWI 76 mm model 1902 guns.jpg|thumb|right|Russian artillery firing.]]
In response to Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia in 1914, Russian government officials denounced the Austro-Hungarian invasion as an "ignoble war" on a "weak country".<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1914. P262">Jelavich, Barbara. Russia's Balkan Entanglements, 1806–1914. P262</ref> Russian government official Nikolaĭ N. Shebeko stated: "the attack on Serbia by a powerful empire such as Austria, supposedly in order to defend its existence, cannot be understood by anyone in my country; it has been considered simply as a means of delivering a death-blow to Serbia."<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1914. P262"/> Russia held close diplomatic relations with Serbia, and Russian foreign minister [[Sergey Sazonov]] suspected the events were a conspiracy between Austria-Hungary and Germany to expel Russian influence in the Balkans.<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1914. P262"/> On 30 July 1914, Russia enacted a general mobilization. The day after general mobilization was enacted, Austria-Hungary's ally Germany declared war on Russia prior to expected Russian intervention against Austria-Hungary.

Following a raid by Ottoman warships on the Russian port of Odessa, Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914.<ref>Afflerbach, Holger; David Stevenson, David. An Improbable War: The Outbreak of World War 1 and European Political Culture. Berghan Books. 2012. P. 293.</ref>

===France===
{{main|French Third Republic|French colonial empire}}
[[File:River Crossing NGM-v31-p338.jpg|thumb|French soldiers crossing a river on their way to Verdun during the [[Battle of Verdun]].]]
After Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany declared war on France.<ref>Tucker, Spencer C. A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East. ABC-CLIO. 2009. P1556.</ref>

===Japan===
{{main|Empire of Japan}}
[[File:Battle of Tsingtao Japanese Landing.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese soldiers landing in Tsingtao during the [[Siege of Tsingtao]] in which Allied forces seized control of Germany's Kiautschou Bay concession.]]
Japan declared war on Germany after it did not accept an ultimatum sent by Japan to Germany, demanding that Germany extinguish its title to the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] and restore that territory to China.<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P155">Hamilton, Richard F; Herwig, Holger H. Decisions for War, 1914–1917. P155.</ref> The Japanese government appealed to the Japanese public that Japan was not merely entering a "European War" on behalf of European powers, but that Japan was fighting on behalf of Asians against a belligerent European power, Germany, that Japan identified as the "source of evil in the Far East".<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P155"/> Thus as a result of this, Japan was following through with the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]].<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P155"/>

===Italy===
{{main|Kingdom of Italy|Italian Empire}}
[[File:Italian alpine troops.jpg|thumb|right|Italian alpine troops.]]Italy had been a member of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary since the 1880s, however the Triple Alliance stipulated that all parties must be consulted in the event of one country engaging in war and Italy was not informed of this.<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P194">Hamilton, Richard F; Herwig, Holger H. Decisions for War, 1914–1917. P194.</ref> As such Italy claimed that it was not obligated to join their war effort.<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P194"/> Italy's relations with Germany and Austria-Hungary in contrast to the Allies were additionally affected by the fact that in 1913, Britain supplied Italy with 90 percent of its annual imports of coal.<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P194"/> The war effort of the Central Powers meant that Germany and Austria-Hungary were using their coal supplies for the war, and little was available to be exported to Italy.<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P194"/> Italy initially attempted to pursue neutrality from 1914 to 1915.<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P194"/>

After diplomatic negotiations, Britain and France convinced Italy to join the war effort with promises that Italy would gain favourable territorial concessions from the Central Powers, including Italian-populated territories of Austria-Hungary.<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P194-198">Hamilton, Richard F; Herwig, Holger H. Decisions for War, 1914–1917. P194-198.</ref> Italy ordered mobilization on 22 May 1915, and issued an ultimatum to Austria-Hungary, and then declared war on Austria-Hungary, though it did not declare war on Germany.<ref name="Hamilton, Richard F 1917. P194-198"/>

===Serbia===
{{main|Kingdom of Serbia}}

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Vojska Ada Ciganlija.jpg|thumb|right|Serbian soldiers during World War I]]
Serbia was invaded by Austria-Hungary after Austria-Hungary placed a stringent ultimatum to the Serbian government demanding full compliance to an Austro-Hungarian investigation of complicity by the Serbian government in the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand. Serbia agreed to most of Austria-Hungary's demands but because it did not fully comply, Austria-Hungary invaded.

Serbia had the diplomatic support of Russia, and both Serbia and Russia resented Austria-Hungary's absorption of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] that held a substantial Serb population. Serbia had expanded in size through its actions in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 when the Ottoman Empire's control in the Balkans collapsed.

During the war, Serbia justified the war as being the result of Austro-Hungarian imperialism towards Serbs and [[South Slavs]], Serbia cooperated with [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslavists]] including the [[Yugoslav Committee]] who sought pan-South-Slav unification, particularly through liberating South Slavs from Austria-Hungary. In the [[Corfu Declaration]] in 1917, the Serbian government officially declared its intention to form a state of [[Yugoslavia]].

The first two allied victories in the war were won by the Serbian army, on the mountains of [[Battle of Cer|Cer]] and [[Battle of Kolubara|Kolubara]], in western Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian army was expelled from the country, suffering heavy losses. Serbia suffered great losses during the war, almost 50% of all men and around 30% of its entire population were killed.

===Romania===
{{main|Romania during World War I}}

[[File:Romanian troops at Marasesti in 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Romanian troops at Mărășești battlefield in 1917]]
When the Entente Powers [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|promised]] Romania [[Transylvania]] and [[Banat]], large Austro-Hungarian territories with Romanian majority, in exchange for Romania's declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality and joined the Allies on 27 August 1916. The treaty, approved and signed by the main Allied countries, also stipulated equal status for Romania at the coming Peace Conference.<ref name="Clark1932p35">{{cite book|author=Charles Upson Clark|title=United Roumania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYLtOFBzZikC&pg=PA135|origyear=1932; with the title ''Greater Roumania''|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-405-02741-3|page=135|year=1971}}</ref> However, this clause of the treaty was eventually ignored by the main Entente Powers. The Romanian [[Battle of Transylvania|offensive]] was initially successful, against the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counterattack by the combined forces of the Central Powers drove them back. As a result of the [[Battle of Bucharest]], the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Fighting in Moldova continued in 1917, resulting in a costly [[Battle of Mărășești|stalemate]] for the Central Powers. Russian withdrawal from the war in late 1917 as a result of the [[October Revolution]] meant that Romania was forced to sign a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|peace treaty]] with the Central Powers on 7 May 1918. However, the treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiègne. Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.

==Other affiliated state combatants==

===Belgium===
Belgium had declared its neutrality when the war began, but Germany disregarded Belgium's neutrality and invaded the country in order to launch an offensive against the French capital of Paris. As a result, Belgium became a member of the Allies.

===Brazil===
{{main|First Brazilian Republic}}
[[File:Brazilian Soldiers First War.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian soldiers in World War I.]]

Brazil entered the war in 1917 after the United States intervened on the basis of Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare sinking its merchant ships, which Brazil also cited as a reason to enter the war fighting against Germany and the Central Powers.

===Montenegro===
{{main|Kingdom of Montenegro}}

Montenegro had very close cultural and political connections with Serbia and had cooperated with Serbia in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913. Montenegro joined the war against Austria-Hungary.

===Nejd and Hasa===
The [[Emirate of Nejd and Hasa]] agreed to enter the war as an ally of Britain in the [[Treaty of Darin]] on December 26, 1915.<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs |last=[[Abdullah I of Jordan]] |first= |author2=Philip Perceval Graves |authorlink2=Philip Graves  |year=1950 |isbn= |page=186}}</ref>

===Idrisid Emirate of Asir===
The [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir]] participated in the Arab revolt. Its Emir, [[Muhammad ibn Ali al-Idrisi]], signed an agreement with the British and joined the Allies in May 1915.
