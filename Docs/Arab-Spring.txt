The '''Arab Spring''' ({{lang-ar|الربيع العربي}}, {{transl|ar|''ar-rabīˁ al-ˁarabī''}}) was a [[revolutionary wave]] of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s (both non-violent and violent), [[riot]]s, and [[civil war]]s in the [[Arab world]] that began on 18 December 2010 in [[Tunisia]] with the [[Tunisian Revolution]], and spread throughout the countries of the [[Arab League]] and its surroundings. While the wave of initial revolutions and protests faded by mid-2012, some started to refer to the succeeding and still ongoing large-scale discourse conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa as the [[Arab Winter]]. The most radical discourse from Arab Spring into the still ongoing civil wars took place in Syria as early as the second half of 2011.

Many Arab Spring demonstrations were met with violent responses from authorities,<ref name="Many wounded as Moroccan police beat protestors" /><ref name="Syria's crackdown" /><ref name="Bahrain troops lay siege to protesters' camp" /> as well as from pro-government militias and counter-demonstrators. These attacks were answered with violence from protestors in some cases.<ref name="Syria clampdown on protests mirrors Egypt's as thugs join attacks" /><ref name="Yemeni government supporters attack protesters, injuring hundreds" /><ref name="Libya Protests: Gaddafi Militia Opens Fire On demonstrators" /> A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world is ''[[Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam|Ash-sha`b yurid isqat an-nizam]]'' ("the people want to bring down the regime").<ref name="slogan" />

==Etymology==
The term "Arab Spring" is an allusion to the [[Revolutions of 1848]], which is sometimes referred to as the "Springtime of Nations", and the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968. In the aftermath of the [[Iraq War]] it was used by various commentators and bloggers who anticipated a major Arab movement towards democratization.<ref>Krauthammer, Charles (21 March 2005): "[http://seattletimes.com/html/opinion/2002214060_krauthammer21.html The Arab Spring of 2005]".'' The Seattle Times. ''Retrieved 7 July 2013.</ref> The first specific use of the term ''Arab Spring'' as used to denote these events may have started with the American political journal ''[[Foreign Policy]]''.<ref name=massad/> [[Marc Lynch]], referring to his article in ''Foreign Policy'',<ref name="lynch "/> writes "Arab Spring—a term I may have unintentionally coined in a January 6, 2011 article".<ref name="The Arab Uprising: The Unfinished Revolutions of the New Middle East"/> [[Joseph Massad]] on ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' said the term was "part of a US strategy of controlling [the movement's] aims and goals" and directing it towards western-style [[liberal democracy]].<ref name="massad"/> Due to the electoral success of [[Islamism|Islamist]] parties following the protests in many Arab countries, the events have also come to be known as "Islamist Spring" or "Islamist Winter".<ref>[[The Atlantic]]: [http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/muslim-protests-has-obama-helped-bring-on-an-anti-us-islamist-spring/262731/ ''Muslim Protests: Has the US President, Barak Obama Helped Bring On an Anti-U.S. 'Islamist Spring'?''], 23 September 2012, retrieved 30 November 2012</ref><ref>[[Foreign Policy]]: [http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/07/19/learning_to_live_with_the_islamist_winter ''Learning to Live With the Islamist Winter''], 19 July 2012, retrieved 30 November 2012</ref>

Some observers have also drawn comparisons between the Arab Spring movements and the [[Revolutions of 1989]] (also known as the "Autumn of Nations") that swept through [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Second World]], in terms of their scale and significance.<ref name="cfr"/><ref name="nytimes"/><ref name="thewashingtonreview"/> Others, however, have pointed out that there are several key differences between the movements, such as the desired outcomes, the effectiveness of [[civil resistance]], and the organizational role of [[Internet]]-based technologies in the Arab revolutions.<ref name="economist"/><ref>T.

==Causes==

=== Pressures from within ===
The Arab Spring is widely believed to have been instigated by dissatisfaction with the rule of local governments, particularly by youth and unions, though some have speculated that wide gaps in income levels may have had a hand as well.<ref>*[http://www.scribd.com/doc/90470593/The-CenSEI-Report-Vol-2-No-6-February-13-19-2012#outer_page_23 The Arab Spring—One Year Later: The CenSEI Report analyzes how 2011's clamor for democratic reform met 2012's need to sustain its momentum.] ''The CenSEI Report'', 13 February 2012</ref> 

Other analysts pointed to the fourth stage "Toppling the Regimes" of the Al Qaeda strategy for world domination, described in [[Fouad Hussein]]'s book published in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Master Plan|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/11/the-master-plan|website = The New Yorker|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref> 

Numerous factors led to the protests, including issues such as [[dictatorship]] or [[absolute monarchy]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Alexander Kazamias, 'The "Anger Revolutions" in the Middle East: an answer to decades of failed reform', Journal of Balkan and Near Eastern Studies, 13:2, June 2011, pp.143-156.|url = https://www.academia.edu/919845/The_Anger_Revolutions_in_the_Middle_East_an_answer_to_decades_of_failed_reform_Journal_of_Balkan_and_Near_Eastern_Studies_13_2_June_2011_pp.143-156|website = www.academia.edu|access-date = 2016-02-20}}</ref> [[human rights]] violations, [[political corruption]] (demonstrated by [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Wikileaks diplomatic cables]]),<ref name="The Tweet and Revolution"/> economic decline, unemployment, extreme poverty, and a number of demographic structural factors,<ref name="Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis"/> such as a large percentage of educated but dissatisfied youth within the entire population.<ref name="Demographics of the Arab League, computed by Wolfram Alpha"/><ref name="Digital Dissidence Political Change: Cyberactivism and Citizen Journalism in Egypt"/>  Catalysts for the revolts in all [[North Africa|Northern African]] and [[Persian Gulf countries]] included the concentration of wealth in the hands of autocrats in power for decades, insufficient transparency of its redistribution, corruption, and especially the refusal of the youth to accept the status quo.<ref name="Reverchon 03/13">{{cite web|last1=Reverchon|first1=Antoine|last2=de Tricornot|first2=Adrien|date=13 April 2011|title=La rente pétrolière ne garantit plus la paix sociale|url=http://lemonde-emploi.blog.lemonde.fr/2011/03/15/%C2%AB-la-rente-petroliere-ne-garantit-plus-la-paix-sociale-%C2%BB-dans-%C2%AB-le-monde-economie-%C2%BB/}}</ref>  

Some protesters looked to the [[Turkish model]] as an ideal (contested but peaceful elections, fast-growing but liberal economy, secular constitution but [[Islamism|Islamist]] government).<ref name="aljazeera"/><ref>Perez, Ines (4 March 2013).[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-and-rising-food-prices-heightened-arab-spring/ "Climate Change and Rising Food Prices Heightened Arab Spring"].

===Social media and the Arab Spring===
In the wake of the Arab Spring protests, a considerable amount of attention has been focused on the role of social media and digital technologies in allowing citizens within areas affected by 'the Arab Uprisings' as a means for collective activism to circumvent state-operated media channels.<ref>{{cite web|last=CNN|title=CNN at SXSW: Social media in Arab Spring|url=<http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1bSj4f9f8Eg&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1bSj4f9f8Eg>.|publisher=Youtube|format=Online video clip|date=12 March 2013}}</ref> The influence of social media on political activism during the Arab Spring has, however, been much debated.<ref name="ASPO-H-01" /><ref name="ASPO-H-02" /><ref name="Social Media in the Middle East" /> Protests took place both in states with a very high level of Internet usage (such as [[Bahrain]] with 88% of its population online in 2011) and in states with one of the lowest Internet penetration ([[Yemen]] and [[Libya]]).<ref name=Stepanova>{{cite web|last1=Stepanova|first1=Ekaterina|title=The Role of Information Communication Technologies in the "Arab Spring"|url=http://pircenter.org/kosdata/page_doc/p2594_2.pdf|website=http://pircenter.org/|accessdate=17 May 2015|date=May 2011}}</ref>

The use of social media platforms more than doubled in Arab countries during the protests, with the exception of Libya.<ref name="Salem, Fadi, Mourtada" /> Some researchers have shown how [[collective intelligence]], [[Crowd psychology|dynamics of the crowd]] in [[participatory systems]] such as social media, have the immense power to support a collective action – such as foment a political change.<ref name="ASPO-H-03" /><ref name="ASPO-H-04" /> {{As of|2011|04|05}}, the amount of Facebook users in the Arab world surpassed 27.7 million people.<ref name="Salem, Fadi, Mourtada" /> Some critics have argued that digital technologies and other forms of communication—videos, cellular phones, blogs, photos, emails, and text messages—have brought about the concept of a 'digital democracy' in parts of North Africa affected by the uprisings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wellman|first1=Barry|last2=Rainie|first2=Lee|title=Networked|date=2014|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Boston, MA|page=207}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Anonymous|title=Social Media: Power to The People?|url=<[http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2011/social_medias/EN/index.htm]>.|work=NATO Review Magazine|publisher=NATO Review Magazine|accessdate=3 October 2013|year=2011}}</ref>

Facebook, Twitter and other major social media played a key role in the movement of Egyptian and Tunisian activists in particular.<ref name=Stepanova /><ref>{{Cite news|title = Egyptians and Tunisians Collaborated to Shake Arab History|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/world/middleeast/14egypt-tunisia-protests.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-02-13|access-date = 2016-02-04|issn = 0362-4331|first = David D.|last = Kirkpatrick|first2 = David E.|last2 = Sanger}}</ref>  Nine out of ten Egyptians and Tunisians responded to a poll that they used [[Facebook]] to organize protests and spread awareness.<ref name="Salem, Fadi, Mourtada" /> This large population of young Egyptian men referred to themselves as "the Facebook generation", exemplifying their escape from their non-modernized past.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rainie|first1=Lee|last2=Wellman|first2=Barry|title=Networked|date=2014|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Boston, MA|page=207}}</ref>  Furthermore, 28% of Egyptians and 29% of Tunisians from the same poll said that blocking Facebook greatly hindered and/or disrupted communication. Social media sites sites were a platform for different movements composed by many frustrated citizens, including the 2008 "April 6 Youth Movement" organized by Ahmed Mahed, which set out to organize and promote a nationwide labor strike, and which inspired the later creation of the "Progressive Youth of Tunisia".<ref name="Networked">{{cite book|last1=Wellman|first1=Barry|last2=Rainie|first2=Lee|title=Networked|date=2014|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Boston, MA|page=208}}</ref>

During the Arab Spring, people created [[Facebook features|pages]] on Facebook to raise awareness about alleged crimes against humanity, such as police brutality in the Egyptian Revolution (see [[Wael Ghonim]] and [[Death of Khaled Mohamed Saeed]]).<ref>{{Cite journal

He claimed that most people in the Middle East and North Africa used texting, emailing, and blogging only to organize and communicate information about internal local protests.<ref>{{Cite web

Social networks were not the only instrument for rebels to coordinate their efforts and communicate. In the countries with the lowest Internet penetration and the limited role of social networks, such as [[Yemen]] and [[Libya]], the role of mainstream electronic media devices - cell phones, emails, and video clips (e.g. [[YouTube]]) was very important to cast the light on the situation in the country and spread the word about the protests in the outside world.<ref name=Stepanova /> In [[Egypt]], in [[Cairo]] particularly, mosques were one of the main platforms to coordinate the protest actions and raise awareness to the masses.<ref name=Demidov>{{cite journal|last1=Demidov|first1=Oleg|title=Social Networks in International and National Security|journal=Security Index|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=22–36|doi=10.1080/19934270.2012.634122|accessdate=17 May 2015|issn=1993-4270}}</ref>

==Events leading up to the Arab Spring==

Tunisia experienced a series of conflicts during the three years leading up to the Arab Spring, the most notable occurring in the mining area of [[Gafsa]] in 2008, where protests continued for many months. These protests included rallies, sit-ins, and strikes, during which there were two fatalities, an unspecified number of wounded, and dozens of arrests.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name="Tunisian government faces growing dissent in mining region"/> In Egypt, the labor movement had been strong for years, with more than 3,000 labor actions since 2004, and provided an important venue for organizing protests and collective action.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> One important demonstration was an attempted workers' strike on 6 April 2008 at the state-run textile factories of [[al-Mahalla al-Kubra]], just outside [[Cairo]]. The idea for this type of demonstration spread throughout the country, promoted by computer-literate working class youths and their supporters among middle-class college students.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> A Facebook page, set up to promote the strike, attracted tens of thousands of followers and provided the platform for sustained political action in pursuit of the "long revolution."<ref name="Digital Dissidence Political Change: Cyberactivism and Citizen Journalism in Egypt"/>  The government mobilized to break the strike through infiltration and riot police, and while the regime was somewhat successful in forestalling a strike, dissidents formed the "6 April Committee" of youths and labor activists, which became one of the major forces calling for the anti-[[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] demonstration on 25 January in [[Tahrir Square]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />

In Algeria, discontent had been building for years over a number of issues. In February 2008, United States Ambassador Robert Ford wrote in a leaked diplomatic cable that Algeria is 'unhappy' with long-standing political alienation; that social discontent persisted throughout the country, with food strikes occurring almost every week; that there were demonstrations every day somewhere in the country; and that the Algerian government was corrupt and fragile.<ref name="07ALGIERS1806"/> Some claimed that during 2010 there were as many as '9,700 riots and unrests' throughout the country.<ref name="army_should_quit"/> Many protests focused on issues such as education and health care, while others cited rampant corruption.<ref name="Political Crises but Few Alternatives in Algeria"/>

In Western Sahara, the [[Gdeim Izik protest camp]] was erected {{convert|12|km|mi}} south-east of [[El Aaiún]] by a group of young [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]] on 9 October 2010. Their intention was to demonstrate against labor discrimination, unemployment, looting of resources, and human rights abuses.<ref name="Ref-1"/> The camp contained between 12,000 and 20,000 inhabitants, but on 8 November 2010 it was destroyed and its inhabitants evicted by Moroccan security forces. The security forces faced strong opposition from some young Sahrawi civilians, and rioting soon spread to El Aaiún and other towns within the territory, resulting in an unknown number of injuries and deaths. Violence against Sahrawis in the aftermath of the protests was cited as a reason for [[2011 Western Saharan protests|renewed protests]] months later, after the start of the Arab Spring.<ref name="Saharawi protests, violence and blackmail Moroccan"/>

The catalyst for the escalation of protests was the self-immolation of Tunisian [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]. Unable to find work and selling fruit at a roadside stand, Bouazizi had his wares confiscated by a municipal inspector on 17 December 2010. An hour later he doused himself with gasoline and set himself afire. His death on 4 January 2011<ref name="Tunisia suicide protester Mohammed Bouazizi dies"/> brought together various groups dissatisfied with the existing system, including many unemployed, political and human rights activists, labor, trade unionists, students, professors, lawyers, and others to begin the [[Tunisian Revolution]].<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

== The Arab Spring == 

The series of protests and demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa that commenced in 2010, became known as the "Arab Spring",<ref name="Egypt protests: an Arab spring as old order crumbles"/><ref name="The Arab spring requires a defiantly European reply"/><ref name="Arab Spring – Who lost Egypt?"/> and sometimes as the "Arab Spring and Winter",<ref name="What Is Palestine's Next Move In The New Middle East?"/> "Arab Awakening"<ref name="The Arab awakening - Spotlight"/><ref name="Arab Awakening?"/><ref name="The Arab awakening reaches Syria"/> or "Arab Uprisings"<ref name="Arab Uprisings: What the 20 February Protests Tell Us About Morocco" /><ref name="Democracy's hard spring"/> even though not all the participants in the protests were [[Arab people|Arab]]. It was sparked by the first protests that occurred in [[Tunisia]] on 18 December 2010 in Sidi Bouzid, following [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]'s [[self-immolation]] in protest of police corruption and ill treatment.<ref name="Slap to a Man's Pride Set Off Tumult in Tunisia"/><ref name="Peddler's martyrdom launched Tunisia's revolution"/> With the success of the protests in Tunisia, a [[revolutionary wave|wave of unrest]] sparked by the [[Mohamed Bouazizi|Tunisian "Burning Man"]] struck [[Algeria]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]],<ref name="Inspired by Tunisia and Egypt, Yemenis join in anti-government protests"/> then spread to other countries. The largest, most organised demonstrations often occurred on a "day of rage", usually Friday afternoon prayers.<ref name="arabnews"/><ref name="Police in south Yemen disperse 'day of rage' protests"/><ref name="Bahrain moves to foil anti-government rallies"/> The protests also triggered similar unrest [[Impact of the Arab Spring|outside the region]].

Tunisian President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] fled to Saudi Arabia on 14 January 2011 following the [[Tunisian Revolution]] protests. In Egypt, [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned on 11 February 2011 after 18 days of massive protests, ending his 30-year presidency. The [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was overthrown on 23 August 2011, after the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) took control of [[Bab al-Azizia]]. He was killed on 20 October 2011, in his hometown of [[Sirte]] after the NTC took control of the city. Yemeni President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] signed the GCC power-transfer deal in which a presidential election was held, resulting in his successor [[Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi]] formally replacing him as the president of Yemen on 27 February 2012, in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Weapons and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] fighters returning from the Libyan Civil War stoked a simmering [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|conflict in Mali]] which has been described as 'fallout' from the Arab Spring in [[North Africa]].<ref name="Mali coup: Arab Spring spreads to Africa">{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2012/03/26/Mali-coup-Arab-Spring-spreads-to-Africa/UPI-33131332791728/?spt=hs&or=tn|agency=United Press International|title=Mali coup: Arab Spring spreads to Africa|date=26 March 2012|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>

Following the self-burning of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] in [[Sidi Bouzid]], a series of increasingly violent street demonstrations through December 2010 ultimately led to the ousting of longtime [[President of Tunisia|President]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] on 14 January 2011.

The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades,<ref name="protestwave"/><ref name="Tunisian president vows to punish rioters after worst unrest in a decade"/> and have resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators.

A [[state of emergency]] was declared and a caretaker coalition government was created following Ben Ali's departure, which included members of Ben Ali's party, the [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD), as well as [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] figures from other ministries. However, the five newly appointed non-RCD ministers resigned almost immediately.<ref name="threeministers"/><ref name="aljaz_protests_21jan"/> As a result of continued daily protests, on 27 January Prime Minister [[Mohamed Ghannouchi]] reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself, and on 6 February the former ruling party was suspended;<ref name="Tunisian minister suspends ex-ruling party"/> later, on 9 March, it was dissolved.<ref name="dissolution"/> Following further public protests, Ghannouchi himself resigned on 27 February, and [[Béji Caïd Essebsi]] became Prime Minister.

[[File:Demonstration in Al Bayda (Libya, 2011-07-22).jpg|thumb|Thousands of demonstrators gather in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] ]]
Anti-government protests began in Libya on 15 February 2011. By 18 February the opposition controlled most of [[Benghazi]], the country's second-largest city. The government dispatched elite troops and militia in an attempt to recapture it, but they were repelled. By 20 February, protests had spread to the capital [[Tripoli]], leading to a television address by [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], who warned the protestors that their country could descend into civil war. The rising death toll, numbering in the thousands, drew international condemnation and resulted in the resignation of several Libyan diplomats, along with calls for the government's dismantlement.<ref name="HIGHLIGHTS – Libyan TV address by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi"/>

Amidst ongoing efforts by demonstrators and rebel forces to wrest control of Tripoli from the [[Jamahiriya]], the opposition set up an [[National Transitional Council|interim government]] in Benghazi to oppose Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s rule.<ref name="Ex Libyan minister forms interim govt-report"/><ref name="Exodus Tripoli: Libyan rebels seize control of third major city as thousands of foreigners battle to flee 'hell'"/> However, despite initial opposition success, government forces subsequently took back much of the Mediterranean coast.

On 17 March, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] was adopted, authorising a [[no-fly zone]] over Libya, and "all necessary measures" to protect civilians. Two days later, France, the United States and the United Kingdom [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened in Libya]] with a bombing campaign against pro-Gaddafi forces. A coalition of 27 states from Europe and the Middle East soon joined the intervention. The forces were driven back from the outskirts of Benghazi, and the rebels [[First Gulf of Sidra offensive|mounted an offensive]], capturing scores of towns across the coast of Libya. The offensive stalled however, and a counter-offensive by the government retook most of the towns, until a [[Battle of Brega–Ajdabiya road|stalemate]] was formed between [[Brega]] and [[Ajdabiya]], the former being held by the government and the latter in the hands of the rebels. Focus then shifted to the west of the country, where bitter fighting continued. After a [[Battle of Misrata|three-month-long battle]], a loyalist siege of rebel-held [[Misrata]], the third largest city in Libya, was broken in large part due to coalition air strikes. The four major fronts of combat were generally considered to be the [[Nafusa Mountains]], the [[Tripolitania]]n coast, the [[Gulf of Sidra]],<ref name="Rebels wage a secret night-time war on the streets of Tripoli"/> and the southern [[Libyan Desert]].<ref name="Rebels Move Toward Gadhafi Stronghold"/>

In late August, anti-Gaddafi fighters [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|captured]] [[Tripoli]], scattering Gaddafi's government and marking the end of his 42 years of power. Many institutions of the government, including Gaddafi and several top government officials, regrouped in [[Sirte]], which Gaddafi declared to be Libya's new capital.<ref name="From voice said to be Gadhafi, a defiant message to his foes"/> Others fled to [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], [[Bani Walid]], and remote reaches of the [[Libyan Desert]], or to surrounding countries.<ref name="Gaddafi loyalists flee Sebha to Niger"/><ref name="Rebels to seek return of Gaddafi family from Algeria"/> However, Sabha [[Battle of Sabha|fell]] in late September,<ref name="hurriyetdailynews"/> Bani Walid was captured after a [[Battle of Bani Walid|grueling siege]] weeks later,<ref name="Libya conflict: NTC forces claim Bani Walid victory"/> and on 20 October, fighters under the aegis of the [[National Transitional Council]] [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|seized]] Sirte, [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|killing Gaddafi]] in the process.<ref name="Qaddafi dead after Sirte battle, PM confirms"/>

Protests occurred in many towns in both the north and south of Yemen starting in mid-January 2011.

[[File:(Banyas demonstration) مظاهرات بانياس جمعة الغضب - 29 نيسان 2011.jpg|thumb|Anti-government demonstrations in [[Baniyas]] ]]
Protests in Syria started on 26 January 2011, when a police officer assaulted a man in public at "Al-Hareeka Street" in old Damascus. The man was arrested right after the assault. As a result, protesters called for the freedom of the arrested man. Soon a "day of rage" was set for 4–5 February, but it was uneventful.<ref name="msnbcrage"/><ref name="aysor">{{cite web|url=http://www.aysor.am/en/news/2011/02/03/syrian-facebook-twitter/ |title="Day of Rage" planned for Syria; protests scheduled for Feb 4–5|publisher=aysor.am |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> On 6 March, the Syrian security forces arrested about 15 children in Daraa, in southern Syria, for writing slogans against the government.

[[Daraa]] was to be the first city to protest against the [[Ba'ath Party (Syria)|Ba'athist]] government, which has been ruling [[Syria]] since 1963.<ref name="Daraa: The spark that lit the Syrian flame"/>

Thousands of protesters gathered in [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[al-Hasakah]], [[Daraa]], [[Deir ez-Zor]], and [[Hama]] on 15 March,<ref name="Fresh Protests Erupt in Syria"/><ref name="alarabiya"/><ref name="sawtbeirut"/> with recently released politician [[Suhair Atassi]] becoming an unofficial spokesperson for the "Syrian revolution".<ref name="bbc5"/> The next day there were reports of approximately 3000 arrests and a few [[martyr]]s, but there are no official figures on the number of deaths.<ref name="sawtbeirut6"/> On 18 April 2011, approximately 100,000 protesters sat in the central Square of Homs calling for the resignation of President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Protests continued through July 2011, the government responding with harsh security clampdowns and military operations in several districts, especially in the north.<ref name="In Syria, Opposition Stages Massive Protests"/>

On 31 July, Syrian army tanks stormed several cities, including Hama, Deir Ez-Zour, [[Abu Kamal]], and [[Hirak, Syria|Herak]] near Daraa. At least 136 people were killed, the highest death toll in any day since the start of the uprising.<ref name="Syria's Ramadan massacre"/> On 5 August 2011, an anti-government demonstration took place in Syria called "God is with us", during which the Syrian security forces shot the protesters from inside the ambulances, killing 11 people consequently.<ref name="alarabiya7"/>

By late November – early December, the [[Baba Amr]] district of [[Homs]] fell under [[Free Syrian Army|armed Syrian opposition]] control. By late December, the battles between the government's security forces and the rebel Free Syrian Army intensified in Idlib Governorate. Cities in Idlib and neighborhoods in Homs and Hama began falling into the control of the opposition, during this time military operations in Homs and Hama stopped.

By mid-January the FSA gained control over [[Zabadani]] and [[Madaya, Syria|Madaya]]. By late January, the Free Syrian Army launched a full-scale attack against the government in [[Rif Dimashq]], where they took over [[Saqba]], Hamoreya, [[Harasta]] and other cities in Damascus's Eastern suburbs. On 29 January, the fourth regiment of the Syrian Army led by the president's brother [[Maher al-Assad]] and the Syrian Army dug in at Damascus, and the fighting continued where the FSA was 8&nbsp;km away from the Republican palace in Damascus. Fighting broke out near Damascus international airport, but by the next day the Syrian government deployed the Republican Guards. The military gained the upper hand and regained all land the opposition gained in Rif Dimashq by early February. On 4 February, the Syrian Army launched a massive bombardment on Homs and committed a huge massacre, killing 500 civilians in one night in Homs. By mid-February, the [[Syrian army]] regained control over [[Zabadani]] and [[Madaya, Syria|Madaya]]. In late February, Army forces entered Baba Amr after a big military operation and heavy fighting. Following this, the opposition forces began losing neighborhoods in Homs to the Syrian Army including al-Inshaat, Jobr, Karm el-Zaytoon and only Homs's old neighborhood's, including Al-Khalidiya, Homs|al-Khalidiya, remained in opposition hands.

By March 2012, the government began military operations against the opposition in [[Idlib Governorate]] including the city of [[Idlib]], which fell to the Army by mid-March. [[Saraqib]] and [[Sarmin]] were also recaptured by the government during the month. Still, at this time, the opposition managed to capture [[Al-Qusayr, Syria|al-Qusayr]] and [[Al-Rastan|Rastan]]. Heavy fighting also continued in several neighborhoods in [[Homs]] and in the city of [[Hama]]. The FSA also started to conduct hit-and-run attacks in the pro-Assad [[Aleppo Governorate]], which they were not able to do before. Heavy-to-sporadic fighting was also continuing in the [[Daraa Governorate|Daraa]] and [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate|Deir ez-Zor]] Governorates.

By late April 2012, despite a cease-fire being declared in the whole country, sporadic fighting continued, with heavy clashes specifically in Al-Qusayr, where rebel forces controlled the northern part of the city, while the military held the southern part. FSA forces were holding onto Al-Qusayr, due to it being the last major transit point toward the Lebanese border. A rebel commander from the Farouq Brigade in the town reported that 2,000 Farouq fighters had been killed in Homs province since August 2011. At this point, there were talks among the rebels in Al-Qusayr, where many of the retreating rebels from Homs city's Baba Amr district had gone, of Homs being abandoned completely.  On 12 June 2012, the UN peacekeeping chief in Syria stated that, in his view, Syria has entered a period of civil war.<ref name="Syria in full scale civil war"/>

==Aftermath==
{{See also|Arab Winter|Impact of the Arab Spring}}
In the aftermath of the Arab Spring in various countries, there was a wave of violence and instability commonly known as the Arab Winter<ref name=telegraph>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/9753123/Middle-East-review-of-2012-the-Arab-Winter.html|title=Middle East review of 2012: the Arab Winter|date=31 December 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> or Islamist Winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/12/the-arab-spring-descends-into-islamist-winter-implications-for-us-policy|title=Arab Spring into Islamist Winter: Implications for U.S. Policy|work=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> The Arab Winter was characterized by extensive civil wars, general regional instability, economic and demographic decline of the Arab League and overall religious wars between Sunni and Shia Muslims.

Although the long-term effects of the Arab Spring have yet to be shown, its short-term consequences varied greatly across the Middle East and North Africa. In Tunisia and Egypt, where the existing regimes were ousted and replaced through a process of free and fair election, the revolutions were considered short-term successes.<ref name="Demystifying the Arab Spring">{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Lisa|title=Demystifying the Arab Spring: Parsing the Differences Between Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=May 2011|volume=90|issue=3|pages=2–7}}</ref><ref name="The Arab Spring Revisited">{{cite journal|last1=Haseeb|first1=Khair El-Din|title=The Arab Spring Revisited|journal=Contemporary Arab Affairs|date=13 March 2012|volume=5|issue=2|pages=185–197|doi=10.1080/17550912.2012.673384}}</ref><ref name="What Explains Successful Protest Cascades?">{{cite journal|last1=Hussain|first1=Muzammil M|last2=Howard|first2=Philip N|title=What Explains Successful Protest Cascades?

Elsewhere, most notably in the monarchies of Morocco and the [[Persian Gulf]], existing regimes co-opted the Arab Spring movement and managed to maintain order without significant social change.<ref name="Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East">{{cite journal|last1=Bellin|first1=Eva|title=Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Lessons from the Arab Spring|journal=Comparative Politics|date=January 2012|volume=44|issue=2|pages=127–149|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23211807}}</ref><ref name="Morocco: Smart Authoritarianism Refined">{{cite book|last1=Kausch|first1=Kristina|editor1-last=Emerson|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Youngs|editor2-first=Richard|title=Democracy's Plight in the European Neighbourhood: Struggling Transitions and Proliferating Dynasties|date=2009|publisher=Centre for European Policy Studies|location=Brussels|isbn=9789290799269|pages=140–147|chapter=Morocco: Smart Authoritarianism Refined}}</ref> In other countries, particularly Syria and Libya, the apparent result of Arab Spring protests was a complete collapse of social order.<ref name="Demystifying the Arab Spring" />

Social scientists have endeavored to understand the circumstances that led to this variation in outcome. A variety of causal factors have been highlighted, most of which hinge on the relationship between the strength of the state and the strength of civil society. Countries with stronger civil society networks in various forms underwent more successful reforms during the Arab Spring; these findings are also consistent with more general social science theories such as those espoused by [[Robert D. Putnam]] and [[Joel S. Migdal]].<ref name="Strong Societies and Weak States">{{cite book|last1=Migdal|first1=Joel S|title=Strong Societies and Weak States: State-Society Relations and State Capabilities in the Third World|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691010731}}</ref><ref name="Bowling Alone">{{cite book|last1=Putnam|first1=Robert D|title=Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community|date=2001|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9780743203043}}</ref>

One of the primary influences that have been highlighted in the analysis of the Arab Spring is the relative strength or weakness of a society's formal and informal [[institution]]s prior to the revolts. When the Arab Spring began, Tunisia had an established infrastructure and a lower level of petty corruption than did other states, such as Libya.<ref name="Demystifying the Arab Spring" /> This meant that, following the overthrow of the existing regime, there was less work to be done in reforming Tunisian institutions than elsewhere, and consequently it was less difficult to transition to and consolidate a democratic system of government.<ref name="Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Douglass C|title=Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance|date=1992|publisher=ICS Press|location=San Francisco|page=13}}</ref>

Also crucial was the degree of state censorship over print, broadcast, and social media in different countries. Television coverage by channels like ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' and [[BBC News]] provided worldwide exposure and prevented mass violence by the Egyptian government in Tahrir Square, contributing to the success of the Egyptian Revolution. In other countries, such as Libya, Bahrain, and Syria, such international press coverage was not present to the same degree, and the governments of these countries were able to act more freely in suppressing the protests.<ref>Hearns-Branaman, Jesse Owen (2012), 'The Egyptian Revolution did not take place: On live television coverage by Al Jazeera English', ''[[International Journal of Baudrillard Studies]]'' Vol 9, no 1 [http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-9_1/v9-1-branaman.html]</ref><ref name="YEAR IN PICTURES: Arab Spring" /> Strong authoritarian regimes with high degrees of censorship in their national broadcast media were able to block communication and prevent the domestic spread of information necessary for successful protests. Morocco is a case in point, as its broadcast media at the time of the revolts was owned and operated almost exclusively by political elites with ties to the monarchy.<ref name="Morocco: Smart Authoritarianism Refined" />

Countries with greater access to social media, such as Tunisia and Egypt, proved more effective in mobilizing large groups of people, and appear to have been more successful overall than those with greater state control over media.<ref name="What Explains Successful Protest Cascades?" /><ref name="The Revolutions Were Tweeted">{{cite journal|last1=Lotan|first1=Gilad|last2=Graeff|first2=Erhardt|last3=Ananny|first3=Mike|last4=Gaffney|first4=Devin|last5=Pearce|first5=Ian|last6=Boyd|first6=Danah|title=The Revolutions Were Tweeted: Information Flows During the 2011 Tunisian and Egyptian Revolutions|journal=International Journal of Communication|date=2011|volume=5|pages=1375–1405}}</ref><ref name="Role of the New Media in the Arab Spring">{{cite journal|last1=Khondker|first1=Habibul Haque|title=Role of the New Media in the Arab Spring|journal=Globalizations|date=October 2011|volume=8|issue=5|pages=675–679}}</ref>

The support, even if tacit, of national military forces during protests has also been correlated to the success of the Arab Spring movement in different countries.<ref name="The Arab Spring Revisited" /><ref name="Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East" /> In Egypt and Tunisia, the military actively participated in ousting the incumbent regime and in facilitating the transition to democratic elections. Countries like Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, exhibited a strong mobilization of military force against protesters, effectively ending the revolts in their territories; others, including Libya and Syria, failed to stop the protests entirely and instead ended up in civil war.<ref name="The Arab Spring Revisited" /> The support of the military in Arab Spring protests has also been linked to the degree of ethnic homogeneity in different societies. In Saudi Arabia and Syria, where the ruling elite was closely linked with ethnic or religious subdivisions of society, the military sided with the existing regime and took on the ostensible role of protector to minority populations.<ref name="Why Middle East Studies Missed the Arab Spring">{{cite journal|last1=Gause III|first1=F. Gregory|title=Why Middle East Studies Missed the Arab Spring: The Myth of Authoritarian Stability|journal=Foreign Policy|date=July 2011|volume=90|issue=4|pages=81–90|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23039608}}</ref> Even aside from the military issue, countries with less homogeneous ethnic and national identities, such as Yemen and Jordan, seem to have exhibited less effective mobilization on the whole. The apparent exception to this trend is Egypt, which has a sizable Coptic minority. {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Finally, the presence of a strong, educated middle class has been noted as a correlate to the success of the Arab Spring in different countries.<ref name="Why was the Arab World Poised for Revolution?">{{cite journal|last1=Campante|first1=Filipe R|last2=Chor|first2=David|title=Why was the Arab World Poised for Revolution?

The strength of the middle class is, in turn, directly connected to the existing political, economic, and educational institutions in a country, and the middle class itself may be considered an informal institution.<ref name="Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth">{{cite book|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|last3=Robinson|first3=James|editor1-last=Aghion|editor1-first=Philippe|editor2-last=Durlauf|editor2-first=Steven N|title=Handbook of Economic Growth, Volume 1A|date=4 January 2006|publisher=North-Holland|isbn=9780444520418|pages=385–472|chapter=Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth}}</ref> In very broad terms, this may be reframed in terms of development, as measured by various indicators such as the [[Human Development Index]]: [[rentier state]]s such as the oil monarchies of the Persian Gulf exhibited less successful revolutions overall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruach|first=James E|last2=Kostyshak|first2=Scott|date=Summer 2009|title=The Three Arab Worlds|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=23|issue=3|pages=165–188|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>
