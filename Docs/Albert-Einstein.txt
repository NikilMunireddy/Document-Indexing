Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that [[Newtonian mechanics]] was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of [[classical mechanics]] with the laws of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led to the development of his [[special theory of relativity]]. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to [[gravitational fields]], and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of [[particle]] theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the [[universe]].<ref name=Nobel>{{Citation |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf |title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2011.

He was visiting the United States when [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933 and, being [[Jewish people|Jewish]], did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]]. He settled in the U.S., becoming an [[American citizen]] in 1940.<ref name="BoyerDubofsky2001">{{cite book|author1=Paul S.

Roosevelt]] alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This eventually led to what would become the [[Manhattan Project]]. Einstein supported defending the Allied forces, but largely denounced the idea of using the newly discovered [[nuclear fission]] as a weapon. Later, with the British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], Einstein signed the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]], which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], until his death in 1955.

Albert Einstein was born in [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] in the [[German Empire]] on 14&nbsp;March 1879.<ref name=Bio>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html |title=Albert Einstein&nbsp;– Biography |accessdate=7 March 2007 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070306133522/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html| archivedate= 6 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> His parents were [[Hermann Einstein]], a salesman and engineer, and [[Pauline Koch]]. In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded ''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie'', a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].<ref name=Bio />

The Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich from the age of 5 for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]] (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59 59–61]}}

In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref>Barry R. Parker, Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, Prometheus Books - 2003, page 31</ref> The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=30–31}} During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether theories|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field".{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}<ref>{{Citation |last=Mehra |first=Jagdish |contribution=Albert Einstein's first paper |title=The Golden Age of Physics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2001 |isbn=981-02-4985-3}}</ref>

In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein sat the entrance examinations for the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]] in [[Zürich]] (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), p. 11}} but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=36–37}} On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the [[Aargau|Argovian]] [[Mittelschule|cantonal school]] ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) in [[Aarau]], Switzerland, in 1895–96 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. (Albert's sister [[Maja Einstein|Maja]] later married Winteler's son Paul.){{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56–57}} In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his [[German citizenship|citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg]] to avoid [[Conscription in Germany|military service]].{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=40}} In September 1896, he passed the Swiss [[Matura]] with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), docs. 21–27}} Though only 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic. Marie Winteler moved to [[Olsberg, Aargau|Olsberg]], Switzerland, for a teaching post.

Einstein's future wife, [[Mileva Marić]], also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 67}} There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his celebrated 1905 papers,<ref>{{Citation |author=Troemel-Ploetz, D. |title=Mileva Einstein-Marić: The Woman Who Did Einstein's Mathematics |work=Women's Studies Int.

The discovery and publication in 1987 of an early correspondence between Einstein and Marić revealed that they had had a daughter, called [[Lieserl Einstein|"Lieserl"]] in their letters, born in early 1902 in [[Novi Sad]] where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. Einstein probably never saw his daughter. The contents of his letter to Marić in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either adopted or died of [[scarlet fever]] in infancy.<ref>J. Renn & R. Schulmann, ''Albert Einstein/Mileva Marić: The Love Letters'', 1992, pp.&nbsp;73–74, 78.</ref><ref>A. Calaprice & T. Lipscombe, ''Albert Einstein: A Biography'', 2005, pp.&nbsp;22–23.</ref>

Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their first son, [[Hans Albert Einstein]], was born in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]. Their second son, [[Eduard Einstein|Eduard]], was born in Zürich in July 1910. In April moved to [[Berlin]]. After a few month his wife returned to Zürich with their sons, after learning that Einstein's chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin Elsa.{{Sfnp|Stahel|1966}} They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called "Tete" (for ''petit''), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death.

In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still-strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/bern/Die-Liebesbriefe-des-untreuen-Einstein/story/11875058 |author=Urs Wüthrich |title=Die Liebesbriefe des untreuen Einstein |trans-title=The love letters of the unfaithful Einstein |newspaper=BZ Berner Zeitung |location=Bern, Switzerland |date=11 April 2015 |language=German |quote=Ich denke in innigster Liebe an Dich in jeder freien Minute und bin so unglücklich, wie nur ein Mensch es sein kann. |accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref>

Einstein married [[Elsa Einstein|Elsa Löwenthal]] on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated to the United States. In 1935, Elsa Einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems; she died in December 1936.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|p=216}}

After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901,{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=82}} but was not [[conscription in Switzerland|conscripted]] for medical reasons. With the help of [[Marcel Grossmann]]'s father, Einstein secured a job in Bern at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property|Federal Office for Intellectual Property]], the patent office,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Grossmann.html |title=Grossmann biography |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |editor=J J O'Connor |editor2=E F Robertson |date=May 2010 |type=scientific website? |accessdate=2015-03-27}}</ref>{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=63}} as an assistant [[patent examiner|examiner]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property |url=http://www.ipi.ch/E/institut/i1.shtm |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, IGE/IPI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=6 February 2014 |type=official website |accessdate=2015-03-27}}</ref><ref name=IGEFAQ>{{cite web |title=FAQ about Einstein and the Institute |url=https://www.ipi.ch/en/about-us/einstein/frequently-asked-questions.html |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, IGE/IPI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=27 May 2014 |type=official website |accessdate=2015-03-27}}</ref> He evaluated [[patent application]]s for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.<ref name=IGEFAQ /> In 1903, Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine technology".<ref name=GalisonClock>{{cite journal |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1344127 |author=Peter Galison |title=Einstein's Clocks: The Question of Time |work=Critical Inquiry |volume=26 |issue=2 Winter |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |date=2000 |format=online reader |via=JSTOR (ITHAKA, Michigan, New York) |pp=355–389 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref>{{rp|370}}

Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the [[thought experiment]]s that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.<ref name=GalisonClock />{{rp|377}}

With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group, self-mockingly named "[[Olympia Academy|The Olympia Academy]]", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Their readings included the works of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], and [[David Hume]], which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=79-84}}

=== Academic career ===
[[File:Albert Einstein (Nobel).png|thumb|upright|Einstein's official 1921 portrait after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics]]
In 1900, Einstein's paper [[List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein#Journal articles|"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen"]] ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the prestigious ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1901}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Galison |first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Galison |title=Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time |publisher=W.W.

As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zürich]], with his dissertation entitled, "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions."{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905b|loc="Meinem Freunde Herr Dr. Marcel Grossmann gewidmet (Dedicated to my friend, Dr. Marcel Grossmann)"}}{{Sfnp|Einstein|1926b|loc=chap. "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions"}} That same year, which has been called Einstein's ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' (miracle year), he published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]], on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.

By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the [[University of Bern]]. The following year, after giving a lecture on [[electrodynamics]] and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, [[Alfred Kleiner]] recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online/Associate-Professor-at-the-Universiy-of-Zurich-und-professor-in-Prague-1909-1912 |title=Associate Professor at the University of Zurich und professor in Prague (1909–1912) |publisher=ETH-Bibliothek Zurich, ETH Zürich, www.ethz.ch |location=Bern, Switzerland |series=Einstein Online |website=www.library.ethz.ch/en/ |date=2014 |type=digital library |language=German, English |accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref>

Einstein became a full professor at the German [[Charles-Ferdinand University]] in [[Prague]] in April 1911, accepting [[Austria]]n citizenship in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to do so.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=164}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/49610/1/569197996.pdf |author=von Hirschhausen, Ulrike  |title=Von imperialer Inklusion zur nationalen Exklusion:Staatsbürgerschaft in Österreich- Ungarn 1867–1923  |publisher=WZB Social Science Research Center Berlin |date=2007 |location=Berlin, Germany |series=ZKD – Veröffentlichungsreihe der Forschungsgruppe, „Zivilgesellschaft, Citizenship und politische Mobilisierung in Europa“ Schwerpunkt Zivilgesellschaft, Konflikte und Demokratie, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung |type=WZB Discussion Paper |issue=No. SP IV 2007-403 |ISSN=1860-4315 |page=8 |quote= Eine weitere Diskontinuität bestand viertens darin, dass die Bestimmungen der österreichischen Staatsbürgerschaft, die in den ersten Dritteln des Jahrhunderts auch auf Ungarn angewandt worden waren, seit 1867 nur noch für die cisleithanische Reichshälfte galten.

In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the [[ETH Zurich]], where he taught analytical mechanics and [[thermodynamics]]. He also studied [[continuum mechanics]], the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend [[Marcel Grossmann]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online/Professor-at-the-ETH-Zurich-1912-1914 |title=Professor at the ETH Zurich (1912–1914) |publisher=ETH-Bibliothek Zurich, ETH Zürich, www.ethz.ch |location=Zurich, Switzerland |series=Einstein Online |website=www.library.ethz.ch/en/ |date=2014 |type=digital library |language=German, English |accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref>

In 1914, he returned to the German Empire after being appointed director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]] (1914–1932)<ref name="Kant">Kant, Horst.

He soon became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], and in 1916 was appointed president of the [[German Physical Society]] (1916–1918).<ref>{{cite book |title=Albert Einstein: a biography| first1=Alice |last1=Calaprice |first2=Trevor |last2=Lipscombe |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2005 |isbn=0-313-33080-8 |page=xix |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5eWh2O_3OAQC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5eWh2O_3OAQC&pg=PR19 Timeline, p. xix]</ref>

Based on calculations Einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, [[Gravitational lens|light from another star should be bent]] by the Sun's gravity. In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] during the [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science&nbsp;– New Theory of the Universe&nbsp;– Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".<ref name="Eddington">{{cite journal |last=Andrzej |first=Stasiak |date=2003 |title=Myths in science |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=4 |issue=3 |page=236 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.embor779 |url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v4/n3/full/embor779.html |accessdate =31 March 2007}}</ref>

In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00000116 |title=Albert Einstein (1879–1955) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref> In 1921, Einstein was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". While the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat the cited work as an ''explanation'' but merely as a ''discovery of the law'', as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the [[Planck spectrum]] by [[S. N. Bose]].  Einstein was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1921|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921]].<ref name="frs" /> He also received the [[Copley Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]] in 1925.<ref name="frs" />

=== 1921–1922: Travels abroad ===
[[File:Einstein in NY 1921.jpg|thumb|240px|Einstein in New York, 1921, his first visit to the United States]]
Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor [[John Francis Hylan]], followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton University]], and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the [[National Academy of Science]] on a visit to the [[White House]]. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher [[Viscount Haldane]] in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at [[King's College London]].{{Sfnp|Hoffmann|1972|pp=145–148}} {{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=499–508}}

He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.," in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], who published his own impressions in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835).<ref>[http://www.einsteinsworld.com/News-New-York-Herald-Tribune-1931-As-Einstein-Sees-America.htm "As Einstein Sees American"], ''Einstein's World'', a 1931 reprint with minor changes, of his 1921 essay.</ref> For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life . . . The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."<ref name=Holton />{{rp|20}}

In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited  [[Singapore]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Japan]],  where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]], where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, Einstein described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=307-308}}

Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.<ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-speech.html The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921: Albert Einstein. Banquet Speech by R. Nadolny (in German).] Retrieved 9 December 2015 via Nobelprize.org</ref>

On his return voyage, he visited [[British Mandate for Palestine|Palestine]] for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. Einstein was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, [[Sir Herbert Samuel]]. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=308}}

=== 1930–1931: Travel to the U.S. ===
In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the U.S., he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=368}}

After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], a lunch with the editors of the ''New York Times'', and a performance of ''Carmen'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] and met the president of [[Columbia University]], who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}} [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]], pastor at New York's [[Riverside Church]], gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}} Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at [[Madison Square Garden]] during a [[Hanukkah]] celebration.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}}

Einstein next traveled to California where he met [[Caltech]] president and Nobel laureate, [[Robert A. Millikan]]. His friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism," where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=373}} During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=374}}

This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author [[Upton Sinclair]] and film star [[Charlie Chaplin]], both noted for their pacifism. [[Carl Laemmle]], head of [[Universal Studios]], gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament," from which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy."<ref name=Chaplin>Chaplin, Charles. ''Charles Chaplin: My Autobiography'', Simon and Schuster, N.Y. (1964)</ref>{{rp|320}}

[[File:Albert Einstein and Charlie Chaplin - 1931.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charlie Chaplin]] and Einstein at the [[Hollywood]] premier of ''[[City Lights]]'', January 1931]]
Chaplin also remembers Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his [[theory of relativity]]. During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food. She asked him if something was bothering him. He sat down at his piano and started playing. He continued playing and writing notes for half an hour, then went upstairs to his study, where he remained for two weeks, with Elsa bringing up his food. At the end of the two weeks, he came downstairs with two sheets of paper bearing his theory.<ref name=Chaplin />{{rp|320}}

Chaplin's film, ''[[City Lights]]'', was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. [[Walter Isaacson]], Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity." Einstein and Chaplin arrived together, in black tie, with Elsa joining them, "beaming." The audience applauded as they entered the theater.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=374}} Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin, and recalled his "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was "possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis."<ref name=Chaplin />{{rp|322}}

=== 1933: Emigration to the U.S. ===
[[File:Einstein-cartoon1.jpg|thumb|Cartoon of Einstein, who has shed his "Pacifism" wings, standing next to a pillar labeled "World Peace." He is rolling up his sleeves and holding a sword labeled "Preparedness" (by Charles R. Macauley, c. 1933).]]
In February 1933 while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=659}}{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=404}}

While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in Pasadena. He and his wife Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in [[Antwerp]] on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and turned in his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} A few years later, the Nazis sold his boat and turned his cottage into a [[Hitler Youth]] camp.<ref>{{YouTube|id=HZ_W3EAfp6I#t=20m50s|title="Albert Einstein: How I See the World"}}, ''PBS''</ref>

==== Refugee status ====
In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} Historian [[Gerald Holton]] describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues," thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.<ref name=Holton>Holton, Gerald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=prgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18&dq=Gerald+Holton+migration+physicists+United+States+Einstein+jews&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cFWCU9qcLsr6oASvhYLgBA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Gerald%20Holton%20migration%20physicists%20United%20States%20Einstein%20jews&f=false "The migration of physicists to the United States"], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', April 1984 pp. 18–24</ref>

A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the [[German Student Union]] in the [[Nazi book burnings]], with Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaiming, "Jewish intellectualism is dead."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}}<ref name=Jerome>Jerome, Fred, and Taylor, Rodger.

[[File:Einstein and Locker-Lampson.jpeg|thumb|Einstein surrounded by Oliver Locker-Lampson (seated) and assistants assigned to protect him]]
Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]], who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with the press publishing a photo of them guarding Einstein.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=422}}

Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet [[Winston Churchill]] at his home, and later, [[Austen Chamberlain]] and former Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=419–420}} Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian [[Martin Gilbert]] notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]] to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.<ref name=Gilbert>Gilbert, Martin. ''Churchill and the Jews'', Henry Holt and Company, N.Y. (2007) pp. 101, 176</ref> Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put [[Allies of World War II|the Allies']] technology ahead of theirs.<ref name=Gilbert />

Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including [[Turkey]]'s Prime Minister, [[İsmet İnönü]], to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved individuals."<ref>Reisman, Arnold. [http://hnn.us/article/31946 "What a Freshly Discovered Einstein Letter Says About Turkey Today"], ''History News Network,'', George Masons University, Nov. 20, 2006</ref>

Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. The bill failed to become law, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Princeton [[Institute for Advanced Study]], in the U.S., to become a resident scholar.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}

==== Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study ====
[[File:Einstein-formal portrait-35.jpg|thumb|Portrait taken in 1935 in Princeton]]
In October 1933 Einstein returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]),{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=649, 678}} noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.<ref name="Arntzenius2011" /> At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their [[Jewish quota]] which lasted until the late 1940s.<ref name="Arntzenius2011">{{cite book|author=Linda G.

Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including [[Christ Church, Oxford]] where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5 year Studentship,<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Oxford Chabad Society |url=http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/457396/jewish/Albert-Einstein.htm |title=Oxford Jewish Personalities: |accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=The Oxford Times |date=2012 |url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/leisure/history_heritage/9617968.How_Einstein_fled_from_the_Nazis_to_an_Oxford_college/ |title=How Einstein fled from the Nazis to an Oxford college |accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=686–687}}

Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief |title=In Brief |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=4 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100329064405/http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief| archivedate= 29 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being [[John von Neumann]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. [[Bruria Kaufman]], his assistant, later became a physicist.  During this period, Einstein tried to develop a [[unified field theory]] and to refute the [[Copenhagen interpretation|accepted interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]], both unsuccessfully.

==== World War II and the Manhattan Project ====
In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted.<ref name=Pritchard>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/7970619/Obama-could-kill-fossil-fuels-overnight-with-a-nuclear-dash-for-thorium.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London, GB |title=Obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium |first=Ambrose |last=Evans-Pritchard |date=29 August 2010 |accessdate=2015-06-07}}</ref> Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]], "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the [[German nuclear energy project|race to build an atomic bomb]], and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=630}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Gosling |first=F.

To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a [[Albert Einstein's political views|pacifist]], said he had never considered.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lanouette |first=William |last2=Silard |first2=Bela |title=Genius in the Shadows: A Biography of Leo Szilárd: The Man Behind The Bomb |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |date=1992 |isbn=0-684-19011-7 |pages=198–200}}</ref> He was asked to lend his support by writing [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|a letter]], with Szilárd, to President [[Franklin D.

As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]]. It became the only country to successfully develop a nuclear weapon during World War II and also remains the only country to use it in [[combat]] by [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonating each nuclear weapon on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, towards the end of the war.

For Einstein, "war was a disease&nbsp;... [and] he called for resistance to war." By signing the letter to Roosevelt, he went against his pacifist principles.<ref>{{cite web |author=Einstein, Albert |date=1952 |title=On My Participation in the Atom Bomb Project |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/EinsteinResponse.shtml |publisher=AJ Software & Multimedia |via=atomicarchive.org |page=??? |accessdate=2015-06-07}}</ref> In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, [[Linus Pauling]], "I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them&nbsp;..."{{Sfnp|Clark|1971|p=???}}

==== U.S. citizenship ====
[[File:Citizen-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein accepting [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]] certificate from judge [[Phillip Forman]]]]
Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the [[meritocracy]] in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=432}}

=== Personal life ===

==== Supporter of civil rights ====
Einstein was a passionate, committed antiracist and joined [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] of African Americans. He considered racism America's "worst disease,"<ref name="Jerome" /> seeing it as "handed down from one generation to the next."<ref>Calaprice, Alice (2005) ''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7921.html The new quotable Einstein]''. pp.148–149 Princeton University Press, 2005.

In 1946 Einstein visited [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in Pennsylvania where he was awarded an honorary degree.

==== Assisting Zionist causes ====
Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the [[World Zionist Organization]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], to help raise funds for the planned university.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=290}} He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.

Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as [[malaria]], which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the country's development.<ref name=Rowe />{{rp|161}} Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.<ref name=Rowe>Rowe, David E. and Schulmann, Robert, editors.

Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president.

==== Love of music ====
{{quote box|width = 300px|quote=If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music...

Einstein developed an appreciation of music at an early age. His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the [[violin]], not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into [[German culture]]. According to conductor [[Leon Botstein]], Einstein is said to have begun playing when he was 5, although he did not enjoy it at that age.<ref name=Botstein />

When he turned 13 he discovered the violin sonatas of [[Mozart]], whereupon "Einstein fell in love" with Mozart's music and studied music more willingly.  He taught himself to play without "ever practicing systematically", he said, deciding that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty."<ref name=Botstein>{{cite book|author1=Peter Galison|author2=Gerald James Holton|author3=Silvan S. Schweber|title=Einstein for the 21st Century: His Legacy in Science, Art, and Modern Culture|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-13520-7|pages=161–164}}</ref> At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played [[Beethoven]]'s [[violin sonata]]s, the examiner stating afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'." What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."<ref name=Botstein />

Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played [[chamber music]] were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the [[Köchel catalogue]] of Mozart's work; that edition was actually prepared by [[Alfred Einstein]],{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} who may have been a distant relation.<ref>Article "Alfred Einstein", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', ed.

Einstein's views about religious belief have been collected from interviews and original writings. He called himself an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], while disassociating himself from the label [[atheist]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=390}} He said he believed in the [[Pantheism|"pantheistic"]] God of [[Spinozism|Baruch Spinoza]], but not in a [[personal god]], a belief he criticized.<ref>Einstein, Albert "Gelegentliches", Soncino Gesellschaft, Berlin, 1929, p. 9 "This firm belief, a belief bound up with a deep feeling, in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God.

=== Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics ===
{{Main|Statistical mechanics|thermal fluctuations|statistical physics}}

Albert Einstein's first paper<ref name=PubList>{{cite web|author=Hans-Josef Kuepper |url=http://www.einstein-website.de/z_physics/wisspub-e.html |title=List of Scientific Publications of Albert Einstein |publisher=Einstein-website.de |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> submitted in 1900 to ''Annalen der Physik'' was on [[capillary attraction]]. It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.<ref name=PubList />

=== General principles ===
He articulated the [[principle of relativity]]. This was understood by [[Hermann Minkowski]] to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the [[principle of equivalence]] and the principle of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of the quantum number.

=== Theory of relativity and ''E'' = ''mc''² ===
{{Main|History of special relativity}}
Einstein's "''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper''" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciles [[Maxwell's equations]] for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics, by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the [[speed of light]]. This later became known as Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]].

Consequences of this include the [[Spacetime|time-space frame]] of a moving body appearing to [[Time dilation|slow down]] and [[Length contraction|contract]] (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}}

In his paper on [[mass–energy equivalence]], Einstein produced ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''<sup>2</sup> from his special relativity equations.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=vi, 15, 90, 131, [https://books.google.com/?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA215 215]}}  Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].<ref>For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different controversies it encountered, see the articles in Thomas F. Glick, ed., ''The Comparative Reception of Relativity'' (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1987), ISBN 90-277-2498-9.</ref>{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=382-386}}

=== Photons and energy quanta ===
[[File:Photoelectric effect.svg|thumb|upright|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]
{{Main|Photon|Quantum}}
In a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (''[[quantum|quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].

Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}

=== Quantized atomic vibrations ===
{{Main|Einstein solid}}
In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be different, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html Celebrating Einstein "Solid Cold". U.S. DOE.], [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]], 2011.</ref>

=== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ===
{{Main|Old quantum theory}}
Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].

Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.

=== Wave–particle duality ===
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein during his visit to the United States]]
{{Main|Wave–particle duality}}
Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}}
In "''über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''" ("[[s:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave–particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this wave-particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.

=== Theory of critical opalescence ===
{{Main|Critical opalescence}}
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref>{{cite web |last=Levenson |first=Thomas |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/ |title=Einstein's Big Idea |publisher=WBGH |type=public broadcaster website |via=NOVA by [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), Arlington, VA, USA |location=Boston, MA, USA |date=9 September 1997 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

=== Zero-point energy ===
{{Main|Zero-point energy}}
In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his "second quantum theory."  Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Albert Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]].  Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data.  The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912–1914|pp=270ff}}

=== General relativity and the equivalence principle ===
{{Main|History of general relativity}}
{{See also|Principle of equivalence|Theory of relativity|Einstein field equations}}
[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]
General relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.

As Albert Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational red shift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179-183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900–1909|pp=273-274}}

In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]] by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity can for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194-195}}

====Gravitational waves====
In 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=Näherungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date= June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1|pages=688–696}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=Über Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154–167}}</ref> ripples in the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]] which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under [[general relativity]] due to its [[Lorentz invariance]] which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]], which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.

The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting [[neutron stars]], [[PSR B1913+16]].<ref name="natgeo">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160211-gravitational-waves-found-spacetime-science/</ref> The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.<ref name="natgeo"/><ref>http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/press.html</ref> Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at [[LIGO]] published direct observation, on Earth, of gravitational waves, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.<ref name="natgeo"/><ref>{{Cite web|title = LIGO {{!}} MIT|url = http://space.mit.edu/LIGO/more.html|website = space.mit.edu|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Scientists make first direct</ref name"natgeo"> detection of gravitational waves|url = http://news.mit.edu/2016/ligo-first-detection-gravitational-waves-0211|website = MIT News|access-date = 2016-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Einstein's gravitational waves 'seen' from black holes - BBC News|url = http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35524440|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Gravitational Waves Detected, Confirming Einstein’s Theory|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2016-02-11|access-date = 2016-02-12|issn = 0362-4331|first = Dennis|last = Overbye}}</ref>

=== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ===
{{Main|Hole argument}}
While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref>van Dongen, Jeroen (2010) ''Einstein's Unification'' Cambridge University Press, p.23.</ref> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.

=== Cosmology ===
{{Main|Cosmology}}
{{cosmology|scientists}}
In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of [[Mach's principle]] in these years.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/14/135th-birthday-einstein-still-full-surprises/#.UybABMHiG9V|title=On His 135th Birthday, Einstein is Still Full of Surprises|work=Out There}}</ref>

Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, the Friedman-Einstein model of 1931<ref name="einstein-1931">Einstein, A. 1931.

In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder". The astrophysicist [[Mario Livio]] has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/books/review/brilliant-blunders-by-mario-livio.html|title=The Genius of Getting It Wrong|date=9 June 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist [[Cormac O'Raifeartaigh]] discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the universe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-lost-theory-uncovered-1.14767|title=Einstein’s lost theory uncovered|work=Nature News & Comment}}</ref> In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.<ref name="cor-steady-state">O’Raifeartaigh, C., B.

For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."

It thus appears that Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|Steady State model]] of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.<ref>Hoyle, "A New Model for the Expanding Universe," MNRAS 108 (1948) 372. {{Bibcode|1948MNRAS.108..372H}}</ref><ref>Bondi and Gold, "The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe," MNRAS 108 (1948) 252. {{Bibcode|1948MNRAS.108..252B}}</ref> However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.<ref name="cor-steady-state"/><ref name="Einstein’s aborted model"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2014/03/07/einsteins-lost-theory-describes-a-universe-without-a-big-bang/#.Uya3EcHiG9U|title=Einstein's Lost Theory Describes a Universe Without a Big Bang – The Crux|work=The Crux}}</ref>

[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|Newspaper headline on May 4, 1935]]

Video.pbs.org. Retrieved on 11 May 2012.</ref> In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}
This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.
Einstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.

=== Bose–Einstein statistics ===
{{Main|Bose–Einstein statistics}}
In 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]–[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm|title=Cornell and Wieman Share 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics|date=9 October 2001|accessdate=11 June 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070610080506/http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm| archivedate= 10 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s.

=== Energy momentum pseudotensor ===
{{Main|Stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor}}
General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.

Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.

The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and others.

=== Unified field theory ===
{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}
Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his "[[unified field theory]]" in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article entitled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.

=== Wormholes ===
{{Main|Wormhole}}
Einstein collaborated with others to produce a model of a [[wormhole]]. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.

If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.

=== Einstein–Cartan theory ===
{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.

=== Equations of motion ===
{{Main|Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations}}
The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the [[Einstein equations]] which describe how space curves, the [[geodesic equation]] which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.

Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.

This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.

=== Other investigations ===
{{Main|Einstein's unsuccessful investigations}}
Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], [[gravitational waves]], and other research.

=== Collaboration with other scientists ===
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world's top physicists. Einstein in the center.]]
In addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.

==== Einstein–de Haas experiment ====
{{Main|Einstein–de Haas effect}}
Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.

==== Schrödinger gas model ====
Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.

This formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref>{{Citation |last=Moore |first=Walter |date=1989 |title=Schrödinger: Life and Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-43767-9}}</ref>

=== Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ===
{{Main|EPR paradox}}
In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.

He then used a hypothesis of [[local realism]] to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.

This principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which had been promulgated in 1964.
