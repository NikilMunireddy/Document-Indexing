The history of [[Pomerania]], an area in modern-day [[Germany]] and [[Poland]], dates back more than 10,000 years. 
The name ''Pomerania'' comes from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''po more'', which means ''Land at the Sea''.<ref>[http://www.pommersches-landesmuseum.de/kulturreferat-fuer-pommern/aufgaben/aufgaben.html ''Der Name Pommern (po more) ist slawischer Herkunft und bedeutet so viel wie „Land am Meer“.''] (Pommersches Landesmuseum, German)</ref>

After the [[glaciers]] of the [[Vistula Glacial Stage]] retreated from [[Pomerania]] during the [[Allerød oscillation]],<ref name=Hoops422/> a warming period that falls within the [[Early Stone Age]], they left a [[tundra]].

During the [[Bronze Age]], [[Western Pomerania]] was part of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] cultures, while east of the [[Oder]] the [[Lusatian culture]] dominated.<ref name=Piskorski2021/> Throughout the [[Iron Age]], the people of the western Pomeranian areas belonged to the [[Jastorf culture]],<ref name=Piskorski23/><ref name=Wernicke1819/> while the Lusatian culture of the East was succeeded by the [[Pomeranian culture]],<ref name=Piskorski23/> then in 150 BC by the [[Oxhöft culture|Oxhöft (Oksywie) culture]], and at the beginning of the first millennium by the [[Willenberg Culture|Willenberg (Wielbark) Culture]].<ref name=Piskorski23/>

While the [[Jastorf culture]] is usually associated with [[Germanic peoples]],<ref name=Wernicke19/> the ethnic category of the [[Lusatian culture]] and its successors is debated.<ref name=Piskorski21ff/> [[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]], [[Germanic peoples]] ([[Goths]], [[Rugians]], and [[Gepids]]) and possibly [[Slavs]] are assumed to have been the bearers of these cultures or parts thereof.<ref name=Piskorski21ff>Piskorski (1999), pp.21ff 6</ref>

Beginning in the 3rd century, many settlements were abandoned,<ref name=Hoops281/> marking the beginning of the [[Migration Period]] in [[Pomerania]]. It is assumed that [[Burgundians]], [[Goths]] and [[Gepids]] with parts of the [[Rugians]] left [[Pomerania]] during that stage, while some [[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]], [[Vidivarii]] and other, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic groups]] remained,<ref name=Hoops282>[[Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde|RGA]] 23 (2003), p.282</ref> and formed the [[Gustow group|Gustow]], [[Debczyn culture|Debczyn]] and late [[Willenberg culture|Willenberg]] cultures, which existed in Pomerania until the 6th century.<ref name=Hoops281>[[Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde|RGA]] 23 (2003), p.281</ref>

{{main|Pomerania during the High Middle Ages}}

The early 12th century, [[Obodrites|Obodrite]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Denmark|Danish]] conquests resulted in vassalage and [[Christianization]] of the formerly pagan and independent [[Pomerania]]n tribes.<ref name="Addison 2003, pp.57ff"/><ref name="Realenzyklopedie p.40">Theologische Realenzyklopädie (1997), p.40</ref><ref name="Buchholz p.25"/><ref name="Herrmann, pp.384ff">Herrmann (1985), pp.384ff</ref> Local dynasties ruled the [[Principality of Rügen]] (House of Wizlaw), the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] ([[House of Pomerania]]), the [[Lands of Schlawe and Stolp]] (Ratiboride branch of the House of Pomerania), and the duchies in [[Pomerelia]] ([[Samborides]]).<ref name="Realenzyklopedie p.40"/>

The [[List of Pomeranian duchies and dukes|dukes of Pomerania]] expanded their realm into [[Circipania]] and [[Uckermark]] to the Southwest, and competed with the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] for territory and formal overlordship over their duchies. Pomerania-Demmin lost most of her territory and was integrated into Pomerania-Stettin in the mid-13th century. When the Ratiborides died out in 1223, competition arose for the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp,<ref name="Buchholz p.87">Buchholz (1999), p.87</ref> which changed hands numerous times.

Throughout the High Middle Ages, a large influx of German settlers and the introduction of German law, custom, and [[Low German]] language turned the area west of the Oder into a German one ([[Ostsiedlung]]). The [[Wends]], who [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|during the Early Middle Ages]] had belonged to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]], [[Liuticians|Lutician]] and [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranian]] tribes, were assimilated by the [[Pomeranians (German people)|German Pomeranians]]. To the east of the Oder these development occurred later; in the area from Szczecin eastward, the number of German settlers in the 12th century was still insignificant. The [[Kashubians]] descendants of [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Slavic Pomeranians]], dominated many rural areas in [[Pomerelia]].

The [[conversion of Pomerania]] to [[Christianity]] was achieved primarily by the missionary efforts of [[Absalon]] and [[Otto von Bamberg]], by the foundation of numerous monasteries, and by the assimilatory power of the Christian settlers. [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cammin|A Pomeranian diocese]] was set up in [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]], the see was later moved to [[Kamien Pomorski|Cammin]].<ref>W. von Sommerfeld: Geschichte der Germanisierung des Herzogtums Pommern oder Slavien bis zum Ablauf des 13.

{{main|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}

Throughout this time, [[Pomerelia]] was within [[Royal Prussia]], a part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] with considerable autonomy. In the late 18th century, it became a part of [[Prussia]].

The [[Duchy of Pomerania]] was fragmented into Pomerania-Stettin ([[Farther Pomerania]]) and Pomerania-Wolgast ([[Western Pomerania]]) in 1532,<ref name="Realenzyklopedie p.40ff">Gerhard Krause, Horst Robert Balz, Gerhard Müller, Theologische Realenzyklopädie, Walter de Gruyter, 1997, p.40ff</ref><ref name="Buchholz pp.205-220">Buchholz (1999), pp.205-220</ref> underwent [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1534,<ref name="Moulin Eckart 1976, pp.111,112"/><ref name="Realenzyklopädie, p.43ff"/><ref name="Buchholz pp.205–212">Buchholz (1999), pp.205-212</ref> and was even further fragmented in 1569.<ref name="Buchholz pp.207">Buchholz (1999), pp.207</ref> In 1627, the [[Thirty Years' War]] reached the duchy.<ref name="Buchholz, p.233">Buchholz (1999), p.233</ref> Since the [[Treaty of Stettin (1630)]], it was under Swedish control.<ref name="Buchholz, p.233"/><ref name="Buchholz, pp.235,236">Buchholz (1999), pp.235,236</ref> Inmidst the war, the last duke [[Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania|Bogislaw XIV]] died without an issue.

{{main|History of Pomerania (1806&ndash;1933)}}

From the [[Napoleonic Wars]] to [[World War I]], [[Pomerania]] was administered by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]] ([[Western Pomerania|Western]] and [[Farther Pomerania]]) and [[West Prussia]] ([[Pomerelia]]).

The Province of Pomerania was created from the [[Province of Pomerania (1653&ndash;1815)]] ([[Farther Pomerania]] and southern [[Vorpommern]]) and [[Swedish Pomerania]] (northern [[Vorpommern]]), and the districts of [[Schivelbein]] and [[Dramburg]], formerly belonging to the [[Neumark]].<ref name="Buchholz, p.366">Buchholz (1999), p.366</ref> While in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the province was heavily influenced by the reforms of [[Karl August von Hardenberg]]<ref>Buchholz (1999), pp.393ff</ref> and [[Otto von Bismarck]].<ref name="Buchholz, pp.420ff">Buchholz (1999), pp.420ff</ref> The [[industrial revolution]] had an impact primarily on the [[Stettin]] area and the infrastructure, while most of the province retained a rural and agricultural character.<ref name="Buchholz 1999, pp.412,413,464ff">Buchholz (1999), pp.412,413,464ff</ref> Since 1850, the [[net migration rate]] was negative, [[Pomeranians (German people)|Pomeranians]] emigrated primarily to [[Berlin]], the West German industrial regions and overseas.<ref>Buchholz (1999), pp.400ff</ref> In areas where Polish population lived along with Germans a virtual apartheid existed, with bans on Polish language and religious discrimination, besides attempts to colonize the areas with Germans<ref>A history of modern Germany, 1800-2000 Martin Kitchen Wiley-Blackwel 2006, page 130)</ref> [[Prussian Settlement Commission]] introduced 154,000 German colonists before World War I, which were also located in Pomerania.<ref>Andrzej Chwalba - ''Historia Polski 1795-1918'' page 461</ref>

With the consolidation of [[Communism]] in [[East Germany]] and [[Poland]], [[Pomerania]] was part of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. In the 1980s, the [[Solidarnosc]] movement in [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig) and the [[Die Wende|Wende]] movement in [[East Germany]] forced the Communists out of power and led to the establishment of [[democracy]] in both the [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Germany|German]] part of [[Pomerania]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
