'''Admission to the bar in the United States''' is the [[Admission to practice law|granting of permission]] by a particular court system to a lawyer to [[practice of law|practice law]] in that system. Each US state and similar jurisdiction (e.g. [[United States territory|territories under federal control]]) has its own court system and sets its own rules for bar admission (or privilege to practice law), which can lead to different admission standards among states. In most cases, a person who is "admitted" to the bar is thereby a "member" of the particular bar.

In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from a [[law school]] approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a [[background check]]. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements.

A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.

==Terminology==
[[Image:Bar at the Rhode Island Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|right|the bar (railing) at the [[Rhode Island Supreme Court]]]]

The use of the term "[[bar (law)|bar]]" to mean "the whole body of lawyers, the legal profession" comes ultimately from English custom. In the early 16th century, a railing divided the hall in the [[Inns of Court]], with students occupying the body of the hall and readers or [[Bencher]]s on the other side. Students who officially became lawyers were "[[called to the bar]]", crossing the symbolic physical barrier and thus "admitted to the bar".<ref name="[[etymologyonline]]">{{cite web

|title=Etymology: Bar
|accessdate=December 11, 2006|publisher=EtymologyOnline.com}}</ref> Later, this was popularly assumed to mean the wooden railing marking off the area around the judge's seat in a courtroom, where prisoners stood for arraignment and where a [[barrister]] stood to plead. In modern courtrooms, a railing may still be in place to enclose the space which is occupied by legal [[counsel]] as well as the [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[defendant]]s and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[litigant]]s who have business pending before the court.

==General requirements for admission==
{{See also|Law school in the United States}}
The first bar exam in what is now the United States was instituted by [[Delaware Colony]] in 1763, as an oral examination before a judge.<ref name=CalBarHistory>{{cite web |title=California Bar Examination: Information and History |url=http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/4/documents/Bar-Exam-Info-History.pdf |publisher=The State Bar of California |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |page=3}}</ref>  The other American colonies soon followed suit.<ref name=CalBarHistory/>  By the late 19th century, the examinations were administered by committees of attorneys, and they eventually changed from an oral examination to a written one.<ref name=CalBarHistory/>

Today, each state has its own rules which are the ultimate authority concerning admission to its bar. Generally, admission to a bar requires that the candidate do the following:
* In most situations, earn a Juris Doctor from a law school approved by that state (often, but not always,<ref>[http://www.lsac.org/LSACResources/Publications/PDFs/ThinkAboutLawSchool.pdf Law School Admission Council "Thinking About Law School?", page 4]</ref> this means accredited by the American Bar Association) (indeed, in certain states, e.g., Arizona, one may not actually take the bar exam unless one's law school is ABA accredited, and this requirement has withstood constitutional attack); or, where permitted, participate in an approved Law Clerk program ("reading the law").  
* In all United States jurisdictions except Maryland, [[Puerto Rico]], and Wisconsin, pass the [[Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination]] (MPRE), an examination covering the [[professional responsibility]] rules governing lawyers. This test is not administered at the same time as any U.S. bar exam. Most candidates usually sit for the MPRE while still in law school, right after studying professional responsibility (a required course in all ABA-accredited law schools), while the material is still fresh in their memory. Some states require that a candidate pass the MPRE before being allowed to sit for the bar exam. Connecticut and New Jersey waive the MPRE for candidates who have received a grade of C or better in a law school professional ethics class.
* Pass a [[Bar examination#United States of America|bar examination]], usually administered by the [[state bar association]] or under the authority of the [[State supreme court|supreme court]] of the particular state.
** {{As of|2015|6}}, 16 jurisdictions have adopted the [[Uniform Bar Examination]] (UBE).<ref name=UBE>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbex.org/about-ncbe-exams/ube/ |title=The Uniform Bar Examination (UBE) |publisher=National Conference of Bar Examiners |accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> Missouri and North Dakota were the first two states to administer the UBE, doing so in February 2011.<ref name="UBE jurisdictions">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbex.org/about-ncbe-exams/ube/ube-faqs/ |title=General UBE FAQs |publisher=National Conference of Bar Examiners |accessdate=April 16, 2014}} Click on "Which jurisdictions administer the UBE?"</ref> Since then, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming have adopted and administered the UBE.<ref name="UBE jurisdictions"/> According to the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), which prepares the UBE, it is intended to "test knowledge and skills that every lawyer should be able to demonstrate prior to becoming licensed to practice law", and "is uniformly administered, graded, and scored by user jurisdictions and results in a portable score."<ref name=UBE/> UBE jurisdictions are allowed to additionally test candidates' knowledge of state-specific law, through either a test or course.<ref name=UBE/> The UBE consists of three parts:<ref name=UBE/>
*** The [[Multistate Bar Examination]] (MBE), a [[standardized test]] consisting of 200 [[multiple-choice question]]s covering seven (7) key areas of law: Constitutional law, Contracts, Criminal law and Procedure, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Federal Rules of Evidence, Real Property and Torts. Examinees have three  (3) hours to answer 100 questions in a morning session and the same for an afternoon session. The MBE is administered on the last Wednesday in February and July.
*** The [[Multistate Essay Examination]] (MEE), a uniform though not standardized test that examines a candidate's ability to analyze legal issues and communicate them effectively in writing. The NCBE provides nine possible MEE questions for each bar exam administration; the UBE uses six of these. This exam is administered on the last Tuesday of each February and July. Topics range from the seven MBE topics above, and include Business law (Agency, Corporations, LLC and Partnerships), Commercial law (Commercial paper, Secured Transactions and the Uniformed Commercial Code [UCC]), Conflicts of law, Estates and Probate (Trusts and Wills), and Family Law.
*** The [[Multistate Performance Test]] (MPT), a "closed-universe" test in which each candidate is required to perform a standard lawyering task, such as a memo or brief. The candidate is provided with a case file and a "library" which contains all of the substantive law required to perform the task (plus some non-relevant material). The MPT is administered on the last Tuesday in each February and July. The NCBE provides two MPT questions for each administration; the UBE uses both.
** In states that do not use the UBE, the examination usually follows a similar format:
*** The MBE is currently required in all jurisdictions except Louisiana and Puerto Rico. The most recent state to adopt the MBE was Washington, which began using the MBE when it adopted the UBE in July 2013.<ref name="MBE jurisdictions">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbex.org/multistate-tests/mbe/mbe-jurisdictions/ |title=MBE Jurisdictions |publisher=National Conference of Bar Examiners |accessdate=February 18, 2013}}</ref>
*** In jurisdictions that do not use the MPRE, candidates must pass a professional responsibility ("ethics") exam included as part of the main bar exam. Some states, such as Michigan, employ the MPRE and include ethics questions in their main exam.
*** State-specific content is usually included in the examination, such as essays in Washington, Minnesota and Massachusetts. Some states, such as Florida, include both essays and multiple-choice questions in their state-specific sections; Virginia uses full essays and short-answer  questions in its state-specific section.
* Be certified (usually by the state bar association) as having the [[good moral character]] and fitness to practice law.
* Apply to that state's authority responsible for licensing lawyers and pay required fees. Upon approval by that authority, the admittee takes an oath to comply with the rules governing the practice of law in that state, and receives a certificate of admission.
* In some jurisdictions, e.g., New Jersey, satisfy additional educational requirements; however, [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) is generally a matter of license renewal, not admission.

===Law schools not accredited by the ABA===
[[Alabama State Bar|Alabama]], [[State Bar of California#Lawyer admissions|California]],<ref>[http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/4/documents/Education/Rules_Title4_Div2-Acc-Law-Sch.pdf Committee of Bar Examiners: Title 4.

On the other hand, in certain states, e.g., Arizona, one may not be allowed to actually take the bar exam unless one's law school is ABA accredited, and this requirement has withstood constitutional attack. Thus, a graduate of a law school without ABA accreditation may not sit for the [[State Bar of Arizona|Arizona bar]], although they may take the bar in other states.

====California "Registered" law schools====
In [[California]], certain law schools are registered with the Committee of Bar Examiners<ref>[http://rules.calbar.ca.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=5LAwXeKsh6U%3d&tabid=1227 Committee of Bar Examiners: Title 4. Admission and Educational Standards Adopted July 2007, Division 3. Unaccredited Law School Rules, Chapter 1. General Provisions]</ref> of The [[State Bar of California#Lawyer admissions|State Bar of California]]. Such schools, though not accredited by either the ABA or the Committee on Bar Examiners, are authorized to grant the [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) [[law degree]]. Students at these schools must take and pass the First-Year Law Students' Examination (commonly referred to as the "[[State Bar of California#Lawyer admissions|Baby Bar]]") administered by the CBE.<ref>[http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Examinations/FirstYearLawStudentsExamination.aspx FYLSE Requirements]</ref> Upon successful passing of the "Baby Bar," those students may continue with their law studies to obtain their J.D. degree.<ref>[http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=hmgSAnbvFi0%3d&tabid=2254 Description & Grading of the California First-year Law Students' Examination]</ref> Students at law schools accredited by either the ABA or CBE are exempt from having to take and pass the Baby Bar.

===Admission without law school===
In California, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming<ref>http://www.courts.state.wy.us/CourtRules_Entities.aspx?RulesPage=PracticeOfLawAdmission.xml</ref> an applicant who has not attended law school may take the bar exam after study under a judge or practicing attorney for an extended period of time.<ref name=wa-rule6>{{cite web

New York requires that applicants who are reading the law have at least one year of law school study (Rule 520.4 for the Admission of Attorneys).<ref>[http://www.nybarexam.org/Rules/Rules.htm#520.4 Rule 520.4]</ref>

[[Maine]] allows students with two years of law school to serve an apprenticeship in lieu of completing their third year.

==Tactical considerations regarding admission in multiple states==

Most attorneys seek and obtain admission only to the bar of one state, and then rely upon ''[[pro hac vice]]'' admissions for the occasional out-of-state matter. However, many new attorneys do seek admission in multiple states, either by taking multiple bar exams or applying for reciprocity. This is common for those living and working in [[United States metropolitan area|metro area]]s which sprawl into multiple states, such as [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York metropolitan area|New York City]]. Attorneys based in predominantly rural states or rural areas near state borders frequently seek admission in multiple states in order to enlarge their client base.

Note that in states that allow reciprocity, admission on motion may have conditions that do not apply to those admitted by examination. For example, attorneys admitted on motion in Virginia are required to show evidence of the intent to practice full-time in Virginia and are prohibited from maintaining an office in any other jurisdiction. Also, their licenses automatically expire when they no longer maintain an office in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/motion/motionrules.html |title=Rules & Regulations for Admission on Motion |author=[[Supreme Court of Virginia]] |publisher=Virginia Board of Bar Examiners |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rules for Admission on Motion|url=http://barreciprocity.com/reciprocity-admission-on-motion/|work=Database of Reciprocity and Admission Rules|publisher=BarReciprocity.com|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}</ref>

==Types of state bar associations==
Admission to a state's bar is not necessarily the same as membership in that state's bar association. There are two kinds of state bar associations:

===Mandatory (integrated) bar===
Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia require membership in the state's bar association to practice law there.<ref name=wptlarticle>{{cite web
|url=http://www.abanet.org/barserv/stlobar.html
|title=State and Local Bar Associations
|accessdate=January 8, 2010
|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref> These states have what is called a having a '''mandatory''', '''unified''', or integrated bar.

In Texas, for example, the [[State Bar of Texas]] is an agency of the judiciary and is under the administrative control of the [[Texas Supreme Court]].<ref>See Texas Government Code section 81.011.</ref> The State Bar of Texas is composed of those persons licensed to practice law in Texas, and each such person is required by law to join the State Bar by registering with the clerk of the Texas Supreme Court.<ref>See Texas Government Code section 81.051.</ref> See also [[State Bar of California]].

===Voluntary and private bar associations===
A [[Voluntary association|voluntary]] bar association is a private organization of lawyers. Each may have social, educational, and lobbying functions, but does not regulate the practice of law or admit lawyers to practice or discipline lawyers. An example of this is the [[New York State Bar Association]].

There is a statewide voluntary bar association in each of the eighteen states that have no mandatory or integrated bar association. There are also many voluntary bar associations organized by geographic area (e.g., [[Chicago Bar Association]]), interest group or practice area (e.g., [[Federal Communications Bar Association]]), or ethnic or identity community (e.g., [[Hispanic National Bar Association]]).

The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) is a nationwide voluntary bar association with the largest membership in the United States. The [[National Bar Association]] was formed in 1925 to focus on the interests of African-American lawyers after they were denied membership by the ABA.<ref>[http://www.nationalbar.org/the_nba_perspective National Bar Association: The NBA Perspective]</ref>

==Federal courts==
Admission to a state bar does not automatically entitle an individual to practice in federal courts, such as the [[United States district court]]s or [[United States court of appeals]]. In general, an attorney is admitted to the bar of these federal courts upon payment of a fee and taking an oath of admission. An attorney must apply to each district separately. For instance, a Texas attorney who practices in federal courts throughout the state would have to be admitted separately to the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|Northern District of Texas]], the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas|Eastern District]], the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|Southern District]], and the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas|Western District]]. To handle a federal appeal, the attorney would also be required to be admitted separately to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] for general appeals and to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] for appeals that fall within that court's jurisdiction. As the [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy courts]] are divisions of the district courts, admission to a particular district court usually includes automatic admission to the corresponding bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy courts require that attorneys attend training sessions on electronic filing before they may file motions.

Some federal district courts have extra admission requirements. For instance, the Southern District of Texas requires attorneys seeking admission to attend a class on that District's practice and procedures. For some time, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|Southern District of Florida]] administered an entrance exam, but that requirement was eliminated by Court order in February 2012.<ref>http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/?page_id=2647</ref> The [[United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island|District of Rhode Island]] requires candidates to attend classes and to pass an examination.

Many federal district courts require attorneys to be members of the state bar where the court sits. This requirement is not necessarily consistent within a state. For example, in Ohio, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio|Southern District]] generally requires membership in the Ohio state bar for full admission,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/localrules/ohsdlocalrules20091201.pdf |title=Local Rule 83.3 Admission to the Bar |work=Local Civil and Criminal Rules |publisher=United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 23, 2009 |format=PDF |pages=35–36}} See specifically Rules 83.3(b) and (c).</ref> while full admission to the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio|Northern District]] is open to all attorneys in good standing with any U.S. jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/assets/Rules_and_Orders/Local_Civil_Rules/Rule_83_5/Rule_83_5.htm |title=Rule 83.5 Admission of Attorneys to Practice in the Northern District of Ohio |work=Local Civil Rules |publisher=United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2011}} See specifically Rule 83.5(b).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/assets/Rules_and_Orders/Local_Criminal_Rules/Local_Criminal_Rules.htm |title=Rule 57.5 Admission of Attorneys to Practice in the Northern District of Ohio |work=Local Criminal Rules |publisher=United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2011}} See specifically Rule 57.5(b).</ref><ref>In the Northern District of Ohio, admitted attorneys need not maintain an office in the district, or associate with a local attorney, unless ordered to do so by the court. See Civil Rule 83.5(c) and Criminal Rule 57.5(c).</ref>

An attorney wishing to practice before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] must apply to do so, must be admitted to the bar of the [[state supreme court|highest court of a state]], must be sponsored by two attorneys already admitted to the Supreme Court bar, must pay a fee and must take either a spoken or written oath.<ref>http://www.supremecourt.gov/bar/barinstructions.pdf</ref>

Various specialized courts with [[subject-matter jurisdiction]], including the [[United States Tax Court]], have separate admission requirements. The Tax Court is unusual in that a non-attorney may be admitted to practice. However, the non-attorney must take and pass an examination administered by the Court to be admitted, while attorneys are not required to take the exam. Most members of the Tax Court bar are attorneys.

Admission to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] is open to any attorney admitted to practice and in good standing with the U.S. Supreme Court, any of the other federal courts of appeal, any federal district court, the highest court of any state, the Court of International Trade, the Court of Federal Claims, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. An oath and fee are required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/rules-of-practice/rules.pdf |title=Rule 46. Attorneys |work=Rules of Practice |publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |format=PDF |pages=86–87 |date=June 1, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref>

Some federal courts also have voluntary bar associations associated with them. For example, the [http://www.baffc.org|Bar Association of the Fifth Federal Circuit], the [http://www.thirdcircuitbar.org|Bar Association of the Third Federal Circuit], or the [http://www.eighthcircuitbar.com|Association of the Bar of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit] all serve attorneys admitted to practice before specific federal courts of appeals.

===Patent practice===
Persons wishing to "prosecute" patent applications (i.e., represent clients in the process of obtaining a patent) must first pass the [[USPTO registration examination]], frequently referred to as the "patent bar." Detailed information about applying for the registration examination is available in the USPTO's General Requirements Bulletin.<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/dcom/olia/oed/grb.pdf USPTO General Requirements Bulletin for Admission]</ref> Although only registered patent attorneys or patent agents can prosecute patent applications in the USPTO, passing the patent bar is not necessary to advise clients on patent infringement, to litigate patent issues in court, or to prosecute trademark applications.

A J.D. degree is not required to sit for the patent bar. Lawyers who pass the patent bar exam may refer to themselves as a [[patent attorney]] (rules of [[legal ethics]] prohibit lawyers from using the title "patent attorney" unless they are admitted to practice before the USPTO). While patent lawyers have a relevant four-year degree and many have graduate technical degrees, patent litigation attorneys do not have to be patent attorneys, although some are. On the other hand, non-lawyers who pass the patent bar are referred to as "patent agents." Patent agents may not [[Unauthorized practice of law|hold themselves out as licensed attorneys]].

Applicants must have [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]], [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residency]] (a Green Card), or a valid [[work visa]] for a patent-related job. An applicant on a work visa, upon passing the exam, is only given "limited recognition" to perform work for the employer listed on the work visa. Only U.S. citizens can maintain their registration in the patent bar while they are working outside the United States. Additionally, the USPTO requires that applicants to the patent bar have earned a [[bachelor's degree]]. Applicants are categorized as having earned an accredited "bachelor's degree in a recognized technical subject" (category A), having earned a "bachelor's degree in another subject" with sufficient credits to qualify for the exam (category B), or having "practical engineering or [[Science|scientific]] experience" (category C).

Applicants in "category A" must have an engineering or "[[Hard and soft science|hard science]]" degree in a field listed in the General Requirements Bulletin. Note that the degree field as shown on the diploma must be exactly as it appears on the list; for example, "[[aerospace engineering]]" does not qualify under category A, while "aeronautical engineering" does. A [[computer science]] degree is accepted under "category A" as long as it is received from an [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET)-accredited or [[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]]-accredited program.

Applicants in "category B" must have earned a bachelor's degree, and must have sufficient credits in science and engineering courses to meet the USPTO's requirements; the number of credits depends on the specific discipline. The coursework must include a minimum of eight credit-hours of acceptable classes in either [[chemistry]] or [[physics]]. Each course being relied upon by the applicant for credit is evaluated by the USPTO's Office of Enrollment and Discipline for suitability;  see the General Requirements Bulletin for the details. Engineering and Computer Science majors whose degree programs do not meet "category A" requirements (typically due to the named field of the degree or, especially in computer science, lack of program accreditation) can apply under "category B."

Applicants in "category C" may present evidence of passing the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]] as proof of technical education. They must also have a bachelor's degree. Although the admission requirements allow applicants to substitute proof of technical experience for technical education, this is rarely done in practice.

===Military law===
Service as a member of a military service's [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]] requires graduation from an ABA-accredited law school, a license to practice law in any state or territory of the United States, and training at the specialized law school of one of the three military services ([[The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School]] for the Army, the [[Naval Justice School]] for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and the Air Force Judge Advocate General School for the Air Force).

In a court-martial, the accused is always provided JAG Corps defense counsel at no expense to the accused, but is also entitled to retain private civilian counsel at his or her own expense. Civilian counsel must either be a member of both a federal bar and a state bar, or must be otherwise authorized to practice law by a recognized licensing authority and certified by the military judge as having sufficient familiarity with criminal law as applicable in courts-martial.<ref>Rule of Court Martial 502(d)(3);  {{cite book|title=Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), United States|url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/documents/mcm2008.pdf|author=United States Joint Service Commission on Military Justice|edition=2008|accessdate=December 1, 2011|date=January 16, 2008}}</ref>

==Apprenticeship issue==
The American legal system is unusual in that, with few exceptions, it has ''no'' formal apprenticeship or clinical training requirements ''between'' the period of academic legal training and the bar exam, or even after the bar exam. Two exceptions are Delaware and Vermont, which require that candidates for admission serve a full-time clerkship of at least five months (Delaware) or three months (Vermont) in the office of a lawyer previously admitted in that state before being eligible to take the oath of admission. New Jersey has a similar requirement, with the addition of training and instruction.

On October 12, 2005, the [[Washington State Supreme Court]] adopted amendments to Admission to Practice Rule 5 and 18, mandating that, prior to admission, Bar applicants must complete a minimum of four hours of approved pre-admission education.<ref name=wa=apr5>{{cite web

Some law schools have tried to rectify this lack of experience by requiring supervised "Public Service Requirements" of all graduates.<ref name=brandeis>{{cite web

As a result, in most jurisdictions anyone with a J.D. (or equivalent experience in the states that allow it) may take the bar exam and be admitted to the bar, and then may immediately seek out clients and start filing papers with a court. The current system has been criticized{{Who|date=April 2008}} on the grounds that clients often end up subsidizing the apprenticeship of young lawyers.

==Character and fitness==
In addition to the educational and bar examination requirements, most states also require an applicant to demonstrate good moral character. This has resulted in a variety of subjective factors being used to prevent applicants who are otherwise qualified from being admitted. For example, until the policy was reversed by the Supreme Court of Virginia in 1979, female applicants who were cohabiting out of wedlock were denied admission to the bar.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5hAVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LgMEAAAAIBAJ&dq=bonnie%20cord%20virginia&pg=3622%2C7802259|title=Woman Fit For Bar Test|work=Toledo Blade|page=3|date=April 21, 1979|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>  In early 2009, a person who had passed the New York bar and had over $400,000 in unpaid student loans was denied admission by the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]] due to excessive indebtedness, despite being recommended for admission by the state's character and fitness committee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/business/02lawyer.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=lawyer%20debt%20character%20and%20fitness%20denied&st=cse|work=The New York Times |title=Finding Debt a Bigger Hurdle Than Bar Exam |date=July 1, 2009|first=Jonathan D.|last=Glater|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> He moved to void the denial, but the court upheld its original decision in November 2009, by which time his debt had accumulated to nearly $500,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/business/27lawyer.html?_r=1&hpw |work=The New York Times |title=Again, Debt Disqualifies Applicant From the Bar |date=November 26, 2009|first=Jonathan D.|last=Glater|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}</ref>

For example, in Virginia, each applicant must complete a 24-page questionnaire<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/pdf/LRC&FQuestion.pdf |title=Character & Fitness Questionnaire |publisher=Virginia Board of Bar Examiners |accessdate=September 4, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008212029/http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/pdf/LRC&FQuestion.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and may appear before a committee for an interview if the committee initially rejects their application.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/cf/cfreq.html#secIII |title=Admission Rules Section III |work=Rules of the Virginia Board of Bar Examiners |publisher=Virginia Board of Bar Examiners |accessdate=September 4, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101012140340/http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/cf/cfreq.html| archivedate= October 12, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Admission formalities==
Once all prerequisites have been satisfied, an attorney must actually be admitted. The mechanics of this vary widely. For example, in California, the admittee simply takes an oath before any state judge or notary public, who then co-signs the admission form. Upon receiving the signed form, the State Bar of California adds the new admittee to a list of applicants recommended for admission to the bar which is automatically ratified by the Supreme Court of California at its next regular weekly conference; then everyone on the list is added to the official roll of attorneys. The State Bar also holds large-scale formal admission ceremonies in conjunction with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the federal district courts, usually in the same convention centers where new admittees took the bar examination, but these are optional.

In other jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia, new admittees ''must'' attend a special session of court in person to take the oath of admission in open court; they cannot take the oath before any available judge or notary public.

==Incidents of admission==
A successful applicant is permitted to practice law after being sworn in as an officer of the Court; in most states, that means they may begin filing pleadings and appearing as counsel of record in any trial or appellate court in the state. Upon admission, a new lawyer is issued a certificate of admission, usually from the state's highest court, and a membership card attesting to admission.

Two states are exceptions to the general rule of admission by the state's highest court:
* In New York, admission is granted by one of the state's four intermediate appellate courts corresponding generally to the Department of residence of the applicant; once admitted, however, the applicant can practice in any (non-federal) court in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybarexam.org/Admission/Admission.htm |title=Admission Information |publisher=The New York State Board of Law Examiners |accessdate=November 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101114081238/http://www.nybarexam.org/Admission/Admission.htm| archivedate= November 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> 
* In Georgia, each new attorney is admitted to practice by the Superior Court of any county, typically the county in which he or she resides or desires to practice. The new attorney, although licensed to practice in any local trial court in the state, must ''separately'' seek admission to the Georgia Court of Appeals as well as the Georgia Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gabaradmissions.org/pdf/admissionrules.pdf |title=Part B, Section 15.

In most states, lawyers are also issued a unique bar identification number. In states like California where unauthorized practice of law is a major problem, the state bar number must appear on all documents submitted by a lawyer.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=two&linkid=rule2_111 California Rules of Court, Rule 2.111].</ref>
