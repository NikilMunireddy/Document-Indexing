Imperial's contributions to society include the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and fibre optics.  Imperial's focus is in science and technology and their applications for industry.

Imperial is ranked among the top universities in the world by numerous [[#Academic profile|university rankings]].<ref name="THE World University Rankings 2015-16"/><ref name="QS World University Rankings 2015-16"/><ref name="Academic Ranking of World Universities 2015"/><ref>{{cite web|title=US News and World Report|url=http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/europe|website=Best Universities in Europe 2016}}</ref> According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', its students are highly recruited worldwide, and receive the highest salaries of any UK university.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2012/10/25/world/asia/25iht-sreducemerging25-graphic.html?ref=asia |title=Global Companies Rank Universities |work=The New York Times |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Complete University Guide|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/student/london-universities-bump-oxbridge-off-top-spots-in-graduate-employment-league-table-10225460.html||website=Student Prospects|location=London|date=5 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Best Universities According to Employers|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/careers-advice/best-universities-according-employers}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=It's official: Imperial grads make the most cash|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1342145/Graduate-pay-rates-reinforce-college-divide.html}}</ref>  Imperial staff and alumni include 15 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]], 2 [[Fields Medal]]ists, 70 [[Royal Society|Fellows of the Royal Society]], 82 [[Royal Academy of Engineering|Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering]] and 78 [[Academy of Medical Sciences|Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/introducing-imperial/our-people/award-winners/ |title=Award winners &#124; Imperial College London |publisher=Imperial.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref>

==History==

===The Great Exhibition===
[[File:Imperial Institute.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute]]]]
The [[Great Exhibition]] in 1851 was organised by [[Prince Albert]], [[Henry Cole]], [[Francis Fuller the Elder|Francis Fuller]] and other members of the [[Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce]].  The Great Exhibition made a surplus of £186,000 used in creating an area in the South of Kensington celebrating the encouragement of the arts, industry, and science. Albert insisted the Great Exhibition surplus should be used as a home for culture and education for everyone.  His commitment was to find practical solutions to today's social challenges.  Prince Albert's vision built the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]], [[Natural History Museum]], [[Geological Museum]], [[Royal College of Science]], [[Royal College of Art]], [[Royal School of Mines]], [[Royal School of Music]], [[Royal College of Organists]], [[Royal School of Needlework]], [[Royal Geographical Society]], [[British Library Sound Archive|Institute of Recorded Sound]], [[Royal Horticultural Society|Royal Horticultural Gardens]], [[Royal Albert Hall]] and the [[Imperial Institute]].<ref name="timeline" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Arbertopolis - The Wisdom of Prince Albert|url=http://www.chr.org.uk/Museums/albertopolis2.htm}}</ref> Royal colleges and the Imperial Institute merged to form what is now Imperial College London.<ref name="History of Imperial College"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Ted Talks History of Imperial College|url=http://tedxalbertopolis.com/albertopolis}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Imperial College 3|url=http://www.chr.org.uk/Museums/albertopolis2.htm}}</ref>

===Royal College of Chemistry===
The [[Royal College of Chemistry]] was established by private subscription in 1845 as there was a growing awareness that practical aspects of the [[Experiment|experimental sciences]] were not well taught and that in the United Kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in Germany. As a result of a movement earlier in the decade, many politicians donated funds to establish the college, including [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] and [[Robert Peel]]. It was also supported by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]], who persuaded [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] to be the first professor.

[[William Henry Perkin]] studied and worked at the college under von Hofmann, but resigned his position after discovering the first [[synthetic dye]], [[mauveine]], in 1856. Perkin's discovery was prompted by his work with von Hofmann on the substance [[aniline]], derived from [[coal tar]], and it was this breakthrough which sparked the synthetic dye industry, a boom which some historians have labelled the second [[chemical revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/heritage/history.html|title=History of ICSTM Chemistry|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> His contribution led to the creation of the [[Perkin Medal]], an award given annually by the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] to a scientist residing in the United States for an "innovation in applied chemistry resulting in outstanding commercial development". It is considered the highest honour given in the industrial [[chemical industry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soci.org/Awards/America-Group-Awards.aspx |title=SCI - America Group Awards |publisher=Soci.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref>

=== Royal School of Mines ===
[[File:My trip to London - Imperial College of Science and Technology.JPG|thumbnail|right|The Royal School of Mines]]
The [[Royal School of Mines]] was established by [[Henry de la Beche|Sir Henry de la Beche]] in 1851, developing from the [[Geological Museum|Museum of Economic Geology]], a collection of minerals, maps and mining equipment.<ref name="timeline" /> He created a school which laid the foundations for the teaching of science in the country, and which has its legacy today at Imperial. Prince Albert was a patron and supporter of the later developments in science teaching, which led to the Royal College of Chemistry becoming part of the Royal School of Mines, to the creation of the [[Royal College of Science]] and eventually to these institutions becoming part of his plan for [[South Kensington]] being an educational region.<ref name="timeline" />

=== Royal College of Science ===
The [[Royal College of Science]] was established in 1881. The main objective was to support the training of science teachers and to develop teaching in other science subjects alongside the Royal School of Mines [[Earth science#Partial list of the major earth science topics|earth sciences specialities]].<ref name="timeline" />

[[File:Queen's Tower.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|[[Queen's Tower, London|Queen's Tower]] at Imperial College]]

===20th century - City and Guilds College===
In 1907, the newly established Board of Education found that greater capacity for higher technical education was needed and a proposal to merge the [[Royal School of Mines]], the [[Royal College of Science]], and [[City and Guilds of London Institute|City and Guilds College]],  was approved and passed, creating ''The Imperial College of Science and Technology'' as a constituent college of the [[University of London]]. Imperial's [[Royal Charter]], granted by [[Edward VII]], was officially signed on 8 July 1907. The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute in [[South Kensington]].

City and Guilds College was founded in 1876, which aimed to provide a practical education for craftsmen, technicians, technologists, and engineers.  The medical schools of [[Charing Cross Hospital]], [[Westminster Hospital]] and [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] were opened in 1823, 1834 and 1854 respectively.<ref name="timeline" /> Imperial acquired Silwood Park in 1947, to provide a site for research and teaching in those aspects of biology not well suited for the main London campus. On 29 January 1950, the government announced that it was intended that Imperial should expand to meet the scientific and technological challenges of the 20th century and a major expansion of the college followed over the next decade. In 1959 the [[Wolfson Foundation]] donated £350,000 for the establishment of a new Biochemistry Department.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} A special relationship between Imperial and the [[Indian Institute of Technology Delhi]] was established in 1963. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  The Department of Management Science was created in 1971 and the Associated Studies Department was established in 1972. The Humanities Department was opened in 1980, formed from the Associated Studies and History of Science departments.

In 1988 Imperial merged with [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]], becoming ''The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine''. In 1995 Imperial launched its own academic publishing house, [[Imperial College Press]], in partnership with [[World Scientific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icpress.co.uk/profiles/aboutus/profile.shtml |title=Imperial College Press |publisher=Icpress.co.uk |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> Imperial merged with the [[National Heart and Lung Institute]] in 1995 and the [[Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School]], Royal Postgraduate Medical School (RPMS) and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997. In the same year the Imperial College School of Medicine was formally established and all of the property of Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, the National Heart and Lung Institute and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School were transferred to Imperial as the result of the [[Imperial College Act 1997]]. In 1998 the [[Sir Alexander Fleming]] Building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II to provide a headquarters for the college's medical and biomedical research.

===21st century===
[[File:Cour intérieure Imperial College 18-10-2004.jpeg|right|thumb|The Blue Cube]]

In 2000 Imperial merged with both the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology and [[Wye College]], the University of London's agricultural college in [[Wye, Kent]]. It initially agreed to keep Agricultural Sciences at Wye, but closed them in 2004.<ref name="scribd1" />  The origins of the later acquired [[College of St Gregory and St Martin at Wye]], was originally founded by [[John Kempe]], the [[Archbishop of York]], in 1447 as a [[seminary]], with an agricultural college being established at Wye in 1894 after the removal of the seminary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1439.htm#Kempe|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church – Biographical Dictionary – Consistory of December 18, 1439|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>  In December 2005, Imperial announced a science park programme at the Wye campus, with extensive housing;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/P7130.htm |title=Imperial College London – New £1&nbsp;billion world-class scientific research centre and facilities planned for Kent |publisher=Imperial.ac.uk |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> however, this was abandoned in September 2006 following complaints that the proposal infringed on Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and that the true scale of the scheme, which could have raised £110m for the college, was known to Kent and Ashford Councils and their consultants but concealed from the public.<ref name="scribd1"/> One commentator observed that Imperial's scheme reflected "the state of democracy in Kent, the transformation of a renowned scientific college into a grasping, highly aggressive, neo-corporate institution, and the defence of the status of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty – throughout England, not just Wye – against rampant greed backed by the connivance of two important local authorities.<ref name="David Hewson 2007">David Hewson. 2007.

In 2003 Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The [[London Centre for Nanotechnology]] was established in the same year as a joint venture between UCL and Imperial College London.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2698649.stm | title=London's little idea|accessdate=20 July 2012|publisher=BBC News| date=27 January 2003|first=Arran|last=Frood}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2981480.stm | title=Nanotech under the microscope|accessdate=20 July 2012| publisher=BBC News| date=12 June 2003}}</ref> In 2004 the [[Imperial College Business School]] and a new Main Entrance on Exhibition Road were opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The [[UK Energy Research Centre]] was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. In November 2005 the Faculties of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences merged to become the Faculty of Natural Sciences.

On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/P7134.htm |title=Imperial College London – Imperial College London to begin negotiations to withdraw from the University of London |publisher=Imperial.ac.uk |date=9 December 2005 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~wongls/icaas-web/news/stnews-2jan06/index.html |title=Imperial College top choice for Singaporean students |publisher=Comp.nus.edu.sg |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.ac.uk/495.html |title=University of London: Updated position statement re: Imperial College London |publisher=London.ac.uk |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> and the first students to register for an Imperial College degree were postgraduates beginning their course in October 2007, with the first undergraduates enrolling for an Imperial degree in October 2008.

In July 2008 the [[Centre for Advanced Structural Ceramics]] was opened in the Materials department.

In May 2012 Imperial, UCL and the IT company [[Intel]] announced the establishment of the Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Sustainable Connected Cities, a London-based institute for research into the future of cities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=420097|title=UCL and Imperial partner with Intel to create research institute|accessdate=19 July 2012|work=Times Higher Education|date=26 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9287696/Intel-London-to-be-city-of-the-future.html|title=Intel: London to be city of the future|accessdate=19 July 2012|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 May 2012|first=Matt|last=Warman}}</ref>

In August 2012 it was announced that Imperial would be the lead institution for the MRC-NIHR Phenome Centre, a new research centre for personalised medicine to be based at [[GlaxoSmithKline]]'s research and development facility in [[Harlow, Essex]], inheriting the anti-doping facilities used to test samples during the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games]].<ref name=the1812 /><ref name=bbc1812 />

In July 2014 the Dyson School of Design Engineering was opened. As of October 2015, the newly formed school offered a course in design engineering following a £12m donation by the [[James Dyson]] Foundation, along with courses such as the MEng in Design Engineering.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/23/james-dyson-foundation-donation-engineering-school-imperial-college |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=James Dyson Foundation gives £12m for creation of engineering school | first=Rebecca | last=Smithers | date=23 March 2015 | accessdate=31 March 2015}}</ref>

===Medicine===
[[File:St Mary's Hospital 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Mary's Hospital, London|St. Mary's Hospital]]]]
{{Main|Imperial College Healthcare}}
The Imperial Faculty of Medicine was formed through mergers between Imperial and the St Mary's, Charing Cross and Westminster, and Royal Postgraduate medical schools and has six [[teaching hospital]]s. It accepts more than 300 undergraduate medical students per year and has around 321 taught and 700 research full-time equivalent postgraduate students.

[[Imperial College Healthcare|Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust ([[Charing Cross Hospital]], [[Hammersmith Hospital]] and [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital]]) and St Mary's NHS Trust ([[St Mary's Hospital, London|St. Mary's Hospital]] and [[Western Eye Hospital]]) with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.nhs.uk/aboutus/index.htm |title=About us – Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Internet |publisher=Imperial.nhs.uk |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> It is an academic health science centre and manages five hospitals: [[Charing Cross Hospital]], [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital]], [[Hammersmith Hospital]], [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], and [[Western Eye Hospital]]. The Trust is currently the largest in the UK and has an annual turnover of £800&nbsp;million, treating more than a million patients a year.

===Wye Campus Sale===
Imperial acquired [[Wye College]] in 2000, which is set in a designated [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. It was rapidly dismantled, causing controversy, particularly a plan for substantial redevelopment in the area, with adverse environmental implications. A local campaign eventually secured the overthrow of the scheme, following which the Wye campus was closed in September 2009.<ref name="David Hewson 2007"/> The Wye campus, some of it dating back to the 15th century, is currently vacant and available for sale or rent.

=== Accusations of Ill-treatment of Staff ===
In 2003, it was reported that one third of female academics "believe that discrimination or bullying by managers has held back their careers".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/18/highereducation.education|title=Female staff 'feel bullied' at Imperial College|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> It was said then that "A spokesman for Imperial said the college was acting on the recommendations and had already made changes".  Nevertheless, allegations of bullying have continued: in 2007, concerns were raised about the methods that were being used to fire people in the Faculty of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/crude-recipe-for-a-chicken-run-sector/209175.article|title=Crude recipe for a 'chicken-run' sector|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Colquhoun | first = David | year = 2007 | title = How to get good science. | journal = Physiology News | volume = 69 | pages = 12–14 | url = http://dcscience.net/colquhoun-goodscience-jp-version-2007.pdf }}</ref> New President of Imperial College, Alice Gast says she sees bright lights in the horizon for female careers at Imperial College London.

===Student activities===
'''Imperial College Radio'''<br>
[[Imperial College Radio]] (or ICRadio) was founded in November 1975 with the intention of broadcasting to the student [[Dormitory|halls of residence]] from a studio under Southside, actually commencing broadcasts in late 1976<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icradio.com/ |title=Imperial College Radio, London, UK |publisher=Icradio.com |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref>

'''Imperial College TV'''<br>
Imperial College TV (ICTV) is Imperial College Union's TV station, founded in 1969 and operated from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block.  The department had bought an early [[AMPEX]] [[Type A videotape|Type A 1-inch videotape recorder]] and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room. A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972. Besides the news, early productions included a film of the Queen opening what was then called College Block. 

'''Felix Newspaper'''<br>
Published weekly, ''[[Felix (newspaper)|Felix]]'' is the free and popular student newspaper of Imperial. It aim is to be independent of both the College itself and the Student Union.

'''Imperial College Boat Club'''<br>
The [[Imperial College Boat Club]] was founded on 12 December 1919.  The Gold medal winning GB 8+ at the 2000 Sydney Olympics had been based at Imperial College's recently refurbished boathouse and included 3 alumni of the college along with their coach Martin McElroy. The club has been highly successful, with many wins at Henley Royal Regatta including most recently in 2013 with victory in The Prince Albert Challenge Cup event. The club has been home to numerous National Squad oarsmen and women and is open to all rowers not just students of Imperial College London.

'''Bars and Pubs'''<br>
There are a number of popular pubs and bars on campus and also surrounding the campus, which become a popular social activity for Imperial's students and the British culture.

===Student housing===
[[File:Beit Hall (596508429).jpg|thumb|right|Beit Hall]]
Imperial College owns and manages twenty one halls of residence in [[Inner London]], [[Ealing]], [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Wye, Kent|Wye]]. Over three thousand rooms are available, guaranteeing first year undergraduates a place in College residences.

The majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having [[Bathroom|en suite]] facilities. Study bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms. The majority of rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network. Most of them are considered among the newest student halls at London universities.

Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates, since they are granted a room once they have selected Imperial as their firm offer at [[UCAS]]. The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the college private housing office. However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a "hall senior".  Some students also live in [[International Students House, London]].
