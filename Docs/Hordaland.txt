'''Hordaland''' {{IPA-no|ˈhɔrdɑˈlɑn||Hordaland.ogg}} is a [[Counties of Norway|county]] in [[Norway]], bordering [[Sogn og Fjordane]], [[Buskerud]], [[Telemark]], and [[Rogaland]] counties. Hordaland is the third largest county after [[Akershus]] and [[Oslo]] by population. The county government is the [[Hordaland County Municipality]] which is located in [[Bergen]]. Before 1972, the city of Bergen was its own separate county apart from Hordaland.

==Name and symbols==

===Name===
Hordaland ([[Old Norse]]: ''Hǫrðaland'') is the old name of the region which was revived in 1919. The first element is the plural [[genitive case]] of ''hǫrðar'', the name of an old [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe (see [[Charudes]]). The last element is ''land'' which means "land" or "region" in the Norwegian language.

Until 1919 the name of the county was ''[[Bergenhus len|Søndre Bergenhus amt]]'' which meant "(the) southern (part of) Bergenhus [[amt (subnational entity)|amt]]". (The old ''Bergenhus amt'' was created in 1662 and was divided into Northern and Southern parts in 1763.)

===Flag===
[[File:Flag of Hordaland.svg|thumb|left|The flag of Hordaland]]
The flag of Hordaland shows two golden axes and a crown in red. The flag is a banner of the [[Coat of arms of Hordaland|coat of arms]] derived from the old seal of the guild of St. Olav from Onarheim in [[Tysnes]] municipality. This seal was used by the delegates of [[Sunnhordland]] in 1344 on the document to install king [[Haakon V of Norway]]. It was thus the oldest symbol used for the region and adapted as the arms and flag in 1961. The symbols refer to the patron saint of the guild, [[Saint Olav]], King of Norway, whose symbol is an axe.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Heraldry of the World|title=Civic heraldry of Norway - Norske Kommunevåpen|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Hordaland|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref>

=== Coat of arms ===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] were officially granted on 1 December 1961.  They were designed by Magnus Hardeland, but the general design had been originally used in the [[Sunnhordland]] region during the 14th century.  In the early 20th century, leaders of the county began using the old arms as a symbol for the county once again.  The arms are on a red background and consist of two golden [[axe]]s that are crossed with a golden [[Heraldic crown|crown]] above them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.no.net/~thuridcs/Kommvpn/Hrdland/beskr-hordal.htm|title=Hordaland fylke|accessdate=2008-08-29|language=no}}</ref>

Hordaland county has been around for more than one thousand years.  Since the 7th century, the area was made up of many [[petty kingdom]]s under the [[Gulating]] and was known as ''Hordafylke'' since around the year 900. In the early 16th century, Norway was divided into four ''len''.  The [[Bergenhus len]] was headquartered in [[Bergen]] and encompassed much of western and northern Norway.<ref name=no />

In 1662, the ''lens'' were replaced by [[Amt (country subdivision)#The amt in Norway|amt]]s.  ''Bergenhus amt'' originally consisted of the present-day areas of Hordaland, [[Sogn og Fjordane]], and [[Sunnmøre]] and the far northern [[Nordlandene amt]] was subordinate to Bergenhus.  In the 1680s, Nordlandene and Sunnmøre were split from Bergenhus. In 1763, the ''amt'' was divided into northern and southern parts: ''Nordre Bergenhus amt'' and ''Søndre Bergenhus amt''.  When the amt was split, the present day municipality of [[Gulen]] was split with the southern part ending up in Søndre Bergenhus amt.  In 1773, the border was re-drawn so that all of Gulen was located in the northern part.  Søndre Bergenhus amt was renamed ''Hordaland fylke'' in 1919.<ref name=no />

The city of [[Bergen]] was classified as a city-county ''(byamt)'' from 1831-1972.  During that time in 1915, the municipality of [[Årstad (municipality)|Årstad]] was annexed into Bergen.  In 1972, the neighboring municipalities of [[Arna (municipality)|Arna]], [[Fana]], [[Laksevåg (municipality)|Laksevåg]] and [[Åsane (municipality)|Åsane]] were annexed into the city of Bergen.  Also at that same time, the city of Bergen lost its county status, and became a part of Hordaland county.<ref name=no />

==Government==
[[File:Hardanger1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hardanger]] is one of Norway's most important sources of [[fruit]], providing approximately 40% of the country's fruit production, including [[apple]]s, [[plum]]s, [[pear]]s, [[cherries]], and [[redcurrant]]s.]]
A county ''(fylke)'' is the chief local administrative area in [[Norway]]. The whole country is divided into 19 counties. A county is also an election area, with popular votes taking place every 4 years.  In Hordaland, the government of the county is the [[Hordaland County Municipality]].  It includes 57 members are elected to form a [[county council (Norway)|county council]] ''(Fylkesting)''. Heading the ''Fylkesting'' is the county mayor ''(fylkesordførar)''. Since 2003, the [[Hordaland county municipality]] has been led by [[Torill Selsvold Nyborg]], the county mayor.

The county also has a [[County governor (Norway)|County Governor]] ''(fylkesmann)'' who is the representative of the [[Monarchy of Norway|King]] and [[Politics of Norway|Government of Norway]]. [[Lars Sponheim]] is the current [[List of County Governors of Hordaland|County Governor of Hordaland]].

The municipalities in Hordaland are divided among four [[district court (Norway)|district courts]] ''(tingrett)'': [[Nordhordland District Court|Nordhordland]], [[Sunnhordland District Court|Sunnhordland]], [[Bergen District Court|Bergen]], and [[Hardanger District Court|Hardanger]]. Hordaland is also part of the [[Gulating Court of Appeal]] district based in Bergen.<ref name=no>[[:no:Hordaland]]</ref>

*Sunnhordland District Court: [[Bømlo]], [[Etne]], [[Fitjar]], [[Kvinnherad]], [[Stord]], [[Sveio]] and [[Tysnes]]
*Bergen District Court: the city of [[Bergen]]

[[Gulen]] and [[Solund]] in [[Sogn og Fjordane]] county are also part of the Hordaland police district.

Hordaland is semi-circular in shape. It is located on the [[Western Norway|western coast of Norway]], split from southwest to northeast by the long, deep [[Hardangerfjorden]], one of [[Norway]]'s main [[fjord]]s and a great tourist attraction. About half of the National park of [[Hardangervidda]] is in this county. The county also includes many well-known [[waterfall]]s of Norway, such as [[Vøringsfossen]] and [[Stykkjedalsfossen]]. It also includes the [[Folgefonna]] and [[Hardangerjøkulen]] [[glacier]]s.
