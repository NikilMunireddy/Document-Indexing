'''Cruzeiro Esporte Clube''' ({{IPA-pt|kɾuˈzejɾu esˈpoɾtʃi ˈklubi|br}}), commonly known as '''Cruzeiro''' and nicknamed '''Raposa''' (English: Fox), is a [[Brazil]]ian multisport club based in Barro Preto, [[Belo Horizonte]]. Although they compete in a number of different sports, Cruzeiro is mostly known for its [[association football]] team. It plays in the [[Campeonato Mineiro]],{{refn|group=nb|Also known merely as Mineiro. Not to be confused with the [[Mineirão]] stadium.}} the [[States of Brazil|state of]] [[Minas Gerais]]'s premier [[State football leagues in Brazil|state league]], as well as in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]],{{refn|group=nb|Also known by its nickname Brasileirão.}} the top tier of the [[Brazilian football league system]]. Cruzeiro are one of the five Brazilian clubs to have [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|never been relegated]], along with [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]], [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] and [[Santos FC|Santos]].

The club was founded on January 2, 1921 by sportsmen from the Italian colony of Belo Horizonte, some members of [[Yale Atlético Clube]] and many Italian immigrant workers decided to create a new club called ''Societá Sportiva Palestra Italia''. As a result of the [[Second World War]], the [[Federal government of Brazil|Brazilian federal government]] banned the use of any symbols referring to the [[Axis powers]] in 1942. The club board members rebaptized the club with the name of a leading national symbol: the [[Crux|Cruzeiro do Sul]]'s constellation. Cruzeiro play their home games at the [[Mineirão]] stadium, which currently holds up to 62,547 spectators. Cruzeiro's regular [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours are blue shirts and white shorts with blue socks (although the team has worn white socks with their home kit for certain periods of time). [[Umbro]] are the side's current kit manufacturers.

Cruzeiro is one of Brazil's most successful clubs despite its young age (comparing to with the others Brazil's biggest clubs). It won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A for the first time in [[1966 Taça Brasil|1966]], after defeating [[Santos FC|Santos]]' ''[[Os Santásticos]]'' in the final series.<ref>[http://imortaisdofutebol.com/2013/03/19/jogos-eternos-cruzeiro-6x2-santos-1966 Jogos eternos Cruzeiro 6x2 Santos Eternal matches Cruzeiro 6x2 Santos]</ref> Cruzeiro has won the Brasileirão again in [[2003 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2003]], [[2013 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2013]] and [[2014 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2014]], obtaining the best campaign in the [[Round-robin tournament|present format]] of the competition. Cruzeiro has also won four [[Copa do Brasil]] titles and the Campeonato Mineiro 37 times. Cruzeiro won the defunct state competitions Taça Minas Gerais five times, the Copa dos Campeões Mineiros twice, [[Copa Sul-Minas|Copa Sul Minas]] twice, the Torneio Início 10 times and the Supercampeonato Mineiro once. ''A Raposa'' also obtained many international laurels such as two [[Copa Libertadores]], two [[Supercopa Libertadores]], one [[Recopa Sudamericana]], one [[Copa de Oro]] and one [[Copa Master de Supercopa]]. Cruzeiro is the only Brazilian and [[South America]]n club to complete the [[Treble (association football)#Domestic Treble|Domestic Treble]], a feat accomplished in 2003 after winning the Campeonato Mineiro, the [[2003 Copa do Brasil]] and the [[2003 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2003 Brasileirão]].

Cruzeiro hold a [[Clássico Mineiro|long-standing rivalry]] against [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]]. It has contributed many key and famous players towards [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s [[FIFA World Cup]] squads such as [[Wilson da Silva Piazza|Piazza]], [[Tostão]], [[Nelinho]], [[Ronaldo]], [[Luisão|Luisao]], [[Alexsandro de Souza|Alex de Souza]], [[Maicon Sisenando|Maicon]], [[Cris (footballer)|Cris]],  [[Jairzinho]], [[Rivaldo]], [[Edílson]] among so many others.

Cruzeiro's history is traced back to the Italian community living in Belo Horizonte, a city where already some Italian [[immigrants]] lived<ref>{{cite web

Similar to the Italians of [[São Paulo]] (who founded [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palestra Itália]], now known as [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]]) the people of Belo Horizonte wanted the Italian colonies in [[Minas Gerais]] to have its own club as well.

In the sporting goods and footwear Augustine Ranieri's factory, located on the street of Caetés, it was decided the foundation of the club should tackle the three major capital: Atlético Mineiro, America-MG and Yale. Was born at that moment, the ''Società Sportiva Palestra Italia'', established on January 2, 1921.<ref name="cruzeiropedia">{{cite web

Another definition was right that only members of the Italian colony could wear the shirt time. Aurelio Noce was elected the first President.<ref name="cruzeiropedia"/>

The Palestra Italia emerged as the representative of the Italian colony. And is characterized as a team of Italian descent, Palestra also stood out by having elements of the Belo Horizonte working class, unlike Atlético and América, who had their consisting squad of college students coming from influential and wealthy families of the city.<ref name="cruzeiropedia"/>

The idea of the club being created took a big step when [[Yale Atlético Clube|Yale]], a sports team from the city went through an administrative crises. When some players left Yale over a dispute (Yale, which itself had connections to the Italian community), some went on to found the all Italian, '''Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Itália''' of Belo Horizonte.<ref name="yalecrises">{{cite web|url=http://jbonline.terra.com.br/destaques/2005/brasileiro/cruzeiro.html |title=Cruzeiro esporte clube |publisher=JB Online |accessdate=2007-08-15 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051103113058/http://jbonline.terra.com.br:80/destaques/2005/brasileiro/cruzeiro.html |archivedate=November 3, 2005 }}</ref><ref name="yalefounding">{{cite web

The name was changed to  Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Mineiro.

Around six months later, the president Ennes Cyro Poni called a general assembly for October 7 and suggested the name Ypiranga. Between October 3 and 7, the local media published the new name thinking it would be approved. In assembly, the counselors and associates kept professional system and approved changing club's name and colors. Yale and Ypiranga were suggested, but '''Cruzeiro Esporte Clube''' was chosen to honor the biggest symbol of Brazil, the constellation of [[Crux]]. The idea was from Oswaldo Pinto Coelho. However, the club kept playing as "Palestra Mineiro" until 1943, when the local Federation approved the new statutes.<ref>{{cite web

With the inauguration of the [[Mineirão]] in 1965, Cruzeiro entered one of the most successful periods in its history, in which the club won five [[Campeonato Mineiro]] titles in a row, and went on to win its first national title, the 1966 [[Taça Brasil]] (the highest honor in Brazilian football at that time) beating [[Santos Futebol Clube|Santos]] of [[Pelé]] in the final.

Cruzeiro also got to the final of the  [[2014 Copa do Brasil|Copa do Brasil]], but lost both matches to rival [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]].

== Symbols ==

=== Colors ===
When Cruzeiro was still known as Palestra Italia, the home shirt colour was green. The first home kit was an improvised dark green shirt, with white shorts and green stockings. Cruzeiro used this kit in their first professional game on April 3, 1921, in the Prado Mineiro Stadium, with a 2–0 win over the Villa Nova/Palmeiras combined team, of Nova Lima.<ref name="colors">{{cite web

| title = História 1921

| accessdate = 2008-07-26
| language = Portuguese
}}</ref> In 1928 the shirt became a lighter tone of green, with a white neck design and red cuffs. The shorts continued to be white, but the green stockings now had red and white details, similar to that of the [[Italian flag]]. This particular uniform was used up until 1940. The light green color of the shirt would later give the team the nickname "periquito", Portuguese for parakeet.<ref name="colors" /> In 1940 there was a big change to the shirt. The shirt began to feature horizontal stripes, with the club crest in the center. This was the shirt used to win the 1940 Campeonato da Cidade&nbsp;– now known as the Campeonto Mineiro&nbsp;– after the club had been unable to win the tournament for ten years. The club also began to be called "tricolor" instead of "periquito".<ref name="colors" />

In 1942 Cruzeiro played one game under the name Ypiranga, and for this game a blue shirt with a central horizontal stripe was used.<ref name="colors" /> In 1943 Cruzeiro played its first game under its current name. The shirt used then was an all blue shirt with a large white v-neck (scapular) design. The shorts and stockings were white. In 1950, due to bad stadium lighting, Cruzeiro began to use an all-white shirt during night games. The shirt, which featured blue details and blue shorts and white stockings, was used for nine years.<ref name="colors" /> In 1956, Cruzeiro used, for a short while, a new shirt that was made up of white and blue horizontal stripes. The uniform was not used in many games.<ref name="colors" /> There was a change to the shirt in 1959; the shirt became all blue, a design that would influence later shirts. In the 1959 shirt, instead of using its normal crest Cruzeiro simply used the five stars, in the crest, loose on the shirt. The shirt made its debut in the Estádio dos Tecelões, in a friendly match against Renascença, on September 19.<ref name="colors" />

In 1984 Cruzeiro had the first ever company logo on its shirt; it was the shirt manufacturer's logo, which was [[Topper (sports)|Topper]].<ref name="colors" /> In the same year Cruzeiro had its first shirt sponsor, Medradao. Medradao was only used on the away shirts<ref name="colors" />

=== Crest ===
[[File:Southern cross appearing on a number of flags.PNG|thumb|200px|The Southern Cross or Crux, is common on a number of other flags and insignia]]
The first Palestra Itália crest was a rhombus whose top half was red and bottom half was green (both colors of the Italian flag). In the center of the crest was a white circle with the letters P and I inside it.<ref name="crest">{{cite web
| url = http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/noticia/2010/06/ibope-aponta-flamengo-como-maior-torcida-e-sport-em-ascensao.html

| publisher = Globo Esporte
| accessdate = 2010-06-01
| language = Portuguese
}}</ref> The following year, 1922, the club's crest maintained its rhombus shape, but was now completely white, with the letter P, S and I, inscribed within it in green.<ref name="crest" /> In 1923, the crest lost its rhombus shape and instead just had the green letters S, P and I.<ref name="crest" /> From 1928–1939 the crest was identical to the first crest in 1921. Just one year later the crest  became a little different: the top half was green and the bottom half was red, similar to the crests from 1921 and 1929–1939, but instead of green letters in its center, it now had the letters S, P and I in yellow.<ref name="crest" />

The crest introduced in 1940 would be the last for Palestra, because the club would soon become Cruzeiro.<ref name="crest" /> Cruzeiro's first crest was introduced in 1950 and was very simple: a blue circle, with a white border, inside of which were five white stars, positioned to look like the [[Crux|Southern Cross]]. This first crest was used for over nine years, until 1959.<ref name="crest" /> In 1959 the crest changed, now with a white border around the crest with the words "''-CRUZEIRO ESPORTE CLUBE-BELO HORIZONTE''" in blue. This version of the crest was used until 1996, making it the longest-used crest by Cruzeiro.<ref name="crest" /> In the same year, Cruzeiro removed BELO HORIZONTE from the crest; this format was used until 2005.<ref name="crest" /> In 2006 to honor its successful 2003 season, a crown was added on top of the crest, to symbolize the triple crown.<ref name="crest" />

Cruzeiro has not always used its official crest on its shirt. In 1959, instead of using its crest, the club opted to simply put the five stars from the Southern Cross on its shirt.<ref name="crest" /> This was done until 2000, when the actual crest was again used.<ref name="crest" /> In 2002 and in part of 2003 the loose stars were used. Part way through 2003 a new shirt that contained the actual crest was introduced, but instead of just using the regular crest the shirt featured two [[Copa Libertadores]] trophies on top of the crest. In 2004 a similar design was used, but now featured a crown, symbolic of the Triple Crown on top of the two trophies.<ref name="crest" /> Since 2007 the club has used the "loose stars" design on home shirts.<ref name="crest" /> It should be noted that none of these designs actually became the official club crest.

=== Anthem ===
{{See also|Jadir Ambrósio}}

The club's anthem, ''Hino ao Campeão'', was written by [[Jadir Ambrósio]] in 1966, in homage to the team of his heart. He never meant for it to become the official anthem, but when fans started hearing it they liked it enough to adapt it as the new anthem.

=== Mascot ===

Fernando Pieruccetti, more popularly known as Mangabeira, created the club's [[mascot]], a ''raposa'' ([[fox]]). Mangabeira was inspired by the club's ex-president, Mario Grossa. "He was a director who let no one trick him. He was sly, agile, intelligent and skillful like a fox."<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> In the 2000s, Cruzeiro has made the ''Raposão'' (Big Fox) its biggest mascot, appearing at all home games and cheering with the crowd while wearing the club's colors. 
In 2010, Raposão won Rede Globo's Competição de Mascotes (Mascot Competition), held in their Sunday sports show Esporte Espetacular. The program united 20 mascots from the biggest Brazilian teams and had them competing in series of challenges. Raposão won all of the events and was crowned as Brazil's Best Mascot.

In 2012, Cruzeiro introduced a "junior mascot", named "Raposinho" (Little Fox), who's basically just a smaller version of "Raposão".

[[Walter Montillo]]'s 39 goals make him the non-Brazilian with the most goals for Cruzeiro, a record that would belong to [[Bolivia national football team]] vice-captain and striker [[Marcelo Martins Moreno|Marcelo Moreno]] with 48 goals or Spanish 1930's striker Fernando Carazo, with 44 goals, had they not become Brazilian nationals.<ref name="topscorers">{{cite web
