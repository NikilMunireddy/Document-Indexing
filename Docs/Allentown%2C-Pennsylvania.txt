'''Allentown''' ([[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania Dutch]]: ''Allenschteddel'') is a [[city]] located in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania]], United States. It is Pennsylvania's third most populous city and the [[List of United States cities by population|226th largest city in the United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 118,032 and is currently the fastest growing city in all of Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau Delivers Pennsylvania's 2010 Census Population Totals|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn74.html}}</ref> It is the largest city in the metropolitan area known as the [[Lehigh Valley]], which had a population of 821,623 residents {{As of|2010|lc=y}}.

Located on the [[Lehigh River]], Allentown is the largest of three adjacent cities, in Northampton and Lehigh counties, that make up a region of eastern Pennsylvania known as the [[Lehigh Valley]]. Allentown is {{convert|50|mi|km}} north-northwest of [[Philadelphia]], the [[List of United States cities by population|fifth most populous]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix drops to 6th largest city|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/03/13/20110313phoenix-6th-largest-city-philadelphia.html}}</ref> city in the United States, {{convert|90|mi|km}} east-northeast of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], the state capital, and {{convert|90|mi|km}} west of [[New York City]], the nation's largest city.

Allentown was cited as a "national success story" in April 2016 by the [[Urban Land Institute]] for its downtown redevelopment and transformation, one of only six communities in the country to have been named as such.

==History==

===Origins===
In the early 1700s, the land now occupied by the City of Allentown and [[Lehigh County]] was a wilderness of scrub oak where neighboring tribes of Indians fished for trout and hunted for deer, grouse, and other game. In 1736, a large area to the north of [[Philadelphia]], embracing the present site of Allentown and what is now Lehigh County, was deeded by 23 chiefs of the five great Indian nations to John, [[Thomas Penn|Thomas]], and Richard Penn, sons of [[William Penn]]. The price for this tract included shoes and buckles, hats, shirts, knives, scissors, combs, needles, looking  glasses, rum, and pipes.<ref name="bicen">Allentown PA Bicentennial – Lehigh Country Sesquicentennial 1962 Commemorative Book</ref>

The land that was to become Allentown was part of a {{convert|5000|acre|km2|sing=on}} plot Allen purchased on September 10, 1735 from his business partner [[Joseph Turner (loyalist)|Joseph Turner]], who was assigned the warrant to the land by Thomas Penn, son of William Penn, on May 18, 1732.<ref name="Allentown1916"/>

The land was originally surveyed on November 23, 1736.<ref name="Allentown1916"/> A subsequent survey done in 1753 by David Schultz for a road from [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], of which present-day Union and Jackson streets were links, shows the location of a log house owned by Allen, situated near the western bank of the [[Jordan Creek (Pennsylvania)|Jordan Creek]], which was believed to have been built around 1740. Used primarily as a hunting and fishing lodge, here Allen entertained prominent guests including his brother-in-law, [[James Hamilton (Pennsylvania)|James Hamilton]], and colonial governor [[John Penn (governor)|John Penn]].<ref name="Allentown1916">Page 17. Source indicates that the foundations of the lodge were located and destroyed in 1845 when excavations took place for Jordan Street.</ref>

===Founding===
The area that is today the center of Allentown was laid out as Northampton Town in 1762 by [[William Allen (loyalist)|William Allen]], a wealthy shipping merchant, former [[List of mayors of Philadelphia|mayor of the city of Philadelphia]] and then-Chief Justice of the [[Province of Pennsylvania]]. It is likely that a certain amount of rivalry with the Penns prompted Judge Allen to decide to start a town of his own in 1762.<ref name="bicen"/>
[[File:2008 - Allentown Trout Hall.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Trout Hall, built in 1770 by James Allen (son of Allentown founder [[William Allen (loyalist)|William Allen]]), is the oldest house in Allentown. From 1867 to 1905, it served as the home of [[Muhlenberg College]].]]

Ten years before, in 1752, Northampton and Berks counties had been formed, each with a county seat, Easton and Reading, respectively.  It is recorded that, in 1763, the very year after the founding of Allentown, an effort was made to have the county seat moved from  Easton to the new town. To this effort  William  Allen  lent all his influence as Chief Justice and also as the son-in-law of Andrew Hamilton.  The influence of the Penns, however, prevailed; and Easton was retained as the county seat of all that vast area which the notorious  "Walking  Purchase" had opened up.<ref name="bicen"/>

The original plan for the town, now in the archives of the [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]], comprised forty-two city blocks and consisted of 756 lots, mostly {{convert|60|ft|m}} in width and {{convert|230|ft|m}} in depth. The town was located between present-day Fourth and Tenth Streets, and Union and Liberty Streets. Many streets on the original plan were named for Allen's children: Margaret (present-day Fifth Street), William (now Sixth), James (now Eighth), Ann (now Ninth) and John (now Walnut). Allen Street (now Seventh) was named for Allen himself, and was the main thoroughfare. [[Pennsylvania Route 222|Hamilton Street]] was named for [[James Hamilton (Pennsylvania)|James Hamilton]]. Gordon Street was named for Sir Patrick Gordon, [[Deputy Governor]] of [[Colonial Pennsylvania]] from 1726–1736. Chew Street was named for [[Benjamin Chew]], and Turner Street was named for Allen's business partner, [[Joseph Turner (loyalist)|Joseph Turner]].<ref name="Allentown1916"/>

Allen hoped that Northampton Town would displace Easton as the seat of [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]] and also become a commercial center due to its location along the Lehigh River and its proximity to Philadelphia. Allen gave the property to his son James in 1767. Three years later, in 1770, James built a summer residence, Trout Hall, in the new town, near the site of his father's former hunting lodge.<ref name = "Proceedings">{{Cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Charles R. | title = William Allen, the Founder of Allentown, and His Descendants | journal = Proceedings of the Lehigh County Historical Society | issue = 1st | pages = 22–43 | publisher = Lehigh County Historical Society | location = Allentown, Pennsylvania | format = PDF | url = https://books.google.com/?id=j7VL8u8BCkUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=proceedings+lehigh-county-historical| year = 1908 | accessdate = August 17, 2008}}</ref>

On March 18, 1811, the town was formally incorporated as the [[Borough]] of Northampton Town. On March 6, 1812, Lehigh County was formed from the western half of Northampton County, and Northampton Town was selected as the county seat. The town was officially renamed "Allentown" on April 16, 1838, after years of popular usage. Allentown was formally incorporated as a city on March 12, 1867.<ref name="dates">{{cite web | url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Lehigh.pdf |format=PDF|title = Lehigh County – 4th class | accessdate = June 3, 2007 | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070629050922/http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Lehigh.pdf| archivedate= June 29, 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

===American Revolutionary War===
The beginnings of the [[American Revolutionary War]] began in Northampton County on December 21, 1774 when  a [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Observation]] for Northampton County was formed by American patriots.   At the time, there were 54 homes in Northampton (Allentown), and the number of inhabitants was around 330.  With the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the Colonial British government began to break down and militias took control.  Frontier justice replaced the rule of law as zealous patriots preoccupied themselves not with fighting the British but with seizing local political power and persecuting their pacifist neighbors.  Patriots pressured [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] out of Northampton County, and plans were made for the raising of a militia. The burden of supplying a military force logistically fell upon the people, and requisitions for food, grain, cattle, horses and cloth became commonplace.<ref name="Moll">[http://www.angelfire.com/pa5/mollpa/  The Moll Family in Pennsylvania,  Molls in the Revolution]</ref> 
[[File:1926 - Allentown Revolutionary War monument.jpg|thumb|1926 tablet placed by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] at the Old Allentown Cemetery, Tenth and Linden Street, honoring American Revolutionary War patriots from Allentown.  The Old Allentown Cemetery, just behind this monument, has the graves of many of the patriots whose names are inscribed on the memorial.]]
After the [[Battle of Trenton]] on December 26, 1776, [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] prisoners-of-war were kept in the vicinity of present-day Seventh and Gordon Streets. The Old Zion Reformed Church, and a house near James (now Eighth) and Hamilton Streets, served as hospitals for injured and sick [[Continental Army]] troops. In 1777, a factory manufacturing [[paper cartridge]]s for [[musket]]s was relocated here from nearby Bethlehem. That same year, a shop of sixteen [[Armourer|armorers]] was established along the [[Little Lehigh Creek]], and employed in the repair of weapons and the manufacture of [[saddle]]s and [[scabbard]]s.<ref name="Allentown1916"/>

It is not generally known, that [[General George Washington]], with his staff, not long after the battle of Trenton, passed through Allentown, up Water street (now Lehigh street). They stopped, at the foot of the street, at a large spring on what is now the property occupied, by the Wire Mill. There are several springs in the vicinity on both sides of the street, and near Wire Street. They rested and watered their horses, then went their way to their post of duty.<ref>[http://lehighvalleyhistory.com/allentown-city A History of Lehigh County, PA, Published by James J. Haurer - 1902]</ref>

In 1777 Toryism was in the ascendancy at Bethlehem. The government found it necessary to remove their cartridge manufacturing to a safer place; and the town of Northampton (Allentown) was selected for repairing arms and bayonets and the manufacturing of saddles. Captain Styles was in charge of the military supplies, while John Tyler and Ebenezer Cowell were armorers in the employ of the state who ran the factory. Sixteen local armorers, of whom Johannes Moll was one, were actively engaged in repair work at the factory. Wood was procured locally which provided the necessary charcoal for the forging operations, as well as replacing the battered stocks of damaged rifles.<ref name="Moll"/>

====Liberty Bell====

{{See also|Liberty Bell Museum}}
[[File:Arrival of Liberty Bell in Allentown - 1777.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of a watercolor by Davis Gray of the arrival of the [[Liberty Bell]] at Zions Church, in Northampton Town, Pennsylvania on 24 September 1777 (holdings of the [[Lehigh County Historical Society]].)]]
Allentown holds historical significance as the location where the [[Liberty Bell]] (then known as the Pennsylvania State House bell) was successfully hidden from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. After [[George Washington]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, and that city prepared for British attack. The [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] ordered that eleven bells, including the State House bell and the bells from Philadelphia's [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] and [[St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia|St. Peter's Church]], be taken down and removed from the city to prevent the British, who would melt the bells down to cast into [[cannon]]s, from taking possession of them. The bells were transported by John Snyder and Heinrich Bartholomew, two local residents assigned to the task by the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council, north to Northampton-Towne, and hidden in the basement of the Old Zion Reformed Church, in what is now center city Allentown.

Two wagon masters played an important role on this historic (Liberty Bell) trip from Philadelphia to Bethlehem. John Snyder and Henry Bartholomew were employed by the Supreme Executive Council, on this same day of the Liberty Bell's journey, to convey money and papers of value from Philadelphia to Easton for protection. It is recorded these two farmers of high esteem with horses and wagon of great value were entrusted with "papers in case, a barrel and a large iron chest". They made more than this one trip. On one journey from Pittston, New Jersey, these two men carried ammunition and books to store in safety in Easton. The only highway to this city came by way of Germantown through Bethlehem and then east to Easton.

Today, a shrine and museum in the church's basement, known as the [[Liberty Bell Museum]], mark the spot where the bell was hidden. "Ordered; Mr Lowden and Mr. Hoge be appointed to have money and papers belonging to the public loan office be moved to Easton in the County of Northampton, and John Snyder, Heinrich Bartholomew was employed with a wagon and convey it to said place."

===Early Allentown===
After the turmoil of the Revolution, Northampton Town grew slowly. In 1782 there were fifty-nine houses and  over a hundred cows were stabled within the town.  The town was described by a visitor in 1783 as "one gets a glimpse of many good stone houses, many of them very neat, and everything about the premises shows good order and attention.   The people are mainly German who speak bad English and distressing German".  In 1795, the U.S. Gazetteer described Allentown as <blockquote>a handsome and flourishing town of Northampton County, pleasantly situated on the point of land formed by the junction of the Jordan Creek and Little Lehigh. It is regularly laid out and contains about ninety dwellings, a German Lutheran and a Calvinist (Zion) Church, an Academy and three merchant mills.<ref name="bicen"/></blockquote>

It also shows Dam Number 7 on the Lehigh River, now known as the Hamilton Street Dam (holdings of the Lehigh County Historical Society).]]
Until 1803, the people of Northampton Town received their mail in Bethlehem. However, at the Compass and Square Hotel at Center Square (Today's Penn National Bank building) a post office was established. After reaching a population of over 700 residents in the 1810 United States Census, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania gave Northampton Town a legal existence on 18 March 1811 by incorporating it as the – Borough of Northampton, in Northampton County.  The first business of the Borough government was to order cows to seek other pastures other than the public streets. An action which led many of its citizens to believe they were better off when it was plain Northampton Town, before it became a Borough.  In 1812, Lehigh County was formed by partitioning a section of Northampton County, and Northampton was designated as its county seat.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT">[https://books.google.com/books?id=70xGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA142 ''Past, Present and Future of the City of Allentown, Pennsylvania'', Allentown Board of Trade, 1886]</ref>  
In the early 1800s, Allen's town, or Allentown, as the borough began to be called since it was no longer a part of Northampton County, continued to grow primarily as a court and market town.  The name became so common that in 1838, the name was officially changed to "Allentown".  The first bank, the Northampton Bank was chartered in July 1814 and it stood at the northeast corner of Center Square, where the Allentown National Bank Building stands today.  It was also in this period that the first Hamilton Street Bridge was built, a 530 foot long chain structure, was constructed over the Lehigh River.   It was composed of two suspended lanes, one for east and one for westbound traffic, and a toll house at the western end.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/><ref name="LCHS1">Allentown, 1762–1987, a 225 Year history, Volume II, 1921–1987, Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987.</ref>
[[File:1910 - Lehigh Canal with Canal Boat.jpg|thumb|Saeger's Mill was built in 1828 along the [[Lehigh Canal]] in the same year it was opened. It used water power purchased from the Lehigh Canal and Navigation Company, the owners of the canal.  The mill straddled the canal, and a covered bridge allowed the company to use both banks of the canal. Sager's Mill was destroyed by a fire in 1951.]]
In 1792, the land to the north of the Lehigh Valley was purchased by the Lehigh Coal Mine Company.  However it was difficult to transport coal over the primitive trail system that existed at the time so very little was mined.   In 1818 the Lehigh Navigation Company was formed and construction was begun on a navigable canal to transport the coal from Mach Chunk (today's Jim Thorpe) to Easton on the Delaware River.  The Lehigh Canal was completed for both ascending and descending navigation in 1829, being 46.6 miles long along the east side of the Lehigh River.  Its construction was the greatest single factor in making anthracite coal one of America's most important domestic and industrial fuels.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="HAER">HISTORIC AMERICAN ENGINEERING RECORD, Hamilton Street Bridge (Dam #7), HAER No. PA-89 Jean P. Yearby, HA.ER, 1985, United States Department of the Interior, Philadelphia, PA, 19106</ref>  However, the operational life of the canal was short.   In 1855 the first railroad was built on the west side of the Lehigh River and the competition between them resulted in the steady decline of canal traffic.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="HAER"/>

The 1840s in particular were not kind to Allentown. A flood in 1841 swept away the Hamilton Street bridge and did extensive damage to the river section of the city. The Northampton Bank failed in 1843 due to speculation and caused financial ruin to many families. Then a large fire on June 1, 1848 burned out most of the Central Business District between Seventh and Eighth Streets on Hamilton. However, during the 1850s, the city recovered economically with a new bridge across the Lehigh, brick buildings replacing the wooden ones burned down on Hamilton Street, and in 1852, the first Allentown Fair was held.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

Worried about the growing tensions between America's North and South, residents of the counties of Lehigh and Northampton in Pennsylvania “called a public meeting at Easton ‘to consider the posture of affairs and to take measures for the support of the National Government,'” according to Alfred Mathews and Austin N. Hungerford, authors of ''History of the Counties of Lehigh and Carbon, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of the Counties of Lehigh and Carbon, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pSBEAQAAMAAJ|publisher = Everts & Richards|date = 1884-01-01|first = Alfred|last = Mathews|first2 = Austin N.|last2 = Hungerford}}</ref> At this meeting on April 13, 1861, these citizens voted to establish and equip a new military unit, the 1st Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, and placed Tilghman H. Good in charge, assigning him the rank of lieutenant colonel. Good, commander of the 4th Regiment, Pennsylvania National Guard at the time, had previously served as captain of the Allen Rifles, a Lehigh County militia established in 1849, and later went on to become a three-time mayor of Allentown. Captain Samuel Yohe of Easton was appointed colonel of the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteers, and Thomas W. Lynn was awarded the rank of major. William H. Gausler, the leader of another Allentown-based militia, the Jordan Artillerists, was subsequently placed in charge of the Allen Rifles.

Then, following the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] and the fort's April 14 surrender to Confederate forces, President Abraham Lincoln issued his April 15, 1861 proclamation, calling for state militia to provide 75,000 volunteer troops to defend the nation's capital. In response, Allentown sent the Allen Infantry. Also known as the "Allen Guards," the unit was commanded by Captain Thomas Yeager, and mustered in for duty in Harrisburg on April 18, 1861. During their Three Months' Service, which lasted until July 23, 1861, these Allentonians primarily performed guard duty<ref>{{Cite book|title = A history of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, from the earliest settlements to the present time, including much valuable information for the use of schools, families, libraries|url = https://archive.org/details/historyoflehighc00hause|publisher = Allentown, Pa., Jacks, the printer|date = 1902-01-01|first = James J[oseph|last = Hauser}}</ref> and, as one of the first five militia units sent by Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C., the Allen Infantry helped to deter the Confederate States from carrying out any plans they had to capture the city. In recognition of this early service, the soldiers from the Allen Infantry, Logan Guards (Lewistown), National Light Infantry (Pottsville), Ringgold Light Artillery (Reading), and Washington Artillerists (Pottsville) became known as "[[Pennsylvania First Defenders]]".<ref name="bicen" />

Both the Allen Rifles and the Jordan Artillerists were then incorporated into the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteers, and mustered into service as Company I at Harrisburg on April 20, 1861, narrowly missing out on the opportunity to be declared as First Defenders. Upon completion of their Three Months’ Service, the men of Company I were honorably discharged, and also mustered out at Harrisburg on 23 July 1861.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Penn Germania ...: A Popular Journal of German History and Ideals in the United States|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SDFEAQAAMAAJ|publisher = P.C.

On August 5, 1861, Governor Andrew Curtin granted authority to Tilghman H. Good to raise another new regiment, the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry]]. Commissioned as Colonel of the 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers, Good secured help from William H. Gausler, who was commissioned as a Major with the regiment's central command staff, and John Peter Shindel Gobin, an officer with the Sunbury Guards in Northumberland County who had been given the authority to form his own unit and who would later go on to become a Pennsylvania state senator and the state's Lieutenant Governor.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = History of Pennsylvania volunteers, 1861-5; prepared in compliance with acts of the legislature, by Samuel P.

After emigrating from Germany at age 15, [[Ignatz Gresser]] became a cobbler in Allentown. Just days after the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, he enlisted in the Allen Infantry.  After the war stretched into its second year, he enlisted in the [[128th Pennsylvania Infantry|128th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry]]. In August 1862, Gresser become a corporal in Company D. He was bestowed the [[Congressional Medal of Honor]] for action at the [[Battle of Antietam]] on September 17, 1862. The Allentown Soldiers and Sailors Monument, which stands in Center Square, came about largely through the efforts of Corporal Gresser.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

===Industrial and Business Center===
{{further2|[[Industrial Revolution]] and [[Second Industrial Revolution]]}}
The opening of the Lehigh Canal caused a fundamental change in the nature of Allentown and the Lehigh Valley, as it transformed both from a rural agricultural area dominated by German-speaking people into an urbanized industrialized area. It expanded the city's commercial and industrial capacity greatly. With this, the town underwent significant industrialization, ultimately becoming a major center for heavy industry and manufacturing.
[[File:1889 - Allentown Iron Works.jpg|thumb|The Allentown Rolling Mill Company, photographed in 1889.]]
The actual foundation for the city's industrial development was brought about by necessity.  David Deshler, the city's first shopkeeper, opened a saw mill in 1782. By 1814 the list of industrial plants in the city included flour mills, saw mills, two saddle makers, a tannery and tan yard, a woolen mill, a card weaving ·plant, two gunsmiths, two tobacconists, two clock-makers, and two printers.<ref name="bicen"/>  In 1855, the first railroads reached Allentown.  These were in direct competition for moving coal with the Lehigh Canal.  The Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad ordered four locomotives and stations were erected at Easton, Allentown and Mauch Chunk. The railroad was placed in operation in September of that year.  Connections for New York were made via the Central Railroad of New Jersey and later connections with Philadelphia were made via the Perkiomen railroad which operated between Norristown and Freemansburg.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/>

It was Henry Leh that began the true industrialization of Allentown in 1861. The Union Army needed boots. Since Simon Cameron, the secretary of war, was from Pennsylvania, many government contracts flowed to the Keystone state.  Leh had opened his shoe and ready-to-wear clothing store in Allentown in 1850.  If the Union Army needed boots and shoes, he'd make them.  In addition to Leh's boot and shoe industry,  during the Civil War, eight brick yards, a saw mill, the Allentown Paint factory, two shoe factories, a piano factory, flour mills, breweries and distilleries had opened in the city.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>
[[File:1910 - Adelaide Silk Mill.jpg|thumb|The Adelaide Silk Mill, shown in 1910.]]
Beds of iron ore had been discovered in the hills around Allentown in the 1840s, and a furnace was constructed in 1846 for the production of pig iron by the Allentown Iron Company. The furnace was opened in 1847 under the supervision of Samuel Lewis, an expert in iron production, and this led to the opening of plants for a wide variety of metal products.  The Allentown Rolling Mill Company was a merger of several small companies in 1860 and became the most significant iron company in the city. It employed many people and turned out more iron products than any other.  Although not as large as the iron and steel industry in neighboring Bethlehem, in the latter half of the 19th Century, Allentown became a major iron-producing center.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/>

The Allentown Boiler Works was founded in 1883 by Charles Collum. He and his partner, John D. Knouse, built a large facility at Third and Gordon Streets in the First Ward, near the Lehigh Valley Railroad yard to the east near Jeter's (later Kline's) Island. The business manufactured iron products of many types, being used in the White House and at the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY. It's boilers and kilns were used across the United States, and also in Canada, Cuba and the Philippines.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/>
[[File:1910 - Center Square Looking West.jpg|thumb|Center Square about 1910]]
In addition to the iron and railroad industries, Allentown also had a strong tradition in the [[brewing]] of [[beer]] and was home to several notable [[List of Pennsylvania breweries|breweries]], including the Horlacher Brewery (founded 1897, closed 1978),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/horlacher.htm|title=Horlacher Brewing Company |accessdate=June 1, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607155057/http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/horlacher.htm| archivedate= June 7, 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> the [[Neuweiler Brewery]] (founded 1875, closed 1968)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pabreweryhistorians.tripod.com/neuweiler.html |title=Neuweiler Brewery |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}</ref> and [[Schaefer Beer]], whose brewery was later owned by [[Pabst Brewing Company]] and [[Guinness]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/pwatch/pw011203.htm |title=$44 Million Guinness Investment Will Create 250 Jobs at Pennsylvania Brewery|accessdate=June 1, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070629111341/http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/pwatch/pw011203.htm| archivedate= June 29, 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> but is now owned by the Boston Beer Company, maker of [[Samuel Adams]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.pennlive.com/lvbreakingnews/2007/08/sam_adams_purchases_upper_macu.html |title=Sam Adams purchases Upper Macungie Twp. plant for $55 M |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}</ref>

Brick making flourished in the city until after World War I, the clay unearthed in various sections of the community proving highly suitable for the manufacture of building brick as well as fire brick.  Bricks were the first products shipped outside of the Allentown area by rail and were sold nationwide.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/>  Food processing started with the early bakers, who came into the city with the first settlers. In 1887, Wilson Arbogast and Morris C. Bastian formed Arbogast and Bastian, where commercial slaughtering was done on a large scale.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>
[[File:1945 Mack Trucks Plant 5C.jpg|thumb|[[Mack Trucks]] assembly plant 5C, shown in 1945]]
With the industrial industry,  Allentown became a major banking and finance center.  William H. Ainey was born in Susquehanna county, November 30, 1834.  In 1860 he organized the Allentown Savings Institution and was chosen its first president.  In 1863-64 the Second National Bank of Allentown was organized. He was elected its first president, a position he filled up to the time of his death.    Ainey was a major financier of the industrial and retail growth of the city. Through his industry and assistance the following industries were established: The Iowa Barb Wire Co., which was later absorbed by the American Steel and Wire Co.; The Pioneer Silk Factory, The Palace Silk Mill, and the Allentown Spinning Company.<ref name="LCHS1"/>

In the late 1870s, Allentown's iron industry collapsed. It left the city economically depressed and to prevent this from happening again, efforts were made to develop a diversifed industrial base. Convincing the Phoenix Manufacturing Company to open a silk mill in Allentown was the first major success of that effort. The success of its Adelaide mill at Race and Court Streets prompted the opening of the Pioneer silk mill in 1886 and the city was established as a silk manufacturing center.   With its many ancillary businesses, the silk industry became the largest in the city and remained so until the late 20th century. By 1914 there were 26 mills in Allentown, which by 1928, when rayon was introduced became 85 mills. Over 10,000 people were employed in the Allentown silk industry at its height during the 1940s.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>
[[File:1950 Hamilton Street 500 Block looking West.jpg|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Route 222|Hamilton Street West]] from 6th in 1950]]
Jack and Gus Mack moved their motor car plant to Allentown from Brooklyn, NY in 1905; taking over the foundries of the former Weaver-Hirsh company on South 10th Street. By 1914, Mack Trucks had developed a reputation for being study and reliable. Many were sent to the battlefields of the Western Front in France before the United States entered World War I in 1917. The British gave the Mack AC five and seven ton trucks the nickname "Bulldog". Mack eventually had a total of eight manufacturing plants in Allentown.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>   In the post-World War II era, the [[Western Electric]] plant on Union Boulevard was announced on 11 October 1945, after a nationwide search to locate a new manufacturing plant.  On 1 October 1951 the world's first [[transistor]] production began at the Allentown Western Electric plant. It would become the backbone of a communications revolution. Over the years the plant was at the forefront of the postwar electronics revolution.<ref>[http://articles.mcall.com/1995-10-08/business/3069670_1_new-location-western-s-electric-s-50th-full-story At&t Decided To Bring High Tech 50 Years Ago October 08, 1995|by FRANK WHELAN, The Morning Call]</ref>

Max Hess came to Allentown in 1896 on a business trip and envisioned a department store serving the area. He moved his family from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, in 1897.   Max and his brother Charles opened Hess Brothers on Ninth and Hamilton streets.  In the first half of the 20th Century, Hess Brothers was a shopping destination. Flamboyance and excitement were cornerstones of the store. It was well known for its fashion apparel as a result of introducing the latest trends from Europe.  Opening in 1926, the Zollinger-Harned Company became Allentown's third major department store in the Central Business District.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

By the mid-20th Century, Allentown had become a major retailing and entertainment center separate from Philadelphia and New York City.  The establishment of the Hess Brothers, H. Leh and Company and Zollinger Department stores led to the growth of the retail business sector in the Central Business District.  There were dozens of smaller retail stores, along with numerous restaurants, hotels, banks and professional offices in the "downtown", as it was called.  In addition to the shopping, at least seven cinemas and stage theaters were located along Hamilton Street between Fifth and Tenth Streets.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

===Late 20th century===
By the mid 1960s, Allentown's economy had been booming for decades.  However, beginning in the 1970s, the economy and demographics of the city began to change.

Increasing taxes in the city and the inability to expand the city's legal limits led to a migration of the [[baby boom generation]] to live outside of the city limits.  Townships such as [[Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Salisbury]], [[South Whitehall Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall]] and [[Whitehall Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Whitehall]] had large areas of farmland that were prime locations for large housing estates to be built.  Allentown began to be drained of its next generation of working class, who began to migrate to the newer, less expensive housing in suburbs which also offered lower taxes, greenspace, less crime, and newer schools.

With these demographic changes that began in the 1970s and continued into the 1980s and 1990s, Allentown's city government and [[Allentown School District|school district]] were left with fewer resources.  The financial shortcomings of the city increased the amount of working-class families leaving Allentown because of the Allentown School District's shortcomings as well as the sea change in demographics in the city's neighborhoods, especially those in [[Center City, Allentown, Pennsylvania|center city]]. With the departure of many working-class families from older center city neighborhoods, many homes were sold to landlords which converted them into inexpensive multi-family apartments which became government subsidized because of lax zoning enforcement and permissive city codes.  The subsidized housing attracted new immigrants to the area from New York and Philadelphia, looking for a better life in the more affordable Allentown area, but started a poverty problem with many of these residents requiring social services which the city could not afford easily.
[[File:1974 - Hamilton Mall Image.jpg|thumb|1974 image of the Hamilton Mall, a redevelopment of the Central Business District of Allentown.  This was an attempt by the city to compete with the suburban shopping centers that had opened outside of the city and bring shoppers back to the Central Business District.]]
While the neighborhoods and school system continued to decline, Allentown, like many other cities, focused all of its attention and resources on Hamilton Street Retail and the Central Business District, ignoring the neighborhoods around them.  This exacerbated the decline of the city at large.  With the population growing in the townships, more and more shopping centers along with other services were built outside of the city to accommodate the needs of their growing populations. In 1966, the [[Whitehall Mall]], the first closed shopping mall north of Philadelphia was opened.  Ten years later in 1976, the larger large [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] was built north of the [[Lehigh Valley Thruway]] (US Route 22).  The stores in the downtown shopping district began to close and be replaced with stores whose customers were less affluent than the past.  Large areas of the downtown were torn down for parking lots and the downtown business district was rebuilt in an attempt to compete with the suburban shopping areas.  However, the Hamilton Mall concept of covered sidewalks and reduced traffic was ultimately unsuccessful.  Two of the city's major department stores, [[Leh's]] and Zollingers closed by 1990.  The third, [[Hess's]] was sold to [[The Bon-Ton]] in 1994, which subsequently closed in 1996.<ref>[http://www.allentownpa.gov/Play/History  Allentownpa.gov city history]</ref>  The closure of Hess's and the fate in 1993 of the Corporate Center, the city's new flagship business center on North Seventh Street, fell victim to a large sinkhole which caused its condemnation and ultimate demolition.

Combined with this, the manufacturing economy of the [[Northeastern United States]] began suffering from [[deindustrialization]].  That caused many of the factories and corporations headquartered in Allentown to close or move.   [[Mack Trucks]] relocated to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], [[LSI Corporation]] (formerly [[Western Electric]], later [[Agere Systems]], which merged with [[LSI Logic]]), moved its headquarters to [[California]], and numerous factories ceased operation.  With the manufacturing base of the economy eroding, more and more high-paying industrial jobs were replaced with lower-paying jobs in the service sector.

In the 2000s and 2010s, Allentown's economy, like most of Pennsylvania's, has been based in the [[Tertiary sector of industry|service industries]] with some manufacturing.  There also has been significant growth in the health care, transportation and warehousing industries.

The Allentown Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) operates a business incubator, the Bridgeworks, which helps attract and support young commercial and manufacturing businesses.  In addition, the Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ) was created by the [[Pennsylvania State Legislature]] in 2009 to encourage development and revitalization in Allentown. The NIZ consists of approximately {{convert|128|acres|abbr=off}} in downtown Allentown and the new Riverfront district (the western side of the [[Lehigh River]]).   As a result, the Central Business District has been redeveloped with Allentown’s new [[PPL Center]] arena, a full-service [[Renaissance Hotels|Renaissance Hotel]] and redeveloped office buildings.<ref name="NIZ">[http://www.allentownpa.gov/Neighborhood-Improvement-Zone  Allentown Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ)]</ref>

In addition to the Central Business District, the Lehigh River waterfront area is being redeveloped with a mixed-use development of apartment and office buildings.<ref name="NIZ"/>  There is also an effort underway to bring suburban residents back into the city.  Downtown apartment complexes, such as the Strata Lofts I and II are being built to provide rentals primarily for [[millennials]] who work in the new office buildings.   Empty Nester boomer and [[Generation X|Gen-X]] residents are being attracted to such condominium residences such as the redeveloped  Livingston Building and Farr Lofts, as well as new uban condominiums planned in the Five City Center Complex downtown.  In addition to the residences and office buildings, new retail stores and restaurants are being built as part of the NIZ development.<ref name="NIZ"/>

[[Center City, Allentown, Pennsylvania|Center City]], which includes the downtown area and the 7th Street retail and residential corridor, is the city's central business district and the site of various city, county and federal government centers. To the east of Center City are "The Wards," residential areas that developed during the city's industrial boom of the late 19th century and early 20th century. Just east of the [[Lehigh River]] are the city's East Side residential neighborhoods, most of which border the various routes to nearby [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]. South of Center City, and across the [[Little Lehigh Creek]], are the city's South Side neighborhoods, which border [[Emmaus, Pennsylvania|Emmaus]].

The City of Allentown is characterized by a large stock of historic homes, commercial structures and century-old industrial buildings.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Allentown's [[Center City, Allentown, Pennsylvania|Center City]] neighborhoods mainly consist of a variety of Victorian and Federal [[Terraced house|rowhomes]]. The stately homes around West Park are mostly [[Victorian Architecture|Victorian]] and [[Craftsman-style]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The houses on the city's tree-lined streets in the West End were mostly built in the 1920s and 1940s. Houses in the City's East Side and South Side are a mixture of architectural styles and are generally single and twin family homes built from the 1940s through the 1960s but there are also some older Victorian homes. Allentown also has [[loft|loft apartments]] in converted mills and historic brick manufacturing buildings and modern and historic high-rise apartment buildings.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The [[PPL Building]] is Allentown's tallest building at {{convert|322|ft|m}}. It is 23 stories high and is located at the northwest corner of 9th and Hamilton Street. It was designed by the New York architectural firm of Helme, Corbett, and Harrison.  Wallace Harrison came to Allentown to design the building, which was a prototype for the [[Art Deco]] architecture of [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City.   The decorative friezes on the exterior of the building were designed by Alexander Archipenko. It was built between 1926–28 and was opened to the public on July 16, 1928.<ref>Ann Bartholomew (Author), Carol M. Front (Author) (2002), Allentown (Images of America), Arcadia Publishing (April 8, 2002), ISBN 0738509965, p38</ref>  It has been illuminated at night since it was opened and in clear weather, the tower can be seen from as far north as the [[Blue Mountain Ski Area]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

One of the city's older surviving structures, [[Miller Symphony Hall]], at 23 North Sixth Street, dates from 1896 and originally housed the city's public market.  Originally known as the Lyric Theater, it is the premier performing arts facility in Allentown, home of the [[Allentown Symphony Orchestra]], as well as the Pennsylvania Sinfonia, Community Concerts of Allentown, Allentown Band and Community Music School of the Lehigh Valley. Built around 1896 as the Central Market Hall, the structure was converted to a theater in 1899 by the architectural firm of J.B. McElfatrick and renamed the Lyric Theater. Perhaps one of only a dozen of the famous McElfatrick designs still standing, the building has been a burlesque Hall, used for vaudeville shows, silent films, symphony orchestras, and other forms of entertainment for well over a century.<ref>"About Symphony Hall".

There are three historic districts in Allentown: Old Allentown, the Old Fairgrounds and the West Park neighborhoods. Old Allentown and Old Fairgrounds are Center City neighborhoods that hold a joint house tour organized by the Old Allentown Preservation Association (OAPA) once a year in September. The West Park neighborhood also offers a tour of this district's larger Victorian and Craftsman-style homes.<ref>[http://www.oldallentown.org Old Allentown Web Site]</ref>

===City parks===
{{Main|List of city parks of Allentown, Pennsylvania}}
Much of the city's park system can be attributed to the efforts of industrialist [[Harry Clay Trexler]].
