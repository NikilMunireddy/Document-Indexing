'''County Kerry''' ({{lang-gle|Contae Chiarraí}}) is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is located in the [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]] and is also part of the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]]. It is named after the [[Ciarraige]] who lived in part of the present county. [[Kerry County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county and [[Tralee]] serves as the county town. The population of the county was 145,502 in 2011, according to the 2011 census.

==Geography and political subdivisions==
Kerry is the 5th largest of the 32 counties of Ireland by area and the 13th largest by population.<ref>{{cite book| first=Eoghan| last=Corry| title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland| year=2005| id= | pages=186–191}}</ref> Uniquely, it is bordered by only two other counties: [[County Limerick]] to the east and [[County Cork]] to the south-east. The [[county town]] is [[Tralee]]. The diocesan see is [[Killarney]], which is one of Ireland's most famous tourist destinations. The [[Lakes of Killarney]], an area of outstanding natural beauty are located in [[Killarney National Park]]. The tip of the [[Dingle Peninsula]] is the most westerly point of Ireland.

===Baronies===
There are nine historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in the county. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under "Administrative units".

===Physical geography===
[[File:County Kerry West of Ballyferriter.jpg|thumb|400px|Near Teeravane, County Kerry, Ireland]]
Kerry faces the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and, typically for an Eastern-Atlantic coastal region, features many [[peninsulas]] and inlets, principally the [[Dingle Peninsula]], the [[Iveragh Peninsula]], and the [[Beara Peninsula]]. The county is bounded on the west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and on the north by the [[River Shannon]]. Kerry is one of the most mountainous regions of Ireland and contains two of its three highest mountains, [[Carrauntoohil]], part of the [[Macgillycuddy's Reeks]] range, and [[Mount Brandon]], part of the [[Slieve Mish Mountains|Slieve Mish range]].

Just off the coast are a number of islands, including the [[Blasket Islands]], [[Valentia Island]] and the [[Skellig Islands|Skelligs]]. [[Skellig Michael]] is a [[World Heritage Site]], famous for the [[medieval]] [[monastery]] clinging to the island's cliffs. The county contains the [[Extreme points of Ireland|extreme west point]] of Ireland, [[Dunmore Head]] on the Dingle Peninsula, or including islands, [[Tearaght Island]], part of the Blaskets.  The most westerly inhabited area of Ireland is [[Dún Chaoin]], on the Dingle Peninsula. The [[River Feale]], the [[River Laune]] and the [[Roughty River]] flow through Kerry, into the Atlantic.
[[File:Dingle peninsula panorama crop.jpg|thumb|930px|center|Dingle Peninsula]]

===Climate===
* The [[North Atlantic Current]], part of the [[Gulf Stream]], flows north by Kerry and the west coast of Ireland, resulting in milder temperatures than would otherwise be expected at the 52 North [[latitude]].  This means that [[subtropical]] plants such as the [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] and [[tree fern]]s, not normally found in Northern Europe, thrive in the area.
* Because of the mountainous area and the prevailing south-westerly winds, Kerry is among the regions with the highest [[rainfall]] in Ireland.  Due to its location, the area is the site of a weather reporting station on Valentia for many centuries.  The Irish record for one-day rain-fall is {{convert|243.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}, recorded at Cloore Lake, in Kerry in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |title=Rainfall – Climate – Met Éireann – The Irish Meteorological Service Online |publisher=Met.ie |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref>
* In 1986, the remnants of [[Hurricane Charley (1986)|Hurricane Charley]] crossed over Kerry as an [[extratropical storm]] causing extensive rainfall, flooding and damage.

Kerry ({{lang-ga|Ciarraí}} or more anciently ''Ciarraighe'') means the "people of Ciar" which was the name of the pre-Gaelic tribe who lived in part of the present county. The legendary founder of the tribe was [[Ciar]], son of [[Fergus mac Róich]].<ref name=barrington>T J Barrington, ''Discovering Kerry, its History Heritage and toponymy'', Dublin, 1976</ref> In [[Old Irish]] "Ciar" meant black or dark brown, and the word continues in use in modern Irish as an adjective describing a dark complexion.<ref>''Gearrfhoclóir Gaeilge-Béarla'', Dublin, 1981</ref> The suffix  ''raighe'', meaning ''people/tribe'', is found in various  ''-ry'' place names in Ireland, such as ''Osry''—''Osraighe'' ''Deer-People/Tribe''. The county's nickname is ''the Kingdom''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mary Tossell |url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlker/history.html |title=History, Geography, Facts about County Kerry |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref>

===Lordship of Ireland===
On 27 August 1329, by [[Letters Patent]], [[Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond]] was confirmed in the feudal seniority of the entire [[county palatine]] of Kerry, to him and his heirs male, to hold of the Crown by the service of one knight's fee. In the 15th century, the majority of the area now known as County Kerry was still part of the [[County Desmond]], the west Munster seat of the [[Earl of Desmond]], a branch of the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald dynasty]], known as the [[Geraldines]].

===Kingdom of Ireland===
[[File:Gallarus Oratory.JPG|220px|thumbnail|Gallarus Oratory near Dingle, which dates back to the 6th century.]]
[[File:Skellig Michael.png|220px|thumbnail|Little Skellig, as seen from Skellig Michael.]]
In 1580, during the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]], one of the most infamous massacres of the Sixteenth century, the [[Siege of Smerwick]], took place at Dún an Óir near [[Ard na Caithne]] (Smerwick) at the tip of the [[Dingle Peninsula]]. The 600-strong Italian, Spanish and Irish [[Second Desmond Rebellion#1579 invasion|papal invasion force]] of [[James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald]] was besieged by the English forces and massacred.

In 1588 when the fleet of the [[Spanish Armada in Ireland]] were returning to [[Spain]] during stormy weather, many of its ships sought shelter at the [[Blasket Islands]] and some were wrecked.

During the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]], Kerry was again the scene of conflict, as the O'Sullivan Beare clan joined the rebellion. In 1602, their castle at [[Dunboy Castle|Dunboy]] was [[Siege of Dunboy|besieged and taken]] by English troops. [[Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare|Donal O'Sullivan]] Beare, in an effort to escape English retribution and to reach his allies in [[Ulster]], marched all the clan's members and dependants to the north of Ireland. Due to harassment by hostile forces and freezing weather, very few of the 1,000 O'Sullivans who set out reached their destination.

In the aftermath of the War, much of the native owned land in Kerry was confiscated and given to English settlers or 'planters'. The head of the [[MacCarthy Mor]] family, [[Florence MacCarthy]] was imprisoned in London and his lands were divided between his relatives and colonists from England, such as the Browne family.

In the 1640s, Kerry was engulfed by the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], an attempt by Irish Catholics to take power in the Protestant [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. The rebellion in Kerry was led by [[Donagh McCarthy, 1st Viscount Muskerry]]. McCarthy held the county during the subsequent [[Irish Confederate Wars]] and his forces were among the last to surrender to the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] in 1652. The last stronghold to fall was [[Ross Castle]], near Killarney.

===United Kingdom===
In the 17th and 18th centuries, Kerry became increasingly populated by poor tenant farmers, who came to rely on the [[potato]] as their main food source. As a result, when the potato crop failed in 1845, Kerry was very hard hit by the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1845–49. In the wake of the famine, many thousands of poor farmers emigrated to seek a better life in America and elsewhere. Kerry was to remain a source of emigration until recent times. Another long term consequence of the famine was the [[Land War]] of the 1870s and 1880s, in which tenant farmers agitated, sometimes violently for better terms from their landlords.

===War of Independence and Civil War===
[[File:RossCastleAndLoughLeane.jpg|220px|thumbnail|Ross Castle and Lough Leane, Killarney National Park.]]
In the 20th century, Kerry was one of the counties most affected by the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–21) and [[Irish Civil War]] (1922–23). In the war of Independence, the [[Irish Republican Army]] fought a guerilla war against the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], and British military. One of the more prominent incidents in the conflict in Kerry was the "siege of Tralee" in November 1920, when the [[Black and Tans]] placed [[Tralee]] under curfew for a week, burned many homes, and shot dead a number of local people in retaliation for the IRA killing of five local policemen the night before. Another was the [[Headford Ambush|Headford Junction ambush]] in spring 1921, when IRA units ambushed a train carrying British soldiers outside Killarney. About ten British soldiers, three civilians and two IRA men were killed in the ensuing gun battle. Violence between the IRA and the British was ended in July 1921, but nine men, four British soldiers and five IRA men, were killed in a shoot-out in Castleisland on the day of the truce itself, indicating the bitterness of the conflict in Kerry.

Following the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], most of the Kerry IRA units opposed the settlement. One exception existed in [[Listowel]] where a pro-Treaty garrison was established by local Flying Column commandant Thomas Kennelly in February 1922. This unit consisted of 200 regular soldiers along with officers and NCOs. A batch of rifles, machine guns and a [[Crossley]]Tender were sent from Dublin. Listowel would remain a base for those supporting the treaty throughout the conflict.<ref>Listowel and its Vicinity. Anthony Gaughan. 1973.</ref> The town was eventually overcome by superior numbers of anti-Treaty forces belonging to the Kerry No. 2 and 3 Brigades in June 1922. In the ensuing civil war between pro- and anti-treaty elements, Kerry was perhaps the worst affected area of Ireland. Initially the county was held by the [[Anti-Treaty IRA]] but it was taken for the [[Irish Free State]] after [[Irish Free State offensive|seaborne landings]] by National Army troops at [[Fenit]], [[Tarbert]] and [[Kenmare]] in August 1922. Thereafter the county saw a bitter guerilla war between men who had been comrades only a year previously. The republicans, or "irregulars", mounted a number of successful actions, for example attacking and briefly re-taking [[Kenmare]] in September 1922. In March 1923, Kerry saw a series of [[Executions during the Irish Civil War|massacres]] of republican prisoners by [[Irish Army|National Army]] soldiers in reprisal for the ambush of their men—the most notorious being the killing of eight men with mines at Ballyseedy, near Tralee. The internecine conflict was brought to an end in May 1923 as the rule of law was re-established following the death of IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch, and the order by Frank Aiken to dump all arms.

==Local government==

===County council===
{{Main|Kerry County Council}}
The principal local authority is Kerry County Council. The council provides a number of services including planning, roads maintenance, fire brigade, council housing, water supply, waste collection, recycling and landfill, higher education grants and funding for arts and culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kerrycoco.ie/en/allservices/ |title=All Services |publisher=Kerry County Council |accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref>

===Town councils===
An additional tier of local government existed in the three largest towns in the county, [[Killarney]], [[Listowel]] and [[Tralee]] until the [[Irish local elections, 2014|2014 local elections]] were held on 23 May 2014. These elections were held following the changes effected by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]. The act abolished [[Town Councils in the Republic of Ireland|town councils]] and introduced [[Municipal district (Ireland)|municipal district]]s. County Kerry was divided into four municipal districts, which are identical with the local electoral areas (LEA) used for election of Councillors.<ref>{{cite web|title=S.I. No. 51/2014 - County of Kerry Local Electoral Areas and Municipal Districts Order 2014|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0051.html|work=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the Attorney General|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref>

==Parliamentary representation==
Kerry is represented in [[Dáil Éireann]] by six [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s returned from two parliamentary constituencies. Following boundary changes in 2011, County Kerry, along with western parts of [[County Limerick]], returns six TDs to the Dáil. Each of the following constituencies returns three deputies to the Dáil: [[Kerry North–West Limerick (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Kerry North–West Limerick]] and [[Kerry South (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Kerry South]]. The TDs elected to the [[Members of the 31st Dáil|31st Dáil Éireann]] at the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]] were:

'''Kerry North–West Limerick''':
* [[Jimmy Deenihan]] ([[Fine Gael]])
* [[Martin Ferris]] ([[Sinn Féin]])
* [[Arthur Spring]] ([[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]])
'''Kerry South''':
* [[Brendan Griffin (Kerry politician)|Brendan Griffin]] ([[Fine Gael]])
* [[Tom Fleming (Irish politician)|Tom Fleming]] ([[Independent (politician)|Independent]])
* [[Michael Healy-Rae]] ([[Independent (politician)|Independent]])

==Culture==
As a region on the extremity of Ireland, culture of Kerry was less susceptible to outside influences and has preserved the [[Irish language]], [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]], song and dance. The [[Sliabh Luachra]] area of northeast Kerry bordering Limerick and Cork is renowned for its traditional music, dance and song, especially its slides, polkas and fiddle playing. The [[Siamsa Tíre]] centre in Tralee is a hub of traditional Irish pastimes. [[Corca Dhuibhne]] and [[Uíbh Ráthach]] are considered [[Gaeltacht]] regions and Irish culture is also very strong in these areas. The Blasket Islands off the Dingle Peninsula are known for their rich literary heritage with authors such as [[Peig Sayers]], [[Muiris Ó Suilleabhain]] and [[Tomás Ó Críomhthain]] all writing books about life on the islands, which were evacuated in 1953. [[John B Keane]], a native of Listowel, is considered one of Ireland's greatest playwrights and is known for his works such as [[The Field (play)|The Field]], [[Sive (play)|Sive]] and Big Maggie.

==Sport==
<!-- Commented out: [[File:Kerry GAA crest.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Kerry GAA]] has large support throughout the county]] -->
