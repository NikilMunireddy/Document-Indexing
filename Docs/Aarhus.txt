'''Aarhus''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɒːhuːˀs|-|Århus.ogg}}; officially spelled '''Århus''' from 1948 until 31 December 2010) is the second-largest city in [[Denmark]] and the seat of [[Aarhus Municipality]]. It is located on the east coast of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, {{convert|187|km}} northwest of [[Copenhagen]] and {{convert|289|km}} north of [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. The inner [[urban area]] contains 264,716	inhabitants ({{as of|2016|01|01|lc=on}}) and the municipal population is 330,639 ({{as of|2016|lc=on}}).<ref name="DSPopulation" /> Aarhus is the central city in the [[East Jutland metropolitan area]], which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016.<ref name="East Jutland">{{cite web|title=Tal og statistik|trans-title=Figures and Statistics|url=http://www.byregionoestjylland.dk/Statistik.html|publisher=Byregion Østjylland|accessdate=25 April 2016|language=Danish}}</ref>

The history of Aarhus began as a fortified [[Viking]] settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the [[bishopric]] seated here from at least 948. The city was founded on the northern shores of [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|a fjord]] at a [[natural harbour]] and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products. [[Market town]] privileges were granted in 1441, but growth stagnated in the 17th&nbsp;century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish Wars]]. In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the [[First Schleswig War|Schleswig Wars]] but avoided destruction. As the [[industrial revolution]] took hold, the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century.

Today Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade, services and industry in Jutland. The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the [[European Union]], and as [[List of largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|number 234]] among [[world cities]], It is also a top 100 [[Meeting|conference]] city in the world.<ref>http://www.iccaworld.com/dcps/doc.cfm?docid=1696.</ref> Aarhus is the principal industrial [[port]] of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in [[Kattegat]]. Major Danish companies have based their headquarters here and people commute for work and leisure from a wide area in [[Region Midtjylland]]. It is a centre for research and education in the [[Nordic countries]] and home to [[Aarhus University]], [[Scandinavia]]'s largest university, including [[Aarhus University Hospital]] and [[INCUBA Science Park]]. Being the Danish city with the youngest demographics, with 48,482 inhabitants aged under 18,<ref name="DSPopulation" /> Aarhus is also one of the fastest growing Danish cities, with an average growth of 4,000 people per annum since 2010.

Aarhus is notable for its musical history. In the 1950s many [[jazz]] clubs sprang up around the city, fuelled by the young population. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into [[rock music|rock]] and other genres. In the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became the centre for Denmark's rock music fostering many iconic bands such as [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]] and [[Gnags]]. Aarhus is home to the annual eight-day [[Aarhus International Jazz Festival]], the [[Spot (music festival)|SPoT Festival]] and the [[NorthSide Festival (Denmark)|Northside Festival]].

==Etymology==
In [[Valdemar's Census Book]] (1231) the city was called ''Arus'', and in Icelandic it was known as ''Aros'', later written as Aars.<ref name=Salmonsen>{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/1/0067.html|title=Salmonsens konversationsleksikon / Anden Udgave|page=53|publisher=[[Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon|Salmonsen]]|accessdate=16 July 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> It is a compound of the two words ''ār'', genitive of ''ā'' ("river", Modern Danish ''å''), and ''ōss'' ("mouth", in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for "river delta").<ref name=dsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/%C3%85rhus|title=Aarhus|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of Aarhus Å ([[Aarhus River]]).<ref name="The Aarhus River">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.dk/east-jutland/history/aarhus-aa|title=The Aarhus River|publisher=Visitaarhus.com|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/denmark/vikings/history-of-aarhus|title= History of the city|publisher=Visitaarhus.com|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> The spelling "Aarhus" is first found in 1406 and gradually became the norm in the 17th&nbsp;century.<ref name=Salmonsen/>

;Aarhus/Århus spelling
With the [[Å#Origin|Danish spelling reform of 1948]], "Aa" was changed to "Å". Some Danish cities resisted the new spelling of their names, notably [[Aalborg]] and [[Aabenraa]]. Århus city council explicitly embraced the new spelling, as it was thought to enhance an image of progressiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/default.asp?Id=1881&AjrDcmntId=30979|title=Det omstridte bolle-å|publisher=Aarhus portalen|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> In 2010, the city council voted to change the name from "Århus" to "Aarhus" in order to strengthen the international profile of the city. The renaming came into effect on 1 January 2011.

Certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city, such as the Aarhus River, changed from "Århus Å" to "Aarhus Å".<ref name="The Aarhus River"/> It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter Å and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative. Whichever spelling local authorities choose most newspapers and public institutions will accept it. Some official authorities such as the [[Dansk Sprognævn|Danish Language Committee]], publisher of the [[Retskrivningsordbogen|Danish Orthographic Dictionary]], still retain "Århus" as the main name, providing "Aarhus" as a new, second option, in brackets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dsn.dk/nyt/nyheder/2011/aarhus-eller-aarhus|title=Århus eller Aarhus?|year=2011|publisher=Danish Language Committee|language=Danish}}</ref>

[[File:Hørning-kirke1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Reconstruction of an early church at [[Moesgaard Museum]].]]

===Early history===
Founded in the early [[Viking Age]], Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, along with [[Ribe]] and [[Hedeby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Byhistoriske hovedtræk - Byens grundlæggelse|language=Danish|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

Achaeological evidence under the Aros settlement's defences indicate the site was a town as early as the last quarter of the 8th&nbsp;century, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed.<ref name="Kristeligt">{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/historie/vikingernes-aros-mellem-land-og-hav|title=Vikingernes Aros mellem land og hav|publisher=''Kristeligt Dagblad''|first=Claus |last=Grymer|date=1 June 2005|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/tidligaros.htm The earliest Århus] [http://www.moesgaardmuseum.dk/vikingemuseet/ The Viking Museum] {{da icon}}</ref> Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half buried [[longhouse]]s, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/norrevold.htm|title=Excavations - Nørrevold|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum (Moesgård Museum)|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/udgravninger.htm|title=Excavations|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum (Moesgård Museum)|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

The centre of Aarhus was once a [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of [[Frode]], King of Jutland, around 900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Aarhus_0045-0059.pdf|title=Kirkerne i Århus|publisher=Danmarks Kirker: Nationalmuseet|page=52|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> In the 900s an earth rampart for the defence of the early city was constructed, encircling the settlement, much like the defence structures found at [[Viking ring fortress|ring fortresses]] elsewhere. The rampart was later reinforced by [[Harald Bluetooth]], and together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military centre. There are strong indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in [[Viby J|Viby]], a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.<ref>[http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/viby.htm Vikingernes Aros] Vikingemuseet {{da icon}}</ref>

The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 948 when [[Adam of Bremen]] reported the bishop Reginbrand attended the [[synod of Ingelheim]] in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/aarhus-domkirke/?tx_historyview_pi1%5Blang%5D=1&cHash=a83dfe233ede9644167a9b5ea9aa35a4|title=Aarhus Cathedral|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_Oldtid/Yngre_Jernalder/Et_samfund_vendt_imod_havet_800-1050_e.Kr/By_efter_by|title=By efter by|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The bishopric and the town's geographical location propelled prosperous growth and development of the early medieval town.<ref name="Danmarkshistorien">{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/aarhus-1/?tx_historyview_pi1%5Blang%5D=1&cHash=42dfd94aaa459af3505372f8b2af029a|title=Aarhus|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> The finding of six [[runestone]]s in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000, as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/runesten.htm|title=Vikingernes Aros|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city, such as [[Harald Hardrada]]'s assault around 1050, when the Holy Trinity Church was burned to the ground.<ref name="Kristeligt"/><ref name="year">{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/the-viking-age-in-scandinavia/aarhus/#.U-4-s2OuSM0|title=Aarhus|publisher=Viking Ship Museum|date=2 December 2011|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Århus Katedral2.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Aarhus Cathedral (1300)]]
The growing influence of the Church during the [[Middle Ages]] gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the city; notably [[Aarhus Cathedral]] was initiated in the late 12th&nbsp;century by the influential bishop [[Peder Vognsen]]. In 1441 [[Christopher III]] issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the 12th&nbsp;century. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/%C3%85rhus_k%C3%B8bstads_privilegium|title=Stenbroen|publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|website=AarhusWiki|language=Danish|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>

The official and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthern ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were removed to accommodate expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/voldgraven.htm|title=The Moat|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Historien_om_Aarhus|title=Historien om Aarhus|language=Danish|publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early 16th&nbsp;century. In 1657 [[octroi]] was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, [[Mejlgade]] and [[Studsgade]]. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where [[merchant]] quarters were built.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/stenbro/side6.htm|title=Stenbroen|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|website=Aarhus Kommunes digitale korttjenester|language=Danish|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>

In the 17th&nbsp;century, Aarhus entered a period of recession as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish wars]] and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state.{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} It was not until the middle of the 18th&nbsp;century growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural [[catchment area]]s around the city; particularly [[grain]] proved to be a remunerative export.<ref name="Danmarkshistorien"/> The first factories were established at this time as the [[industrial revolution]] reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.<ref name=dcfb>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?koebstadID=74|title=Århus: Byhistorie|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

===Industrialisation===
[[File:Aarhus set fra bakkerne i Riis Skov.jpg|right|thumb|View of Aarhus, 1850]]
Following the [[Napoleonic wars]], Denmark lost Norway and was excluded from international trade for some years which caused a recession for Aarhus' trade based economy that lasted until the 1830s. The economy turned around as the [[industrial revolution]] reached the city and  factories with steam-driven machinery became more productive.

In 1838, the electoral laws were reformed leading to elections for the 15 seats on the city council. The rules were initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run. In the 1844 elections only 174 citizens qualified out of a total population of more than 7,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Byraadet/Byens-raad-dengang/Byens-raad-1838-1868.aspx|title=Byens raad 1838-1868|language=Danish|first=Aarhus |last=Kommune|website=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref> The first city council, mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the [[Aarhus River]]. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the city council, as it is to this day.<ref name="Byhistorie.dk">{{cite web|url=http://blog.byhistorie.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/I-medgang-og-modgang-rapport-over-udviklingen-af-den-moderne-havn-i-Aarhus-fra-o.-1840-2006.pdf|title=Rapport over udviklingen af den moderne havn i Aarhus fra o. 1840-2006|language=Danish|author =Byhistorie.dk|publisher=Byhistorie.dk|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>

During the [[First Schleswig War]] Aarhus was occupied by German troops from 21 June to 24 July 1849. The city was spared any fighting, but in [[Vejlby]] north of the city a cavalry skirmish known as [[Skirmish of Århus|Rytterfægtningen]] took place which stopped the German advance through Jutland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/AarhusStadsarkiv/Home/Servicesider/Nyheder/2014/3-kvartal/Ugens-Aarhushistorie-Rytterfaegtningen.aspx?sc_lang=da|title=Ugens Aarhushistorie - Rytterfægtningen|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|website=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|language=Danish|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets, particularly in [[Frederiksbjerg]], are named after Danish officers of the time. Fifteen years later, in 1864, the city was occupied again, this time for seven months, during the [[Second Schleswig War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/nyheder/1864-jylland-besat-af-tyske-tropper|title=1864 Jylland besat af tyske tropper|first=Ivan Freund |last=Nielsen|publisher=Aarhus Stiftstidende|language=Danish|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/perioder/det-unge-demokrati-1848-1901/treaarskrigen-1848-50-1-slesvigske-krig/|title=Det unge demokrati 1848-1901|publisher=Aarhus University|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|first=Erik Strange |last=Petersen|language=Danish|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>

In spite of wars and occupation the city continued to develop. In 1851 [[octroi]] was abolished and the city walls were removed to provide easier access for trade. Regular [[steamship]] links with Copenhagen had begun in 1830 and in 1862 Jutland's first railway was established between Aarhus and [[Randers]].<ref name="Byhistorie.dk"/>

[[File:Havne udsigt fra dokken.jpg|thumb|right|''Toldkammeret'' (Custom House, 1898)]]
In the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century industrialisation came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The [[Ceres Brewery]] was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: ''the Ceres-grounds'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceres.dk/Default.aspx?ID=25 |title=History|publisher=Ceres.dk|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoflev.dk/article.asp?id=134|title= Ceres Bryggerierne A/S|publisher=Hoflev.dk|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/ceres-grunden.asp|title=Ceres-grunden|language=Danish|publisher=Aarhusportalen (Jyllands-Posten)|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created [[Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet]] (KFK), focused on grain and [[Animal feed|feedstuffs]].

Aarhus became the largest provincial city in the country by the turn of the century and the city marketed itself as the "Capital of Jutland". The population increased from 15,000 in 1870 to 52,000 in 1901 and in response the city annexed large land areas to develop new residential quarters such as [[Trøjborg]], [[Frederiksbjerg]] and [[Marselisborg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/frederiksbjerg/side1.htm|title=Frederiksbjerg Øst - Århus|language=Danish|author =Magistratens 2.

===Second World War===
[[File:Danish resistance fighters injured during fighting with German troops in Aarhus, Bispetorv, 5 May, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Resistance fighters on Bispetorv fighting with German soldiers, 5 May 1945]]
On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark, occupying Aarhus the following day and 5 years hence. The occupation was a destructive period with major disasters, loss of life and economic depression. The [[Port of Aarhus]] became a hub for supplies to the [[Baltics]] and [[Norway]] while the surrounding rail network supplied the [[Atlantic Wall]] in west Jutland and cargo headed for Germany. Combined these factors resulted in a strong German presence, especially in 1944-45.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Den_tyske_bes%C3%A6ttelse|title=Aarhus Besættelse|publisher=[[Vester Allé 12#Aarhus City Archives|Aarhus City Archives]]|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> The first years were peaceful in conjunction with the policies of the Danish [[Denmark in World War II#Protectorate Government 1940–43|Protectorate Government]] but following the enactment of the [[Communist Law]] in August 1941 the first armed resistance commenced, gradually growing in intensity over the years with repression and terror in response.

Small, independent [[Danish resistance movement|resistance groups]] first appeared in 1941-42 but the first to coordinate with the [[Danish Freedom Council|Freedom Council]] was the [[Samsing Group]], responsible for most operations from early 1943.{{Sfn|Hansen|1946|p=13}}{{sfn|Alenius|2002|p=34}} The Samsing group, along with others in and around Aarhus, was dismantled in June 1944 when [[Grethe Bartram|Grethe "Thora" Bartram]] turned her family and acquaintances over to German authorities.{{Sfn|Kristensen|2010|p=52}} In response requests for assistance was sent to contacts in [[England]] and in October 1944 the [[Royal Air Force]] [[Aarhus Air Raid|bombed the Gestapo headquarters]] successfully destroying archives and obstructing the ongoing investigation.{{sfn|Zabecki|1999|pp=1350-1}}{{Sfn|Trenear-Harvey|2009|p=2}} The [[5 Kolonne]] group was established with assistance from [[Holger Danske (resistance group)|Holger Danske]] to restore a resistance movement in Aarhus along with the [[L-groups]], tasked with assasinating collaborators.{{sfn|Hauerbach|1945|p=8}} Resistance operations escalated from mid-1944 with most major sabotage operations and assassinations occurring in the period 1944-45.{{sfn|Hauerbach|1945|p=22}}{{sfn|Knudsen|2009|p=76}} The growing resistance was countered with 19 [[Schalburgtage]] terror operations by the [[Peter group|Peter Group]] from August 1944, including large-scale fire bombings and murders. The increasingly destructive occupation was compounded when an [[1944 explosion in Aarhus|ammunition barge exploded]] in 1944, destroying much of the harbor and damaging the inner city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/70-aar-siden-eksplosionen-paa-aarhus-havn|title=70 aar siden eksplosionen|publisher=[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref> On 5 May 1945 German forces in Denmark surrendered but during the transitional period fighting broke out in Aarhus between the resistance and German soldiers resulting in 22 dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE4463374/blodbad-pa-bispetorvet/|title=Blodbad på Bispetorvet|publisher=[[Jyllandsposten]]|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref> Order was restored by the end of the day and on 8 May the British [[1st The Royal Dragoons|Royal Dragoons]] entered the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/erindringer/indsendte/205.html|title=The Royal Dragoons ankomst til Danmark|publisher=5.

===Post-war years===
[[File:Aarhus docklands by night.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Urban development in Aarhus city centre, 2013]]
In the 1980s the city entered a period of rapid growth and the service sector overtook trade, industry and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time. Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/aarstal/|title=VIGTIGE ÅRSTAL|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; [[Gaffa (magazine)|Gaffa]] and the [[KaosPilot]] school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as [[TV-2 (band)|TV2]], [[Gnags]], [[Thomas Helmig]], [[Bamses Venner]], [[Anne Dorte Michelsen]], Mek Pek and [[Shit & Chanel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/aarhusrocks/|title=Aarhus Rocks|publisher=Den Gamle By|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nordeafonden.dk/aarhus-rocks-byen-og-musikken-1960-2014|title=Byen og Musikken 1960-2914|publisher=NordeaFonden|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/%C3%85rhus/%C3%85rhus_(Musikliv)|title=Aarhus - rytmisk musik|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>

Since the turn of the millennium both skyline and land use has changed as former industrial sites are being redeveloped into new city districts. Starting in 2007, the former docklands are being converted to a new mixed use district dubbed "Aarhus Ø" ([[Aarhus Docklands]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessaarhus.dk/da/Fremtidens-Aarhus/Udviklingsomraader/Aarhus-Oe.aspx|title=Business Aarhus, Aarhus Ø|publisher=Business Aarhus|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref> The site of the former [[Royal Unibrew]] [[Ceres Brewery|Ceres breweries]] began redevelopment in 2012 into "CeresByen", a residential district with educational institutions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ceresbyen.dk/ |title=CeresByen.dk|publisher=CeresByen |accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref> The former [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]] repair facilities at Frederiks Plads have been demolished and are being developed into a new business district with high-rise buildings scheduled for completion in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frederiksplads.dk/projekter/id%C3%A9en.aspx|title=Frederiks Plads|publisher=NCC Property Development A/S|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfmoller.com/g/Frederiks-Plads-ny-bydel-i-centrum-af-Aarhus-i13235.html|title=Frederiks Plads|publisher=C.

Accelerating growth since the early 2000s brought the inner urban area to roughly 260,000 inhabitants by 2014. The rapid growth is expected to continue until at least 2030 when Aarhus municipality has set an ambitious target for 375,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/aarhus/FremtidensAarhus1.aspx|title=Fremtidens Aarhus|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>

==Geography==
Aarhus is located at the [[Bay of Aarhus]] facing the [[Kattegat]] sea in the east with the peninsulas of [[Mols]] and [[Helgenæs]] across the bay to the northeast. Mols and Helgenæs are both part of the larger regional peninsula of [[Djursland]]. A number of larger cities and towns is within easy reach from Aarhus by road and rail, including [[Randers]] ({{convert|38.5|km}} by road north), [[Grenå]] (northeast), [[Horsens]] ({{convert|50|km}} south) and [[Silkeborg]] ({{convert|44|km}} east).<ref name="GM">{{Google maps|url=http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-is-it-between.htm|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref>

===Topography===
[[File:Egådalen (juli).jpg|thumb|right|Egådalen. A broad, flat valley, marking the northern city limits]]
At Aarhus' location, the Bay of Aarhus provides a natural harbour with a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} quite close to the shore.{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} Aarhus was founded at the mouth of a brackish water [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord]], but the original fjord no longer exists, as it has gradually narrowed into what is now the [[Aarhus River]] and the [[Brabrand Lake]], due to natural [[Sediment transport#Fluvial|sedimentation]]. The land around Aarhus was once covered by forests, remains of which exist in parts of [[Marselisborg Forest]] to the south and [[Riis Skov]] to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Riis_Skov|title=Riis Skov|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=28 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/museum-aarhus/malerier-fra-aarhus/marselisborgskovene/|title=Marselisborgskovene|publisher=Den Gamle By|accessdate=27 July 2014 }}</ref> Several larger lakes extend west from the [[Skanderborg]] railway junction and the landscape rises to heights exceeding {{convert|152|m|ft}} at [[Himmelbjerget]], forming part of the larger region called [[Søhøjlandet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Ud-i-naturen/Stier-og-ruter/6-infotavler-Vandreruten-Aarhus-Silkeborg.ashx|title=Vandreruten Aarhus-Silkeborg|publisher=Aarhus.dk|accessdate=1 August 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

The hilly area around Aarhus consists of a [[moraine|moranial plateau]] from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of [[tunnel valley]]s. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake and Tåstrup Sø (Tåstrup Lake) and the [[Egå|Egå Valley]] to the north, with the stream of [[Egå]]en, Kasted Mose (Kasted Bog) and Geding Sø (Geding Lake). Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, but recently some of the drainage was removed for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the Lyngbygård Å (Lyngbygård River) in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the [[quaternary|pre-quaternary]]. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late [[glacial meltwater valley]]s. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow [[tertiary]] clay from the [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] (57 to 24 million years ago).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/%C3%85rhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=19 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://extra.geus.info/web/nm-grundvand-brabrand-dalen.htm|title=Brabrand Dalen|publisher=[[Aarhus County]]|accessdate=9 April 2016|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ntsnet.dk/sites/default/files/%C3%85rhus%20%C3%85dal.pdf|title=Aarhus Ådal|publisher=[[Danish Ministry of Education]]|accessdate=9 April 2016|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Landskab og bebyggelse|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|accessdate=9 April 2016|language=Danish}}</ref>

Aarhus is in the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'') <ref name="WeatherOnline">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Denmark.htm|title=Denmark|publisher=WeatherOnline|accessdate=24 November 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> and the weather is influenced by [[low-pressure area|low-pressure systems]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.

Western winds from the Atlantic and [[North Sea]] are dominant resulting in more precipitation in western Denmark. In addition, Jutland rises sufficiently in the centre to lift air to higher, colder altitudes contributing to increased precipitation in eastern Jutland. Combined these factors make east and south Jutland comparatively wetter than other parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/arkiver/normaler-og-ekstremer/klimanormaler-dk|title=Klimanormaler|publisher=DMI|accessdate=23 November 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> Average temperature over the year is {{convert|8.43|°C|0}} with February being the coldest month (0.1&nbsp;°C) and August the warmest (15.9&nbsp;°C). Temperatures in the sea can reach 17 to 22 degrees Celsius in June to August, but it is not uncommon for beaches to register 25 degrees Celsius locally.<ref name="WeatherOnline"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ditdanmark.com/article.95.html|title=The climate in Denmark|publisher=DitDanmark|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>

The geography in the area affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. [[Brabrand Lake]] to the west further contributes to this effect and as a result the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining [[boulder clay]]. These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/%C3%85rhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=23 November 2014|language=Danish}}</ref>

Because of the northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|title=Sol op/ned |publisher=Almanak|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

Aarhus Municipality and the city council have attacked the challenges from different angles in a constructive collaboration with private partners. Many new underground rainwater basins have been built across the city in recent years. The two lakes of [[Brabrand Lake|Årslev Engsø]] and [[Egå Engsø]] were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. Large expanses of forest have been planted in vulnerable land areas in order to secure drinking water and avoid groundwater pollution from [[pesticides]] and other sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Park-og-skov/PDF-Vedr-skove/skovudviklingsplan-2010-2020.pdf|title=Skovudviklingsplan 2010-2020|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=1 August 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> Since 1988, the [[New Forests of Aarhus]] have been developed to assist in [[carbon sequestration|binding CO2]], securing [[drinking water]], protecting [[groundwater]] from pollution, dealing with [[Nutrient pollution|excessive nutrients]], increasing [[biodiversity]], creating an attractive countryside, providing easy access to nature and offering outdoor activities to the public. The [[afforestation]] plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda, and there are new afforestation objectives to double the forest cover in Aarhus municipality, before the year 2030.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal/Attraktiv-by/Nye-skove-sikrer-drikkevand-natur-og-friluftsliv.aspx?sc_lang=da|title=Woodland Target 2030|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>

The city is home to 75 different religious groups and denominations most of which are Christian or Muslim with a smaller number of Buddhist and Hindu communities.

==Economy==
[[File:De fem søstre i århus perspetiv korrekt.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Silos from 1927 known as the "[[Five Sisters (Aarhus)|Five Sisters]]"]]
The economy of Aarhus is predominantly knowledge and service based, strongly influenced by the [[University of Aarhus]] and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/erhverv.aspx?koebstadID=74|title=Danmarks Købsteder: Århus|publisher=Den digitale byport|accessdate=8 December 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 in the private sector and the rest split between state, region and municipality.<ref name="Aarhus Kommune"/> The region is a major [[agriculture|agricultural producer]], with many large farms in the outlying districts.<ref name="Aarhus: Economy">{{cite web|url=http://bcg.thetimes.co.uk/Europe/Denmark/Aarhus#/Europe/Denmark/Aarhuseconomy|title=Aarhus: Economy|publisher=''The Times''|accessdate=23 July 2014 }}</ref>

The Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in [[northern Europe]] with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world.<ref name=aarhushavn>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/about_port_of_aarhus.htm|title=About Port of Aarhus|publisher=Aarhus Havn|accessdate=16 July 2014 }}</ref><ref name="Signe Ferslev Pedersen">{{cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/transport/maersk-arving-vil-kapre-mere-gods-til-aarhus|title=Mærsk-arving vil kapre mere gods til Aarhus |author =Signe Ferslev Pedersen|publisher=''Berlingske''|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5 million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while [[animal feed|feedstuff]]s, stone, cement and [[coal]] are among the chief imports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/cargo_statistics/cargo_statistics.htm|title=Cargo statistics|publisher=Aarhus Havn|accessdate=21 July 2014 }}</ref> Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the [[Port of Hamburg]] and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008.<ref name="Signe Ferslev Pedersen"/>

The ferry terminal presents the only alternative to the [[Great Belt Link]] for passenger transport between Jutland and [[Zealand]]. It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830. Currently [[Mols-Linien]] operates the route and annually transports some 2 million passengers and a million vehicles. Additional [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargo ferries serve [[Finland]] and [[Kalundborg]] on a weekly basis and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals. Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/download/formularer/aarsrapport2013.pdf|publisher=Aarhus Havn|title=Aarsrapport 2013|accessdate=9 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as 750,000 a year, most of them Danes from other regions, the remainder coming mainly from Norway, Sweden, northern Germany and the United Kingdom. Overall, they spend about DKK 3 billion ($540 million) in the city each year.<ref name="kulturturisme.dk">{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturturisme.dk/media/507561/Aarhus-som-kulturel-city-break-destination-final_med_logo.pdf|title=Aarhus som kulturel city destination|publisher=kulturturisme.dk|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or as a part of a round trip in Denmark.

There are more than 30 tourist information spots across the city, some of them staffed, while others are on-line, publicly accessible touch screens. The official tourist information service in Aarhus is organised under VisitAaarhus, a corporate foundation initiated in 1994 by Aarhus Municipality and local commercial interest organisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/denmark/tourist-in-aarhus|title=Tourist Information|publisher=VisitAarhus|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.dk/aarhus/om-visitaarhus|title=Om VisitAarhus|publisher=VisitAarhus|language=Danish|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.test2.rm.dk/politik/regionsr%C3%A5dets+m%C3%B8der/visdagsorden?file=23-09-2009/Aaben_dagsorden/Bilag/Punkt_32_Bilag_2___.pdf|publisher=Region Midtjylland|title=Vedtægter for VisitAarhus|language=Danish|date=18 January 2005|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>

==Cityscape==
{{See also|Architecture of Aarhus}}
{{wide image|Panorama of Aarhus.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of the Aarhus skyline seen from the top of [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS]].}}
Aarhus has developed in stages, from the Viking age to modern times, all visible in the city today. Many architectural styles are represented in different parts of the city such as [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[National Romantic Style|National Romantic]], [[Nordic Classicism|Nordic classicism]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[empire style|Empire]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Arkitektur og byggeskik i byen|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=14 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the harbour and later the railway station and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.

The streets Volden (lit ''Rampart'') and Graven (lit. ''Moat'') testify to the defences of the initial Viking settlement and ''Allégaderingen'' in [[Midtbyen, Aarhus|Midtbyen]] roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network in the [[Midtbyen (Aarhus)|inner city]] formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. ''Vesterport'' (lit. ''Western Gate'') still bears the name of a medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways ''Posthussmøgen'' and ''Telefonsmøgen'' are remnants of toll stations from that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reader.livedition.dk/aarhuskommune/188/|title=Kulturhistorisk redegørelse 2013|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=14 December 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> The inner city has the oldest preserved houses, especially the [[Latinerkvarteret, Aarhus|Latin Quarter]], with buildings dating back to the early 17th&nbsp;century in [[Mejlgade]] and [[Skolegade]].{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in [[Klostergade]], [[Studsgade]] and Skolegade.

Vendors of street food are numerous throughout the centre, often selling from small trailers on permanent locations formally known as ''[[Pølsevogn]]e'' (lit. sausage wagons), traditionally serving a Danish variety of [[hot dogs]], sausages and other [[fast food]]. There are increasingly more outlets inspired by other cultural flavours such as [[sushi]], [[Doner kebab|kebab]] and [[currywurst]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.krak.dk/p%C3%B8lsevogne/%C3%A5rhus/s%C3%B8g.cs|title=Pølsevogne i Aarhus|publisher=Krak.dk|language=Danish|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhusupdate.dk/takeaway-fra-ginza-sushi-ingen-snak-og-fin-value-money/|title=Takeaway fra Ginza Sushi|publisher=Aarhus Update|language=Danish|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref>

Aarhus has a robust and diverse nightlife that tends to concentrate in the inner city, but not exclusively. The nightlife offers everything from small joints with cheap alcohol and a homely atmosphere to fashionable night clubs serving champagne and cocktails and small or large music venues with bars, dance floors and lounges. Well established places where you can have a drink and socialise, include the relaxed ''Ris Ras Filliongongong'' offering [[hookah|waterpipes]] and an award winning beer selection, ''Fatter Eskild'' where you can experience a broad selection of Danish bands playing mostly blues and rock, the [[wine bar|wine]] and [[book café]] of ''Løve's'' in Nørregade, ''Sherlock Holmes'', a British-style [[pub]] with live music, the [[brew pub]] of ''Sct. Clemens'' with [[A Hereford Beefstouw]] restaurant and ''Thorups Kælder'', a tavern located in rooms built by [[Cistercian]] monks in the 1300s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loeves.dk/bogcafe/omtale.php|title=Omtale|publisher=Loeves|language=Danish|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ale.dk/index.php?id=495|title=Serving in Aarhus|publisher=Danske Ølentusiaster (Aarhus C)|language=Danish|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Porter|Prince|2007|p=372}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoa.dk/natteliv/thorups-kaelder|title=AoA Thorups Kælder|publisher=AoA|language=Danish|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref>

The ''Århus Set'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Århus Sæt) is a set of drinks often ordered together, named for the city and consisting of two beverages, one [[Ceres Brewery|Ceres Top]] beer and one shot [[Arnbitter]], both originally from Aarhus. Ordering "a set" suffices in most bars and pubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/nationalt/et-aarhus-saet-er-ikke-laengere-fra-aarhus |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6eavKKeQ0|archive-date=15 January 2016|title=Et »Aarhus-sæt« er ikke længere fra Aarhus|publisher=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|language=Danish|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv2oj.dk/artikel/239834:Aarhus--Arnbitter-forlader-Aarhus |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/archive.php|archive-date=15 January 2016|title=Arnbitter forlader Aarhus|publisher=TV2 Østjylland|language=Danish|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref> Aarhus Bryghus is a local [[microbrewery]] with a sizeable production.

===Local dialect===
The Aarhus Danish dialect, commonly called ''Aarhusiansk'' ([[Literal translation|Lit.]]: ''Aarhusian''), is a [[Jutlandic dialect]] ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Jysk) in the [[Danish dialects|Mid-Eastern Jutland dialect area]], traditionally spoken in and around Aarhus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/jysk/ |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6eak3iK3G|archive-date=15 January 2016| title=Jysk|publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]]|language=Danish|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref> Aarhusian, as most local dialects in Denmark, has diminished in use through the 20th century and most people today speak some version of Standard Danish with regional features although it still has a strong presence in older segments of the population and in areas with high numbers of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE1852264/saarn-bevarer-etniske-unge-aarhusiansk-ikkaa/ |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6eakufFAw|archive-date=15 January 2016|title=Saarn bevarer etniske unge ikkaa|publisher=[[Politiken]]|language=Danish|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/dagens-portraet/hun-fandt-den-aarhusianske-dialekt-i-aarhus-v |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ealB7CWw|archive-date=15 January 2016|title=Hun fandt den Aarhusianske dialekt i Aarhus V|publisher=[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|language=Danish|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/vi-snakker-mindre-aarhusiansk-do |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ealHbWPb|archive-date=15 January 2016|title=Vi snakker mindre Aarhusiansk do|publisher=[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|language=Danish|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref>

Common or traditional Aarhusian words are: træls (tiresome), noller (silly or dumb) and dælme ([[Phrasal exclamation|Excl]]. damn me).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information.dk/284790 |title=Aarhus — engelsk for noller|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ealV4Iqr|archive-date=15 January 2016|publisher=[[Dagbladet Information]]|language=Danish|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://odt.hum.ku.dk/dokumenter/Glargaard__Amalie.__2014_._Tr_ls_-_dialekt_eller_standardsprog._Eksamensopgave.pdf |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6eannJkqR|archive-date=15 January 2016|title=Træls - dialekt eller standardsprog|publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]]|language=Danish|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref> The dialect is notable for single syllable words ending in "d" being pronounced with [[stød]] while the same letter in multiple syllable words is pronounced as "j", i.e.. [[Odder]] is pronounced "Ojjer". Like other dialects in East Jutland it has two [[grammatical gender]]s, similar to Standard Danish, but different from West Jutlandic dialects which have only one.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/da/publications/aarhusiansk--byens-sprog-foer-og-nu(eb13f420-ae37-11dc-89ab-000ea68e967b).html |title=Århusiansk – byens sprog før og nu|last=Borchmann|first=Simon|chapter=4|page=|year=2009|publisher=Aarhus Universitetsforlag|isbn=978-87-7934-436-5}}</ref>

In 2009 the University of Aarhus compiled a list of contemporary public figures, who best exemplify the dialect, including [[Jacob Haugaard]], [[Thomas Helmig]], [[Steffen Brandt]], [[Stig Tøfting]], [[Flemming Jørgensen]], [[Tina Dickow]] and [[Camilla Martin]]. In popular culture the dialect features prominently in [[Niels Malmros]]' movie ''Aarhus By Night'' and 90s comedy sketches by Jacob Haugaard and [[Finn Nørbygaard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jysk.au.dk/fileadmin/www.jysk.au.dk/publikationer/centrets_publikationer/Aarhusiansk.pdf|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6eake5xNr|archive-date=15 January 2016|title=Aarhusiansk|publisher=[[University of Aarhus]]|language=Danish|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref>

==Media==
[[File:Soesterhoej.jpg|thumb|The Aarhus [[Søsterhøj]] TV tower, height {{convert|261|m|abbr=on}}]]
The first daily newspaper to appear in Aarhus was ''[[Århus Stiftstidende]]'', established in 1794 as ''Aarhuus Stifts Adresse-Contoirs Tidender'', with a moderately conservative approach. Once one of Denmark's largest,{{sfn|Cremo|2010|p=230}} it was a leading provincial newspaper for a time, but after the Second World War it increasingly faced competition from ''[[Demokraten (1873)|Demokraten]]'' (1884-1974) and ''Jyllands-Posten'', both published in Aarhus. In 1998, it merged with ''Randers Amtsavis'' and is now run by Midtjyske Medier, part of [[Berlingske Media]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Massemedier/Medier_og_dagblade,_Danmark/%C3%85rhus_Stiftstidende|title=Århus Stiftstidende|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=21 July 2014 }}</ref> The daily newspaper of ''Jyllandsposten'' (today known as ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'') was established in 1871 in Aarhus, and takes a generally right-wing editorial approach. With a reputation as a serious news publication, the paper has always included news from [[Jutland]] in particular, but somewhat less so since its promotion as a national newspaper (''Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten'') in the 1960s. Today it is one of the three leading serious newspapers in Denmark, the others being ''[[Berlingske]]'' and ''[[Politiken]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Massemedier/Medier_og_dagblade,_Danmark/Jyllands-Posten|title=Jyllands-Posten|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=21 July 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> Jyllands-Posten publishes ''JP Aarhus'', a section dedicated to news in and around Aarhus, and the free cityguide website of ''Aarhusportalen'' (The Aarhus Portal).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/|title=JP Aarhus|publisher=Jyllands-Posten|accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/|title=Aarhusportalen|publisher=Jyllands-Posten|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> The Copenhagen-based media company of ''Politiken'', also publishes several free local papers once a week in parts of Denmark and Sweden.
