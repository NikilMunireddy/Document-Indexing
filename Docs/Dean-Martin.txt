'''Dean Paul Martin''' (born '''Dino Paul Crocetti'''; June 7, 1917 – December 25, 1995) was an American singer, actor, comedian, and film producer.

One of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century, Martin was nicknamed the "King Of Cool" for his seemingly effortless charisma and  self-assurance.<ref>{{cite web|author=mike says:|url=http://blog.blogtalkradio.com/celebrities/dean-martins-diva-daughter-elvis-called-dad-the-king-cool/|title=Dean Martin's Diva Daughter: Elvis Called My Dad 'The King of Cool'|publisher=Blog.blogtalkradio.com|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/245966#survey "Dean Martin 'just a golfer' to his kids"], thestar.com</ref> He and [[Jerry Lewis]] were partners in the immensely popular comedy team "[[Martin and Lewis]]". He was a member of the "[[Rat Pack]]" and a star in concert stage/[[nightclub]]s, recordings, motion pictures, and television. He was the host of the television variety program ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' (1965–1974) and ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' (1974–1985).

Martin's relaxed, warbling [[Crooner|crooning]] voice earned him dozens of hit singles including his signature songs "[[Memories Are Made of This]]", "[[That's Amore]]", "[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]", "[[You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You]]", "[[Sway (song)|Sway]]", "[[Volare (song)|Volare]]", and "[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]".

==Early life==
[[File:Dean Martin Mural in Steubenville.jpg|left|thumb|Mural of Dean Martin in Steubenville, Ohio]]

Martin was born on June 7, 1917 in [[Steubenville, Ohio]], to an [[Italians|Italian]] father, Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894–1967), and an Italian-American mother, Angela Crocetti (née Barra; 1899–1966). They were married in 1914. His father, who was a barber, was originally from [[Montesilvano]], in [[Abruzzo]], and his maternal grandparents' origins are believed to be also from [[Abruzzo]] even if it is not clearly known. Martin had an older brother named William Alfonso Crocetti (1916-1968).{{Citation needed|date=August 2014|reason=Not Guglielmo or William?}} Martin's first language was an [[Neapolitan language|Abruzzese]] dialect of Italian, and he did not speak English until he started school at the age of 5. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville where he was bullied for his broken English. He later took up the drums as a hobby as a teenager. Martin then dropped out of [[Steubenville High School]] in the [[tenth grade|10th grade]] because he thought he was smarter than his teachers.<ref name=HOLLYWOODSONGSTERS>{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert|title=Hollywood Songsters: Singers Who ACT and Actors Who Sing: A Biographical Dictionary Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-94333-8|page=533}}</ref> He [[Rum-running|bootlegged liquor]], served as a [[speakeasy]] [[croupier]], was a [[blackjack]] dealer, worked in a [[steel mill]] and boxed as a [[welterweight]].

At 15 he was a [[boxing|boxer]] who billed himself as "Kid Crochet".  His prizefighting earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, many broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford tape used to wrap boxers' hands), and a bruised body. Of his 12 bouts, he said: "I won all but 11."<ref>Tosches, Nick. ''Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams''. Vintage, London, 1999, page 57. ISBN 0-7493-9897-3</ref> For a time, he roomed with [[Sonny King (singer)|Sonny King]], who, like Martin, was starting in show business and had little money. It is said that Martin and King held bare-knuckle matches in their apartment, fighting until one was knocked out; people paid to watch. Martin knocked out King in the first round of an amateur boxing match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing-scoop.com/show_boxer.php?boxer_ID=11280 |title=Dean Martin Amateur Boxing Record|publisher=Boxing-Scoop.com|date=1917-06-07|accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref>

Martin gave up boxing to work as a [[roulette]] stickman and [[croupier]] in an illegal [[casino]] behind a [[tobacco shop]], where he had started as a stock boy. At the same time he sang with local bands, calling himself "Dino Martini" (after the Metropolitan Opera tenor, [[Nino Martini]]). He got his break working for the [[Ernie McKay Orchestra]]. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills (of the [[Mills Brothers]]), among others. In the early 1940s, he started singing for bandleader [[Sammy Watkins (musician)|Sammy Watkins]], who suggested he change his name to Dean Martin.

In October 1941 Martin married Elizabeth ("Betty") Anne McDonald, they had four children, and the marriage ended in 1949.  Martin worked for various bands throughout the early 1940s, mostly on looks and personality until he developed his own singing style. Martin flopped at the Riobamba, a nightclub in New York,<ref>"Two New to Biz Take Over Riobamba." ''The Billboard'', New York, New York, September 16, 1944, page 24. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uQwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT23 Link to scanned copy online].</ref> when he followed [[Frank Sinatra]] in 1943, but it was the setting for their meeting.

Martin was drafted into the [[United States Army]] in 1944 during [[World War II]], serving a year in [[Akron, Ohio]]. He was reclassified as [[4F (military conscription)|4-F]] and discharged (possibly because of a double [[hernia]]; [[Jerry Lewis]] referred to the surgery Martin needed for this in his autobiography).

By 1946 Martin was doing well, but he was little more than an East Coast nightclub singer with a common style, similar to that of [[Bing Crosby]].

==Career==

===Teaming with Jerry Lewis===
{{Main|Martin and Lewis}}
[[File:Lewis and Martin.jpg|thumb|<center>[[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] c. 1950</center>]]
Martin attracted the attention of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming. He met comic [[Jerry Lewis]] at the Glass Hat Club in [[New York City|New York]], where both were performing. [[Martin and Lewis]] formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team.

Martin and Lewis's debut together occurred at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]'s 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to "go for broke", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material.<ref>Ambalal, Monica. The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition. University of Michigan. Oxford University Press, Inc. 2013</ref> Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with breadrolls. They did slapstick, reeled off old [[vaudeville]] jokes, and did whatever else popped into their heads. The audience laughed. This success led to a series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York's [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both said, is that they ignored the audience and played to each other.

The team made its TV debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (then called "TheToast Of The Town") on June 20, 1948 with composers [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] also appearing. A [[The Martin and Lewis Show (radio program)|radio series]] began in 1949, the year Martin and Lewis signed with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] as comedy relief for the movie ''[[My Friend Irma (film)|My Friend Irma]]''.
[[File:Dean Martin Jerry Lewis 1955 Colgate Comedy Hour.JPG|right|thumb|<center>[[Martin and Lewis]] in 1955<center>]]
Their agent, Abby Greshler, negotiated one of Hollywood's best deals: although they received only $75,000 between them for their films with Wallis, Martin and Lewis were free to do one outside film a year, which they would co-produce through their own York Productions. They also controlled their club, record, radio and television appearances, and through these they earned millions of dollars.

In ''Dean & Me'', Lewis calls Martin one of the great comic geniuses of all time. But harsh comments from critics, as well as frustration with the similarity of Martin and Lewis movies, which producer Hal Wallis refused to change, led to Martin's dissatisfaction.<ref name=DEANANDME>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Jerry|title=Dean and Me: (A Love Story)|year=2005|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-7679-2086-5|page=223}}</ref> He put less enthusiasm into the work, leading to escalating arguments with Lewis. Martin told his partner he was "nothing to me but a dollar sign". The act broke up in 1956, 10 years to the day from the first teaming.

Martin's first solo film, ''[[Ten Thousand Bedrooms]]'' (1957), was a box office failure. He was still popular as a singer, but with [[rock and roll]] to the fore, the era of the pop crooner was waning.

===Solo career===
[[File:Dean Martin portrait.jpg|thumb|Dean Martin in the film ''[[Ada (film)|Ada]]'' (1961)]]
Martin wanted to become a real actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films. Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'' (1958), his part would be with [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Montgomery Clift]]. [[Tony Randall]] already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in night clubs, films and records. Martin replaced Randall and the film turned out to be the beginning of Martin's comeback.

Martin starred alongside [[Frank Sinatra]] for the first time in an acclaimed [[Vincente Minnelli]] drama, ''[[Some Came Running (1958 film)|Some Came Running]]'' (1958). By the mid-1960s, Martin was a movie, recording, television and nightclub star, while Lewis' film career declined. Martin was acclaimed as Dude in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959), directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and also starring [[John Wayne]] and singer [[Ricky Nelson]]. He would team again with Wayne in ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]'' (1965), cast as brothers.

In 1960, Martin was cast in the film version of the [[Judy Holliday]] stage musical comedy ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]''. He won a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance in the 1960 film comedy ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]'' but continued to seek dramatic roles, portraying a Southern politician in 1961's ''[[Ada (film)|Ada]]'' and starring in 1963's screen adaptation of an intense stage drama, ''[[Toys in the Attic (1963 film)|Toys in the Attic]]'', opposite [[Geraldine Page]].

He and Sinatra teamed up for several more movies, the crime caper ''[[Ocean's 11]]'', the musical ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' and the western comedies ''[[Sergeants 3]]'' and ''[[4 for Texas]]'', some featuring their so-called [[Rat Pack]] pals [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]] and [[Joey Bishop]], as well as a romantic comedy, ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]''. Martin also co-starred with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in a number of films, including ''Some Came Running'', ''[[Artists and Models]]'', ''[[Career (1959 film)|Career]]'', ''[[All in a Night's Work (film)|All in a Night's Work]]'' and ''[[What a Way to Go!]]''

He played a satiric variation of his own womanizing persona as Las Vegas singer "Dino" in [[Billy Wilder]]'s comedy ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]'' (1964) with [[Kim Novak]], and he poked fun at his image in films such as the ''[[Matt Helm]]'' [[spy]] [[parody|spoofs]] of the 1960s, in which he was a co-producer. In the third Matt Helm film ''[[The Ambushers (film)|The Ambushers]]'' (1967), Helm, about to be executed, receives a last cigarette and tells the provider, "I'll remember you from the great beyond," continuing ''sotto voce'', "somewhere around Steubenville, I hope."
[[File:Dean Martin - Rio Bravo 1959.jpg|thumb|In ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'']]
As a singer, Martin copied the styles of Harry Mills (of the [[Mills Brothers]]), [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Perry Como]] until he developed his own and could hold his own in duets with Sinatra and Crosby. Like [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]], he could not read music, but he recorded more than 100 albums and 600 songs. His signature tune, "[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]", knocked [[the Beatles]]' "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]" off number one in the United States in 1964. This was followed by "The Door is Still Open to My Heart", which reached number six that year. [[Elvis Presley]] was said to have been influenced by Martin, and patterned "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]" after his style.

Martin, like Elvis, was influenced by [[country music]]. By 1965, some of Martin's albums, such as ''Dean "Tex" Martin,'' ''The Hit Sound of Dean Martin,'' ''Welcome to My World'' and ''Gentle On My Mind'', were composed of country and western songs by artists such as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Buck Owens]]. Martin hosted country performers on his TV show and was named "Man Of the Year" by the [[Country Music Association]] in 1966.

But the image of Martin as a Vegas entertainer in a tuxedo has been an enduring one. "[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]", a song Martin performed in ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'', did not become a hit at the time, but has enjoyed a revival in the media and pop culture.

For three decades, Martin was among the most popular acts in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Martin sang and was one of the smoothest comics in the business, benefiting from the decade of comedy with Lewis. Martin's daughter, Gail, also sang in Vegas and on his TV show, co-hosting his summer replacement series on NBC. Daughter Deana and son Ricci are singers who continue to perform. Eldest son Craig was a producer on Martin's television show and daughter Claudia was an actress in films such as ''[[For Those Who Think Young (film)|For Those Who Think Young]]''. Though often thought of as a ladies' man, Martin spent a lot of time with his family; as second wife Jeanne put it, prior to the couple's divorce, "He was home every night for dinner."

===The Rat Pack===
[[File:Ocean's Eleven1960.jpg|thumb|''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'' with [[Buddy Lester]], [[Joey Bishop]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and Dean Martin.]]
{{Main|Rat Pack}}
As Martin's solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends [[Joey Bishop]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] formed the [[Rat Pack]], so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the [[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles|Holmby Hills]] Rat Pack centered on [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], of which Sinatra had been a member.
(The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as "The Summit" or "The Clan" and never as "The Rat Pack", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination.) The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President [[John F. Kennedy]]).

The Rat Pack was legendary for its [[Las Vegas Strip]] performances. For example, the marquee at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] might read DEAN MARTIN—MAYBE FRANK—MAYBE SAMMY. Their appearances were valuable because the city would flood with wealthy gamblers. Their act (always in tuxedo) consisted of each singing individual numbers, duets and trios, along with seemingly improvised slapstick and chatter. In the socially charged 1960s, their jokes revolved around adult themes, such as Sinatra's womanizing and Martin's drinking, as well as Davis's race and religion. Sinatra and Martin supported the civil rights movement and refused to perform in clubs that would not allow African-American or Jewish performers.<ref name=FRANKSINATRA-NANCY>{{cite book|last=Sinatra|first=Nancy|title=Frank Sinatra: An American Legend|year=1998|publisher=Readers Digest Assn|isbn=978-0-7621-0134-4|page=156}}</ref>

Posthumously, the Rat Pack has experienced a popular revival, inspiring the [[George Clooney]]/[[Brad Pitt]] "Ocean's" trilogy.

===''The Dean Martin Show''===
[[File:Dean Martin Florence Henderson 1958.JPG|thumb|right|Martin and [[Florence Henderson]] in ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' (1968)]]
In 1965, Martin launched his weekly [[NBC]] comedy-variety series, ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk [[crooner]], hitting on women with remarks that would get anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]]. During an interview on the British TV documentary ''Wine, Women and Song'', aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them.

His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend [[Greg Garrison]], made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership is the subject of a lawsuit brought by [[NBCUniversal]].

Despite Martin's reputation as a drinker – perpetuated via his vanity license plate "DRUNKY" – he masked his self-discipline.<ref>[[Richard Metzger|Metzger, Richard]] (July 8, 2011), [http://www.dangerousminds.net/index.php/comments/richard_metzger_the_time_i_met_dean_martin/ "Richard Metzger: The time I met Dean Martin"], Dangerous Minds, retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref> He was often the first to call it a night, and when not on tour or on a film location, liked to go home to see his wife and children.   He borrowed the lovable-drunk [[shtick]] from [[Joe E. Lewis]], but his convincing portrayals of heavy boozers in ''[[Some Came Running]]'' and Howard Hawks's ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' led to unsubstantiated claims of [[alcoholism]].

Martin starred in and co-produced four [[Matt Helm]] [[superspy]] comedy adventures during this time, as well as a number of [[Westerns]].

By the early 1970s, ''The Dean Martin Show'' was still earning solid ratings, and although he was no longer a Top 40 hitmaker, his record albums continued to sell. He found a way to make his passion for golf profitable by offering a signature line golf balls and the [[Dean Martin Tucson Open]] was an event on golf's [[PGA Tour]] from 1972–75. At his death, Martin was reportedly the single largest minority shareholder of RCA stock.

Now comfortable financially, Martin began reducing his schedule. The final (1973–74) season of his variety show would be retooled into one of celebrity roasts, requiring less involvement. After the show's cancellation, NBC continued to air ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' format in a series of TV specials through 1984. In those 11 years, Martin and his panel of pals made fun of stars in this order: [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[William Conrad]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Barry Goldwater]], [[Johnny Carson]], [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Carroll O'Connor]], [[Monty Hall]], [[Jack Klugman]] & [[Tony Randall]], [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], [[Leo Durocher]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Bobby Riggs]], [[George Washington]], [[Dan Rowan]] & [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]], [[Hank Aaron]], [[Joe Namath]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Telly Savalas]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Michael Landon]], [[Evel Knievel]], [[Valerie Harper]], [[Muhammad Ali]], Dean Martin himself, [[Dennis Weaver]], [[Joe Garagiola]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Gabe Kaplan]], [[Ted Knight]], [[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]], [[Dan Haggerty]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Jack Klugman]], [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]], [[George Burns]], [[Betty White]], [[Suzanne Somers]], [[Joan Collins]], [[Kent McCord]], [[Martin Milner]], and [[Mr. T]].

===Later career===
For nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for [[Reprise Records]]. That stopped in November 1974, when Martin recorded his final Reprise album, ''Once In A While'', which was released in 1978. His last recordings were for Warner Brothers Records. An album titled ''The Nashville Sessions'' was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with "(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song", which was recorded with [[Conway Twitty]] and made a respectable showing on the country charts. A follow-up single, "L.A. Is My Home" / "Drinking Champagne", came in 1985.

The 1975 film drama ''[[Mr. Ricco]]'' marked Martin's final starring role, in which he played a criminal defense lawyer. He played a featured role in the 1981 comedy ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' and its sequel, both starring [[Burt Reynolds]].

In 1972, he filed for divorce from his second wife, Jeanne. A week later, his business partnership with the Riviera dissolved amid reports of the casino's refusal to agree to Martin's request to perform only once a night. He was taken by the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], where he was the featured performer on the hotel's opening night December 23, 1973, and also signed a three-picture deal with MGM Studios. Less than a month after his second marriage had dissolved, Martin married 26-year-old Catherine Hawn, on April 25, 1973. Hawn had been the receptionist at the chic Gene Shacrove hair salon in Beverly Hills. They divorced November 10, 1976. He was also briefly engaged to [[Gail Renshaw]], [[Miss World]]–U.S.A. 1969.

Eventually, Martin reconciled with Jeanne, though they never remarried. He also made a public reconciliation with [[Jerry Lewis]] on Lewis' [[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon|Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon]] in 1976. [[Frank Sinatra]] shocked Lewis by bringing Martin out on stage. As Martin and Lewis embraced, the audience cheered and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years. Lewis reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, "So, you working?" Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was "at the Meggum" (meaning the MGM Grand). This, with the death of Martin's son [[Dean Paul Martin]] more than a decade later, helped bring the two men together. They maintained a quiet friendship, but only performed again once, in 1989, on Martin's 72nd birthday.<ref name=Talevski>{{cite book|last=Talevski|first=Nick|title=Knocking on Heaven's Door: Rock Obituaries|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-84609-091-2|page=399}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Martin was married three times. Subsequent to the divorce of his first wife, Elizabeth Anne "Betty" McDonald, Martin gained custody of their children; Betty lived out her life in quiet obscurity in San Francisco. They had four children; Craig Martin (born 1942), Claudia Martin (born March 16, 1944, died 2001 of [[breast cancer]]), Gail Martin (born 1945) and [[Deana Martin]] (born 1948).

Martin's second wife was Jeanne Biegger, a former [[Orange Bowl]] queen from [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. Their marriage lasted 24 years (1949–1973) and had three children: [[Dean Paul Martin]] (November 17, 1951 – March 21, 1987;
jet fighter crash), Ricci Martin (born 1953) and Gina Martin (born 1956). Her marriage made Martin the [[Parent-in-law|father-in-law]] of [[the Beach Boys]]' [[Carl Wilson]]. Figure skater [[Dorothy Hamill]] and actress [[Olivia Hussey]] were his daughters-in-law during their marriages to Dean Paul Martin.

Martin's third marriage to Catherine Hawn lasted three years. Martin initiated the divorce proceedings. Martin adopted Hawn's daughter, Sasha. Martin's uncle was [[Leonard Barr]], who appeared in several of his shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famousquotes.me.uk/epitaphs/13.htm|title=Famous Epitaph on Dean Martin tomb stone|publisher=Famousquotes.me.uk|accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref>

In the 1960s and early 1970s he lived at [[363 Copa De Oro Road]] in Bel Air, Los Angeles,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Movieland Directory: Nearly 30,000 Addresses of Celebrity Homes, Film Locations and Historical Sites in the Los Angeles Area, 1900-Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIEwCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA111|date=10 August 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0432-9|pages=111–}}</ref> before selling it to [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] for $500,000 in June 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/welsh-homes/8000-semi-6m-bel-air-8631385|title=From the £8,000 semi to $6m Bel Air mansion, inside the houses Sir Tom Jones has called home|publisher=''Wales Online''|date=12 February 2015|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>

===Later years and end of career===
Martin returned to films briefly with appearances in the two star-laden, critically panned but commercially successful ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' movies. He also had a minor hit single with "[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]" and made his first music video, which appeared on [[MTV]]. The video was created by Martin's youngest son, Ricci.

On March 21, 1987, Martin's son, actor [[Dean Paul Martin]] (formerly Dino of the 1960s "[[teenybopper|teeny-bopper]]" rock group [[Dino, Desi & Billy]]), died when his [[F-4 Phantom II]] jet fighter crashed while flying with the [[California Air National Guard]].

Later, a tour with Davis and Sinatra in 1988 sputtered. Martin, who responded best to a club audience, felt lost in the huge stadiums they were performing in at Sinatra's insistence, and he was not interested in drinking until dawn after performances. His final Vegas shows were at Bally's Hotel in 1990. There he had his final reunion with [[Jerry Lewis]] on his 72nd birthday. Martin's last two TV appearances involved tributes to his former [[Rat Pack]] members. On December 8, 1989, he joined stars in Sammy Davis Jr's 60th anniversary celebration, which aired a few weeks before Davis died from throat cancer. In December 1990, he congratulated [[Frank Sinatra]] on his 75th birthday special.

===Death===

===Tributes and legacy===
In 1996, [[Ohio Route 7]] through [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], was rededicated as Dean Martin Boulevard. Road signs bearing an [[Al Hirschfeld]] caricature of Martin's likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street.

An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville. Impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear.

In 2005, [[Clark County, Nevada]], renamed a portion of Industrial Road as Dean Martin Drive. A similarly named street was dedicated in 2008 in [[Rancho Mirage, California]].

Martin's family was presented a gold record in 2004 for ''[[Dino: The Essential Dean Martin]],'' his fastest-selling album, which also hit the iTunes Top 10. For the week ending December 23, 2006, the Dean Martin and [[Martina McBride]] duet of "[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]" reached No. 7 on the R&R AC chart. It also went to No. 36 on the R&R Country chart – the last time Martin had a song this high in the charts was in 1965, with the song "[[I Will (Dick Glasser song)|I Will]]," which reached No. 10 on the Pop chart.

An album of duets, ''[[Forever Cool]]'', was released by Capitol/EMI in 2007. It features Martin's voice with [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Shelby Lynne]], [[Joss Stone]], [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]], [[Robbie Williams]], McBride and others.

His footprints were immortalized at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in 1964. Martin has three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one at 6519 Hollywood Boulevard for movies; the second at 1617 Vine for recordings; and a third at 6651 Hollywood Boulevard for television.

In February 2009, Martin was honored with a posthumous [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Four of his surviving children, Gail, Deana, Ricci and Gina accepted it on his behalf.

A number of Martin songs have been featured across popular culture for decades. Hits such as "Ain't That a Kick in the Head", "Sway", "You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You", "That's Amore", and Martin's signature song "Everybody Loves Somebody" have been in films (such as the Oscar-winning ''[[Logorama]]'', ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', ''[[Goodfellas]]'', ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'', ''[[Sexy Beast]]'', ''[[Moonstruck]]'', ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'', ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'' and ''[[Return to Me]]''), television series (such as ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', and ''[[House (TV series)|House MD]]''), video games (such as ''[[The Godfather: The Game]]'', ''[[The Godfather II (video game)|The Godfather II]]'', ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' and ''[[Mafia II]]''), and fashion shows (such as the 2008 ''[[Victoria's Secret Fashion Show]]'').

Martin was portrayed by [[Joe Mantegna]] in the 1998 [[HBO]] movie about Sinatra and Martin titled ''[[The Rat Pack (film)|The Rat Pack]]''. Mantegna was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the role. British actor [[Jeremy Northam]] portrayed the entertainer in the 2002 made-for-TV movie ''[[Martin and Lewis (film)|Martin and Lewis]]'', alongside ''[[Will & Grace]]'''s [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] as Jerry Lewis.

Martin is the subject of ''Dean Martin's Wild Party'' and ''Dean Martin's Vegas Shindig'', a pair of video slot machines found in many casinos. The games feature songs sung by Martin during the bonus feature and the count-up of a player's winnings.

A compilation album called ''Amore!'' debuted at Number One on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[Top Pop Catalog Albums]] chart in its February 21, 2009, issue.
