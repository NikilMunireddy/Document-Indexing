'''Cornell University''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɔr|ˈ|n|ɛ|l}} {{respell|kor|NEL|'}}) is an American [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] and federal [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[doctoral university]] located in [[Ithaca, New York]]. Founded in 1865 by [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge — from the [[classics]] to the [[science]]s, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study."<ref name="motto">{{cite web|url=http://www.cornell.edu/search/index.cfm?tab=facts&q=&id=514 |title=Cornell University Facts: Motto|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=May 22, 2006}}</ref>

The university is broadly organized into seven [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] colleges and seven [[graduate school|graduate]] divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in [[New York City]] and one in [[Education City]], [[Qatar]].

Cornell is one of three private [[land-grant university|land grant universities]] in the nation and the only one in New York.<ref group="note">The others are the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the publicly funded but "privately governed" [[University of Delaware]].</ref> Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are [[statutory college|state-supported statutory or contract colleges]] through the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and veterinary colleges. As a land grant college, it operates a [[cooperative extension]] outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions.<ref name="Spitzer 2005"/> The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres, but is much larger when the [[Cornell Plantations]] (more than 4,300 acres) are considered, as well as the numerous university-owned lands in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realestate.fs.cornell.edu/about/faq.cfm#CP_JUMP_5682| title=Cornell University Facilities Services FAQ|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>

Since its founding, Cornell has been a [[co-education]]al, non-[[sectarianism|sectarian]] institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. Cornell counts more than 245,000 living [[alumnus|alumni]], and  its former and present faculty and alumni include 34&nbsp;[[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall Scholars]], 29&nbsp;[[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 7&nbsp;[[Gates Cambridge Scholarship|Gates Scholars]], [[List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Cornell University|50 Nobel laureates]], and 14 living billionaires.<ref name="factbook">{{cite web|url= http://www.cornell.edu/about/facts/cornell_facts.pdf|title=2009–10 Factbook| publisher=Cornell University |format=PDF|accessdate =December 27, 2009}}</ref><ref name=nobel>{{cite web|url= http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/Nobel_Laureates_at_CUk1.shtml|title=Cornell Nobel laureates |publisher=Cornell News Service|accessdate =June 6, 2006}}</ref><ref name="Rhodes Scholars">{{cite web|url= http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1165899600|title=Uncle Ezra| publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=January 10, 2007}}</ref> The student body consists of nearly 14,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 122 countries.<ref name="student body">{{cite web|url= http://www.cornell.edu/about/facts/stats.cfm|title=Facts about Cornell|format=URL |publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref><ref name="The Top 10 Universities for Billionaire Alumni">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/2013/02/23/The-Top-10-Universities-for-Billionaire-Alumni.html?slide=5|title=Universities for Billionaire Alumni| publisher=CNBC |accessdate =November 2, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
<!-- unless there is an urgent need to include a fact or event here, please consider just having the fact in the separate Cornell history article -->
{{Main|History of Cornell University}}
Cornell University was founded on April&nbsp;27, 1865; the [[New York State Senate|New York State (NYS) Senate]] authorized the university as the state's [[land-grant university|land grant]] institution. Senator [[Ezra Cornell]] offered his farm in [[Ithaca, New York]] as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial [[financial endowment|endowment]]. Fellow senator and experienced educator [[Andrew Dickson White]] agreed to be the first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings and traveled to attract students and [[faculty (university)|faculty]].<ref name=founding>{{Cite book|last=Becker|first =Carl L.|authorlink=Carl L.

Cornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its research to its own campus as well as to outreach efforts. For example, in 1883 it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-powered [[dynamo]] to light the grounds.<ref name=chp>{{cite web|url= http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html|title=The Early History of District Energy at Cornell University|accessdate=November 24, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704140529/http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html|archivedate=July 4, 2007}}</ref> Since 1894, Cornell has included colleges that are state funded and fulfill statutory requirements;<ref>{{cite book|author=Gelber, Sidney|year=2001|title=''Politics and Public Higher Education in New York State: Stony Brook: A Case History''|place=New York |publisher=P.

Cornell has had active alumni since its earliest classes. It was one of the first universities to include alumni-elected representatives on its Board of Trustees.<ref group=note>The University's charter was amended on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni-elected trustees; ({{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPIKAAAAIAAJ&dq=first%20alumni%20trustees%20cornell%20elect&pg=PA278#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=278|title=Cornell University, a history, Volume 1|year=1905|publisher=University Publishing Society|accessdate=December 14, 2010|author1=Waterman Thomas Hewett |author2=Frank R.

Palmer |author4=Project Innovation }}) Also in 1865, the election of the Harvard University Board of Overseers was shifted to alumni voting.</ref>

Cornell expanded, particularly since [[World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], when numerous students were funded by the GI Bill. Its student population in Ithaca in the 21st century totals nearly 20,000 students. The faculty also expanded, and by 1999, the university had about 3,000&nbsp;faculty members.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.info.cornell.edu/CUFACTS/demographics.html|title = Cornell Facts 2000-2001|publisher = Cornell University|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020608034139/http://www.info.cornell.edu/CUFACTS/default.html|archivedate=June 8, 2002|accessdate = August 2, 2013|at = Student, Faculty, Staff and Alumni Demographics}}</ref> The school has increased the number of courses.

===African-American 1960s activism===
Cornell was among the Ivies that had heightened student activism during the 1960s related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to the Vietnam War. Its administration was criticized for failing to have an African-American studies program, and for the low number of African-American faculty and students. The university attracted national attention in April&nbsp;1969 when African-American students occupied [[Willard Straight Hall]] in protest over alleged racism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&d=CDS19690421.2.1.2&e=--------20--1----Barton+Hall+protest-all|title=Black Students Leave Straight as C.U.

{{Main|Cornell Central Campus|Cornell North Campus|Cornell West Campus}}
Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in [[Ithaca, New York]], overlooking the town and [[Cayuga Lake]]. Since the university was founded, it has expanded to about 2300&nbsp;acres (9.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding areas.<ref name="ithaca">{{cite web|url= http://www.cornell.edu/visiting/ithaca|title=Cornell University - The Ithaca Campus |publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=April 6, 2006}}</ref> Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all of the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums. Collegetown contains two upper-class [[residence halls]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://dining.cornell.edu/campuslife/housing/undergraduate/cascadilla-hall.cfm|title=Housing – Cascadilla Hall|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.campuslife.cornell.edu/campuslife/housing/undergraduate/sheldon-court.cfm|title=Sheldon Court|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}</ref> and the Schwartz [[performing arts|Performing Arts]] Center amid a mixed-use neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ci.ithaca.ny.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7B4519B3DC-DFAD-47EE-9E0A-6A55E243E4B4%7D&DE=%7BFEA36033-DB19-4201-9F95-A5F4DAA6DE06%7D|title=Collegetown|publisher=City of Ithaca|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref>

The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic [[architectural style]]s, including ornate [[Collegiate Gothic]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] buildings, and the more spare [[international style (architecture)|international]] and [[modern architecture|modernist]] structures. The more ornate buildings generally predate [[World War II]]. The student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, at a time when architectural styles favored modernism.<ref>{{cite book |first=Daniel|last=Margulis |author2=Schroeder, John|title=A Century at Cornell|publisher=[[Cornell Daily Sun]]|location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]]|year=1980|isbn=0-938304-00-3|pages=110–111}}</ref> While some buildings are neatly arranged into [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangles]], others are packed densely and haphazardly. These eccentricities arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus. For example, in one of the earliest plans, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the designer of [[Central Park]], proposed a "grand terrace" overlooking [[Cayuga Lake]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Kermit C.|last=Parsons|title= The Cornell Campus: A History of its Planning and Development|publisher= Cornell University Press|location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]] |year=1968 |chapter= Chp. 3: A Quadrangle of Stone}}</ref>

Several of the university buildings are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including the [[Andrew Dickson White House]], [[Bailey Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Bailey Hall]], [[Caldwell Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Caldwell Hall]], [[Comstock Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Comstock Hall]], [[Morrill Hall]], and [[Deke House (Ithaca, New York)|Deke House]]. At least three other historic buildings—[[Roberts Hall (Ithaca, New York)|the original Roberts Hall]], [[East Robert Hall (Ithaca, New York)|East Robert Hall]] and [[Stone Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Stone Hall]]—have also been listed on the NRHP. The university demolished them in the 1980s to make way for other development.<ref>{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref> In September 2011, ''[[Travel+Leisure]]'' listed the Ithaca Campus as among the most beautiful in the United States.<ref>[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/11 "America's most beautiful college campuses"] ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)</ref>

Located among the rolling valleys of the [[Finger Lakes]] region, the campus on a hill provides views of the surrounding area, including 38&nbsp;miles (61.4&nbsp;km) long [[Lake Cayuga]]. Two [[Canyon|gorges]], Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, bound Central Campus and are used as popular swimming holes during the warmer months (although the university and city code discourage their use).<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=14850 Today |title=Cornell offering free shuttle buses to Buttermilk Falls State Park for two weekends |date=August 23, 2013 |url=http://today.14850.com/stories/08232-cornell-buttermilk |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref> Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800&nbsp;acre (11.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) [[Cornell Plantations]], a [[botanical garden]] containing flowers, trees, and ponds, with manicured trails providing access through the facility.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://explore.cornell.edu/scene.cfm?scene=Natural%20Beauty&stop=CU%20%2D%20NB%20%2D%20Campus%20Gardens|title=Explore Cornell - Natural Beauty - Campus Gardens |publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=April 6, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801143414/http://explore.cornell.edu/scene.cfm?scene=Natural+Beauty&stop=CU+-+NB+-+Campus+Gardens |archivedate=August 1, 2003 }}</ref>

The university has embarked on numerous 'green' initiatives. In 2009, a new gas-fired combined heat and power facility replaced a coal-fired steam plant, resulting in a reduction in carbon emissions to 7% below 1990 levels, and projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75,000 tons per year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/10/01_22_10.pdf|title=Cornell moves beyond coal with combined heat and power plant|work=Cornell Chronicle|first=Bill|last=Steele|date=January 22, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> This facility satisfies 15% of campus electrical needs,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainablecampus.cornell.edu/energy/cogeneration.cfm|title=Energy Use: Cogeneration of Electricity|year=2006|accessdate=November 24, 2009}}</ref> and a university-run, on-campus hydroelectric plant in the Fall Creek Gorge provides an additional 2%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_hydroelectricplant.html |title=Hydroelectric Plant |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100502011959/http://www.utilities.cornell.edu:80/utl_hydroelectricplant.html |archivedate=May 2, 2010 }}</ref> The university has a [[Deep lake water cooling|lake source cooling]] project that uses Lake Cayuga to air condition campus buildings, with an 80% energy saving over conventional systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_lscabout.html|title=Lake Source Cooling : An Idea Whose Time Has Come|accessdate=November 24, 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080629072724/http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_lscabout.html|archivedate=June 29, 2008}}</ref> In 2007, Cornell established a Center for a Sustainable Future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/about/|title=About the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> Cornell has been rated "A-" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/cornell-university|title=Cornell University - Green Report Card 2011|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref>

====Cornell Tech====
{{Main|Cornell Tech}}

On December 19, 2011, Cornell University and [[Technion-Israel Institute of Technology]] won a competition for rights to claim free city land as well as $100 million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York City. The competition was established by New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] in order to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology sector. The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square feet state-of-the-art tech campus to be built on [[Roosevelt Island]] on the site of the former [[Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital]].  Instruction began in the fall of 2012 in a temporary location in Manhattan ([[111 Eighth Avenue]] in space donated by [[Google]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec11/NYCcover.html|title='Game-changing' tech campus goes to Cornell, Technion|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref> [[Thom Mayne]] of the architecture firm [[Morphosis]] has been selected to design the first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island.

Cornell consists of nine privately endowed colleges as well as four publicly supported "[[statutory college]]s": the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Human Ecology, School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and College of Veterinary Medicine. These statutory colleges received $131.9&nbsp;million in [[State University of New York|SUNY]] appropriations in 2010-2011 to support their teaching, research, and service missions, which makes them accountable to SUNY trustees and other state agencies. The budget also includes $3.9 million of state funds for Cornell Cooperative Extension<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.suny.edu/GovtRelations/state/pdf/BudgetDocument.pdf|title=State University of New York 2010-2011 Budget|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Ramanujan>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April07/2007StateBudget.kr.html|title=State budget pleases CU administrators |last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna |date=April 17, 2007|work=The Cornell Chronicle|accessdate=July 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Graffeo 2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/search/display.html?terms=&url=/nyctap/I05_0016.htm|title=3 No. 14: In the Matter of Jeremy W.

Cornell is [[decentralized]], with its colleges and schools exercising wide autonomy.

In the early 1980s, Cornell deployed the first [[IBM 3090]]-400VF and coupled two IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate coarse-grained parallel computing. In 1984, the [[National Science Foundation]] began work on establishing five new [[supercomputer]] centers, including the [[Cornell Theory Center|Cornell Center for Advanced Computing]], to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. As an NSF center, Cornell deployed the first IBM Scalable Parallel supercomputer. In the 1990s, Cornell developed scheduling software and deployed the first supercomputer built by Dell. Most recently, Cornell deployed Red Cloud, one of the first cloud computing services designed specifically for research. Today, the center is a partner on the National Science Foundation XSEDE supercomputing program, providing coordination for XSEDE architecture and design, systems reliability testing, and online training using the Cornell Virtual Workshop learning platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cac.cornell.edu/about/history.aspx|title=Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing History and Awards|date=April 2012|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=April 22, 2012}}</ref>

Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as [[Hans Bethe]], contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] (see also: [[List of Cornell Manhattan Project people]]). In the 1930s, Cornell built the second [[cyclotron]] in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study [[synchrotron radiation]]. During the 1990s, the [[Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source|Cornell Electron Storage Ring]], located beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerncourier.com/main/article/42/1/11|title=Cornell's laboratory is at the crossroads|publisher=CERN Courier |accessdate=May 23, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lns.cornell.edu/accelphys/cesr.shtml|title=Accelerator Physics: Cornell Electron Storage Ring|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=July 4, 2006}}</ref> After building the synchrotron at Cornell, [[Robert R.

Cornell's connection to national Greek life is strong and longstanding. Many chapters are among the oldest of their respective national organizations, as evidenced by the proliferation of ''Alpha-series'' chapters. The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] constructed in 1877 is believed to be the first house built in America solely for fraternity use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alphadeltaphi.org/AboutUs/Chapters/tabid/59/agentType/View/ChapterID/12/Default.aspx |title=The Cornell Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity |publisher=Alphadeltaphi.org |date=1929-02-11 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref> Philanthropy opportunities are used to encourage community relations, for example, during the 2004–05 academic year, the Greek system contributed 21,668 [[community service]] and [[advocacy]] hours and raised $176,547 in charitable contributions from its philanthropic efforts.<ref name=Greek/> Generally, discipline is managed internally by the inter-Greek governing boards.

===Press and radio===<!-- Any publications discussed here should pertain chiefly to Student life -- Scholarly publications belong in the Press and scholarly publications section above -->
The Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio. Student-run newspapers include ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'', an independent daily; ''[[The Cornell Review]]'', a conservative newspaper published fortnightly; and ''[[The Cornell Progressive (newspaper)]]'', a liberal newspaper published every month.

Other press outlets include ''[[The Cornell Lunatic]]'', a campus humor magazine; the ''[[Cornell Chronicle]]'', the university's newspaper of record; and ''[[Kitsch (magazine)|Kitsch Magazine]]'', a [[feature story|feature magazine]] published in cooperation with [[Ithaca College]]. ''The Cornellian'' is an independent student organization that organizes, arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, as well as the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award for Journalism as well as a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cornell.edu/search/index.cfm?tab=facts&q=&id=225 |title=Cornellian |publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}</ref> Cornellians are represented over the radio waves on [[WVBR]], an independent commercial FM radio station owned and operated by Cornell students.

{{Main|Cornelliana}}
Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include [[Slope Day]], a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and [[Dragon Day]], which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near St. Patrick's Day. The dragon is built secretly by the architecture students, and taunting messages are left for the engineering students for the week before Dragon Day. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded across the Arts Quad and then set afire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=55|title=History of Dragon Day|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate = 2006-05-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909042704/http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=55<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=September 9, 2006}}</ref>

According to legend, if a virgin crosses the [[Arts Quad]] at midnight, the statues of [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fs.cornell.edu/tours/default.cfm?tour_id=41 |title=Fall Creek Gorge: Suspension Bridge Virtual Tour|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

The university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7&nbsp;m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27&nbsp;kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/pumpkin_tale.html|title=Pumpkin Tale| publisher=Cornell News Service|accessdate=June 5, 2006}}</ref> The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1067490000|title=Ask Uncle Ezra|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> The clock tower also plays music.

The school colors are [[carnelian (color)|carnelian]] (a shade of red) and white, a play on "Cornellian" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot "Touchdown" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.<ref name=mascot>{{Cite news |url=http://cornellsun.com/node/17613 |title=Wild Cornell Mascot Wreaks Havoc|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=April 30, 2006|accessdate=2010-09-21|first=Casey|last=Holmes}}</ref> The university's [[alma mater]] is "[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]", and its [[fight song]] is "[[Give My Regards to Davy]]". People associated with the university are called "Cornellians".

===Campus police===
Cornell University Police protect the campus and are classified as peace officers and have the same authority as the Ithaca city police. They are similar to the campus police at Ithaca College and Syracuse University because those campus police are classified as armed peace officers. The Cornell University Police are on campus and on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Their duties include, but are not limited to: patrolling the university around the clock, responding to emergency situations as well as non-emergency calls for service, crime prevention services, active investigation of crimes on campus, enforcement of state criminal and motor vehicle laws, and campus regulations.<ref>http://www.cupolice.cornell.edu/</ref>{{secondary source needed|date=April 2016}}
