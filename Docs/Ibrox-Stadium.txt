'''Ibrox Stadium''' is a [[Soccer-specific stadium|football stadium]] located on the south side of the [[River Clyde]] in the [[Ibrox, Glasgow|Ibrox]] district of [[Glasgow]]. The home of [[Rangers F.C.]], Ibrox is one of the largest [[List of football stadiums in the United Kingdom|football stadiums in the UK]], and the third largest [[List of football stadiums in Scotland|football stadium in Scotland]], having an all-seated capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|rangers}}.<ref name = "capacity"/>

It was opened as '''Ibrox Park''' in 1899, but suffered a [[1902 Ibrox disaster|disaster in 1902]] when a wooden terrace collapsed. Vast earthen terraces were built in its place, while a main stand, which is now a [[listed building]], was built in 1928. A British record crowd of 118,567 gathered in January 1939 for a league match with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. After the [[1971 Ibrox disaster|Ibrox disaster of 1971]], the stadium was largely rebuilt. The vast bowl-shaped terracing was removed and replaced by three rectangular, all-seated stands by 1981. After renovations were completed in 1997, the ground was renamed Ibrox Stadium.

Ibrox has also hosted the [[Scotland national football team]], particularly when the national stadium [[Hampden Park]] was redeveloped in the 1990s. Ibrox also hosted three Scottish domestic cup finals in the same period. It has also been the venue for concerts by major performers, including [[Frank Sinatra]].

Ibrox Park, as it was known between 1899 and 1997,<ref name = "story"/> is almost completely different from the Ibrox Stadium of today.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand along one side.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> The ground had a capacity of 40,000.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> Celtic Park, Ibrox and [[Hampden Park]] all competed with each other to host [[Scottish Cup Final]]s and Scotland matches, one of which could generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large terracing, holding 36,000 people, behind the western goalmouth.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> The terracing, designed by [[Archibald Leitch]], was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.<ref name = "rangers"/>

The structure was passed by the Govan Burgh Surveyor in March 1902, but there were newspaper reports that it was unstable.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> A crowd of 68,114 assembled for a Scotland v [[England national football team|England]] match on 5 April 1902, but shortly after the kick-off one section of the terracing "collapsed like a [[trap door]]".<ref name = "Inglis466"/> A gap of 20 square yards appeared, causing about 125 people to fall to the ground 50 feet below the terracing.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> Most survived due to the fact they fell on top of other bodies, but 25 people were killed.<ref name = "Inglis466"/><ref name = "journal"/><ref name = "bricks"/> 517 people were injured, some due to being crushed in the panic caused by the collapse.<ref name = "Inglis466"/><ref name = "journal">{{cite journal | title =The fatalities at the Ibrox disaster of 1902 |journal =The Sports Historian | volume =18 | issue =2 | pages =148–155 | publisher =British Society of Sports History | year =1998 | url =http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/1998/sh182k.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =17 May 2007 | doi =10.1080/17460269809445801|first=Robert |last=Sheils}}</ref>

Most people in the stadium were unaware that the (first) Ibrox disaster had happened.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> People even re-occupied the damaged area, despite the danger of further collapse.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> A definite reason for the disaster was not agreed upon, partly because there was no [[public inquiry]] held.<ref name = "bricks"/> Some experts blamed the quality of wood<ref name = "Inglis466"/> and the supplier was tried for [[culpable homicide]], but was acquitted.<ref name = "bricks"/> The design was also cited as a possible cause.<ref name = "Inglis466"/><ref name = "bricks"/> Generally, wooden structures of that size were not trusted.<ref name = "Inglis466"/> Rangers removed the wooden terraces, reducing capacity to 25,000.<ref name = "rangers"/> The criticism of the design did not deter Rangers from hiring Leitch in the future.<ref name = "Inglis466"/><ref name = "bricks"/> He designed an expansion of Ibrox to a 63,000 capacity by 1910, using slopes made of earth.<ref name = "Inglis466"/><ref name = "rangers"/> By this point, the city of Glasgow had the three largest purpose-built football grounds in the world.<ref name = "Inglis466"/><ref name = "bricks"/>

Although later events, such as the [[Hillsborough disaster]] and the subsequent [[Taylor Report]], vindicated this plan, Rangers were taking a significant risk.<ref name = "Inglis467"/> The whole plan was estimated to cost £6 million, which no other club could have afforded in a short period of time.<ref name = "Inglis467"/> The development was funded by the Rangers [[football pool]]s operation, which was the largest club-based scheme in Britain.<ref name = "Inglis467"/><ref name = "inspiration"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/rangers-and-celtic-pools-1.806557|title=Rangers and Celtic pools |date=2 January 1992|accessdate=17 November 2011|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|publisher=Herald & Times Group|first=Hugh|last=Adam}}</ref> The first phase of the plan, which began in 1978, was the removal of the east terracing and its replacement with the Copland Road stand.<ref name = "Inglis467"/> The same process was repeated on the west side of the ground a year later, with the two identical stands each holding 7,500 seats.<ref name = "Inglis468">{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=468}}</ref> The redevelopment was completed in 1981 with the replacement of the Centenary Stand by the 10,300 capacity Govan Stand.<ref name = "Inglis468"/>

The new Ibrox had a capacity of 44,000 and was opened with an Old Firm game played on 19 September 1981.<ref name = "Inglis468"/> By this time, however, the development cost had risen to £10 million, which depleted the club financially.<ref name = "Inglis468"/> This resulted in a difficult period in the history of Rangers, as the average attendance fell to 17,500 in the 1981–82 season, including a crowd of only 4,500 for a game against [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]].<ref name = "Inglis468"/><ref group = "note">Rangers: The Complete Record (Breedon Books, 2005) states the attendance for the match against St Mirren was 6,000.</ref> The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this, as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to the spaces between the stands.<ref name = "Inglis468"/> This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general.

==Structure and facilities==
[[File:Ibrox Plan-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|<center>A plan of the layout of Ibrox Stadium</center>]]

[[File:Ibrox Stadium façade.jpg|thumb|left|The facade of the Bill Struth Main Stand.]]
The Bill Struth Main Stand, formerly known as the Main Stand, faces onto Edmiston Drive ([[A8 road (Scotland)|A8 road]]).<ref name = "Inglis470"/> The red-brick facade, designed by [[Archibald Leitch]], is a Category B listed building. [[Simon Inglis]], writing in 1996, described it as an "imposing red-brick facade, with its mock [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] arched, square and pedimented windows, exudes prestige and power."<ref name = "Inglis470"/> On each end wall the club crest is depicted in a blue and gold mosaic.<ref name = "Inglis470"/> Stairtowers leading to the Club Deck (third tier) stand at each end of the Main Stand.<ref name = "Inglis470"/> These towers are also framed in red-brick, but deliberately contrast with the main body of the stand.<ref name = "Inglis470"/> The two stairtowers also support a {{convert|146|m|adj=on}} long and {{convert|540|t|adj=on}} truss, which claimed to be the longest and heaviest clear span girder in the world.<ref name = "Inglis468"/>

Through the main doors of the Main Stand is a wood-panelled hallway.<ref name = "Inglis471">{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=471}}</ref> A staircase leads to the boardroom and trophy room.<ref name = "Inglis471"/> Inglis compared Ibrox to [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]], in that it combined corporate power with a sense of tradition and solidity.<ref name = "Inglis471"/> It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s with the addition of the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure. It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. The front wall of the middle tier is one of the last surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss-cross detailing.<ref name = "Inglis471"/> The middle tier is split into front and rear sections, while the enclosure is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.<ref name = "plan"/><ref name = "Inglis471"/>

Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand formerly known as the Govan Stand.<ref name = "plan"/> It is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981.<ref name = "Inglis468"/> To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space.<ref name = "Inglis469"/> The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans.<ref name = "Inglis471"/> It is traditionally the 'Rangers end' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end in the second half of matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, is identical to the opposite end.<ref name = "Inglis471"/> Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas.<ref name = "Inglis471"/> All of the stands are designed using the 'goalpost' structure, in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured.<ref>{{cite web | title =The goal post frame | work =Corus in the construction industry | publisher =Corus plc | url =http://www.corusconstruction.com/en/reference/teaching_resources/architectural_studio_reference/design/stadia/the_goal_post_frame/
