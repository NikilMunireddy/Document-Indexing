In the nineteenth century, cultural anthropologist Sir James Frazer studied the practices of Northern Celtic people on ''Hallowmas'' (a term that has come to describe the three day period of October 31st, Halloween, November 1st, All Saints' Day, and November 2nd, All Souls' Day). He asserted that the traditions of Hallowmas were rooted in Samhain, and he claimed that the ancient pagan festival had been a day to honor the dead. Though Christianity probably brought the focus on the dead to Samhain, Frazer claimed the reverse.}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Halloween|last=Bolinius|first=Erich|date=31 October 2006|publisher=FDP Emden|language=German<!--|accessdate=12 November 2015-->|quote=Die lückenhaften religionsgeschichtlichen Überlieferungen, die auf die Neuzeit begrenzte historische Dimension der Halloween-Kultausprägung, vor allem auch die Halloween-Metaphorik legen nahe, daß wir umdenken müssen: Halloween geht nicht auf das heidnische Samhain zurück, sondern steht in Bezug zum christlichen Totengedenkfest Allerheiligen/ Allerseelen.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdr.de/themen/freizeit/brauchtum/halloween_10/interview_doering.jhtml?rubrikenstyle=freizeit|title=Süßes, Saures - olle Kamellen?

==Etymology==
The word ''Halloween'' or ''Hallowe'en'' dates to about 1745<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Halloween&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Halloween |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> and is of Christian origin.<ref>''The A to Z of Anglicanism'' (Colin Buchanan), Scarecrow Press, page 8</ref> The word "Hallowe'en" means "[[hallowed]] evening" or "holy evening".<ref>''The American Desk Encyclopedia'' (Steve Luck), Oxford University Press, page 365</ref> It comes from a Scottish term for ''All Hallows' Eve'' (the evening before [[All Saints' Day|All Hallows' Day]]).<ref name="oed"/> In [[Scots language|Scots]], the word "eve" is ''even'', and this is contracted to ''e'en'' or ''een''. Over time, ''(All) Hallow(s) E(v)en'' evolved into ''Hallowe'en''. Although the phrase "All Hallows'" is found in [[Old English]] (''ealra hālgena mæssedæg'', all saints mass-day), "All Hallows' Eve" is itself not seen until 1556.<ref name="oed">{{cite book |title=The Oxford English Dictionary |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford Univ.

Albyn Press, 1970. pp.29–31</ref> the festival included [[Mummers Play|mumming]] and [[guising]] in Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man and Wales.<ref name=hutton379-383>Hutton, pp.379-383</ref> This involved people going house-to-house in costume (or in disguise), usually reciting verses or songs in exchange for food.<ref name=hutton379-383/> It may have originally been a tradition whereby people impersonated the ''Aos Sí'', or the souls of the dead, and received offerings on their behalf, similar to the custom of [[soul cake|souling]] (see [[Halloween#Christian influence|below]]). Impersonating these beings, or wearing a disguise, was also believed to protect oneself from them.<ref>Hole, Christina. ''British Folk Customs''. Hutchinson, 1976. p.91</ref> It is suggested that the mummers and guisers "personify the old spirits of the winter, who demanded reward in exchange for good fortune".<ref>Peddle, S. V. (2007). ''Pagan Channel Islands: Europe's Hidden Heritage''. p.54</ref> In parts of southern Ireland, the guisers included a [[hobby horse]]. A man dressed as a ''Láir Bhán'' ([[White horse (mythology)|white mare]]) led youths house-to-house reciting verses—some of which had pagan overtones—in exchange for food. If the household donated food it could expect good fortune from the 'Muck Olla'; not doing so would bring misfortune.<ref>''Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Volume 2''. 1855. pp.308-309</ref> In Scotland, youths went house-to-house with masked, painted or blackened faces, often threatening to do mischief if they were not welcomed.<ref name=hutton379-383/> [[F. Marian McNeill]] suggests the ancient festival included people in costume representing the spirits, and that faces were marked (or blackened) with ashes taken from the sacred bonfire.<ref name=mcneill2/> In parts of Wales, men went about dressed as fearsome beings called ''gwrachod''.<ref name=hutton379-383/> In the late 19th and early 20th century, young people in [[Glamorgan]] and [[Orkney]] [[cross-dressing|cross-dressed]].<ref name=hutton379-383/>  Elsewhere in Europe, mumming and hobby horses were part of other yearly festivals. However, in the Celtic-speaking regions they were "particularly appropriate to a night upon which supernatural beings were said to be abroad and could be imitated or warded off by human wanderers".<ref name=hutton379-383/> From at least the 18th century, "imitating malignant spirits" led to playing pranks in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands.<ref name=hutton379-383/> Wearing costumes and playing pranks at Halloween spread to England in the 20th century.<ref name=hutton379-383/> The "traditional illumination for guisers or pranksters abroad on the night in some places was provided by [[rutabaga|turnips]] or [[mangelwurzel|mangel wurzels]], hollowed out to act as lanterns and often carved with grotesque faces".<ref name=hutton379-383/> By those who made them, the lanterns were variously said to represent the spirits,<ref name=hutton379-383/> or were [[Apotropaic magic|used to ward off]] evil spirits.<ref name=palmer87>Palmer, Kingsley.

===Christian influence===
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
Today's Halloween customs are also thought to have been influenced by Christian dogma and practices derived from it. Halloween is the evening before the [[Christian]] holy days of [[All Saints' Day|All Hallows' Day]] (also known as ''All Saints' or Hallowmas'') on 1 November and [[All Souls' Day]] on 2 November, thus giving the holiday on 31 October the full name of ''All Hallows' Eve'' (meaning the evening before All Hallows' Day).<ref name="rogers_religion">Rogers, Nicholas (2002).

In parts of Britain, these customs came under attack during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] as some [[Protestant]]s berated purgatory as a "[[popish]]" doctrine incompatible with their notion of [[predestination]]. Thus, for some [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist Protestants]], the [[Christian theology|theology]] of All Hallows’ Eve was redefined; without the doctrine of purgatory, "the returning souls cannot be journeying from Purgatory on their way to Heaven, as Catholics frequently believe and assert. Instead, the so-called ghosts are thought to be in actuality evil spirits. As such they are threatening."<ref name="Santino, p.95"/> Other Protestants maintained belief in an [[intermediate state]], known as [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]] ([[Bosom of Abraham]]),<ref>''The Episcopal Church, its teaching and worship'' (Latta Griswold), E.S. Gorham, page 110</ref> and continued to observe the original customs, especially souling, [[Votive candle|candlelit]] [[procession]]s and the ringing of church bells in memory of the dead.<ref name="rogers_religion"/><ref name=Mosteller/> With regard to the [[unclean spirit|evil spirits]], on Halloween, "barns and [[House blessing|homes were blessed]] to protect people and livestock from the effect of witches, who were believed to accompany the malignant spirits as they traveled the earth."<ref name="Medieval Celebrations page 17"/> In the 19th century, in some rural parts of England, families gathered on hills on the night of All Hallows' Eve. One held a bunch of burning straw on a [[pitchfork]] while the rest knelt around him in a circle, praying for the souls of relatives and friends until the flames went out. This was known as ''teen'lay'', derived either from the [[Old English]] ''tendan'' (to kindle) or a word related to [[Old Irish]] ''tenlach'' (hearth).<ref name=hutton373>[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, Ronald]].

[[File:Souling on Halloween.png|150px|thumb|Souling was a Christian practice carried out in many English towns on Halloween and Christmas.]]

American historian and author [[Ruth Edna Kelley]] of [[Massachusetts]] wrote the first book length history of Halloween in the US; ''[[:s:The Book of Hallowe'en|The Book of Hallowe'en]]'' (1919), and references souling in the chapter "Hallowe'en in America".<ref>Kelley, Ruth Edna.

While the first reference to "guising" in North America occurs in 1911, another reference to ritual begging on Halloween appears, place unknown, in 1915, with a third reference in Chicago in 1920.<ref>Theo.

===Costumes===
{{Main| Halloween costume}}
[[File:Vintage Halloween Costumes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[costume party]] in 1890]]

Halloween costumes are traditionally modeled after supernatural figures such as vampires, monsters, ghosts, skeletons, witches, and devils. Over time, in the United States the costume selection extended to include popular characters from fiction, celebrities, and generic [[archetypes]] such as ninjas and princesses.<ref name=Britannica />

Dressing up in costumes and going "guising" was prevalent in Ireland and Scotland at Halloween by the late 19th century.<ref name=frle/> Costuming became popular for Halloween parties in the US in the early 20th century, as often for adults as for children. The first mass-produced Halloween costumes appeared in stores in the 1930s when [[trick-or-treating]] was becoming popular in the United States.

The yearly [[Greenwich Village Halloween Parade|New York Halloween Parade]], begun in 1974 by [[puppeteer]] and mask maker Ralph Lee of [[Greenwich Village]], is the world's largest Halloween parade and one of America's only major nighttime parades (along with Portland's Starlight Parade), attracting more than 60,000 costumed participants, two million spectators, and a worldwide television audience of over 100 million.<ref name="NYCHalloweenParade"/>

Eddie J. Smith, in his book ''Halloween, Hallowed is Thy Name'', offers a religious perspective to the wearing of costumes on All Hallows' Eve, suggesting that by dressing up as creatures "who at one time caused us to fear and tremble", people are able to poke fun at [[Satan]] "whose kingdom has been plundered by our Saviour." Images of skeletons and the dead are traditional decorations used as ''[[memento mori]]''.<ref>''School Year, Church Year'' (Peter Mazar), Liturgy Training Publications, page 114</ref><ref>''Memento Mori'', Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri</ref>

===UNICEF===
{{Main|Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF}}

"Trick-or-Treat for [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]" is a fundraising program to support UNICEF,<ref name=Britannica /> a United Nations Programme that provides humanitarian aid to children in developing countries. Started as a local event in a Northeast [[Philadelphia]] neighborhood in 1950 and expanded nationally in 1952, the program involves the distribution of small boxes by schools (or in modern times, corporate sponsors like [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]], at their licensed stores) to trick-or-treaters, in which they can solicit small-change donations from the houses they visit. It is estimated that children have collected more than $118&nbsp;million for UNICEF since its inception. In Canada, in 2006, UNICEF decided to discontinue their Halloween collection boxes, citing safety and administrative concerns; after consultation with schools, they instead redesigned the program.<ref name="ctv">{{cite news |first=Genevieve |last=Beauchemin |author2=CTV.ca News Staff |title=UNICEF to end Halloween 'orange box' program |url= http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060530/unicef_orange_060530?s_name=&no_ads= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016235444/http://ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060530/unicef_orange_060530?s_name=&no_ads= |archivedate= 16 October 2007 |publisher=CTV |date=31 May 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2006}}</ref><ref name="ca_un">{{cite web |title=History of the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF Campaign |url =http://www.trickortreatforunicef.ca/tot_history.html |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090604032837/http://www.trickortreatforunicef.ca/tot_history.html |archivedate =4 June 2009 |publisher=UNICEF Canada |year=2008 |accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref>

==Games and other activities==
[[File:Halloween-card-mirror-2.jpg|upright|left|thumb|In this 1904 Halloween greeting card, [[divination]] is depicted: the young woman looking into a mirror in a darkened room hopes to catch a glimpse of her future husband.]]

There are several games traditionally associated with Halloween parties. One common game is dunking or [[apple bobbing]], which may be called "dooking" in Scotland<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/south_of_scotland/7648188.stm Apple dookers make record attempt]", BBC News, 2 October 2008</ref> in which apples float in a tub or a large basin of water and the participants must use their teeth to remove an apple from the basin. The practice is thought by some to have derived from the Roman practices in celebration of [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]].<ref name=Britannica /> A variant of dunking involves kneeling on a chair, holding a fork between the teeth and trying to drive the fork into an apple. Another common game involves hanging up treacle or syrup-coated scones by strings; these must be eaten without using hands while they remain attached to the string, an activity that inevitably leads to a very sticky face.

Some games traditionally played at Halloween are forms of divination. In All Hallows' Eve celebrations during the [[Middle Ages]], these activities historically occurred only in rural areas of medieval Europe and were only done by a "rare few" as these were considered to be "deadly serious" practices.<ref name="Medieval Celebrations page 17"/> A traditional Scottish form of divining one's future spouse is to carve an apple in one long strip, then toss the peel over one's shoulder. The peel is believed to land in the shape of the first letter of the future spouse's name.<ref name="McNeill">McNeill, F. Marian (1961, 1990) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol. 3. William MacLellan, Glasgow ISBN 0-948474-04-1 pp.11–46</ref> Unmarried women were told that if they sat in a darkened room and gazed into a mirror on Halloween night, the face of their future husband would appear in the mirror.<ref name="hollister">{{cite book

[[File:Families picking pumpkins for Halloween.PNG|thumb|A common custom includes picking and purchasing pumpkins from [[Garden|patch]]es]]

Another game/superstition that was enjoyed in the early 1900s involved walnut shells. People would write fortunes in milk on white paper. After drying, the paper was folded and placed in walnut shells. When the shell was warmed, milk would turn brown therefore the writing would appear on what looked like blank paper. Folks would also play fortune teller. In order to play this game, symbols were cut out of paper and placed on a platter. Someone would enter a dark room and was ordered to put her hand on a piece of ice then lay it on a platter. Her "fortune" would stick to the hand. Paper symbols included: dollar sign-wealth, button-bachelorhood, thimble-spinsterhood, clothespin- poverty, rice-wedding, umbrella- journey, caldron-trouble, 4-leaf clover- good luck, penny-fortune, ring-early marriage, and key-fame.<ref>''Green Bay Press Gazette'', 27 October 1916</ref>

The telling of [[ghost story|ghost stories]] and viewing of horror films are common fixtures of Halloween parties. Episodes of television series and [[List of Halloween television specials|Hallowe'en-themed specials]] (with the specials usually aimed at children) are commonly aired on or before Halloween, while new horror films are often released theatrically before Halloween to take advantage of the atmosphere.

==Haunted attractions==
[[File:Ura and ima.jpg|thumb|Humorous [[tombstone]]s in front of a house in [[California]]]]

{{Main|Haunted attraction (simulated)}}
Haunted attractions are entertainment venues designed to thrill and scare patrons. Most attractions are seasonal Halloween businesses. Origins of these paid scare venues are difficult to pinpoint, but it is generally accepted that they were first commonly used by the [[Junior Chamber International]] (Jaycees) for fundraising.<ref name="msnbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9855272/|title=Haunted house business getting frightfully hard|last=Associated Press|date=30 October 2005|work=MSNBC.com|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=18 November 2008}}</ref> They include [[haunted houses]], [[corn maze]]s, and [[hayride]]s,<ref name="hvmag">{{cite web |url=http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/October-2008/A-Model-of-Mayhem/ |title=A Model of Mayhem |accessdate=6 October 2008 |author=Greg Ryan |date=17 September 2008 |work=Hudson Valley Magazine}}</ref> and the level of sophistication of the effects has risen as the industry has grown. Haunted attractions in the United States bring in an estimated $300–500 million each year, and draw some 400,000 customers, although press sources writing in 2005 speculated that the industry had reached its peak at that time.<ref name="msnbc"/> This maturing and growth within the industry has led to technically more advanced [[special effects]] and costuming, comparable with that of [[Hollywood]] films.<ref name="usatoday-haunt">{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-10-11-haunted-house-main_x.htm |title=Haunted houses get really scary|last=Wilson|first=Craig|date=12 October 2006 |work=USAToday.com}}</ref>

==Food==
[[File:HalloweenPumpkin2.jpg|thumb|left|Pumpkins for sale during Halloween]]

On All Hallows' Eve, many Western Christian denominations encourage [[meat-free day|abstinence from meat]], giving rise to a variety of [[Christian vegetarianism|vegetarian]] foods associated with this day.<ref name=mader>{{cite web |last=Mader |first=Isabel |date=September 30, 2014 |title=Halloween Colcannon |publisher=Simmer Magazine |url=http://www.simmermagazine.com/2014/09/30/halloween-colcannon-recipe/ |accessdate=3 October 2014 |quote=All Hallow's Eve was a Western (Anglo) Christian holiday that revolved around commemorating the dead using humor to intimidate death itself. Like all holidays, All Hallow's Eve involved traditional treats. The church encouraged an abstinence from meat, which created many vegetarian dishes.}}</ref>

Because in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] Halloween comes in the wake of the yearly apple harvest, [[candy apple]]s (known as toffee apples outside North America), [[Caramel apple|caramel or taffy apples]] are common Halloween treats made by rolling whole apples in a sticky sugar syrup, sometimes followed by rolling them in nuts.

At one time, candy apples were commonly given to trick-or-treating children, but the practice rapidly waned in the wake of widespread rumors that some individuals were embedding items like pins and [[Poisoned candy myths|razor blades in the apples]] in the United States.<ref name="rogers_r">Rogers, Nicholas (2002).

Nonetheless, many parents assumed that such heinous practices were rampant because of the mass media. At the peak of the hysteria, some hospitals offered free X-rays of children's Halloween hauls in order to find evidence of tampering. Virtually all of the few known candy poisoning incidents involved parents who poisoned their own children's candy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/8839-poisoned-halloween-candy-trick-treat-myth.html |title=Poisoned Halloween Candy: Trick, Treat or Myth? – LiveScience|last=Nixon|first=Robin|date=27 October 2010 |publisher=LiveScience.com |accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref>

One custom that persists in modern-day [[Ireland]] is the baking (or more often nowadays, the purchase) of a [[barmbrack]] ({{lang-gle|báirín breac}}), which is a light fruitcake, into which a plain ring, a coin and other charms are placed before baking. It is said that those who get a ring will find their true love in the ensuing year. This is similar to the tradition of [[king cake]] at the festival of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

* [[Bonfire toffee]] ([[Great Britain]])
* [[Candy apple]]s/[[toffee apple]]s (Great Britain and Ireland)

On Hallowe'en (All Hallows' Eve), in [[Poland]], believers were once taught to [[Christian prayer|pray]] out loud as they walk through the forests in order that the souls of the dead might find comfort; in [[Spain]], Christian priests in tiny villages toll their [[church bell]]s in order to remind their congregants to remember the dead on All Hallows' Eve.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bannatyne|first=Lesley Pratt|title=Halloween: An American Holiday, an American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNAXt9jLXWwC&pg=PA12&dq=Hallowe'en+All+Hallows+Eve+Spain+church+bells&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mx-TUPOTBJTM9gTAooDwAQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2012|date=1 August 1998|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=1565543467|page=12|quote=Polish Catholics taught their children to pray out loud as they walked through the woods so that the souls of the dead could hear them and be comforted.

The Church traditionally held a vigil on All Hallows' Eve when worshippers would prepare themselves with prayers and fasting prior to the feast day itself. The name derives from the Old English 'hallowed' meaning holy or sanctified and is now usually contracted to the more familiar word Hallowe'en. ...However, there are supporters of the view that Hallowe'en, as the eve of All Saints' Day, originated entirely independently of Samhain...|year=2010|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=Service /><ref name=Prayer />

==Analogous celebrations and perspectives==

===Judaism===
According to [[Alfred J. Kolatch]] in the ''Second Jewish Book of Why'', in [[Judaism]], Halloween is not permitted by Jewish [[Halakha]] because it violates [[Leviticus 18|Leviticus 18:3]] which forbids Jews from partaking in gentile customs. Many Jews observe [[Bereavement in Judaism#Yizkor|Yizkor]], which is equivalent to the observance of [[Allhallowtide]] in Christianity, as prayers are said for both "martyrs and for one's own family."<ref>''The Jewish Life Cycle: rites of passage from biblical to modern times'' (Ivan G. Marcus), University of Washington Press, page 232</ref> Nevertheless, many American Jews celebrate Halloween, disconnected from its Christian origins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Halloween.html |title=Jews and Halloween |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Rabbi]] Jeffrey Goldwasser has said that "There is no religious reason why contemporary Jews should not celebrate Halloween" while [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Rabbi Michael Broyde has argued against Jews observing the holiday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://haamnews.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/halloween-and-judaism-a-contradiction-or-a-coalition/ |title=Halloween and Judaism: a contradiction or a coalition? |publisher=Haamnews.wordpress.com |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> Jews do have the [[Purim]] holiday, where they get to dress up in costumes and celebrate it.

===Islam===
[[Sheikh]] Idris Palmer, author of ''A Brief Illustrated Guide to Understanding Islam'', has argued that [[Muslim]]s should not participate in Halloween, stating that "participation in Halloween is worse than participation in [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], ... it is more sinful than congratulating the Christians for their prostration to the crucifix".<ref>{{citation |url=http://alhudainstitute.ca/Upload/specialevents/halloween/through-muslim-eyes.pdf |title=Halloween: Through Muslim Eyes |author=A.

===Hinduism===
Most [[Hindu]]s do not observe All Hallows' Eve, instead remembering the dead in the festival of [[Pitru Paksha]], during which Hindus pay homage to and perform a ceremony "to keep the souls of their ancestors at rest."<ref>{{citation |url=http://visionnationals.org/halloween-in-india/ |title=Halloween in India? |author=Lauren Stengele |publisher=Vision Nationals |date=25 October 2012}}</ref> The celebration of the Hindu festival [[Diwali]] sometimes conflicts with the date of Halloween; but some Hindus choose to participate in the popular customs of Halloween.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/omsweetom/2009/10/halloween.html |title=Trick or Treat?

===Neopaganism===
[[Neopagan]]s do not observe Halloween, but instead observe [[Samhain]] on 1 November,<ref name=George>{{cite web|url=http://www.themanitoban.com/2010/10/real-life-witches-that-dont-celebrate-halloween/1513/|title=Real-life witches that don’t celebrate Halloween|last=George|first=Stephanie|date=25 October 2010|publisher=[[The Manitoban]]|accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> although some neopagan individuals choose to participate in cultural Halloween festivities, opining the idea that one can observe both "the solemnity of Samhain in addition to the fun of Halloween." Other neopagans are opposed to the celebration of Halloween, believing that it "trivializes Samhain",<ref>''Should Pagans Celebrate Halloween?'' (Wicasta Lovelace), Pagan Centric</ref> and "avoid Halloween, because of the interruptions from trick or treaters."<ref>''Halloween, From a Wiccan/Neopagan perspective'' (B.A. Robinson), Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance</ref> ''[[The Manitoban]]'' writes that "[[Wiccans]] don’t officially celebrate Halloween, despite the fact that 31 Oct. will still have a star beside it in any good Wiccan’s day planner. Starting at sundown, Wiccans celebrate a holiday known as Samhain. Samhain actually comes from old Celtic traditions and is not exclusive to Neopagan religions like Wicca. While the traditions of this holiday originate in Celtic countries, modern day Wiccans don’t try to historically replicate Samhain celebrations. Some traditional Samhain rituals are still practised but at its core, the holiday is simply a time to celebrate darkness and the dead — a possible reason why Samhain is often confused with Halloween celebrations."<ref name=George/>
