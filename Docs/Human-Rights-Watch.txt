'''Human Rights Watch''' ('''HRW''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]] that conducts research and [[advocacy]] on [[human rights]]. HRW headquarters are in [[New York City]] with offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[Beirut]], [[Berlin]], [[Brussels]], [[Chicago]], [[Geneva]], [[Johannesburg]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Moscow]], [[Nairobi]], [[Paris]], [[San Francisco]], [[Sydney]], [[Tokyo]], [[Toronto]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Zurich]].<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/node/75138|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2015-01-21}}</ref>

As of June 2011, the organization’s annual expenses totaled $50.6 million.<ref name="Financial Statements, Year Ended June 30, 2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/financial-statements-2011.pdf|title=Financial Statements, Year Ended June 30, 2011|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|Helsinki Watch}}
Human Rights Watch was founded as a private American [[NGO]] in 1978, under the name [[Helsinki Watch]], to monitor the former [[Soviet Union]]'s compliance with the [[Helsinki Accords]].<ref name="OH">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/75134|title=Our History |publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref> Helsinki Watch adopted a practice of publicly "[[name and shame|naming and shaming]]" abusive governments through media coverage and through direct exchanges with policymakers. By shining the international spotlight on human rights violations in the Soviet Union and its [[Europe]]an partners, Helsinki Watch contributed to the democratic transformations of the region in the late 1980s.<ref name="OH" />

'''Americas Watch''' was founded in 1981 while bloody civil wars engulfed [[Central America]]. Relying on extensive on-the-ground fact-finding, Americas Watch not only addressed perceived abuses by government forces but also applied [[international humanitarian law]] to investigate and expose [[war crime]]s by rebel groups. In addition to raising its concerns in the affected countries, Americas Watch also examined the role played by foreign governments, particularly the [[United States government]], in providing military and political support to abusive regimes.

'''Asia Watch''' (1985), '''Africa Watch''' (1988), and '''Middle East Watch''' (1989) were added to what was known as "'''The Watch Committees'''." In 1988, all of these committees were united under one umbrella to form Human Rights Watch.

Originally called the '''Helsinki Watch''', the Human Rights Watch was first designed in 1978 as a support organization for citizens of the Soviet bloc. Their founding objective was to aid these citizens in monitoring government compliance with the Helsinki Accords of 1975, which called for respectful and cooperative relations between the Communist bloc and the West. The Helsinki Watch used media coverage, as well as contact with policymakers, to employ methods of publicly “naming and shaming” abusive governments. This way, the organization was able to bring international attention to corruption and abuse in Soviet and Eastern European governments, acting as a major force in the dramatic spread of democracy of the 1980s. Each were formed in the same likeness of the Helsinki Watch, though Americas Watch was the first to take it a step further as their Central American civil wars were raging on, and apply international humanitarian law to their efforts towards the investigation and exposition of war crimes by different rebel groups. In addition, they looked into, and were critical of, the roles that foreign governments may play in aiding abusive regimes, whether militarily, politically, or financially. These new strategies became lasting tactics of the organization as a whole, and in 1988, the collection of Watch Committees decided to merge under one all-inclusive title, calling themselves the "Human Rights Watch".<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.hrw.org/node/75134|agency=Human Rights Watch (HRW.org) |accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Chauhan|first=Yamini|title=Human Rights Watch|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1459072/Human-Rights-Watch|work=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

== Profile ==

Pursuant to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Human Rights Watch (HRW) opposes violations of what it considers basic human rights. This includes [[capital punishment]] and discrimination on the basis of [[LGBT social movements|sexual orientation]]. HRW advocates freedoms in connection with fundamental human rights, such as [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of the press]].

Human Rights Watch publishes research reports on violations of [[international human rights law|international human rights norms]] as set out by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and what it perceives to be other internationally accepted, human-rights norms. These reports are used as the basis for drawing international attention to abuses and pressuring governments and international organizations to reform. Researchers conduct fact-finding missions to investigate suspect situations also using diplomacy, staying in touch with victims, making files about public and individuals, and providing required security for them in critical situations and in a proper time generate coverage in local and international [[News media|media]]. Issues raised by Human Rights Watch in its reports include social and [[discrimination|gender discrimination]], [[torture]], [[military use of children]], [[political corruption]], abuses in [[criminal justice]] systems, and the legalization of [[abortion]].<ref name="OH" /> HRW has documented and reported various violations of the laws of [[war]] and international humanitarian law.

Human Rights Watch also supports writers worldwide, who are being persecuted for their work and are in need of [[Welfare (financial aid)|financial assistance]]. The Hellman/Hammett grants are financed by the estate of the playwright [[Lillian Hellman]] in funds set up in her name and that of her long-time companion, the novelist [[Dashiell Hammett]]. In addition to providing financial assistance, the Hellman/Hammett grants help raise international awareness of activists who are being silenced for speaking out in defense of human rights.<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/about/info/helham.html Hellman-Hammett Grants],''Human Rights Watch''</ref>

Each year, Human Rights Watch presents the Human Rights Defenders Award to activists around the world who demonstrate leadership and courage in defending human rights. The award winners work closely with HRW in investigating and exposing human rights abuses.<ref>{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|title=Five Activists Win Human Rights Watch Awards|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/09/14/five-activists-win-human-rights-watch-awards|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="SocialSciences.in">{{cite web|last=SocialSciences.in|title=Human Rights Watch|url=http://socialsciences.in/article/human-rights-watch|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>

Human Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in 1998. It is also the co-chair of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], a global coalition of civil society groups that successfully lobbied to introduce the [[Ottawa Treaty]], a treaty that prohibits the use of anti-personnel landmines.

Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of [[non-governmental organizations]] that monitor [[censorship]] worldwide. It also co-founded the [[Cluster Munition Coalition]], which brought about an international convention banning the weapons. HRW employs more than 275 staff—country experts, lawyers, journalists, and academics – and operates in more than 90 countries around the world.<ref name="WWA">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/75136|title=Who We Are |publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>

The current executive director of HRW is [[Kenneth Roth]], who has held the position since 1993. Roth conducted investigations on abuses in [[Poland]] after martial law was declared 1981. He later focused on [[Haiti]], which had just emerged from the Duvalier dictatorship but continued to be plagued with problems. Roth’s awareness of the importance of human rights began with stories his father had told about escaping [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Roth graduated from [[Yale Law School]] and [[Brown University]].

In the summer of 2004, the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University in New York became the depository institution for the Human Rights Watch Archive, an active collection that documents decades of human rights investigations around the world. The archive was transferred from its previous location at the Norlin Library at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The archive includes administrative files, public relations documents, as well as case and country files. With some exceptions for security considerations, the Columbia University community and the public have access to field notes, taped and transcribed interviews with alleged victims of human rights violations, video and audio tapes, and other materials documenting the organization’s activities since its founding in 1978 as Helsinki Watch.<ref>[http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2004/03/ljarchives/human-rights-watch-archive-moves-to-columbia-university/ ''Library Journal'', March 11, 2004]</ref>

== Comparison with Amnesty International ==
Human Rights Watch and [[Amnesty International]] are the only two Western-oriented international human rights organizations operating in most situations of severe oppression or abuse worldwide.<ref name="SocialSciences.in"/>  The major differences lie in the group's structure and methods for promoting change.

Amnesty International is a mass-membership organization. Mobilization of those members is the organization's central advocacy tool. Human Rights Watch's main products are its crisis-directed research and lengthy reports, whereas Amnesty International lobbies and writes detailed reports, but also focuses on mass letter-writing campaigns, adopting individuals as "[[prisoners of conscience]]" and lobbying for their release. Human Rights Watch will openly lobby for specific actions for other governments to take against human rights offenders, including naming specific individuals for arrest, or for [[International sanctions|sanctions]] to be levied against certain countries, recently calling for punitive sanctions against the top leaders in [[Sudan]] who have overseen a killing campaign in [[Darfur]]. The group has also called for human rights activists who have been detained in Sudan to be released.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE4AQ00Q.html Human rights group says activists detained in Sudan]</ref>

Its documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analysis of the political and historical backgrounds of the conflicts concerned, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI's reports, on the other hand, tend to contain less analysis, and instead focus on specific abuses of rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 2010 ''[[The Times]]'' of London wrote that HRW has "all but eclipsed" Amnesty International.  According to ''The Times'', instead of being supported by a mass membership, as AI is, HRW depends on wealthy donors who like to see the organization's reports make headlines. For this reason, according to ''The Times'', HRW tends to "concentrate too much on places that the media already cares about", especially in disproportionate coverage of Israel.<ref name="Nazi scandal engulfs Human Rights Watch" >[http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/ngo_monitor_research_featured_in_sunday_times_nazi_scandal_engulfs_human_rights_watch_ NGO Monitor research featured in Sunday Times: "Nazi scandal engulfs Human Rights Watch"], March 28, 2010.
