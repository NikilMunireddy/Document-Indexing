In 1745, two Scots, James Lee and Lewis Kennedy, established the Vineyard Nursery, over six acres devoted to landscaping plants. During the next hundred and fifty years the nursery introduced many new plants to England, including [[fuchsia]] and the standard [[Rhododendron maximum|rose tree]].<ref>{{cite web |date=20 August 2010 |title=History of Olympia|publisher=London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Council |url=http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/History_of_Olympia.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100911143455/http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/History_of_Olympia.asp |archivedate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author=Willson, Eleanor Joan |year=1961 |title=James Lee and the Vineyard Nursery, Hammersmith |location=London |publisher=Hammersmith Local History Group}}</ref>

<!--much of the geography is in fact here-->
[[File:Hammersmith panorama.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2.5|The [[river Thames]] at Hammersmith]]

Hammersmith is located at the confluence of a key arterial route out of central London (the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]]) with several local feeder roads and a bridge over the Thames. The focal point of the district is the commercial centre (the Broadway Centre) located at this confluence, which houses a shopping centre, bus station, an [[Hammersmith tube station (Piccadilly and District lines)|Underground station]] and an office complex.

[[File:King Street Hammersmith.jpg|thumb|right|King Street]]

Stretching about 750m westwards from this centre is [[King Street, Hammersmith|King Street]], Hammersmith's main shopping street. Named after [[John King (Bishop of London)|John King, Bishop of London]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hamunitedcharities.org.uk/about-us/huc-history |title=HUC History |publisher=Hammersmith United Charities |accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> it contains a second shopping centre ([[Kings Mall]]), many small shops, the Town Hall, the [[Lyric Hammersmith|Lyric Theatre]], a cinema, the [[Polish Social and Cultural Association|Polish community centre]] and two hotels. King Street is supplemented by other shops along [[Shepherds Bush Road]] to the north, [[Fulham Palace Road]] to the south and [[Hammersmith Road]] to the east.

Hammersmith's office activity takes place mainly to the eastern side of its centre, along Hammersmith Road and in the [[The London Ark|Ark]], an office complex to the south of the [[Overpass|flyover]] which traverses the area. The offices of [[International SOS]], [[Bechtel]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Pokémon]], [[L'Oréal]], [[AOL|AOL UK]], [[Accor|Accor UK]], [[Next Fifteen Communications]], [[US Airways]], [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]], [[Frost Meadowcroft]], [[Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands]] and [[Royal Jordanian|Royal Jordanian Airlines]] are all found in Hammersmith.

Two [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] hospitals provide jobs in Hammersmith - [[Charing Cross Hospital]] to the south of the centre on Fulham Palace Road and Hammersmith Hospital in the north. Charing Cross Hospital is a large multi-disciplinary hospital with accident & emergency and teaching departments run by the [[Imperial College School of Medicine]].

==Architecture==
Architecturally, Hammersmith is notable for
* [[The London Ark|"The Ark" office building]] designed by British architect Ralph Erskine and was completed in April 1992<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savills.com/intinvest/the_ark.html |title=Savills UK &#124; 404 |publisher=Savills.com |date= |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> as the name suggests it has the appearance of a large ship.
* "Hammersmith Bridge Road Surgery" Doctor's office<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/hammersmith/ |title=Hammersmith Bridge Road Surgery London by Guy Greenfield |publisher=Galinsky.com |date= |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>
* "[[22 St Peter's Square (London)|22 St Peter's Square]]" the former Royal Chiswick Laundry and [[Island Records]] HQ converted to architects studios and offices by [[Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands]]. It has a Hammersmith Society Conservation award plaque (2009)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ealinggazette.co.uk/ealing-news/local-ealing-news/2009/05/27/best-and-worst-of-hammersmith-and-fulham-buildings-named-64767-23726569|title=Best and worst of Hammersmith and Fulham buildings named|author=Dan Hodges}}</ref> and has been included in tours in Architecture Week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.architectureweek.org.uk/event.asp?eventURN=3638 |title=architectureweek.org.uk |publisher=architectureweek.org.uk |date=24 June 2007 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>
* Several of Hammersmith's pubs are [[listed building]]s, including the ''[[Black Lion (Hammersmith)|Black Lion]]'', ''[[The Dove (Hammersmith)|The Dove]]'', ''[[The George (Hammersmith)|The George]]'', ''[[The Hop Poles]]'', the ''[[Hope and Anchor (Hammersmith)|Hope and Anchor]]'', the ''[[Salutation, Hammersmith|Salutation Inn]]'' and ''[[The Swan (Hammersmith)|The Swan]]''.
* Also listed are Hammersmith's two [[parish church]]es, [[St Paul's, Hammersmith|St Paul]] (the town's original church, rebuilt in the 1890s) and [[St Peter's Church, Hammersmith|St Peter]], built in the 1820s.

==Culture and entertainment==

* [[Riverside Studios]] is a cinema, performance space, bar and cafe. Riverside Studios was formerly [[BBC]] studios used for TV productions.
* [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Hammersmith Theatre]]
* [[Hammersmith Apollo]] concert hall and theatre (formerly the Carling Hammersmith Apollo, '''Hammersmith Odeon''', and before that the Gaumont Cinema).
* [[Hammersmith Palais]] nightclub, which is now disused and set to be demolished.
* [[POSK]], the Polish cultural centre, is on King Street.<ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3Z3XzmHduXQC&pg=PA255 |title=Eccentric London |author=Benedict Le Vay}}</ref>

[[File:the dove pub1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The famous ''Dove'' public house - entrance in the alley that is the only surviving trace of the old Hammersmith Village. (September 2005)]]
* ''[[The Dove (Hammersmith)|The Dove]]'' is a riverside pub with, reputedly, the smallest bar in the world, frequented by [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Graham Greene]]. The narrow alley in which it stands is the only remnant of the riverside village of Hammersmith, the bulk of which was demolished in the 1930s. [[Furnivall Gardens]], which lies to the east, covers the site of [[Hammersmith Creek]] and the High Bridge. The site of the creek can be ascertained by a mound near the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Great West Road]].

American broadcasters [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] both have their London news bureau in Hammersmith.

==Leisure and social activities==
In addition to the cinema and pubs of King Street, leisure activity also takes place along Hammersmith's pedestrianised riverside, home to a number of pubs, rowing clubs and the riverside park of Furnival Gardens. Hammersmith has a municipal park [[Ravenscourt Park]] to the west of the centre. Its facilities include tennis courts, a basketball court, a bowling lawn, a paddling pool and playgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/features/5576/5.html |title=Time Out, "London's best local parks," 29 August 2008 |publisher=Timeout.com |date= |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> The whole area is covered by the same W6 postcode as Hammersmith town centre.

Hammersmith is the historical home of the [[West London Penguin Swimming and Water Polo Club]], formerly known as the ''Hammersmith Penguin Swimming Club''.

"Round Table London Hammersmith 48" is a community service and networking club for men aged 18 to 45. Regular meetings are held at the London Corinthian Sailing Club on the banks of the river Thames.

The "Polish Social and Cultural Centre" (known as [[POSK]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://posk.org |title=posk.org |publisher=posk.org |date= |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> is based in Hammersmith, with facilities including a library, a theatre, restaurants and cafes, and houses many other Polish organisations.

==Transport==
[[File:Hammersmith Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Hammersmith Bridge]]]]

The area is on the main A4 [[trunk road]] heading west from central London towards the [[M4 motorway]] and [[Heathrow Airport]]. The A4, a busy commuter route, passes over the area's main road junction, Hammersmith Gyratory System, on a long viaduct, the [[Hammersmith Flyover]]. [[Hammersmith Bridge]], the first [[suspension bridge]] over the River Thames, carries traffic to and from Barnes and southwest London.

[[File:Hammersmith.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hammersmith tube roundel]]

The centre of Hammersmith is served by two [[London Underground]] stations named Hammersmith: [[Hammersmith tube station (Hammersmith & City and Circle lines)|one]] is served by the [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] and [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] lines and [[Hammersmith tube station (Piccadilly and District lines)|the other]] is served by the [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]] and [[District line|District]] lines. The latter tube station is part of a larger office, retail and transport development, locally known as "The Broadway Centre". [[Hammersmith Broadway]], itself, stretches from the junction of Queen Caroline Street and King Street in the west to the junction of Hammersmith Road and Butterwick in the east. It forms the north side of the gyratory system also known as Hammersmith Roundabout. The Broadway Shopping Centre includes a large modern bus station, which is open 24 hours a day and served by a large number of buses, night buses, airport transfer buses and some long distance coaches.

The length of King Street places the westernmost shops and offices closest to [[Ravenscourt Park tube station]] on the [[District line]], one stop west of Hammersmith itself.

Hammersmith used to have two public passenger transport depots: Hammersmith [[Trolleybus]] Depot (coded "HB") situated opposite [[Fulham Palace]] Road and a Motor Bus Garage, known as Riverside (coded "R") to stop confusion with "HB". Riverside was originally a mansion and after the bus operations ceased the fascia of the building was listed.

==In literature and music==

Hammersmith features in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Great Expectations]]'' as the home of the Pocket family. Pip resides with the Pockets in their house by the river and goes boating on the river.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Calvert |first1=Laurie |title=A Teacher's Guide to the Signet Classics Edition of Charles Dickens's Great Expectations |url=http://www.penguin.com/static/pdf/teachersguides/greatexp.pdf |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>

[[William Morris]]'s utopian novel ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' (1890) describes a journey up the river from Hammersmith towards [[Oxford]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Creating a utopian future: William Morris's News from Nowhere |url=http://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/from-socialist-news-to-fine-art-printing-william-morriss-news-from-nowhere |publisher=[[The British Library]] |accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> it is of growing interest to contemporary [[ecological]] and [[socialist]] political movements.

In 1930, [[Gustav Holst]] composed ''Hammersmith'', a work for military band (later rewritten for orchestra), reflecting his impressions of the area, having lived across the river in Barnes for nearly forty years.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Music of Gustav Holst (1930) Hammersmith Op. 52 |url=http://www.gustavholst.info/compositions/listing.php?work=7 |website=GustavHolst.info |accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> It begins with a haunting musical depiction of the River Thames flowing underneath Hammersmith Bridge. Holst taught music at [[St Paul's Girls' School]] and composed many of his most famous works there, including his ''[[The Planets]]'' suite. A music room in the school is named after him.<ref name=ODNBHolst/>
