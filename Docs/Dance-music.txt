'''Dance music''' is [[music]] composed specifically to facilitate or accompany [[dance|dancing]]. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek vases]] sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving [[medieval dance]]s. In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, the major dance styles were [[noble court]] dances (see [[Baroque dance]]). In the [[classical music era]], the minuet was frequently used as a third [[movement (music)|movement]], although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The [[waltz]] also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the [[romantic music]] period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the [[barcarolle]], [[mazurka]],[[ecossaise]],[[ballade]] and [[polonaise]].

Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[social dance]] music. During the early 20th century, [[ballroom dancing]] gained popularity among the [[working class]] who attended public [[dance hall]]s. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, called the Swing era, [[Swing music]] was the popular dance music. In the 1950s, [[rock and roll]] became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music. The rise of [[disco]] in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, [[electronic dance music]] was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of [[popular music]] commonly played in dance music [[nightclub]]s, [[radio station]]s, [[concert|shows]] and [[rave]]s. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved.

==Origins==

Folk dance music is music accompanying [[Folk dance|traditional dance]] and may be contrasted with historical/classical, and popular/commercial dance music. An example of folk dance music in the United States is the [[old-time music]] played at [[square dance]]s and [[contra dance]]s.

==Historical dance music==
{{See also|History of dance|History of ballet|Historical dance}}

While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek vases]] sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving [[medieval dance]]s such as [[Carol (music)|carols]] and the [[Estampie]]. The earliest of these surviving dances are almost as old as Western staff-based [[music notation]].

===By period===

The [[Renaissance dance]] music was written for instruments such as the [[lute]], [[viol]], [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]], [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and the [[sackbut]].

In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, the major dance styles were [[noble court]] dances (see [[Baroque dance]]). Examples of dances include the [[courante|French courante]], [[sarabande]], [[minuet]] and [[gigue]]. Collections of dances were often collected together as [[suite (music)|dance suites]].

In the [[classical music era]], the minuet was frequently used as a third [[movement (music)|movement]] in four-movement non-vocal works such as [[sonata (music)|sonatas]], [[string quartet]]s, and [[symphony|symphonies]], although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The [[waltz]] also arose later in the classical era, as the minuet evolved into the [[scherzo]] (literally, "joke"; a faster-paced minuet).

Both remained part of the [[romantic music]] period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the [[barcarolle]], [[mazurka]] and [[polonaise]]. Also in the romantic music era, the growth and development of [[ballet]] extended the composition of dance music to a new height. Frequently, dance music was a part of [[opera]].

==Popular dance music==

Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[social dance]] music.

===By genre===
Dance music works often bear the name of the corresponding dance, e.g. [[waltz]]es, the [[Tango music|tango]], the [[bolero]], the [[can-can]], [[minuet]]s, [[salsa music|salsa]], various kinds of [[jig]]s and the [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Other dance forms include [[contradance]], the [[merengue (music)|merengue]] ([[Dominican Republic]]), and the [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]]. Often it is difficult to know whether the name of the music came first or the name of the dance.

[[Ballad]]s are commonly chosen for [[slow-dance]] routines. However ballads have been commonly deemed as the opposite of dance music in terms of their tempo. Originally, the ballad was a type of dance as well (hence the name "ballad", from the same root as "[[ballroom]]" and "[[ballet]]"). Ballads are still danced on the [[Faeroe Islands]].

====Dansband====
{{Main|Dansband}}

"Dansband" ("Dance band") is a term in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] for bands who play a kind of [[popular music]], "dansbandsmusik" ("Dance band music"), to [[partner dance]] to. These terms came into use around 1970, and before that, many of the bands were classified as "[[pop music|pop groups]]". This type of music is mostly popular in the [[Nordic countries]].

====Disco====
{{Main|Disco}}

Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[Salsa music|salsa]]. It was most popular during the mid to late 1970s, though it has had brief resurgences afterwards. It inspired the [[electronic dance music]] genre.

====Electronic====

{{Main|Electronic dance music}}

By 1981, a new form of dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of [[popular music]] commonly played in dance music [[nightclub]]s, [[radio station]]s, [[concert|shows]] and [[rave]]s. During its gradual decline in the late 1970s, [[disco]] became influenced by computerization (the first notable fully synthesized disco hit was "[[I Feel Love]]" by [[Donna Summer]]).<ref>http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct09/articles/classictracks_1009.htm</ref> [[Music loop|Looping]], [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[segue]]ing as found in disco continued to be used as creative techniques within [[trance music]], [[techno|techno music]] and especially [[house music]].

Electronic dance music experienced a boom after the proliferation of [[personal computer]]s in the 1980s, manifest in the dance element of [[Tony Wilson]]'s [[Ha√ßienda]] scene (in Manchester) and London clubs like Delirium, The Trip, and Shoom. The ongoing influence of Shoom can be seen in its 25th anniversary party, held at Cable Nightclub on 8 December 2012, which sold out in four days. The scene rapidly expanded to the Summer Of Love in [[Ibiza]], which became the European capital of house and trance. Clubs like [[Sundissential]] and [[Manumission]] became household names with British, German and Italian tourists.

Many music genres that made use of electronic instruments developed into contemporary styles mainly due to the [[MIDI]] protocol, which enabled computers, synthesizers, [[sound card]]s, samplers, and drum machines to interact with each other and achieve the full synchronization of sounds. Electronic dance music is typically composed using [[computers]] and [[synthesizers]], and rarely has any physical [[musical instrument|instruments]]. Instead, this is replaced by [[Digital data|digital]] or [[electronic musical instrument|electronic]] sounds, with a 4/4 beat. Many producers of this kind of music however, such as [[Darren Tate]] and [[MJ Cole]], were trained in classical music before they moved into the electronic medium.

Associated with dance music are usually commercial tracks that may not easily be categorized, such as "[[The Power (Snap! song)|The Power]]" by [[Snap!]], "[[No Limit (song)|No Limit]]" by [[2 Unlimited]], "[[Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)]]" by [[C+C Music Factory]], and the [[Beatmasters]]' "Rok Da House" but the term "dance music" is applied to many forms of [[electronic music]], both commercial and non-commercial.

Some of the most popular upbeat genres include [[house music|house]], [[techno]], [[Drum and bass|drum & bass]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]], [[Hardcore techno|hardcore]], [[electronica]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[breakbeat]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[psychedelic trance]], [[UK garage]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]]. There are also much slower styles, such as [[downtempo]], [[Chill out music|chillout]] and [[nu jazz]].

Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved. Subgenres of [[House music|house]] include [[acid house]], [[electro house]], [[hard house]], [[funky house]], [[deep house]], [[tribal house]], [[hip house]], [[tech house]] and [[US garage]]. Subgenres of [[Drum and bass|drum & bass]] include [[techstep]], [[hardstep]], [[jump-up (drum and bass)|jump-up]], [[Intelligent drum and bass|intelligent D&B/atmospheric D&B]], [[liquid funk]], [[sambass]], [[drumfunk]], [[neurofunk]] and [[ragga jungle]]. Subgenres of other styles include [[progressive breaks]], [[rave breaks]], [[booty bass]], [[Goa trance]], [[hard trance]], [[hardstyle]], [[minimal techno]], [[Gabber|gabber techno]], [[breakcore]], [[broken beat]], [[trip hop]], [[folktronica]] and [[Glitch (music)|glitch]]. [[Speed garage]], [[breakstep]], [[2-step garage|2-step]], [[Bassline (music genre)|bassline]], [[Grime (music)|grime]], [[UK funky]], [[future garage]] and the [[reggae]]-inspired [[dubstep]] are all subgenres of [[UK garage]].

===By decade===

====1900s‚Äì1910s====

During the early 20th century, [[ballroom dancing]] gained popularity among the [[working class]] who attended public [[dance hall]]s.

====1920s====

{{Main|Jazz Age}}

Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. Nightclubs were frequented by large numbers of people at which a form of [[jazz]], which was characterized by fancy orchestras with strings instruments and complex arrangements, became the standard music at clubs. A particularly popular dance was the [[fox-trot]]. At the time this music was simply called jazz, although today people refer to it as "white jazz" or [[big band]].

====1970s====
It was with the rise of [[disco]] in the early 1970s that dance music once again became popular with the public. Disco was characterized by the use of real orchestral instruments, such as strings, which had largely been abandoned during the 1950s because of rock music. In contrast to the 1920s, however, the use of live orchestras in night clubs was extremely rare due to its expense. [[Disc jockey]]s (commonly known as DJs) played recorded music at these new clubs. The disco craze reached its peaked in the late 1970s when the word disco became synonymous with "dance music" and nightclubs were referred to as discos.
