==Company history==

===Founding and Def Jam under Columbia/CBS Records-Sony Music Entertainment===
Def Jam was founded by [[Rick Rubin]] in his dormitory in Weinstein Hall at [[New York University]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html?pagewanted=all|author=Herschberg, Lynn|title=The Music Man|work=[[New York Times Magazine]]|date=September 2, 2007}}</ref> and its first release was a single by his punk-rock group [[Hose (band)|Hose]]. [[Russell Simmons]] joined Rubin shortly after they were introduced to each other by [[Vincent Gallo]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Turner |first=Edwin |url=http://biblioklept.org/2011/12/17/i-review-def-jam-25-the-overstuffed-illustrated-oral-history-of-a-record-label-that-helped-change-american-culture/ |title=I Review Def Jam 25, the Overstuffed Illustrated Oral History of a Record Label that Helped Change American Culture |publisher=Biblioklept |date=2011-12-17 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}</ref> The first single released with a Def Jam Recordings logo was [[T La Rock]] & [[Jazzy Jay]]'s "It's Yours."  The first releases with Def Jam Recordings catalog numbers were [[LL Cool J]]'s "[[I Need a Beat]]" and the [[Beastie Boys]]' "[[Rock Hard]]," both in 1984. The singles sold well, eventually leading to a distribution deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] (which would later become Sony Music Entertainment) through [[Columbia Records]] the following year. This created a short-lived subsidiary label called '''OBR Records''', catered toward R&B artists — the first artist signed to that imprint was [[Oran "Juice" Jones]], who enjoyed success with his hit single "The Rain". A few years later, Def Jam started another subsidiary label called '''Rush Associated Labels''',<ref>{{cite web|title=Rush Associated Labels|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/11818-Rush-Associated-Labels|website=discogs.com|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref> which became the home to [[Nice & Smooth]] and [[EPMD]] after both acts were acquired due to the folding of their former label [[Sleeping Bag Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Maurice|title=Indianapolis: CRUSH Ent Presents: EPMD & DJ Scratch @ The Vogue|url=http://bestevents.us/indianapolis-crush-ent-presents-epmd-amp-dj-scratch-the/418969|website=bestevents.us|publisher=Best Events|accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref> Other acts on the RAL subsidiary included [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]], [[Flatlinerz]], [[Domino (rapper)|Domino]], [[Warren G]] and [[Jayo Felony]]. Def Jam also signed its first and only [[thrash metal]] band, [[Slayer]], in 1986, and the band's [[Reign in Blood|third]] and [[South of Heaven|fourth]] albums were the only two Def Jam releases to be distributed through [[Geffen Records]] under [[Warner Bros. Records]] as opposed to Columbia/CBS. As the decade drew to a close, the label signed [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], whose controversial lyrical content garnered the company both critical acclaim and disdain.  [[Lyor Cohen]] became president of Def Jam in 1988, after winning a power struggle with Rubin, who would shortly thereafter leave the company to form Def American Recordings (now known as [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]).  Rubin would take [[Slayer]] with him to Def American in its initial stages.

===Def Jam under PolyGram Records===
By 1992, despite recent multi-platinum selling releases from [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], and [[EPMD]], Def Jam ran into severe financial troubles and was faced with folding. However, in 1994, [[PolyGram]] purchased Sony's 50% stake in Def Jam Recordings — subsequently bringing the label into its fold. Following PolyGram's purchase, Def Jam distributed the [[Violator Records]]-signed artist [[Warren G]]'s ''[[Regulate... G Funk Era]]'' album, which went triple platinum and brought much-needed revenue to Def Jam through its distribution deal with Violator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1994_Nov_16/ai_15864732 |title=PolyGram acquires 50% of Def Jam Recordings |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref>

PolyGram acquired an additional 10% in Def Jam Recordings in 1996, further strengthening its ownership of Def Jam. Shortly thereafter, Rush Associated Labels was renamed Def Jam Music Group. The label remained profitable as its veteran star LL Cool J released his successful album ''[[Mr. Smith (album)|Mr. Smith]]'' in 1995. The label later signed [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], whose debut album ''[[Ill Na Na]]'' became a platinum seller in 1997. 

===Def Jam under Universal Music Group===
In 1999, PolyGram was purchased by [[Seagram]] and merged with the MCA family of labels, which became [[Universal Music Group]]. It then purchased the remaining interest of Def Jam Recordings from Russell Simmons for a reported $100 million. UMG merged Def Jam with [[Island Records]] to form [[the Island Def Jam Music Group]]. Despite the formation of IDJMG, both Def Jam and Island continue to operate as separate imprints underneath the bigger umbrella.

Lyor Cohen was appointed president of IDJMG, and [[Kevin Liles]] succeeded him as president of Def Jam. In 1999, Def Jam created their second [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] spin-off label called '''Def Soul Recordings''', which inherited many of Island Records' urban artists (and also some from [[Mercury Records]]), including [[Dru Hill]] and its lead singer [[Sisqó]], [[the Isley Brothers]] and [[Kelly Price]]. Def Soul also issued recordings by [[Musiq]], [[Montell Jordan]], [[Case (singer)|Case]], [[112 (band)|112]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and [[Christina Milian]]. Island's [[4th & B'way Records]] was also folded into Def Jam.

Also in 1999, the label began to distribute releases by [[Murder Inc. Records]], run by former Def Jam executive [[Irv Gotti]]. Murder Inc.'s roster of artists would include [[Ja Rule]], [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]], [[Lloyd (singer)|Lloyd]], Vita. The following year, it launched another subsidiary, ''[[Def Jam South]]'', which focused on [[Southern rap]] and distributed releases from labels such as [[Disturbing tha Peace]], whose artists have included [[Ludacris]], [[Chingy]], and [[Bobby Valentino (American singer)|Bobby Valentino]]. Russell Simmons tapped Texas-born and raised rap legend [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] (aka Brad Jordan) as the original head of Def Jam South. After about a 4-year run at Def Jam South, Scarface negotiated a release from the company in 2003. The label is currently run by Miami-based [[DJ Khaled]].

===Def Jam in the 2000s===
In 2001, Lyor Cohen announced '''Def Jam Germany''', the first international Def Jam company. This increased the label's presence around the world. Def Jam Germany signed German rappers Spezializtz, and Philly MC. The label was located in Berlin and opened on May 23, 2000. In addition to signing and marketing local artists, Def Jam Germany also marketed all U.S. signed Def Jam artists in the German territory. But the German division folded just two years later in 2002. Many of the artists were picked up by Universal/Urban, while others did not get a new contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netzfeuilleton.de/hiphop-geschichte-label-def-jam/ |title=Hiphop Geschichte des Labels DefJam|publisher=netzfeuilleton.de |date=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2014-11-14}}</ref>

The second international label is a Japanese branch, {{nihongo|'''Def Jam Japan'''|デフ・ジャム・ジャパン|Defu Jamu Japan}}, also founded in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universal-music.co.jp/defjam/ |title=Def Jam Japan (A Universal Music Company) |publisher=Universal-music.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref> Its artist roster has included [[Ai (singer)|AI]], [[Teriyaki Boyz]], and [[Nitro Microphone Underground]].

In 2003, Def Soul was absorbed into its Def Jam parent. A year later, Murder Inc. became the center of a [[money laundering]] investigation involving illegal profits from [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,145482,00.html |title=Hip-Hop's Irv 'Gotti' Surrenders to FBI - Celebrity Gossip &#124; Entertainment News &#124; Arts And Entertainment |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2005-01-27 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref> leading to the label's eventual release from its distribution contract by 2005. [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] was sold to the company in 2004, by which time it had launched the career of producer-turned-rapper [[Kanye West]].

[[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] helped the company to great heights during 1998 and 1999 selling millions of records and revived hardcore hip hop during this time. 
The same year, Cohen left IDJMG for [[Warner Music Group]], and was replaced by former Arista executive [[L.A. Reid]]. An unhappy Liles eventually decided to follow Cohen to Warner.<ref name="jayzsuit">Ogunnaike, Lola (Aug. 28, 2005). "[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/arts/music/28ogun.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Jay-Z, From Superstar to Suit]". ''New York Times''. Retrieved March 23, 2008.</ref> A bidding war for [[Jay-Z]]'s contract began, and Reid appointed Jay-Z president of Def Jam.<ref name="jayzsuit" />

Under Jay-Z's leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&B singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Ne-Yo]]. At the end of 2007, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the President and CEO of Def Jam in order to start his new venture, [[Roc Nation]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1578538/20071224/jay_z.jhtml |title=Jay-Z Stepping Down As Def Jam President/CEO - News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref> Following Jay-Z's departure, L.A. Reid took over leadership of the label, as opposed to hiring a replacement. In June 2008, [[Shakir Stewart]] was appointed as Executive Vice President of Def Jam, a position left vacant since December 2007.

Also main producer of distribution Anthony Maddigan which co-operate with [[MTV]] Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anton-maddigan/7a/491/a5b/ | title= Def Jam Producer; Linkedin Profile}}</ref>

===Def Jam in the 2010s===
On March 14, 2012, it was announced that former Warner Bros. Records executive Joie Manda would become the first President of Def Jam since [[Jay-Z]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1681053/def-jam-new-president-joie-manda.jhtml |author=Markman, Rob|title= Def Jam Names Joie Manda New President; MTV News |publisher=[[MTV.com]] |date=2012-03-12 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref> Until March 2013 when he exited his post at Def Jam and it was announced he'd be heading up the urban division of Interscope Records by his former boss, Barry Weiss.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|title=Joie Manda Resigns as Def Jam President, Moving to Interscope|author=Aswad, Jem|date=March 28, 2013|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/1554917/joie-manda-resigns-as-def-jam-president-moving-to-interscope}}</ref> [[The-Dream]] served as Def Jam's executive vice president between 2012 and 2014. Currently, [[No I.D.]] upholds the position of executive vice president after helping to establish [[GOOD Music]] with Kanye West; Steve Bartels is the current CEO of Def Jam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2014/04/03/no-i-d-is-the-new-executive-vice-president-of-def-jam-recordings/|title=No I.D.

In a press release serviced by Universal Music Group, the label will now be reorganizing Def Jam Recordings, Island Records and [[Motown Records]] all as separate entities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2014/04/island-def-jam-will-longer-exist/|title=Island Def Jam Is Over|author=miranda|date=1 April 2014|work=XXL Mag}}</ref>
