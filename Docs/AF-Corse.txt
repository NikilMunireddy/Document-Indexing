'''AF Corse''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[auto racing]] team founded by former racing driver [[Amato Ferrari]] in 1995 in [[Piacenza]].  Strongly linked to the [[Maserati]] and [[Ferrari]] brands, AF Corse currently competes in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], [[European Le Mans Series]], [[Asian Le Mans Series]], and [[International GT Open]], and are four-time champions of the GT2 class of the former [[FIA GT Championship]].<ref name="2007 Champions">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2007 | title = 2007 Champions | publisher = [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080327221247/http://fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2007| archivedate= 27 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The team has also entered cars under Advanced Engineering, AT Racing, Pecom Racing, Spirit of Race and [[Enzo Potolicchio|8Star Motorsports]], and in association with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] (AF Waltrip).

==History==
In 1995, Amato Ferrari (no relation to the family of [[Enzo Ferrari]] and his [[Ferrari]] car company) retired from driving and chose to concentrate on team management, initially entering the [[Italian Superturismo Championship]].  Following the series' demise in 1999, Ferrari launched a new team known as AF Corse, named for his initials.  The team turned to [[sports car racing]], and within a year was contracted by [[Maserati]].  AF Corse was tasked with the development, maintenance, and transport of the Trofeo Cup, a [[One-Design|one-make series]] based on the [[Maserati Coupé]].  The company would continue in this position until 2005.

During 2004, Maserati approached AF Corse about running their latest development in sports car racing: the new [[Maserati MC12]] for the international [[FIA GT Championship]].  The team aided Maserati in testing and developing the car before running the two new racers in their home event at [[2004 FIA GT Imola 500 km|Imola]].  Drivers Fabrizio de Simone, [[Andrea Bertolini]], [[Mika Salo]], and [[Johnny Herbert]] were all be assigned to the team, eventually earning AF Corse two victories before the season ended.<ref name="AF Corse">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/teambio.php?countkey=0 | title = Team Biography: AF Corse Motorola | publisher =  [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080312004742/http://www.fiagt.com/teambio.php?countkey=0| archivedate= 12 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Once the development of the MC12 was satisfied, the company returned to running the Trofeo Cup, as well as running a Maserati Light in the 2005 [[Italian GT Championship]].

AF Corse returned to the FIA GT Championship in 2006.  This time however they would be running the latest Ferrari offering, the [[Ferrari F430]], as well as competing in the series' lower category, the GT2 class.  Salo was retained in the driving line-up, while newcomers [[Rui Águas (racing driver)|Rui Águas]], [[Jaime Melo]], and [[Matteo Bobbi]] completed the standard line-up.  Victory was earned in the teams debut at [[2006 FIA GT Tourist Trophy|Silverstone]], and another two were earned over the season, including at the [[Spa 24 Hours]].  AF Corse won the class championship, beating fellow Ferrari competitor Scuderia Ecosse.<ref name="2006 Champions">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2006 | title = 2006 Champions | publisher = [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080327221242/http://fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2006| archivedate= 27 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The company retained their connection to Maserati however, entering a trio of cars in the new [[FIA GT3 European Championship]].

As defending champions, AF Corse remained in the FIA GT Championship in 2007, although much on the team changed.  While the Ferrari F430s remained, all new drivers were introduced to the team.  [[Dirk Müller (racing driver)|Dirk Müller]], [[Toni Vilander]], [[Gianmaria Bruni]], and [[Stephane Ortelli]] took over driving duties for the season, while [[Motorola]] announced their full sponsorship of the squad.  The two cars dominated the [[2007 FIA GT Championship season|2007 season]], winning nine of the ten events on the schedule and wrapping up another championship.<ref name="2007 Champions" />

For 2008, AF Corse expanded to a three car team in the GT2 class.  Vilander and Bruni are retained in the lead car, while Biagi returns to the squad to be joined by Christian Montanari in the second entry.  The third car will be run under the Advanced Engineering name, with [[Argentinian]] [[Matías Russo]] and [[Luís Pérez Companc]].

In 2010, the [[FIA GT Championship]] was dissolved and two new championships were born from it. The GT1 class of the former series became the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]] while the GT2 class formed the [[FIA GT2 European Championship]]. The GT2 series was suspended due to lack of entries. As a result, the AF Corse team joined the [[Le Mans Series]]. For the [[2010 Le Mans Series season|2010 season]], the team fielded three Ferrari F430 GT2s for the series' GT2 class. Drivers [[Matías Russo]] and [[Luís Pérez Companc]] campaigned the #94 Ferrari with [[Toni Vilander]] and former Grand Prix drivers [[Jean Alesi]] and [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] in the #95. [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]] regulars, with the [[Risi Competizione]] team, [[Jaime Melo]] and [[Gianmaria Bruni]] drove the Ferrari #96.

In 2011 AF Corse entered the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] with brand new Ferrari 458 Italia GT2s as well as the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] with Ferrari 458 Italia GT3s. AF Corse won the ILMC in the GTE-Pro category, including the final round at [[Petit Le Mans]]. It also won the FIA GT3 driver's championship with [[Francisco Catellaci]] and [[Federico Leo]].

The team also joined the [[International GT Open]] for the [[2010 International GT Open season|2010 season]] in the Super GT class, which is largely reminiscent of the GT2 rules in the [[Le Mans Series]]. The team fields two Ferrari GT2 cars for drivers [[Jack Gerber]] & [[Rui Águas (racing driver)|Rui Águas]] in the #6 car and [[Pierre Kaffer]] and [[Álvaro Barba]] in the #8 Ferrari. AF Corse will also field a third Ferrari (#7) for the [[AT Racing]] team with drivers [[Alexander Talkanitsa]] and his son [[Alexander Talkanitsa, Jr]].

For 2012, AF Corse competed in a variety of sports car championships throughout Europe and globally, including the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] and [[GT1 World Championship]] with Ferrari F458 Italia GT2s and Ferrari F458 Italia GT3s, including a co-branded for GTE-Am class car with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]], AF Waltrip.  At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, amateur driver [[Piergiuseppe Perazzini]] collided with the No. 8 Toyota driven by overall-contender [[Anthony Davidson]], sending the Toyota airborne at the Mulsanne Corner.  Perazzini's Ferrari also flipped and landed on its roof after hitting the tyre barrier. Davidson suffered two broken vertebrae in the crash but was able to pull himself from the car in the immediate aftermath of the accident - though of course he was forced to abandon the race.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/motorsport/18474792 | title = Anthony Davidson breaks back after Le Mans 24 Hour accident | publisher = [[BBC]] | work = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 17 June 2012 | accessdate =25 June 2013}}</ref>
