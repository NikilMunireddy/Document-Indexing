The '''Indian Army''' ('''IA'''; <small>[[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]</small>: ''Bhāratīya Thalsēnā'') is the [[army|land-based branch]] and the largest component of the [[Indian Armed Forces]]. The [[President of India]] serves as Supreme Commander of the Indian Army,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presidentofindia.nic.in/about.htm|title=About - The President of India|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref> and it is commanded by the [[Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army|Chief of Army Staff]] (COAS), who is a [[Four-star rank|four-star]] [[General officer|General]]. Two officers have been conferred the rank of [[Field marshal (India)|Field marshal]], a [[Five-star rank]], which is a ceremonial position of great honour. The Indian Army originated from the armies of the [[East India Company]], which eventually became the [[British Indian Army]], and the armies of the princely states, which finally became the national army after [[Independence of India|independence]]. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in a number of battles and campaigns across the world, earning a large number of [[Battle and theatre honours of the Indian Army|battle and theatre honours]] before and after Independence.<ref name='Sarbans'>{{cite book |title=Battle Honours of the Indian Army 1757–1971 |last=Singh |first=Sarbans |year=1993 |publisher=Vision Books |location=New Delhi |isbn=8170941156}}</ref>

The primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure [[national security]] and unity, [[Defence (military)|defending]] the nation from external aggression and threats, and maintaining peace and security within its borders. It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other disturbances, like [[Operation Surya Hope]], and can also be requisitioned by the government to cope with internal threats. It is a major component of national power alongside the [[Indian Navy]] and the [[Indian Air Force]].<ref>Headquarters Army Training Command. "Indian Army Doctrine". October 2004.

Other major operations undertaken by the army include [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]], [[Operation Meghdoot]] and [[Operation Cactus]]. Apart from conflicts, the army has conducted large peace time exercises like [[Operation Brasstacks]] and Exercise Shoorveer, and it has also been an active participant in numerous [[Indian Army United Nations peacekeeping missions|United Nations peacekeeping missions]] including the ones in Cyprus, Lebanon, Congo, Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam, Namibia, El Salvador, Liberia, Mozambique and Somalia.

The Indian Army has a [[Regiment#Regimental system|regimental system]], but is operationally and geographically divided into [[Indian Army#Commands|seven commands]], with the basic field formation being a [[Division (military)|division]]. It is an [[Volunteer military|all-volunteer force]] and comprises more than 80% of the country's active defence personnel.

A Military Department was created within the Government of the [[East India Company]] at [[Kolkata]] in the year 1776. Its main function was to sift and record orders relating to the Army that were issued by various Departments of the East India Company for the territories under it's control.<ref name=mod-history>{{cite web|url=http://mod.nic.in/aboutus/welcome.html |title=About The Ministry |publisher=Ministry of Defence, Government of India |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>

With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat of the Government of the East India Company was reorganised into four Departments, including a Military Department. The army in the Presidencies of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]] & [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] functioned as respective Presidency Army until April 1895, when the Presidency Armies were unified into a single [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] on 1 April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssbcrack.com/2015/07/10-facts-which-prove-indian-army-living-up-to-its-motto-service-before-self.html|title=10 Facts Which Prove Indian Army Living Up To Its Motto - "Service Before Self"|author=Editorial Team|work=SSB Interview Tips & Coaching - SSBCrack}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://guidinghawk.com/indian-army-official-facebook-page-wikifactsofficial-websitemotto/|title=Indian army official Facebook page wiki-facts,official website,motto|work=GuidingHawk}}</ref><ref>[http://20thcenturybattles.com/2015/02/06/the-british-indian-army-during-the-first-world-war/# THE BRITISH INDIAN ARMY DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR]</ref><ref>[[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]][http://www.idsa-india.org/an-jul8-1.html]</ref>
For administrative convenience, it was divided into four commands at that point of time, namely Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including Burma) and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).<ref>Harold E. Raugh, ''The Victorians at war, 1815–1914: an encyclopaedia of British military history'' (2004) pp 173–79</ref>

The British Indian Army was a critical force for the primacy of the [[British Empire]] both in India and across the world. Besides maintaining the internal security of the [[British Raj]], the Army fought in many other theatres&nbsp;– [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]], [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars, [[First Anglo-Afghan War|First]], [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|Second]] and [[Third Anglo-Afghan War|Third]] Anglo-Afghan Wars, [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s in China, [[Abyssinia (battle honour)|Abyssinia]], [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China.

In the 20th century, the Indian Army was a crucial adjunct to the British forces in both the [[World Wars]]. 1.3 million Indian soldiers served in [[World War I]] (1914–1918) for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], in which 74,187 Indian troops were killed or missing in action.<ref name="Urlanis">{{cite book |title=Wars and Population |last=Urlanis |first=Boris |year=1971 |location=Moscow |page=85 }}</ref> In 1915 there was a [[1915 Singapore Mutiny|mutiny]] by Indian soldiers in Singapore. After the United Kingdom made promises of self-governance to the [[Indian National Congress]] in return for its support. Britain reneged on its promises after the war, following which the [[Indian independence movement#First World War|Indian Independence movement]] gained strength.

The "[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]" of the British Indian Army began with the formation of the [[Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College]] at Dehradun in March 1912 with the purpose of providing education to the scions of aristocratic and well-to-do Indian families and to prepare selected Indian boys for admission into the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. Indian officers given a King's commission after passing out were posted to one of the [[Eight Unit Scheme of Indianisation|eight units]] selected for Indianisation. Political pressure being applied due to the slow pace of Indianisation, with just 69 officers being commissioned between 1918 and 1932, led to the formation of the [[Indian Military Academy]] in 1932 and greater numbers of officers of Indian origin being commissioned.<ref>{{cite book |title=Thimayya: an amazing life |last=Khanduri |first=Chandra B. |year=2006 |publisher=Knowledge World |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-87966-36-4|page=394 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWXfAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref>

In [[World War II]] Indian soldiers fought for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In 1939, British officials had no plan for expansion and training of Indian forces, which comprised about 130,000 men (in addition there were 44,000 men in British units in India in 1939).  Their mission was internal security and defence against a possible Soviet threat through Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battle fronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was lack of equipment.<ref>Kaushik Roy, "Expansion And Deployment of the Indian Army during World War II: 1939–45,"''Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research,'' Autumn 2010, Vol. 88 Issue 355, pp 248–268</ref>  Indian units served in Burma, where in 1944–45 five Indian divisions were engaged along with one British and three African divisions. Even larger numbers operated in the Middle East. Some 87,000 Indian soldiers died in the war. By the end of the war it had become the largest [[Volunteer military|volunteer army]] in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in August 1945.<ref name="su25">Sumner, p.25</ref><ref name="CWrepdirect">{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/admin/files/cwgc_india.pdf |title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission Report on India 2007–2008 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100618081321/http://www.cwgc.org/admin/files/cwgc_india.pdf |archivedate=18 June 2010 }}</ref>

In the African and Middle-Eastern Campaigns, captured Indian troops were given a choice to join the German Army to eventually "liberate" India from Great Britain instead of being sent to [[POW camp]]s. These men, along with Indian students who were in Germany when the war broke out, made up what was called the [[Free India Legion]]. They were originally intended as pathfinders for German forces in Asia but they soon were sent to help guard the [[Atlantic Wall]]. Few who were part of the Free India Legion ever saw any combat and very few were ever stationed outside of Europe. At its height the Free India Legion had over 3,000 troops in its ranks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Martin Bamber and Aad Neeven |url=http://www.freeindianlegion.info/pag_infanterie-regement-950.php |title=The Free Indian Legion&nbsp;– Infantry Regiment 950 (Ind) |publisher=Freeindianlegion.info |date=26 August 1942 |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

Indian POWs also joined the [[Indian National Army]], which was allied with the [[Empire of Japan]], was raised by a former col of British Indian Army (Gen) Mohan Singh but later led by Netaji [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and [[Rash Bihari Bose]]. With the fall of Singapore in 1942, about 40,000 Indian soldiers were captured. They were given a choice and over 30,000 joined the [[Indian National Army]]. Those who refused became POWs and were mostly shipped to New Guinea.<ref>Peter Stanley, "Great in adversity": Indian prisoners of war in New Guinea," ''Journal of the Australian War Memorial'' (October 2002) No. 37 [https://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j37/indians.asp online]</ref> After initial success it was defeated along with Japanese but it had huge impact on Indian independence movement. Similar organisations were also made in Germany and Japan. In 1946 Indian sailors revolted against British in the [[Royal Indian Navy mutiny|1946 British Indian Navy Mutiny]].

===Post independence===
{{main|Indian Army Day}}
Upon [[Independence of India|independence]] and the subsequent [[Partition of India]] in 1947, four of the ten [[Gurkha]] regiments were transferred to the British Army. The rest of the [[British Indian Army]] was divided between the newly created nations of [[Republic of India]] and [[Republic of Pakistan]]. The [[Punjab Boundary Force]], which had been formed to help police the Punjab during the partition period, was disbanded,<ref>For the Punjab Boundary Force, see Daniel P. Marston, 'The Indian Army, Partition, and the Punjab Boundary Force, 1945–47,' War in History November 2009, vol. 16 no. 4 469–505</ref> and Headquarters Delhi and East Punjab Command was formed to administer the area.

===First Kashmir War (1947)===
{{Main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|Kashmir conflict}}
Immediately after independence, tensions between India and Pakistan began to boil over, and the first of three full-scale wars between the two nations broke out over the then [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir]]. The Maharaja of Kashmir wanted to have standstill position. Since, Kashmir was [[Muslim]] majority state, Pakistan wanted to make Kashmir a Pakistan territory. In 1948, Pakistan invaded, Kashmir, as a result, [[Maharaja Hari Singh]] appealed to India, and to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]], the Governor General, for help. He signed the Instrument of Accession to India. It took 2 weeks for Indian forces to reach war front. Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar.<ref name="TC">{{cite journal|first=Tom |last=Cooper |date=29 October 2003 |title=Indo-Pakistani War, 1947–1949 |publisher=ACIG |url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_321.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060613025308/http://www.acig.org:80/artman/publish/article_321.shtml |archivedate=13 June 2006 }}</ref> This contingent included [[General Thimayya]] who distinguished himself in the operation and in years that followed, became a Chief of the Indian Army. An intense war was waged across the state and former comrades found themselves fighting each other. Pakistan suffered significant losses. Its forces were stopped on the line formed which is now called LOC (Line of Control).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

An uneasy UN sponsored peace returned by the end of 1948 with Indian and Pakistani soldiers facing each other directly on the [[Line of Control]], which has since divided Indian-held Kashmir from Pakistan-held Kashmir. A number of UN resolutions (38–47) were passed calling for a plebiscite to be held in Kashmir to determine accession to India or Pakistan.<ref>[http://www.kashmiri-cc.ca/un/index.htm UN Resolutions] {{wayback|url=http://www.kashmiri-cc.ca/un/index.htm |date=20110618111041 |df=y }}</ref> These resolutions were never accepted by India.<ref>[http://www.kashmiri-cc.ca/un/index.htm Resolutions] {{wayback|url=http://www.kashmiri-cc.ca/un/index.htm |date=20100830150206 |df=y }}</ref> Tensions between India and Pakistan, largely over Kashmir, have never since been entirely eliminated.

===Annexation of Hyderabad (1948)===
[[File:Op Polo Surrender.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Major General]] [[General El Edroos|El Edroos]] (at right) offers his surrender of the Hyderabad State Forces to Major General (later Army Chief) [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri|J.N. Chaudhuri]] at [[Secunderabad]]]]
{{Main|Operation Polo}}
After the partition of India, the [[Hyderabad State|State of Hyderabad]], a princely state under the rule of a [[Nizam]], chose to remain independent. The [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]], refused to accede his state to the Union of India. The following stand-off between the [[Government of India]] and the Nizam ended on 12 September 1948 when India's then deputy prime minister [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] ordered Indian troops to secure the [[Hyderabad State|state]]. With 5 days of low-intensity fighting, the Indian Army, backed by a squadron of [[Hawker Tempest|Hawker Tempest aircraft]] of the [[Indian Air Force]], routed the Hyderabad State forces. Five infantry battalions and one armoured squadron of the Indian Army were engaged in the operation. The following day, the [[Hyderabad State|State of Hyderabad]] was proclaimed as a part of the [[Union of India]]. Major General [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri]], who led the [[Operation Polo]] was appointed the Military Governor of Hyderabad (1948–1949) to restore law and order.

===Medical assistance during Korean War (1950–1953)===
{{main|Korean War}}
During the Korean War, India sent the 60th Indian (Parachute) Field Ambulance unit to aid the UN troops fighting against the Chinese and North Korean invasion of South Korea, though they decided against sending combat forces. The 60th PFA was included in the [[1st Commonwealth Division]]. In the aftermath of the war, an Indian infantry brigade formed the Custodian Force of India as part of the soldiers were also sent to Korea as part of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee to assist in the exchange of prisoners of war. The NNRC was commanded by Lt Gen KS Thimayya.

===Annexation of Goa, Daman and Diu (1961)===

Even though the British and French vacated all their colonial possessions in the [[Indian subcontinent]], Portugal refused to relinquish control of its Indian colonies of [[Goa]], Daman and Diu. After repeated attempts by India to negotiate with Portugal for the territory were spurned by Portuguese prime minister and dictator, [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], India launched [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]] on 12 December 1961 to take Goa from the Portuguese. A small contingent of its troops entered Goa, Daman, and Diu to capture and secure the territory. After a brief conflict, in which 31 Portuguese soldiers were killed, the [[Portuguese Navy]] frigate [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque]] destroyed, and over 3,000 Portuguese captured, Portuguese General [[Manuel António Vassalo e Silva]] surrendered to Maj Gen KP Candeth (Kunhiraman Palat Kandoth) of the Indian Army, after twenty-six hours and Goa, Daman and Diu joined the Indian Union.

===Sino-Indian War (1962)===
{{Main|Sino-Indian War}}

The cause of the war was a dispute over the sovereignty of the widely separated Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh border regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to Kashmir and by China to be part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.

Small-scale clashes between the Indian and Chinese forces broke out as India insisted on the disputed [[McMahon Line]] being regarded as the international border between the two countries. Chinese troops claim to have not retaliated to the cross-border firing by Indian troops, despite sustaining losses.<ref>Bruce Bueno de Mesquita & David Lalman.

In 1962, the Indian Army was ordered to move to the Thag La ridge located near the border between Bhutan and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and about three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of the disputed McMahon Line. Meanwhile, Chinese troops too had made incursions into Indian-held territory and tensions between the two reached a new high when Indian forces discovered a road constructed by China in [[Aksai Chin]]. After a series of failed negotiations, the [[People's Liberation Army]] attacked Indian Army positions at the Thag La ridge. This move by China caught India by surprise and by 12 October, Nehru gave orders for the Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor coordination among various divisions of the Indian Army and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India in both the North-West and North-Eastern parts of the border and captured vast portions of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.

As the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate, however India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no peaceful agreement in sight, China unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support to it from the United States, while China stated that it still held territory that it had staked diplomatic claim upon. The dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the [[Line of Actual Control]].

The poor decisions made by India's military commanders, and, indeed, its political leadership, raised several questions. The [[Henderson-Brooks Report|Henderson-Brooks & Bhagat committee]] was soon set up by the Government of India to determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. The report of China even after hostilities began and also criticised the decision to not allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines out of fear of Chinese aerial counter-attack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was also targeted at the incompetence of then Defence Minister, [[Krishna Menon]] who resigned from his post soon after the war ended. Despite frequent calls for its release, the Henderson-Brooks report still remains classified.<ref>Claude Arpi. ''India and her neighbourhood: a French observer's views''.

Pakistani leaders believed that India, which was still recovering from the disastrous Sino-Indian War, would be unable to deal with a military thrust and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted swiftly and launched a counter offensive on Pakistan. Pakistan launched [[Operation Grand Slam]] in reply on 1 September, invading India's Chamb-Jaurian sector. In retaliation, the Indian Army launched a major offensive throughout its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as its prime target.

Initially, the Indian Army met with considerable success in the northern sector. After launching prolonged artillery barrages against Pakistan, India was able to capture three important mountain positions in Kashmir. By 9 September, the Indian Army had made considerable in-roads into Pakistan. India had its largest haul of Pakistani tanks when the offensive of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division was blunted at the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]], which took place on 10 September near Khemkaran.<ref name=pradhan>{{cite book|last=R.D.

===1967 Sino-Indian Conflict===
{{Main|Cho La incident}}
The 1967 Sino-Indian skirmish, also known as the Cho La incident, was a [[military conflict]] between [[India]]n troops and members of the [[China|Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]] who had infiltrated on 1 October 1967 in [[Sikkim]], then a protectorate of India. On 10 October, once again both sides had the conflict, the Defence Minister of India, [[Sardar Swaran Singh]] addressed that government is looking after the developments across the borders. During whole conflict Indian losses were 88 killed, and 163 wounded, while Chinese casualties were 300 killed and 450 wounded in [[Nathu La|Nathula]], and 40 in Chola.<ref>"Rapprochement Across the Himalayas: Emerging India-China Relations Post Cold"[https://books.google.com/books?id=pSpncRn2YFYC] p. 40</ref> The end of the battle saw the Chinese Army leave Sikkim after being defeated by Indian troops.<ref name=Hoontrakul>{{cite book

===Operation against the Naxalites during 1971===
In the supervision of [[Indira Gandhi]] during the [[President's rule]] in 1971, the Indian Army along with the [[Indian police]] launched ''[[Operation Steeplechase]]'', a gigantic "counter-insurgency" operation against the [[Naxalites]], which resulted in the death of hundreds of Naxalites and imprisonment of more than 20,000 suspects and cadres including senior leaders.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Maoist Insurgency in Nepal: Revolution in the Twenty-first Century |chapter=Part V: Military and state dimension |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtGNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA208&output=text#c_top |page=208 |first1=Mahendra |last1=Lawoti |first2=Anup Kumar |last2=Pahari |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-11-35261-68-9 |quote=The second turning point came in the wake of the 1971 Bangladesh war of independence which India supported with armed troops.

"Operation Steeplechase," a police and army joint anti–Naxalite undertaking, was launched in July–August 1971.

Standing behind them are officers of India's Army, Navy and Air Force.]]
An independence movement broke out in [[East Pakistan]] which was [[Operation Searchlight|brutally crushed]] by Pakistani forces. Due to large-scale [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|atrocities]] against them, thousands of [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] took refuge in neighbouring India causing a major refugee crisis there. In early 1971, India declared its full-support for the Bengali rebels, known as [[Mukti Bahini]], and Indian agents were extensively involved in covert operations to aid them.

On 20 November 1971, Indian Army moved the 14 Punjab Battalion [[45 Cavalry]] into Garibpur, a strategically important town near India's border with East Pakistan, and successfully [[Battle of Garibpur|captured it]]. The following day, more [[Battle of Atgram|clashes]] took place between Indian and Pakistani forces. Wary of India's growing involvement in the Bengali rebellion, the [[Pakistan Air Force]] (PAF) launched a preemptive strike on 10 Indian air bases at Srinagar, Jammu, Pathankot, Amritsar, Agra, Adampur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Uttarlai and Sirsa at 1745 hours on 3 December. This aerial offensive, however, failed to accomplish its stated objectives and gave India its excuse to declare a full-scale war against Pakistan the same day. By midnight, the Indian Army, accompanied by Indian Air Force, launched a major three-pronged assault into East Pakistan. The Indian Army won several battles on the eastern front including the decisive of [[battle of Hilli]], which was the only front where the Pakistani Army was able to build up considerable resistance. The operation also included a battalion-level airborne operation on Tangail which resulted in the capitulation of all resistance within five days.<ref>Owen Bennett Jones.

[[File:Basantar2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Indian Army personnel celebrate victory at the end [[Battle of Basantar]] on top of a knocked out Pakistani Patton tank.]]
Pakistan launched a counter-attack against India on the western front. On 4 December 1971, the A company of the 23rd Battalion of India's [[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]] detected and intercepted the movement of the 51st Infantry Brigade of the Pakistani Army near Ramgarh, Rajasthan. The [[battle of Longewala]] ensued during which the A company, though being outnumbered, thwarted the Pakistani advance until the Indian Air Force directed its fighters to engage the Pakistani tanks. By the time the battle had ended, 38 Pakistani tanks and 100 armoured vehicles were either destroyed or abandoned. About 200 Pakistani troops were killed in action during the battle while only 2 Indian soldiers lost their lives. Pakistan suffered another major defeat on the western front during the [[battle of Basantar]] which was fought from 4 December to 16th. By the end of the battle, about 66 Pakistani tanks were destroyed and 40 more were captured. In return, Pakistani forces were able to destroy only 11 Indian tanks. None of the numerous Pakistani offensives on the Western front materialised.<ref>S. Paul Kapur. ''Dangerous deterrent: nuclear weapons proliferation and conflict in South Asia''.

ISBN 978-0-8047-5550-4.</ref> By 16 December, Pakistan had lost sizeable territory on both eastern and western fronts.

Under the command of [[Jagjit Singh Arora|Lt. General J.S. Arora]], the three corps of the Indian Army, which had invaded East Pakistan, entered [[Dhaka]] and forced Pakistani forces to surrender on 16 December 1971, one day after the conclusion of the battle of Basantar. After Pakistan's Lt General [[Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi|A A K Niazi]] signed the Instrument of Surrender, India took more than 90,000 Pakistani [[prisoners of war]]. At the time of the signing of the Instrument of Surrender, 11,000 Pakistani soldiers were killed-in-action while India suffered 3,500 battle-related deaths.<ref name=encarta/> In addition, Pakistan lost 220 tanks during the battle compared to India's 69.<ref>Encyclopedia of the Developing World, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3mE04D9PMpAC&pg=PA806 p. 806].</ref>

In 1972, the [[Simla Agreement]] was signed between the two countries and tensions simmered. However, there were occasional spurts in diplomatic tensions which culminated into increased military vigilance on both sides.

===Siachen conflict (1984)===
{{Main|Siachen conflict}}
[[File:Dogra Siachen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|A memorial at the headquarters of the [[Dogra Regiment]] of the Indian Army in remembrance of members of the regiment who died or served in the [[Siachen Conflict]]]]
The [[Siachen Glacier]], though a part of the Kashmir region, was not officially demarcated on maps prepared and exchanged between the two sides in 1947. As a consequence, prior to the 1980s, neither India nor Pakistan maintained any permanent military presence in the region. However, Pakistan began conducting and allowing a series of mountaineering expeditions to the glacier beginning in the 1950s. By the early 1980s, the government of Pakistan was granting special expedition permits to mountaineers and United States Army maps deliberately showed Siachen as a part of Pakistan. This practice gave rise to the contemporary meaning of the term ''[[oropolitics]]''.

India, possibly irked by these developments, launched [[Operation Meghdoot]] in April 1984. An entire battalion of the Kumaon Regiment was airlifted to the glacier. Pakistani forces responded quickly and clashes between the two followed. Indian Army secured the strategic [[Sia La]] and [[Bilafond La]] mountain passes and by 1985, more than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of territory, 'claimed' by Pakistan, was under Indian control.<ref>Edward W.

===Counter-insurgency activities===
The Indian Army has played a crucial role in the past, fighting [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s and terrorists within the nation. The army launched [[Operation Blue Star]] and [[Operation Woodrose]] in the 1980s to combat [[Sikh]] insurgents. The army, along with [[Paramilitary forces of India|some paramilitary forces]], has the prime responsibility of maintaining [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] in the troubled [[Jammu and Kashmir]] region, led specifically by the Northern Command. The Indian Army also sent a contingent to Sri Lanka in 1987 as a part of the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]]. Allied to the work of the Northern command and its peace time activities is, ''"North Tech Symposium"'', an annual event, with an aim to provide viable platform for knowledge diffusion on contemporary military relevant technologies available as Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=qa5JhBUEvMjl6sBZTu6ALg==&ParentID=djRlGJCPlMimzWFr2XjtFQ==&flag=XJhhZ3ZNb4jdIfd36rqrwA==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopnews.in/det.aspx?q=40585|title=Indian Army organizes a Symposium titled “North Technical-2014” - Scoop News Jammu Kashmir|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=3F60ea7D/0+avn5qmbETJA==&ParentID=L6g1oacs6fCSYTJA2U+VpQ==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref> The Indian Army also successfully conducted [[Operation Golden Bird]] in 1995 for counter-insurgency in northeast India.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=h9KGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=Wyakaung+beach&source=bl&ots=9F2kVv7OUI&sig=uXLPx1AezneEEQ7tvLmtGdMgHm4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Gjl3VdnxL4OU8QWzvIPQBg&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Wyakaung%20beach&f=false|title=Troubled Periphery: The Crisis of India's North East By Subir Bhaumik}}</ref>

===Kargil war (1999)===
{{Main|Kargil War}}
[[File:Indian soldiers in Batalik during the Kargil War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Indian soldiers in Batalik during [[Kargil War]]]]

In 1998, India carried out [[Pokhran-II|nuclear tests]] and a few days later, Pakistan responded by more [[Chagai-I|nuclear tests]] giving both countries [[nuclear deterrence]] capability, although India had tested one hydrogen bombs which Pakistan lacks. Diplomatic tensions eased after the [[Lahore Summit]] was held in 1999. The sense of optimism was short-lived, however, since in mid-1999 Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the [[Kargil district]] of India. These had been vacated by the Indian army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were supposed to reoccupied in spring. The regular Pakistani troops who took control of these areas received important support, both in the form of arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the ''Tiger Hill'', overlooked the vital [[Srinagar]]-[[Leh]] Highway (NH 1A), [[Batalik]] and [[Dras]].
Once the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realised, the Indian Army quickly mobilised about 200,000 troops and [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] was launched. However, since the heights were under Pakistani control, India was in a clear strategic disadvantage. From their [[observation post]]s, the Pakistani forces had a clear line-of-sight to lay down [[indirect fire|indirect artillery fire]] on NH 1A, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians.<ref name="NLI">[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-5-2003_pg7_14 Indian general praises Pakistani valour at Kargil] 5 May 2003 Daily Times, Pakistan {{wayback|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-5-2003_pg7_14 |date=20090116123416 |df=y }}</ref> This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main logistical and supply route.<ref>Kashmir in the Shadow of War By Robert Wirsing Published by M.E.

[[File:Kargil war.jpg|thumb|left|Indian soldiers after winning a battle during the [[Kargil War]]]]

Though most of the posts in the vicinity of the highway were cleared by mid-June, some parts of the highway near Drass witnessed sporadic shelling until the end of the war. Once NH1a area was cleared, the Indian Army turned to driving the invading force back across the Line of Control. The [[Battle of Tololing]], among other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's favour. Nevertheless, some of the posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. As the operation was fully underway, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the [[Sightline|line-of-sight]]. In many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the outposts manned by the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults which were slow and took a heavy toll given the steep ascent that had to be made on peaks as high as 18,000 feet (5,500 m). Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges they had lost;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n08/ali_01_.html|title=Tariq Ali · Bitter Chill of Winter: Kashmir · LRB 19 April 2001|work=London Review of Books|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Colonel Ravi Nanda | title=Kargil : A Wake Up Call | publisher=Vedams Books | year=1999 | isbn=81-7095-074-0}} [https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no14953.htm Online summary of the Book] {{wayback|url=https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no14953.htm |date=20070928055430 |df=y }}</ref> according to official count, an estimated 75%–80% of the intruded area and nearly all high ground was back under Indian control.

==Major exercises==

===Operation Brasstacks===
[[Operation Brasstacks]] was launched by the Indian Army in November 1986 to simulate a full-scale war on the western border. The exercise was the largest ever conducted in India and comprised nine infantry, three mechanised, three armoured and one air assault division, and included three independent armoured brigades. Amphibious assault exercises were also conducted with the [[Indian Navy]]. Brasstacks also allegedly incorporated nuclear attack drills. It led to tensions with Pakistan and a subsequent rapprochement in mid-1987.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/brass-tacks.htm |title=Brass Tacks |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1811/18110990.htm |title=An exercise in anticipation |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |author=John Cherian |date=8 June 2001 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Yudh Abhyas 2012.ogv|thumb|left|Yudh Abhyas 2012&nbsp;– U.S. and Indian Army military exercise Trailer.]]
Exercise Yudh Abhyas is part of an ongoing series of joint exercises between the Indian and United States Armies since 2005, agreed upon under the New Framework of India-US Defence Relationship. Commencing at the platoon level, the exercise has graduated to a command post (CPX) and field training exercise (FTX).

The seventh edition of Yudh Abhyas is currently underway since 5 March 2012 in two locations under the South Western Command. The US Army contingent is from the [[United States Army Pacific|US Army Pacific (USARPAC)]], part of the [[United States Pacific Command|United States Pacific Command (USPACOM)]]. The Command Post Exercise has an engineer brigade headquarters with its planners from both sides, while the Field Training Exercise comprises troops of 2nd Squadron 14th US Cavalry Regiment from 25th Infantry Division, Hawaii, along with a platoon of Strykers, and a similar sized Indian Army contingent of mechanised infantry. The event is all the more interesting as a number of key surveillance, communications and Improvised Explosive Devices detection and neutralisation technologies, available with both sides have been fielded in the exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/indian-defence/165331-indo-us-army-exercise-yudh-abhyas.html |title=Indo-US Army Exercise Yudh Abhyas |publisher=Defence.pk |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

===Exercise Shakti===
Exercise Shakti is an ongoing series of joint exercises between the Indian and French armies since 2011. Exercise Shakti is conducted to practice and validate anti terrorist operations and drills in snowbound and mountainous areas. The second joint military exercise between the two countries was held in September 2013 with the first one being held in India in October 2011. The theme of the exercise is to conduct platoon level joint counter insurgency operations in high altitude mountainous terrain under the UN Charter, thus emphasising the shared concerns of both countries about global terrorism. An added aim of the exercise is to qualitatively enhance knowledge of each other's military procedures thus increasing the scope for interoperability and better responsiveness to a common threat. The twelve-day exercise with France Army is scheduled to be conducted in multiple modules in order to achieve complete integration between the two contingents at every stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |title=Indo-French joint Army exercise Shakti 2013 begins today |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |title=INDO&nbsp;— FRENCH JOINT ARMY EXERCISE SHAKTI 2013 |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>

===Exercise Shoorveer===
On first week of April 2012 Indian Army has launched a massive summer exercise in the Rajasthan desert involving over 50,000 troops and several hundred artillery guns and infantry combat vehicles as part of its efforts to shore up its battle worthiness on the western front with Pakistan. The exercise, code-named "Shoorveer", is being conducted by the Jaipur-based South Western Command and will end in the first week of May. This is the largest ever exercise conducted by Indian army since 1947. The collective training started with honing up of basic battle procedures and tactical drills at tactical level.
A number of field firings are being carried out to check the accuracy and lethality of the weapon systems. A large number of innovations and modifications carried out by units and formations to enhance combat power are being tested in the field. The troops will build the momentum of training gradually, with increased combat tempo to set the stage for a major joint army-air force exercise in the later part of the exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |title=Indian Army gears up for war game in Rajasthan desert |publisher=FacenFacts |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

=== Exercise Shatrujeet ===
In April 2016, Indian Army conducted a major exercise called 'Shatrujeet' by the elite Mathura-based Strike Corps in desert area of Mahajan field firing range of [[Rajasthan]], wherein the capability to strike, deep into the enemy territory in an integrated air-land battle environment was evaluated. The focus of the exercise was to achieve joint and seamless coordination among all the forces in a nuclear biological chemical warfare scenario so as to deliver the enemy, a lethal punch with full might at a lightening speed. The operationally-oriented exercise was focused on validating integrated theatre battle fighting concept by incorporating new age technologies, weapon platforms and systems as well as long-range precision targeting vectors. This exercise is in the last phase and on April 22, army chief D S Suhag is likely to come and review the exercise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Indian-Armys-firing-exercise-Shatrujeet-enters-its-last-phase/articleshow/51861638.cms|title=Indian Army's firing exercise 'Shatrujeet' enters its last phase - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-army-conducts-battle-exercise-shatrujeet-in-rajasthan-1396215|title=Indian Army Conducts Battle Exercise 'Shatrujeet' In Rajasthan|website=NDTV.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsghana.com.gh/indian-army-test-its-operation-abilities/|title=Indian Army Test Its Operation Abilities|last=Admin|website=News Ghana|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>

==Today==

===Combat doctrine===
The current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down whilst the strike formations attack at a point of Indian choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its [[special forces]] capabilities. With the role of India increasing and the requirement for protection of India's interest in far off shores become important, the Indian Army and Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |title=Army and navy plan to set up a marine brigade |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

===Personnel===
The Indian Army is a voluntary service and although a provision for military [[conscription]] exists in the [[Indian constitution]], it has never been imposed. According to the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], in 2010 the army had a strength of 1,129,900 active personnel and 960,000 reserve personnel.<ref name="iiss2010">[[#IISS2010|IISS 2010]], pp. 360</ref> Of those in reserve 160,000 were in the [[Indian Territorial Army]], however only 40,000 of those regularly report for duty.

The ranks of the Indian Army can be found at [[Army ranks and insignia of India]], and for the most part follow the British Army tradition.

===Infantry regiments===
{{Main|List of regiments of the Indian Army}}
[[File:Yudh Abhyas 2013, 2nd Batallion, 5th Gurkha Rifles.jpg|left|thumb|Soldiers of the 99th Mountain Brigade's 2nd Battalion, [[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)|5 Gorkha Rifles]], during Yudh Abhyas 2013.]]
Upon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations, as such it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and commonwealth counterparts troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal and take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.

Infantry regiments of the Indian Army recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as on regional, ethnicity, or religion such as the [[Assam Regiment]], [[Jat Regiment]], and [[Sikh Regiment]] respectively. Most of them continue the heritage of regiments raised under the Raj, but the [[Ladakh Scouts]], [[Arunachal Scouts]], and [[Sikkim Scouts]], specialised in border defence, have been raised since independence.

Over the years various political and military factions have tried to dissolve the unique selection criteria process of the regiments over a fear that loyalty to the regiment or its ethnic people opposed to loyalty to the union of India and have succeeded somewhat with the creation of ethnic-less, religion-less, non-regional regiments, such as the Brigade of Guards and Parachute Regiment, but have generally met with little success or gained popular support amongst the rank and file Jawans.

{{Main|Equipment of the Indian Army|List of active Indian military aircraft}}

Most of the army equipment is imported, but efforts are being made to manufacture indigenous equipment. The [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] has developed a range of weapons for the Indian Army ranging from small arms, artillery, radars and the [[Arjun (tank)|Arjun]] tank. All Indian Military small-arms are manufactured under the umbrella administration of the [[Ordnance Factories Board]], with principal Firearm manufacturing facilities in Ichhapore, [[Cossipore]], Kanpur, Jabalpur and Tiruchirapalli. The Indian National Small Arms System ([[INSAS]]) rifle, which is successfully inducted by Indian Army since 1997 is a product of the [[Ishapore Rifle Factory]], while ammunition is manufactured at Khadki and possibly at Bolangir.

In 2014, Army chief General Bikram Singh said that if given sufficient budget support, the Indian Army might be able to acquire half the ammunition needed to fight in a major conflict by the next year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Army-running-low-on-ammunation/articleshow/32569909.cms |title=Army running low on ammunition |last1=Pandit |first1=Rajat |date=24 March 2014 |website=indiatimes.com |publisher=TNN |accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>

The Indian Army camouflage consists of shirts, trousers and cap of a synthetic material. Shirts are buttoned up with two chest pockets with buttoned up flaps. Trousers have two pockets, two thigh box pockets and a back pocket. The Indian Army Jungle [[camouflage]] dress features a jungle camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments. The Indian Army Desert camouflage, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert and desert areas of [[Rajasthan]] and its vicinity.

The forces of the [[East India Company]] in [[British India|India]] were forced by casualties to dye their white summer [[tunic]]s to neutral tones, initially a tan called khaki (from the [[Hindi]]-[[Urdu]] word for "dusty"). This was a temporary measure which became standard in Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the [[Second Boer War]] in 1902, did the entire [[British Army]] standardise on dun for [[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]]. Indian Army uniform standardises on dun for khaki.

The modern Indian Army wears distinctive parade uniforms characterised by variegated turbans and waist-sashes in regimental colours. The Gurkha and Garwhal Rifles and the Assam, Kumaon and the Naga Regiments wear broad brimmed hats of traditional style. Traditionally, all Rifle regiments and the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, [[Garhwal Rifles]], Gurkha Rifles, and Rajputana Rifles) wear [[rank badge]]s, buttons and blackened wire embroidered articles of uniform in black instead of the usual Brass (or gold) coloured as the original role of the rifle regiments was camouflage and concealment.

===Intelligence===
{{Main|Directorate of Military Intelligence (India)}}

The [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (India)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]] (DMI) is the Intelligence arm of the Indian Army. The MI (as it is commonly referred to) was constituted in 1941 and was initially created to check corruption in the Army's own ranks. With time, its role has evolved into cross border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent groups and counter-terrorism. In the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the [[Samba spy scandal]] wherein 3 Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies. The organisation has since emerged from the scandal as a prime Intelligence organisation of the Indian Army. As of 2012, the MI has seen many of its roles taken away in a turf war with the newly created [[National Technical Research Organisation]] and [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|Defence Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |title=How Indian Army's Military Intelligence Directorate works : Special Report&nbsp;– India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> However bypassing NTRO's controversies with MI, since it was set up in 2004, as a premier apex scientific agency, we cannot overlook its scientific prowess, under the National Security Adviser in the Prime Minister's Office,  as it also includes the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD), which is first of its kind in Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|title=State govt allots land for NTRO in Borda village|work=IBNLive|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref>

==Formation and structure==
[[File:Indian Army Structure.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Indian Army Structure (click to enlarge)]]

The army has a strength of about a million troops and fields 35 Divisions within 13 Corps. Its headquarters is located in the Indian capital New Delhi and it is under the overall command of the [[Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army|Chief of Army Staff]] (COAS), currently [[General Dalbir Singh Suhag]]. Initially, the army's main objective was to defend the nation's frontiers. However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially in insurgent-hit [[Kashmir]] and the [[Northeast India|Northeast]]. Recently it has been proposed to enhance the strength of the army by more than 90,000 to counter the increasing presence of Chinese troops along the LAC.

* [[F-INSAS]] is the Indian Army's principal infantry modernisation programme, which aims to modernise the army's 465 infantry and paramilitary battalions by 2020. The programme aims to upgrade the infantry with a multi-calibre rifle with an under-barrel grenade launcher and bulletproof jackets and helmets. The helmet would include a visor, flashlight, thermal sensors, night vision devices and a miniature computer with audio headsets. It will also include a new lightweight and waterproof uniform, which would help the soldier in carrying extra load and fighting in an NBC environment.<ref name=dns9j13>{{cite news|title=DRDO's F-INSAS programme to be ready in two years |url=http://www.defencenews.in/defence-news-internal.asp?get=new&id=1645 |accessdate=10 July 2013 |newspaper=Defence News |date=9 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131212084347/http://www.defencenews.in/defence-news-internal.asp?get=new&id=1645 |archivedate=12 December 2013 }}</ref>
* India is currently re-organising its mechanised forces to achieve strategic mobility and high-volume firepower for rapid thrusts into enemy territory. India proposes to progressively induct as many as 248 [[Arjun MBT]] and develop and induct the Arjun MK-II variant, 1,657 Russian-origin T-90S main-battle tanks (MBTs). The army is procuring 2,000 pieces of night vision devices for T-72 tanks for Rs 10&nbsp;billion; 1,200 pieces for T-90 tanks for Rs 9.60&nbsp;billion and 1,780 pieces for infantry combat vehicles for Rs 8.60&nbsp;billion. It is also acquiring 700 TISAS (thermal imaging stand alone systems) and 418 TIFACS (thermal fire control systems) for its T-72 fleet at a cost of around $230 million. 300 Israeli TISAS were installed as part of several T-72 upgrade phases, followed by 3,860 image intensifier-based night-vision devices. 310 Russian produced T-90S Main Battle Tanks were also fitted with French Catherine TI cameras.<ref name=zn2a13>{{cite news|title=Night-vision devices for Indian Army approved|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/night-vision-devices-for-indian-army-approved_839359.html|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=Zee News|date=2 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=tect2a13>{{cite news|title=Army to get night vision devices worth over Rs 2,800 crore for its tanks and infantry combat vehicles|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-02/news/38218271_1_indian-army-indigenisation-ongoing-12th-defence-plan|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=2 April 2013}}</ref>
