The '''2012 Summer Olympics''', formally the '''Games of the XXX Olympiad'''<ref>The IOC numbers the Olympiads using [[Roman numerals]].</ref> and commonly known as '''London 2012''', was a major international [[multi-sport event]] celebrated in the tradition of the [[Olympic Games]], as governed by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). It took place in [[London]] and to a lesser extent across the United Kingdom from 25 July to 12 August 2012. The first event, the [[group stage]] in [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics&nbsp;– Women's tournament|women's football]] began on 25 July at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], followed by the opening ceremonies on 27 July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/london/index_uk.asp|publisher=International Olympic Committee|title=London 2012|accessdate=3 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801100305/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/london/index_uk.asp|archivedate=1 August 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/schedule-results/list/football/20120725|title=Olympics schedule and results – Wednesday 25 July|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> 10,768 athletes from 204 [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) participated.<ref name=athletecount/>

The final medal tally was led by the [[United States at the 2012 Summer Olympics|United States]], followed by [[China at the 2012 Summer Olympics|China]] and host [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]]. Several world and Olympic records were set at the games. Though there were several controversies, the 2012 games were deemed highly successful with the rising standards of competition amongst nations across the world, packed stadiums and smooth organisation. Furthermore, the focus on sporting legacy and post-games venue sustainability was seen as a blueprint for future Olympics.

==Bidding process==
{{Main|Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics}}
By 15 July 2003, the deadline for interested cities to submit bids to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics: [[Havana]], [[Istanbul]], [[Leipzig]], [[London]], [[Madrid]], [[Moscow]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/3068323.stm|title=Olympic bids: The rivals|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2003|accessdate=3 August 2008}}</ref> On 18 May 2004, as a result of a scored technical evaluation, the IOC reduced the number of cities to five: London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3725157.stm|title=London bid team delighted|work=BBC Sport|date=18 May 2004|accessdate=3 August 2008}}</ref> All five submitted their candidate files by 19 November 2004 and were visited by the IOC inspection team during February and March 2005. The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, [[Guy Drut]], would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.<ref name="wrongb">{{Cite news|publisher=GamesBids|accessdate=9 March 2005|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1110389129|title=Day One Of Paris 2012 Inspection By IOC}}</ref>

[[File:Lord Coe - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright| [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]] – the head of the London 2012 bid]]
Throughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin. Its position began to improve after the appointment of [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]] as the new head of London 2012 on 19 May 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsr.london.edu/lbs-article/673/index.html|title=How London really won the games|accessdate=24 June 2012|last=Payne|first=Michael|publisher=London Business School}}</ref> In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.<ref name="wrongd">{{Cite news|publisher=GamesBids|accessdate=31 August 2004|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1093970849|title=London And Paris Tie In 2012 Bid}}</ref>

On 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.<ref name="wrongc">{{Cite news|publisher=GamesBids|accessdate=6 June 2005|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1118060827|title=Paris, London and New York Get Glowing IOC Reports}}</ref> On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, [[Jacques Rogge]] said, "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less."<ref name="Rogge quote">{{cite web|publisher=[[International Sailing Federation]]|accessdate=6 March 2007|url=http://www.sailing.org/news/12257.php|title=Rogge Arrives in Singapore|date=1 July 2005}}</ref>

On 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in [[Singapore]]. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to Paris' 50.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4655555.stm|work=BBC News|title=London beats Paris to 2012 Games|date=6 July 2005}}</ref> The celebrations in London were short-lived, being overshadowed by [[7 July 2005 London bombings|bombings on London's transport system]] less than 24 hours after the announcement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/sep/02/london.Olympics2012|title=The party that never was: capital marks the games at last—Eight weeks after Olympic celebrations were cut short by bombings, London puts on a low-key but  spectacle to show it means business and hard work.|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=6 July 2005|accessdate=22 August 2008|first=Andrew|last=Culf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002091306/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/sep/02/london.Olympics2012|archivedate=2 October 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Horse Guards Parade]]. After the Games, some of the new facilities will be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excel-london.co.uk/mediacentre/pressoffice/london2012|title=London 2012|publisher=Excel London|date=6 July 2005|accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref>

The majority of venues have been divided into three zones within [[Greater London]]: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition there are a few venues that, by necessity, are outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]] some {{convert|125|mi|0|abbr=on}} southwest of London, which hosted the [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|sailing]] events.

[[File:London 2012 games lane.jpg|thumb|right|Olympic rings marked on a street, indicating that the lane was reserved for the use of Olympic athletes and staff.]]
TfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the [[Olympic Route Network]]; roads connecting between all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special "Olympic lanes" marked with the Olympic rings{{emdash}}reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18196.aspx Olympic and Paralympic route network], TfL {{wayback|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18196.aspx |date=20120305060001 |df=y }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/olympics/olympic-news/revealed-the-road-signs-that-will-ban-drivers-from-olympic-lanes-6368234.html|author=Beard, Matthew|title=Revealed: the road signs that will ban drivers from Olympic lanes|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=15 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=guardian-cycling/> The painting of Olympic lane indicators in mid-July led to confusion from commuters, who wrongly believed that the Olympic lane restrictions had already taken effect (they were to take effect on 27 July). The [[A4 road (England)|A4]] experienced traffic jams due to drivers avoiding the Olympic lane, and likewise on a section of [[Southampton Row]], where the only lanes available in one direction were the Olympic lane and the bus lane.<ref name=dm-farce>{{cite news|last=Bond|first=Anthony|title=The road to nowhere: The most ridiculous example yet of how Olympics lanes are making a farce of driving in London|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2174441/London-Olympics-2012-The-ridiculous-example-Olympics-lanes-making-farce-driving-London.html|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London|date=16 July 2012|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>

Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy|sailing events]] at [[Portland, England|Portland]] had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panamericanchauffeurs.com/london_olympics_2012_airport_transfers.html |title=2012 London Olympic Games &#124; London Chauffeur Limo Service |publisher=Panamerican Chauffeurs |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111103172317/http://www.panamericanchauffeurs.com:80/london_olympics_2012_airport_transfers.html |archivedate=3 November 2011 }}</ref> However, a £77&nbsp;million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/6529709.stm|work=BBC News|title=Go-ahead won for £77m relief road|date=5 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-12769307|work=BBC News|title=Weymouth Olympic relief road is opened|date=17 March 2011}}</ref> Some £16&nbsp;million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8323724.stm|work=BBC News|title=Olympics road plans put on show|date=24 October 2009}}</ref>

TfL created a promotional campaign and website, ''Get Ahead of the Games'', to help provide information related to transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. Through the campaign, TfL also encouraged the use of cycling as a mode of transport during the Games.<ref name=les-cycling>{{cite news|title=The Olympic commute...

===Financing===
The costs of mounting the Games are separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure, and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games are privately funded, the venues and Park costs are met largely by public money.

The original budget for the Games was £2.4 billion ($3.94 billion USD), but this was increased almost fourfold to about £9.3 billion ($15.28 billion USD) in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pearman|first=Hugh|title=These Knock-Down, Shrinkable Games|url=http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303754904577532921054250902.html?mod=ITP_personaljournal_3&mg=reno64-wsj|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=25 July 2012|page=D6}}</ref> The revised figures were announced to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 15 March 2007 by [[Tessa Jowell]]. Along with East End regeneration costs, the breakdown was:
* Building the venues and infrastructure&nbsp;— £5.3&nbsp;billion.
* Elite sport and Paralympic funding&nbsp;— £400&nbsp;million.
* Security and policing&nbsp;— £600&nbsp;million.
* Regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley&nbsp;— £1.7&nbsp;billion.
* Contingency fund&nbsp;— £2.7&nbsp;billion.

===Volunteers===
Unpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Volunteering&nbsp;– Making the Games happen|url=http://www.london2012.com/volunteer|publisher=London 2012|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shifrin|first=Tash|title=Olympic appeal as volunteer target hit|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2004/feb/10/volunteering|accessdate=15 April 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=10 February 2004}}</ref> When recruitment took place in 2010, over 240,000 applications were received.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Games Maker facts|url=http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/london-2012-games-makers/10-games-maker-facts.php|publisher=London 2012|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, "Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them".<ref>{{cite news|title=Volunteers training day at Wembley Stadium as they prepare for Games|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9061305/London-2012-Olympics-volunteers-training-day-at-Wembley-Stadium-as-they-prepare-for-Games.html|accessdate=15 April 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=4 February 2012}}</ref> The volunteers wore clothing which included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white [[trainers]] which they collected from the [[Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre]].

===Torch relay===

[[File:Olympic torch relay through Newport.jpg|thumb|right|The [[2012 Summer Olympics torch relay|torch relay]] in [[Newport, Isle of Wight]]]]
The Olympics torch relay ran from 19 May to 27 July 2012, before the Games. Plans for the relay were developed in 2010–11, with the torch-bearer selection process announced on 18 May 2011.<ref name="Torch relay">{{cite news|date=17 May 2011|title=London 2012 torch relay should focus on youth|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/8518637/London-2012-Olympics-torch-relay-should-focus-on-youth-says-Locog.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=17 May 2011|first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay}}</ref>

On 18 May 2012 the [[Olympic flame]] arrived at [[RNAS Culdrose]] in [[Cornwall]] from Greece<ref name="Olympic Torch Dates">{{cite web|date=18 May 2011|title=The Olympic Torch Relay|url=http://www.london2012.com/olympic-torch-relay|publisher=[[LOCOG]]|accessdate=18 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608061845/http://www.london2012.com/olympic-torch-relay|archivedate=8 June 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> on flight BA2012, operated by a [[British Airways]] [[Airbus A319]] named "Firefly". On the flight the flame was carried inside 4 miners lamps supplied by [http://www.protectorlamp.com Protector Lamp] of Eccles, Greater Manchester.

The relay lasted 70 days, with 66 evening celebrations and six island visits, and involved some 8,000 people carrying the torch about {{convert|8000|mi|0|abbr=on}}, starting from [[Land's End]] in Cornwall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13426353|work=BBC News|title=London 2012 Olympic torch relay route revealed|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=18 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518081518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13426353|archivedate=18 May 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> The torch had three days outside the United Kingdom when it visited the [[Isle of Man]] on 2 June, [[Dublin]] in Ireland, on 6 June,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1208/breaking40.html|work=The Irish Times|agency=Reuters|location=Dublin|title=Dublin to host Olympic Torch|date=8 December 2011}}</ref> and both [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] on 15 July.

The relay focused on National Heritage Sites, locations with sporting significance, key sporting events, schools registered with the Get Set School Network, green spaces and biodiversity, Live Sites (city locations with large screens), and festivals and other events.<ref>{{cite web|title=London Culture and 2012 Open Meeting |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/lcsg/docs/openmeetings/20091102/presentation3.pdf |publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121030062212/http://london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/lcsg/docs/openmeetings/20091102/presentation3.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2012 }}</ref> [[Dumfries and Galloway]] was the only Region in the whole of the United Kingdom that had the Olympic Torch pass through it twice.

===Environmental policy===
The [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes, and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2009-02/new-biodiversity-plan-sets-out-future-for-olympic-park-wildlife.php|title=New biodiversity plan sets out future for Olympic Park wildlife|work=London 2012|accessdate=5 March 2009|date=27 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309051828/http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2009-02/new-biodiversity-plan-sets-out-future-for-olympic-park-wildlife.php|archivedate=9 March 2009 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Renewable energy also features at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, this may now be as little as 9%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13034546|title=London 2012 Olympics 'to miss renewable energy target'|work=BBC News|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=11 April 2011}}</ref> Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generators]] in the River Thames.

Food packaging at the Olympics is made from compostable materials&nbsp;– like starch and cellulose-based [[bioplastics]]&nbsp;– where it cannot be re-used or recycled. This includes fast food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons. After they have been used, many of these materials would be suitable for [[anaerobic digestion]] (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/news/compostable-bioplastics-set-for-big-win-at-london-olympics|title=Compostable bioplastics set for big win at London Olympics|work=NNFCC|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=31 May 2011}}</ref>

Buildings like the [[Water Polo Arena]] will be relocated elsewhere. Building Parts like Roofing Covers and membranes of different temporary venues will be recycled via [[Vinyloop]]. This allows to meet the standards of the [[Olympic Delivery Authority]], concerning environmental protection. Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy is fulfilled. It says that

:Where London 2012 procures PVC for temporary usage or where permanent usage is not assured, London 2012 is required to ensure that there is a take-back scheme that offers a closed loop reuse system or mechanical recycling system for post-consumer waste.

"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the [[London Aquatics Centre|Aquatic centre]] temporary stands, basketball arena, [[Water Polo Arena]], and the shooting facilities at the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]], are essentially big tents. Basically PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme" says Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticseurope.org/information-centre/televised-newslinks.aspx |title=Televised Newslinks |publisher=PlasticsEurope |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>

London's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop [[baseball]] and [[softball]] from the 2012 Games two days after it had selected London as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were last scheduled for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]].<ref name=SportsDropped>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2005-07-08-baseball-softball-dropped_x.htm|title=Baseball, softball bumped from Olympics|first=Vicki|last=Michaelis|accessdate=17 August 2008|date=8 July 2005|work=USA Today }}</ref> The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them.

[[File:International Broadcast Centre, 14 June 2011 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The [[London Olympics Media Centre|International Broadcast Centre]] in June 2011]]

The host broadcaster was [[Olympic Broadcasting Services]] (OBS), an agency of the IOC. The OBS used its own cameras, and crews subcontracted from other Olympic broadcasters, to cover the events. The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own [[Sports commentary|commentary]] and presentation.

The official recording format of the 2012 Olympic Games used [[Panasonic]]'s digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the [[London Olympics Media Centre|International Broadcast Centre]] in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used [[P2 (storage media)|P2]] HD shoulder-mount camcorders.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Panasonic Announces 3D P2 HD Shoulder-Mount Camcorder ... for London 2012 Olympic Games|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110410005065/en/Panasonic-Announces-3D-P2-HD-Shoulder-Mount-Camcorder|publisher=Panasonic|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=10 April 2011}}</ref>

The IOC's wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and London 2012 was covered by several national and regional broadcasters. In the UK, the [[BBC]] carried the Olympics and [[Channel 4]] the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.<ref name="Roger Mosey Blog">{{cite web|date=29 September 2010|title=Roger Mosey's Blog|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/rogermosey/2010/06/highlighting_an_issue.html|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> [[BBC Parliament]]'s [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] channel was suspended, [[BBC Three]]'s on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.

In [[Sri Lanka]] a dispute occurred between [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation|Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC)]] and [[MBC Networks|MBC Networks (MTV/MBC)]] as to who was the official broadcaster of the Games. This problem was caused as [[Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union|Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU)]] had offered the official broadcasting rights to both networks, as both of the networks were ABU members. So SLRC filed a case against MBC Networks for broadcasting rights at the Colombo Magistrate's Court. Considering the case, the court issued a special court order preventing MBC Networks' Olympic broadcast and stated that SLRC should be the sole broadcaster.<ref>[http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=18124 Olympic broadcasting rights only to Rupavahini]</ref> However, when the Games started, both networks broadcast most of the events simultaneously. Another dispute had previously occurred between [[Carlton Sports Network|Carlton Sports Network (CSN)]] and SLRC, but the Sports Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, had stated that SLRC had the exclusive rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/sinhala/news/story/2012/03/120319_csn_rupavahini_olympics.shtml|title=BBCSinhala.com - Sandeshaya - Olympic rights 'will not be transferred'|publisher=}}</ref>

===Logo and graphics===
There have been two London 2012 logos: one created by Kino Design for the bidding process and a second as the brand for the Games themselves. The former was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green and red stripes winding through the text "LONDON 2012", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The latter, designed by [[Wolff Olins]], was published on 4 June 2007. It is a representation of the number 2012, with the [[Olympic symbols|Olympic Rings]] embedded within the zero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/about-newlook-video.html|title=The new London 2012 brand|publisher=London 2012|date=4 June 2007|accessdate=4 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606204757/http://www.london2012.com/about-newlook-video.html|archivedate=6 June 2007}}</ref>

===Sponsors===
{{main|2012 Summer Olympics marketing#Sponsors}}
{{update|section|date=October 2012}}
LOCOG and the IOC agreed sponsorship deals with several companies, each assigned to one of four categories; worldwide, tier one, tier two and tier three.<ref name="Sponsors"/> The worldwide partners are: [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Atos]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], [[General Electric]], [[McDonald's]], [[Omega SA]], [[Panasonic]], [[Procter & Gamble]], [[Samsung]] and [[Visa Inc.|Visa]].<ref name="Sponsors">{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/about-us/the-people-delivering-the-games/olympic-partners/|title=Olympic Games partners &#124; The people delivering the Games|publisher=London 2012|accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref> The companies provided £1.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.<ref>{{cite news|title=London 2012 Olympic sponsors list: who are they and what have they paid?|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/19/london-2012-olympic-sponsors-list|last=Rogers|first=Simon|date=19 July 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>

==Controversies==
{{main|Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics}}
During the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,<ref>{{cite news|last=Carman|first=Tim|date=18 July 2012|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/mcdonalds-olympian-achievement-in-london-a-french-fry-monopoly-and-largest-fast-food-restaurant/2012/07/18/gJQAZ6tQuW_story.html|title=McDonald's Olympian achievement in London: A French fry monopoly and largest fast-food restaurant|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.<ref name="washingtonpost1"/>

During the Games eight competitors in the [[Badminton at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's doubles|badminton women's doubles]] were disqualified for "not using best efforts", when they tried to lose matches in the group stage to obtain more favourable fixtures in the knockout rounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-blogs/badminton/all-eight-women-disqualified-for-throwing-badminton-matches.html |title=All eight women disqualified for throwing badminton matches |date=1 August 2012 |publisher=NBC Olympics |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120801173250/http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-blogs/badminton/all-eight-women-disqualified-for-throwing-badminton-matches.html |archivedate=1 August 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19072677|title=Olympics badminton: Eight women disqualified from doubles|work=BBC Sport|date=1 August 2012}}</ref> A number of results in boxing, gymnastics and judo were overturned by officials after initial decisions were appealed against.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-blogs/boxing/olympic-boxing-officials-punished-for-controversial-rulings.html |title=Olympic boxing officials punished for controversial rulings |publisher=NBC Olympics |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120814203322/http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-blogs/boxing/olympic-boxing-officials-punished-for-controversial-rulings.html |archivedate=14 August 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=John|first=Emma|title=Olympics: Kristian Thomas keeps cool as Team GB grab gymnastics bronze|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/30/london-2012-great-britain-gymnastics|accessdate=14 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j3bNS7fgOzpv5yhYWWpsIawrm3HQ?docId=CNG.174be06ad8ee4755308494817ef96f0e.a21|title=Farcical scenes in Japan-Korea judo quarter final|publisher=AFP|date=29 July 2012}}</ref>

[[Ye Shiwen]] faced doping allegations after her gold medal in the women's 400m Individual Medley as she came from being behind the world record in the final 50m to beating it by 1.02 seconds. Furthermore, her last 50m was swum 0.17 seconds quicker than the men's winner, [[Ryan Lochte]].
