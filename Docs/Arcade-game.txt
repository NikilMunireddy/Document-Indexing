An '''arcade game''' or '''coin-op''' is a [[coin-operated]] entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and [[amusement arcade]]s. Most arcade games are [[video game]]s, [[Pinball|pinball machines]], [[Electromechanics|electro-mechanical games]], [[redemption game]]s or [[merchandisers]].

While exact dates are debated, the [[golden age of arcade video games]] is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based [[video game consoles]] increased in capability and decreased in cost.

==Arcade action games==
The term "arcade game" is also used to refer to an [[action game|action video game]] that was designed to play similarly to an arcade game with frantic, addictive gameplay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Genre Definitions|url=http://www.mobygames.com/glossary/genres|publisher=Mobygames|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> The focus of arcade action games is on the user's reflexes, and the games usually feature very little puzzle-solving, complex thinking, or strategy skills. Games with complex thinking are called [[strategy video games]] or [[puzzle video games]].

==History==
The first popular "arcade games" included early [[amusement park|amusement-park]] [[midway (fair)|midway]] games such as [[wikt:shooting gallery|shooting galleries]], [[ball]]-[[wikt:toss|toss]] games, and the earliest coin-operated machines, such as those that claimed to tell a person's [[Fortune teller machine|fortune]] or that played mechanical music. The old midways of 1920s-era [[amusement park]]s (such as [[Coney Island]] in New York) provided the inspiration and atmosphere of later arcade games.

In the 1930s the first coin-operated [[pinball]] machines emerged. These early amusement machines differed from their later electronic cousins in that they were made of wood. They lacked  plungers or lit-up bonus surfaces on the playing field, and used mechanical instead of electronic scoring-readouts. By around 1977 most pinball machines in production switched to using [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[electronics]] both for operation and for scoring.<ref>[http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/ Vintage Coin Operated Fortune Tellers, Arcade Games, Digger/Cranes, Gun Games and other Penny Arcade games, pre-1977] from Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum</ref>

===Electro-mechanical games===
In 1966, [[Sega]] introduced an electro-mechanical game called ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]''.<ref name=Kent/> It was an early [[submarine simulator]] and [[light gun shooter]],<ref>Brian Ashcraft (2008) ''Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers'', p. 133, Kodansha International</ref> which used lights and plastic waves to simulate sinking ships from a submarine.<ref>Steve L. Kent (2001), ''The ultimate history of video games: from Pong to Pokémon and beyond: the story behind the craze that touched our lives and changed the world'', p. 102, [[Prima Games|Prima]], ISBN 0-7615-3643-4</ref> It became an instant success in Japan, Europe, and North America,<ref name=Wolf-149/> where it was the first arcade game to cost a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] per play,<ref name=Kent>[[Steven L. Kent]] (2000), ''The First Quarter: A 25-Year History of Video Games'', p. 83, BWD Press, ISBN 0-9704755-0-0</ref> which would remain the standard price for arcade games for many years to come.<ref name=Wolf-149>Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XiM0ntMybNwC ''The video game explosion: a history from PONG to Playstation and beyond''], p. 149, [[ABC-CLIO]], ISBN 0-313-33868-X</ref> In 1967, [[Taito]] released an electro-mechanical arcade game of their own, ''Crown Soccer Special'', a two-player [[sports game]] that simulated association football, using various electronic components, including electronic versions of pinball flippers.<ref>{{KLOV game|16047|Crown Soccer Special}}</ref>

The company Sega later produced gun games which resemble [[first-person shooter]] video games, but were in fact electro-mechanical games that used [[Rear projection effect|rear]] [[Image projector|image projection]] in a manner similar to the ancient [[zoetrope]] to produce moving animations on a [[Projection screen|screen]].<ref name="Cohen">{{citation|title=Killer Shark: The Undersea Horror Arcade Game from Jaws|author=D.S.

It was also the earliest known arcade game to feature a [[joystick]] with a fire [[Push-button|button]], which was used as part of an early [[Dual analog control|dual-control]] scheme, where two [[D-pad|directional buttons]] are used to move the player's tank and a two-way joystick is used to shoot and steer the missile onto oncoming planes displayed on the screen; when a plane is hit, an explosion is animated on screen along with an explosion sound.<ref name="Missile">{{KLOV game|10600|Missile}}</ref> In 1970,<ref>{{KLOV game|5190|S.A.M.I.}}</ref> the game was released in North America as ''S.A.M.I.'' by [[Midway Games|Midway]].<ref name="Missile"/> That same year, Sega released ''Jet Rocket'', a [[combat flight simulator]] featuring [[Aircraft flight control system|cockpit controls]] that could move the player aircraft around a landscape displayed on a screen and shoot missiles onto targets that explode when hit.<ref>{{KLOV game|17309|Jet Rocket}}</ref>

Throughout the 1970s, electro-mechanical arcade games were gradually replaced by electronic video games, following the release of ''Pong'' in 1972.<ref>Brian Ashcraft (2008) ''Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers'', p. 134, Kodansha International</ref> In 1972, Sega released an electro-mechanical game called ''Killer Shark'', a first-person light gun shooter known for appearing in the 1975 film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.<ref name="Cohen"/> In 1974, [[Nintendo]] released ''[[Wild Gunman]]'', a light gun shooter that used [[Full motion video based game|full-motion]] [[video projection]] from [[16 mm film]] to display live-action [[cowboy]] opponents on the screen.<ref>{{KLOV game|10432|Wild Gunman (1974)}}</ref> One of the last successful electro-mechanical arcade games was ''[[F-1 (arcade game)|F-1]]'', a racing game developed by [[Namco]] and distributed by [[Atari]] in 1976;<ref>{{KLOV game|7743|F-1}}</ref> the game was shown in the films ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978)<ref>{{YouTube|3UVzepqkmts|Mall Arcade (Dawn Of The Dead)}}</ref> and ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'' (1980), as was Sega's ''Jet Rocket'' in the latter film. The 1978 video game ''[[Space Invaders]]'', however, dealt a yet more powerful blow to the popularity of electro-mechanical games.<ref>Brian Ashcraft (2008) ''Arcade Mania!

===Arcade video games===
{{see also|Timeline of arcade video game history}}
{{VG history}}

In 1971 students at [[Stanford University]] set up the ''[[Galaxy Game]]'', a coin-operated version of the [[Spacewar!|Spacewar]] video game. This ranks as the earliest known instance of a coin-operated video game. Later in the same year, [[Nolan Bushnell]] created the first mass-manufactured game, ''[[Computer Space]]'', for [[Nutting Associates]].

In 1972, [[Atari]] was formed by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]]. Atari essentially created the coin-operated [[video game industry]] with the game ''[[Pong]]'', the first successful electronic [[ping pong]] video game. ''Pong'' proved to be popular, but imitators helped keep Atari from dominating the fledgling coin-operated video game market.

====Golden age====
{{main|Golden age of arcade video games}}
Taito's ''[[Space Invaders]]'', in 1978, proved to be the first [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] arcade video game.<ref>{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life|page=18| publisher= [[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ| accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> Its success marked the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games. Video game arcades sprang up in shopping malls, and small "corner arcades" appeared in restaurants, grocery stores, bars and movie theaters all over the United States, Japan and other countries during the late 1970s and early 1980s. ''Space Invaders'' (1978), ''[[Galaxian]]'' (1979), ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980), ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' (1980), ''[[Defender (arcade game)|Defender]]'' (1980), and ''[[Bosconian]]'' (1981) were especially popular. By 1981, the arcade video game industry was worth $8 billion<ref>{{cite news|title=Can Lasers Save VIdeo Arcades?|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB29715971BCAA2&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM| accessdate=13 March 2012| newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=3 February 1984|quote=Last year, arcade game revenues were approximately $5 billion, compared to $8 billion in 1981 and $7 billion in 1982.}}</ref> (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|8000000000|1981|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).

During the late 1970s and 1980s, chains such as [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], [[Ground Round]], [[Dave and Busters]], [[ShowBiz Pizza Place]] and [[Gatti's Pizza]] combined the traditional restaurant and/or bar environment with arcades.<ref name="daveandbustersexample">{{cite web|title=Dave and Buster's About Page|url=http://www.daveandbusters.com/About/|accessdate=20 September 2007}}</ref> By the late 1980s, the arcade video game craze was beginning to fade due to advances in home [[video game console]] technology. By 1991, US arcade video game revenues had fallen to $2.1 billion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Tracy|title=Are Arcades Archaic?

====Late 1980s====
[[Sega AM2]]'s ''[[Hang-On]]'', designed by [[Yu Suzuki]] and running on the [[Sega Space Harrier]] hardware, was the first of Sega's "Super Scaler" [[arcade system board]]s that allowed [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)#Move to 3D|sprite-scaling]] at high [[frame rate]]s.<ref>[http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p3.html IGN Presents the History of SEGA: World War], [[IGN]]</ref> The pseudo-3D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]/[[Tile engine|tile]] scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later [[Texture mapping|texture-mapped]] [[3D computer graphics|polygonal 3D]] games of the 1990s.<ref name=pseudo>[http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/ Extentofthejam.com]</ref> Designed by [[Sega AM2]]'s [[Yu Suzuki]], he stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning.

So I was always thinking in 3D."<ref name=suzuki>[http://web.archive.org/web/20131113174154/http://www.1up.com/features/disappearance-suzuki-part-1?pager.offset=2 Web.archive.org]</ref> It was controlled using a [[video game arcade cabinet]] resembling a [[motorbike]], which the player moves with their body. This began the "Taikan" trend, the use of [[Motion controller|motion-controlled]] hydraulic arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on [[video game console]]s.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20131113173854/http://www.1up.com/features/disappearance-suzuki-part-1?pager.offset=1 Web.archive.org]</ref>

====Renaissance====
In the early 1990s, the arcades experienced a major resurgence with the 1991 release of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Street Fighter II]]'',<ref>{{citation|title=Gamers: writers, artists & programmers on the pleasures of pixels|author=Shanna Compton|publisher=[[Soft Skull Press]]|year=2004|isbn=1-932360-57-3|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sCO-gODwy4C&pg=PA119}}</ref> which popularized competitive [[fighting game]]s and revived the arcade industry to a level of popularity not seen since the days of ''Pac-Man'',<ref name="tao2">Spencer, Spanner, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_taoofbeatemups_pt2_retro The Tao of Beat-'em-ups (part 2)], ''EuroGamer'', 12 February 2008.

In 1993, ''[[Electronic Games]]'' noted that when "historians look back at the world of coin-op during the early 1990s, one of the defining highlights of the video game art form will undoubtedly focus on fighting/martial arts themes" which it described as "the backbone of the industry" at the time.<ref>{{citation|title=Insert Coin Here: Getting a Fighting Chance|author=Jay Carter|magazine=[[Electronic Games]]|date=July 1993|issue=10|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic-Games-1993-07/Electronic%20Games%201993-07#page/n15/mode/2up|accessdate=2014-12-16}}</ref>

[[3D computer graphics|3D polygon graphics]] were popularized by the [[Sega Model 1]] games ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' (1992) and ''[[Virtua Fighter (arcade game)|Virtua Fighter]]'' (1993),<ref name=vracing>{{cite web|title=Virtua Racing – Arcade (1992) |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html |work=15 Most Influential Games of All Time |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=19 January 2014 |date=14 March 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131231101921/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html |archivedate=31 December 2013 }}</ref> followed by [[racing game]]s<ref name="tao2"/> like the [[Namco System 22]] title ''[[Ridge Racer]]'' (1993) and [[Sega Model 2]] title ''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona USA]]'', and [[light gun shooter]]s like Sega's ''[[Virtua Cop]]'' (1994)<ref name="ngage">[http://uk.ngage.ign.com/articles/528/528915p1.html Virtua Cop], ''IGN,'' 7 July 2004.

Around the mid-1990s, the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation]] home consoles, [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation]], and [[Nintendo 64]], began offering [[true 3D]] graphics. By 1995, personal computers followed, with [[3D accelerator]] cards. While [[Arcade system board|arcade systems]] such as the [[Sega Model 3]] remained considerably more advanced than home systems in the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite journal|title=News: Virtua Fighter 3|journal=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=May 1996| issue=174|pages=10–1}}</ref><ref>http://www.thg.ru/smoke/19991022/print.html</ref> the technological advantage that arcade games had, in their ability to customize and use the latest graphics and sound chips, slowly began narrowing, and the convenience of home games eventually caused a decline in arcade gaming. [[Sega]]'s [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation]] console, the [[Dreamcast]], could produce 3D graphics comparable to the [[Sega NAOMI]] arcade system in 1998, after which Sega produced more powerful arcade systems such as the [[Sega NAOMI|Sega NAOMI Multiboard]] and [[Sega Hikaru]] in 1999 and the [[Sega NAOMI 2]] in 2000, before Sega eventually stopped manufacturing expensive proprietary arcade system boards, with their subsequent arcade boards being based on more affordable commercial console or PC components.

====Decline====
Arcade video games had declined in popularity so much by the late 1990s, that revenues in the United States dropped to $1.33 billion in 1999,<ref>{{cite news|last=Henry|first=Lydia|title=Skee-ball Mania|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZFsxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0aIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5114,5262090|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|date=26 April 2001|page=36}}</ref> and reached a low of $866 million in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|title=Video killed the arcade star|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/article_9b22d9ea-1810-5465-8bd9-a4e3204de569.html?mode=story|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=[[East Valley Tribune]]|date=20 April 2006}}</ref> Furthermore, by the early 2000s, networked gaming via computers and then consoles across the Internet had also appeared,<ref name="online games">{{cite web|last=Mabry|first=Donald J.|title=Evolution of Online Games|url=http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/s/online-games.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209100942/http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/s/online-games.php|archivedate=9 February 2008|accessdate=21 September 2007}}</ref> replacing the venue of head-to-head competition and social atmosphere once provided solely by arcades.<ref name="socialarcades">{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Brad|title=Awakening the Arcade|url=http://blogs.oreilly.com/digitalmedia/2005/11/awakening-the-arcade.html|accessdate=21 September 2007}}</ref>

The arcades also lost their status as the forefront of new game releases. Given the choice between playing a game at an arcade three or four times (perhaps 15 minutes of play for a typical arcade game), and renting, at about the same price, exactly the same game—for a video game console—the console became the preferred choice. Fighting games were the most attractive feature for arcades, since they offered the prospect of face-to-face competition and tournaments, which correspondingly led players to practice more (and spend more money in the arcade), but they could not support the business all by themselves.

[[File:Video game - Ms Pacman and Galaga.jpg|right|thumb|Recent 20th anniversary arcade machine, combining two classic video games.]]
To remain viable, arcades added other elements to complement the video games such as [[redemption game]]s, merchandisers, and food service. Referred to as "fun centers" or "family fun centers",<ref name="familyfuncenterexample">{{cite web|title=Bullwinkles Family Fun Center|url=http://fun-center.com/WA/|accessdate=20 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070911154700/http://www.fun-center.com/WA/| archivedate= 11 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> some of the longstanding chains such as [[Chuck E.

Many old video game arcades have long since closed, and classic coin-operated games have become largely the province of dedicated hobbyists.

====Today====
Today's arcades have found a niche in games that use special controllers largely inaccessible to home users. An alternative interpretation{{By whom|date=February 2015}} (one that includes fighting games, which continue to thrive and require no special controller) is that the arcade game is now a more socially-oriented hangout, with games that focus on an individual's performance, rather than the game's content, as the primary form of novelty. Examples of today's popular genres are [[rhythm game]]s such as ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' (1998) and ''[[DrumMania]]'' (1999), and [[rail shooter]]s such as ''[[Virtua Cop]]'' (1994), ''[[Time Crisis]]'' (1995)  and  ''[[The House of the Dead (arcade game)|House of the Dead]]'' (1996).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the Western world, the arcade video game industry still exists today but in a greatly reduced form. Video arcade game hardware is often based on home game consoles to reduce development costs; there are video arcade versions of [[Dreamcast]] ([[Sega NAOMI|NAOMI]], [[Atomiswave]]), [[PlayStation 2]] ([[Namco System 246|System 246]]), [[Nintendo GameCube]] ([[Triforce (arcade system board)|Triforce]]), and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] ([[Sega Chihiro|Chihiro]]) home consoles and [[Personal computer|PC]] (e.g. [[Taito Type X]]). Some arcades have survived by expanding into ticket-based prize redemption and more physical games with no home console equivalent, such as [[skee ball]] and [[Whac-A-Mole]]. Some genres, particularly [[Music video game|dancing]] and [[rhythm game]]s (such as [[Konami]]'s ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''), continue to be popular in arcades.

Worldwide, arcade game revenues gradually increased from $1.8 billion in 1998 to $3.2 billion in 2002, rivalling [[PC game]] sales of $3.2 billion that same year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chou|first=Yuntsai|title=G-commerce in East Asia: Evidence and Prospects|journal=Journal of Interactive Advertising|date=Fall 2003|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://jiad.org/article43|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref> In particular, arcade video games are a thriving [[Video gaming in the People's Republic of China|industry in China]], where arcades are widespread across the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jou|first=Eric|title=The Wonderful and Seedy World of Chinese Arcades|url=http://kotaku.com/5894415/the-wonderful-and-seedy-world-of-chinese-arcades/gallery/1|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=9 April 2012|date=19 March 2012}}</ref> The US market has also experienced a slight resurgence, with the number of video game arcades across the nation increasing from 2,500 in 2003 to 3,500 in 2008, though this is significantly less than the 10,000 arcades in the early 1980s. As of 2009, a successful arcade game usually sells around 4000 to 6000 units worldwide.<ref>{{cite book|title=Digital sport for performance enhancement and competitive evolution : intelligent gaming technologies|year=2009|publisher=[[IGI Global|Information Science Reference]]|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=1-60566-406-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kags8xC1xzsC&pg=PA260|editor1=Nigel K.

==== Japan ====
In the [[Video gaming in Japan|Japanese gaming industry]], arcades have remained popular through to the present day. As of 2009, out of Japan's $20 billion gaming market, $6 billion of that amount is generated from arcades, which represent the largest sector of the Japanese video game market, followed by home [[console game]]s and [[mobile game]]s at $3.5 billion and $2 billion, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sambe|first=Yukiharu|title=Japan’s Arcade Games and Their Technology|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2009|volume=5709|series=Entertainment Computing– ICEC 2009|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-04052-8_62|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/tkv51714762l3645/|accessdate=25 January 2012|page=338}}</ref> In 2005, arcade ownership and operation accounted for a majority of [[Namco]]'s for example.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carless|first=Simon|title=Namco, Bandai To Merge|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=5405|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=13 March 2012|date=2 May 2005}}</ref> With considerable withdrawal from the arcade market from companies such as [[Capcom]], [[Sega]] became the strongest player in the arcade market with 60% marketshare in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Video Games Daily {{!}} Yu Suzuki: The Kikizo Interview (Page 2)|url = http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/sega_yu_suzuki_iv_feb06_p2.asp|website = archive.videogamesdaily.com|accessdate = 2015-06-28}}</ref> However, due to the country's [[Great Recession|economic recession]], the Japanese arcade industry has also been steadily declining, from [[Japanese yen|¥]]702.9 billion (US$8.7 billion) in 2007 to ¥504.3 billion ($6.2 billion) in 2010.<ref name="capcom_market">{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|website=[[Capcom]] Investor Relations|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=14 October 2011}}</ref> In 2013, estimation of revenue is ¥470 billion.<ref name="capcom_market"/>

In the Japanese market, [[Computer network|network]] and card features introduced by ''[[Virtua Fighter 4]]'' and ''[[World Club Champion Football]]'', and novelty cabinets such as [[Kidō Senshi Gundam: Senjō no Kizuna|''Gundam Pod'']] machines have caused revitalizations in arcade profitability in Japan. The reason for the continued popularity of arcades in comparison to the west, are heavy [[population density]] and an infrastructure similar to [[casino]] facilities.

Former rivals in the Japanese arcade industry, [[Konami]], [[Taito]], [[Bandai Namco]] and [[Sega]], are now working together to keep the arcade industry vibrant. This is evidenced in the sharing of arcade networks, and venues having games from all major companies rather than only games from their own company.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Interview: Takenobu Mitsuyoshi|url = http://www.tssznews.com/2013/03/28/interview-takenobu-mitsuyoshi/|website = TSSZ News|accessdate = 2015-06-28|first = Danny|last = Russell}}</ref>

==Technology==
{{See also|Arcade system board|List of Sega arcade system boards|Sprite (computer graphics)}}
[[File:Neogeoguts.JPG|thumb|right|Inside of a [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]]]]
Virtually all modern arcade games (other than the very traditional midway-type games at county fairs) make extensive use of solid state [[electronics]] and [[integrated circuit]]s. In the past, coin-operated arcade video games generally used custom per-game hardware often with multiple [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], highly specialized [[Sound chip|sound]] and [[Graphics processing unit|graphics chips]], and the latest in expensive [[computer graphics]] display technology. This allowed [[arcade system board]]s to produce more complex graphics and sound than what was then possible on [[video game console]]s or [[personal computer]]s, which is no longer the case today. Recent arcade game hardware is often based on modified video game console hardware or high-end PC components.

Arcade games frequently have more immersive and realistic game controls than either [[PC game|PC]] or [[console game]]s, including specialized ambiance or control accessories: fully enclosed dynamic cabinets with [[force feedback]] controls, dedicated [[lightgun]]s, rear-projection displays, reproductions of automobile or airplane cockpits, motorcycle or horse-shaped controllers, or highly dedicated controllers such as [[dance pad|dancing mats]] and [[fishing rod]]s. These accessories are usually what set modern video games apart from other games, as they are usually too bulky, expensive, and specialized to be used with typical home PCs and consoles.

==Arcade genre==
<!-- This section is linked from [[Endorfun]] -->
Arcade games often have short levels, simple and intuitive control schemes, and rapidly increasing difficulty. This is due to the environment of the Arcade, where the player is essentially renting the game for as long as their in-game avatar can stay alive (or until they run out of [[token coin|token]]s).

Games on consoles or PCs can be referred to as "arcade games" if they share these qualities or are direct ports of arcade titles. Many independent developers are now producing games in the arcade genre that are designed specifically for use on the Internet. These games are usually designed with [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]]/[[Java (programming language)|Java]]/[[DHTML]] and run directly in web-browsers.

Arcade [[racing game]]s have a simplified [[physics engine]] and do not require much learning time when compared with [[racing simulator]]s. Cars can turn sharply without braking or understeer, and the [[artificial intelligence|AI]] rivals are sometimes programmed so they are always near the player ([[rubberband effect]]).

Arcade [[flight]] games also use simplified physics and controls in comparison to [[flight simulator]]s. These are meant to have an easy [[learning curve]], in order to preserve their action component. Increasing numbers of console flight video games, from [[Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge|Crimson Skies]] to [[Ace Combat]] and [[Secret Weapons Over Normandy]] indicate the falling of manual-heavy flight sim popularity in favor of instant arcade flight action.<ref>{{cite web|author=Butts, Steve |year=2003 |title=Secret Weapon Over Normandy Review |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441056p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=15 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214100501/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441056p1.html |archivedate=14 February 2007 }}</ref>

Other types of arcade-style games include [[fighting game]]s (often played with an [[arcade controller]]), [[beat 'em up]] games (including fast-paced [[hack and slash]] games), [[light gun shooter|light gun]] [[rail shooters]] and "[[bullet hell]]" [[shooter game|shooters]] (intuitive controls and rapidly increasing difficulty), [[music game]]s (particularly [[rhythm game]]s), and [[mobile game|mobile]]/[[casual game]]s (intuitive controls and often played in short sessions).

==Emulation==
{{main|List of video game emulators#Arcade}}
[[Emulator]]s such as [[MAME]], which can be run on modern computers and a number of other devices, aim to preserve the games of the past.

Legitimate emulated titles started to appear on the [[Sony PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]], with CD-ROM compilations such as [[Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 1]], and on the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] with DVD-ROM titles such as [[Midway Arcade Treasures]].

Arcade games are currently being downloaded and emulated through the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] Service starting in 2009 with ''[[Gaplus]]'', ''[[Mappy]]'', ''[[Space Harrier]]'', ''[[Star Force]]'', ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'', ''[[Tecmo Bowl]]'', ''[[Altered Beast]]'' and many more.  Other classic arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', ''[[Tron (video game)|Tron]]'', ''[[Discs of Tron]]'', ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'', ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'', ''[[Dig Dug]]'', ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', and ''[[Missile Command]]'' are emulated on [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox Live Arcade]].

==Locations==
In addition to restaurants and video arcades, arcade games are also found in bowling alleys, college campuses, dormitories, laundromats, movie theaters, supermarkets, shopping malls, airports, ice rinks, corner shops, truck stops, bar/pubs, hotels, and even bakeries. In short, arcade games are popular in places open to the public where people are likely to have free time.

==List of highest-grossing arcade video games==
{{see also|List of best-selling video games|Golden age of arcade video games}}

For arcade games, success was usually judged by either the number of [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade hardware]] units sold to operators, or the amount of revenue generated, from the number of coins (such as [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] or [[100 yen coin]]s) inserted into machines,<ref>{{citation|title=The video game explosion: a history from PONG to Playstation and beyond|author=Mark J. P. Wolf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2008|isbn=0-313-33868-X|page=275|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiM0ntMybNwC&pg=PA275|accessdate=10 April 2011|quote=What are the best-selling video games? There are a number of factors to consider when attempting to answer this question. First, there are several different types of video games, which makes comparisons difficult, or perhaps unfair. Arcade games are played for a quarter a play (although some are 50 cents, or even more), while home games are bought outright, and their systems must be purchased as well.}}</ref> and/or the hardware sales (with arcade hardware prices often ranging from $1000 to $4000 or more). This list only includes arcade games that have either sold more than 1000 hardware units or generated a revenue of more than US$1&nbsp;million. Most of the games in this list date back to the [[golden age of arcade video games]], though some are also from before and after the golden age.
