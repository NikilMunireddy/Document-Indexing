The '''10th [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships in Athletics]]''', under the auspices of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF), were held in the [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium|Olympic Stadium]], [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] (6 August 2005 &ndash; 14 August 2005), the site of the first IAAF World Championships in 1983. One theme of the 2005 championships was [[paralympics|paralympic]] sports, some of which were included as [[Exhibition game|exhibition]] events.  Much of the event was played in extremely heavy [[rainfall]].

==Background==

===Bidding===
The original winning bid for the competition was for [[London]] but the cost to build the required stadium at [[Picketts Lock]] and host the event was deemed too expensive by the government. [[UK Athletics]] suggested to move the host city to [[Sheffield]] (using [[Don Valley Stadium]]), but the IAAF stated that having London as the host city was central to their winning the bid. The championships bidding process was reopened as a result. The United Kingdom's withdrawal as host was the first case for a major sporting event in a developed country since [[Denver]]'s withdrawal as host of the [[1976 Winter Olympics]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/1577797.stm Picketts Lock bid scrapped]. [[BBC Sport]] (2001-10-04). Retrieved on 2011-01-20.</ref>

Helsinki was considered by many to be the outsider in the race to host the games with rival bids being presented by [[Berlin]] in [[Germany]]; [[Brussels]] in [[Belgium]], [[Budapest]] in [[Hungary]], [[Moscow]] in [[Russia]] and [[Rome]] in [[Italy]].

===Opening ceremony===
[[Apocalyptica]] and [[Nightwish]] performed at the opening ceremony of the event over a heavy rainfall. [[Geir Rönning]], Finland's [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] entrant, sang "Victory" the official song of the 2005 IAAF World Championships.

===Events===
With the addition of the women's [[long-distance track event|3000 metres steeplechase]] to the schedule, that year's program of events was closer to parity for women and men. With the exception of the [[race walking|50 km walk]] the women competed in practically the same events as the men. Two differences remaining from before, though, were the short hurdles race (100 metres for women vs. 110 metres for men), and the multi-event competition ([[heptathlon]] for women vs. [[decathlon]] for men).

Since the first [[1983 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships in Helsinki 1983]], seven new events have been added for women:

* [[Long-distance track event|10000 metres]], introduced in [[1987 World Championships in Athletics|1987]]
* [[Long-distance track event|5000 metres]], replaced [[Middle distance track event|3000 metres]] in [[1995 World Championships in Athletics|1995]]
* [[triple jump]], introduced in [[1993 World Championships in Athletics|1993]]
* [[Race walking|20 km walk]] introduced in [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999]], replaced [[Race walking|10 km walk]] that first appeared in [[1987 World Championships in Athletics|1987]]
* [[pole vault]], introduced in [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999]]
* [[hammer throw]], introduced in [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999]]
* [[Long-distance track event|3000 metres steeplechase]], introduced in 2005

==Drug testing==
The IAAF conducted their largest ever anti-doping program at an athletics event for the championships, with 705 athletes subjected to a total 884 of tests.<ref>[http://www.canadiancyclist.com/dailynews.php?id=9732 November 2/05 10:28 am – WADA News, Lori-Ann Muenzer in Ontario, More 'Cross Results].

In March 2013, the IAAF announced that re-testing of samples taken during these championships revealed that five medal winners had proved positive for banned substances. The athletes involved were Belarusian [[Nadzeya Ostapchuk]] (shot put gold),  Belarusian [[Ivan Tsikhan]] (hammer throw gold), Russian [[Olga Kuzenkova]] (hammer throw gold), Russian [[Tatyana Kotova]] (long jump silver) and Belarus's [[Vadim Devyatovskiy]] (men's hammer silver).<ref name="BBC Sport">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/21712788 |title=Doping: Five 2005 world medallists caught after IAAF retests |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref> Belarusian [[Andrei Mikhnevich]] (shot put 6th) had also tested positive and was disqualified.<ref name=IAAF2013>IAAF: [http://www.iaaf.org/news/iaaf-news/andrei-mikhnevich-blr-results-annulled-from Andrei MIKHNEVICH (BLR) – results annulled from August 2005], iaaf.org, 31 July 2013</ref>

|colspan=6|Fascinating race with [[Paula Radcliffe]], using the race as preparation for the marathon, setting most of the pace before her lack of competitive 10k races this season sees her drop back with three laps to go. The three medal winners shows amazing acceleration with one lap to go, '''Berhane Adere''' kicking first but quickly covered by '''Tirunesh Dibaba''' with elder sister '''Ejegayehu Dibaba''' unable to match their pace. Tirunesh kicks again and goes past Adere with 250 metres to go to claim the gold. Reigning [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] champion [[Xing Huina]] cannot cope with the acceleration and finishes fourth.

'''Kajsa Bergqvist''' showed what willpower and dedication can achieve, as she claimed her first world championship gold medal after clearing 2.02m with only one foul in her entire series of jumps despite being having only recovered from injury within the past few months.  Newcomer '''Chaunte Howard''' was the only real threat to Kajsa, and a big surprise, seemingly to herself as much as to the spectators.  Her respectable jump technique and result make her someone to keep an eye on in the future.

|colspan=6|A close heptathlon saw '''Eunice Barber''' take the early lead after winning the 100&nbsp;mH and HJ. A foot injury hampered '''Carolina Klüft''' who jumped 12&nbsp;cm below her season best in the HJ, however, she struck back in the SP with a PB. After the first day, Barber had only a 2-point lead over Klüft. Day two started with the LJ, where Klüft was expected to jump poorly due to her injury. If she had problems she hid them well, winning with an SB. In the JT '''Margaret Simpson''' set a new PB with an impressive 56.36&nbsp;m, this would propel her to Ghana's first ever world championship medal. Before the final event, Klüft's lead was 18&nbsp;points and Barber needed to beat her by 1.5&nbsp;sec in the 800&nbsp;m to win the gold medal. Barber stuck to [[Kelly Sotherton]], the eventual winner of the race, until the last 200&nbsp;m but Klüft timed her race perfectly to beat Barber with another PB.
