Defensive tackle

A '''defensive tackle''' ('''DT''') is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in [[American football]]. The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the [[Guard (American football)|offensive guards]]. Depending on a team's individual defensive scheme, a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles.  These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent's backfield. If a defensive tackle reads a pass play, his primary responsibility is to pursue the [[quarterback]], or simply knock the pass down at the line if it's within arm's reach.  Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the [[screen pass]] or drop into coverage in a [[zone blitz]] scheme. In a traditional [[4-3 defense|4–3 defensive set]], there is no nose tackle. Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rush |first=Nathan |coauthors= |title=NFL Draft — Defensive Tackles |url=http://www.athlonsports.com/pro-football/12951/nfl-draft-defensive-tackles |date=February 8, 2008 |work=Athlon Sports |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100214062411/http://www.athlonsports.com:80/pro-football/12951/nfl-draft-defensive-tackles |archivedate=February 14, 2010 }}</ref> Some teams especially in the [[NFL]] do have a [[nose tackle]] in this scheme, but most of them do not.

==Nose tackle==
<!-- [[Nose guard]] redirects here -->
'''Nose tackle''' (also '''nose guard'''  or '''middle guard''') is a defensive alignment position for a [[defensive lineman]]. In the 3–4 defensive scheme the sole defensive tackle is referred to as the nose tackle.<ref name="DillonTSN">{{cite news|first=Dennis |last=Dillon |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Getting their nose dirty |url=http://tsn.sportingnews.com/exclusives/20041011/572815.html |work=[[The Sporting News]] |publisher= |date=October 11, 2004 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090829075406/http://tsn.sportingnews.com:80/exclusives/20041011/572815.html |archivedate=August 29, 2009 }}</ref> The nose tackle aligns across the [[line of scrimmage]] from the offense's [[Center (American football)|center]] before the play begins in the "0-technique" position.<ref name="Kirwan" />  In this position, frequently taking on the center and at least one if not both of the guards, the nose tackle is considered to be the most physically demanding position in football.<ref>Dixon, D., (October 18, 2004) http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_42_228/ai_n6249316/?tag=content;col1 [[The Sporting News]]</ref> In five-linemen situations, such as a goal-line formation, the nose guard is the innermost lineman, flanked on either side by a defensive tackle or [[defensive end]]. According to [[Pat Kirwan]], a traditional 3–4 defense demands "a massive man who can clog up the middle," while a 4–3 defense is looking for "a nose tackle who relies on quickness to penetrate and move along the front."<ref name="Kirwan">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/pat-kirwan/21823671/in-deep-pool-of-d-line-talent-schemes-will-dictate-picks |title=In deep pool of D-line talent, schemes will dictate picks |work=CBSSports.com |date=March 6, 2013 }}</ref>

Typical 3–4 nose tackles are "big wide bodies who can hold the point of attack and force double teams by the [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and [[Center (American football)|center]]."<ref name="Kirwan" /> They are usually the heaviest players on the roster, with weights ranging from {{convert|325|to|375|lb|kg|0}}. Also, height is critical, as they are supposed to get "under" the offensive line, which means ideal 3–4 nose tackles are no taller than {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Kirwan" /> Recent examples of such nose tackles include [[Ron Simmons]], [[Casey Hampton]], [[Jamal Williams]], [[Gilbert Brown]], and [[Vince Wilfork]]. Rather uncommon are taller nose tackles, such as [[Ted Washington]] and [[Ma'ake Kemoeatu]], who each won a Super Bowl ring are both {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m|2|abbr=on}} tall.

In some [[4-3 defense|4–3 defensive set]], the nose tackle is one of two defensive tackles. Some teams especially in the [[NFL]] do have a [[nose tackle]] in the [[4-3 defense|4–3 defensive set]], which lines up against the opposing center and very likely the weak-side or pulling guard.  In a [[4-3 defense|4–3 defensive set]], nose tackles are rather quick and supposed to "shoot the 'A gap' and beat the center and very likely the weak-side or pulling guard into the backfield."<ref name="Kirwan" /> Height is not as important, and their weight is closer to {{convert|300|lb|kg|0}}.

The terms "nose guard" or "middle guard" were more commonly used with the five-man defensive line of the older [[5–2 defense#5-2 Eagle|5-2 defense]].  Effective against most plays of the day, but with a weakness to the inside short pass, the 5–2 was phased out of the pro game in the late 1950s.<ref>Rand, Jonathan, ''Riddell Presents: The Gridiron’s Greatest Linebackers'', Sports Publishing, 2003, p. 36</ref><ref>Zimmerman, Paul, ''The New Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football'', Harper Collins, 1984, p. 128.</ref>  In the [[4-3 defense]], the upright [[middle linebacker]] replaced the middle guard. The nose guard is also used in a 50 read defense.  In this defense there is a nose guard, two defensive tackles, and two outside linebackers who can play on the line of scrimmage or off the line of scrimmage in a two-point stance.  The nose guard lines up head up on the center about six to eighteen inches off the ball. In a reading 50 defense, the nose guard's key is to read the offensive center to the ball.  In run away, the nose guard's job is to shed the blocker and pursue down the line of scrimmage, taking an angle of pursuit. The primary responsibility of the nose tackle in this scheme is to absorb multiple blockers so that other players in the defensive front can attack ball carriers and rush the quarterback.
