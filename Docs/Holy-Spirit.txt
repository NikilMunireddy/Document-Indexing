Holy Spirit

{{other uses}}
'''Holy Spirit''' or '''Holy Ghost''' is a term found in [[English translations of the Bible]] that is understood differently among the [[Abrahamic religions]].<ref>John R. Levison ''The Spirit in First-Century Judaism 2002'' p65 "Relevant Milieux : Israelite Literature : The expression, holy spirit, occurs in the Hebrew Bible only in Isa 63:10-11 and Ps 51:13. In Isaiah 63, the spirit acts within the corporate experience of Israel…"</ref><ref>Emir Fethi Caner, Ergun Mehmet Caner. ''More than a prophet: an insider's response to Muslim beliefs about Jesus and Christianity'' ISBN 978-0-8254-2401-4, 2003, p. 43. In Surah al-Nahl (16:102), the text is even more explicit: Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from thy Lord in Truth, in order to strengthen those who believe and as a Guide and glad tidings to Muslims."</ref>

The Hebrew language phrase ''ruach ha-kodesh'' ([[Hebrew]]: רוח הקודש, "holy spirit" also transliterated ''ruaḥ ha-qodesh'') is a term used in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) and Jewish writings to refer to the [[spirit]] of [[YHWH]] (רוח יהוה). It literally means "spirit of the holiness" or "spirit of the holy place". The Hebrew terms ''ruaḥ qodshəka'', "thy holy spirit" (רוּחַ קָדְשְׁךָ), and ''ruaḥ qodshō'', "his holy spirit" (רוּחַ קָדְשׁ֑וֹ) also occur (when a possessive suffix is added the [[definite article]] is dropped). 

The "Holy Spirit" in Judaism generally refers to the divine aspect of prophecy and wisdom. It also refers to the divine force, quality, and influence of the Most High [[God in Judaism|God]], over the universe or over his creatures, in given contexts.<ref name="Encyclopedia Judaica">Alan Unterman and Rivka Horowitz,Ruah ha-Kodesh, Encyclopedia Judaica (CD-ROM Edition, Jerusalem: Judaica Multimedia/Keter, 1997).</ref>

For the large majority of [[Christianity|Christians]], The Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost, from [[Old English]] ''gast'', "spirit") is the third [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|divine person]] of [[The Trinity]]: The "Triune God"  manifested as three different persons [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and Holy Spirit; each person being entirely [[God in Christianity|God]].<ref name=Erickson103>{{cite book |first1=Millard J. |last1=Erickson |year=1992 |title=Introducing Christian Doctrine |publisher=Baker Book House |page=103}}</ref><ref name=Hammond>{{cite book |first1=T.

(1994). ''Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine.'' Leicester, England: Inter-Varsity Press; Grand Rapids, MI: [[Zondervan]]. p. 226.</ref>  Two symbols from the [[New Testament]] canon are associated with the Holy Spirit in Christian [[iconography]]: a winged dove, and tongues of fire.  Each depiction of the invisible Heavenly Spirit of God arose from different historical accounts in the [[Gospel]] narratives; the first being at the [[baptism of Jesus]] in the [[Jordan River]] where the Holy Spirit was said to descend in the form of a dove as the voice of [[God the Father]] spoke as described in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]; the second being from the day of [[Pentecost]], fifty days after [[Easter|Pascha]] where the descent of the Holy Spirit came upon the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] and other followers of [[Jesus Christ]], as tongues of fire as described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|2:1–31}}.

For [[Orthodox Christians]], the Theophany and Pentecostal troparion are:

Theophany Troparion (Tone 1): When Thou, O Lord, wast baptized in the Jordan, worship of the [[Trinity]] wast made manifest; for the voice of the Father bore witness to Thee, calling Thee His beloved Son. And the Spirit in the form of a dove confirmed the truth of His word. O Christ our God, Who hath appeared and enlightened the world, glory to Thee.<ref>http://orthodoxwiki.org/Theophany</ref>

Pentecost, Troparion (Tone 8): Blessed art Thou, Christ our God, Who didst make [[Apostle (Christian)|the fishermen]] wise by sending down upon them the Holy Spirit, and through them didst draw the world into Thy net. Lover of men, glory to Thee.

Pentecost Kontakion (Tone 8): When the Most High came down and [[Tower of Babel|confused the tongues]], He divided the nations, but when He distributed the tongues of fire, He called all to unity. And with one accord we glorify the All-Holy Spirit."<ref>http://www.holytrinityorthodox.com/calendar/index.php?tzo=-5</ref>

==Islam==
{{Main|Holy Spirit (Islam)}}
The Holy Spirit ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: روح القدس  ''Ruh al-Qudus'', "the-Spirit the-Holy") is mentioned a number of times in the [[Qur'an]], where it acts as an agent of divine action or communication. The Muslim interpretation of the Holy Spirit is generally consistent with other interpretations based upon the Old and the New Testaments. On the basis of narrations in certain [[Hadith]] some Muslims identify it with the angel [[Gabriel]] (Arabic ''Jibreel''). The Spirit (الروح ''al-Ruh'', without the adjective "holy" or "exalted") is described, among other things, as the creative spirit from God by which God enlivened [[Adam in Islam|Adam]], and which inspired in various ways God's messengers and prophets, including [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]]. The belief in a "[[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]", according to the Qur'an, is forbidden and deemed to be [[blasphemy]]. The same prohibition applies to any idea of the [[dualism|duality]] of [[God in Islam|God]] ([[Allah]]).<ref>Griffith, Sidney H. ''Holy Spirit'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Quran]].</ref><ref>[[Thomas Patrick Hughes]], ''A Dictionary of Islam'', p. 605.</ref> Though [[grammatical gender]] has no bearing on sexual identity in non-personal nouns, the term "Holy Spirit" translates to, and is used in, the masculine form throughout the Qur'an.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] has the concept of the ''Most Great Spirit'', seen as the bounty of God.<ref name="saq">{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1981 |title = Some Answered Questions |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-190-6 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-25.html | chapter = The Holy Spirit|pages=108–109 |origyear = 1904-06}}</ref> It is usually used to describe the descent of the Spirit of God upon the [[Manifestations of God|messengers/prophets of God]] who include, among others, [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]].<ref name="rob1">{{cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh | year = 1976 |title = The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher = George Ronald |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-270-8 | page = 10 | url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V1/p007-011Ch01.html?back=%3C}}</ref>

In Bahá'í belief, the Holy Spirit is the [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] through which the wisdom of God becomes directly associated with his messenger, and it has been described variously in different religions such as the [[burning bush]] to Moses, the [[Atar|sacred fire]] to Zoroaster, [[Baptism of Jesus|the dove]] to Jesus, the angel [[Gabriel]] to Muhammad, and the [[Maid of Heaven]] to Bahá'u'lláh.<ref name="abdo">{{cite journal | journal = Bahá'í Studies Review | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | year = 1994 | title = Female Representations of the Holy Spirit in Bahá'í and Christian writings and their implications for gender roles | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdo_female_holy-spirit | first = Lil | last = Abdo}}</ref> The Bahá'í view rejects the idea that the Holy Spirit is a partner to God in the Godhead, but rather is the pure essence of God's attributes.<ref name="saq2">{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1981 |title = Some Answered Questions |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-190-6 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-27.html | chapter = The Trinity | pages = 113–115 |origyear = 1904-06}}</ref>
