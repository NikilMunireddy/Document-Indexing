The '''2009–10 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|93rd]] season of operation (92nd [[Season (sport)|season]] of play) of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and the 100th season since the founding of the predecessor [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA). It ran from October 1, 2009, including four games in Europe on October 2 and 3—until April 11, 2010, with the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs]] running to June 9, 2010. A mid-season break from February 15 to February 28 occurred to allow participation of NHL players in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. Because of the Winter Olympics break, there was no [[NHL All-Star Game]] for 2010. The [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Final]] saw the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] defeat the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in six games.

=== Salary cap ===

The salary cap was only increased a small amount for 2009–10 season. It was set at $56.8 million, which is $100,000 higher than in the 2008–09 season. The salary floor was $40.8 million.<ref>{{cite news |work=NHL.com |title=2009–10 salary cap set at $56.8 million |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=431786 |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 28, 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090627213922/http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=431786| archivedate= June 27, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Entry Draft ===
{{Main|2009 NHL Entry Draft}}
The Entry Draft was held June 26–27, 2009 at the [[Bell Centre]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[New York Islanders]] chose [[John Tavares (ice hockey)|John Tavares]] with the first overall pick. Other notable picks were [[Matt Duchene]], [[Victor Hedman]], [[Evander Kane]] and [[Brayden Schenn]].

=== New uniforms ===
Several teams ([[Calgary Flames|Calgary]], [[Minnesota Wild|Minnesota]], [[Nashville Predators|Nashville]], [[Florida Panthers|Florida]], and [[Colorado Avalanche|Colorado]]) debuted new third uniforms this season, while [[Philadelphia Flyers|Philadelphia]] and [[Edmonton Oilers|Edmonton]] made their third uniform their primary home jersey, and [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago]] made the jersey they wore for [[2009 NHL Winter Classic|the previous season's Winter Classic]] their new alternate. The [[New Jersey Devils]] announced plans to play one game (March 17 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, the first anniversary of [[Martin Brodeur]]'s record breaking 552nd win) wearing their 1982–1992 uniforms, albeit transferred onto the league's current RBK Edge jersey template. In addition, NHL officials had new uniforms, which debuted at the [[2009 NHL All-Star Game|2009 All-Star Game]].

=== Television dispute ===

Prior to the season, a contract dispute between [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] (the NHL cable carrier for the United States) and satellite television supplier [[DirecTV]] blacked out Versus for 14 million satellite subscribers. Versus was restored to DirecTV in March 2010.<ref>{{cite news |work=Mediaweek |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/cable-tv/e3ieae2fa145a05b6f729c2228d23d7cd6a |title=Viewership is up as Versus, ESPN rights fight brews |date=April 25, 2010| accessdate=May 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100429144309/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/cable-tv/e3ieae2fa145a05b6f729c2228d23d7cd6a?| archivedate= April 29, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref> While negotiations were secret, it was reported by the media that the dispute was over the 'slotting' of Versus with other channels. Versus was restored to DirecTV in the same tier of channels as the previous season. Versus President Jamie Davis confirmed that the dispute was necessary to get "the same level of distribution we had prior to be taken off the air".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nhl.fanhouse.com/2010/04/19/versus-president-jamie-davis-talks-nhl-wec-and-3d/ |title=Versus President Jamie Davis Talks NHL, WEC and 3D |publisher=NHL |date=April 19, 2010 |author=Perez, A.J.| accessdate=May 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100422020049/http://nhl.fanhouse.com/2010/04/19/versus-president-jamie-davis-talks-nhl-wec-and-3d/| archivedate= April 22, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy and sale===
{{main|Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy}}
The [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]]' holding company, Dewey Ranch Hockey LLC, filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. In a statement, Moyes announced that he had agreed in principle to sell the team to PSE Sports and Entertainment, headed by [[Research in Motion]] co-CEO [[Jim Balsillie]], for $212.5 million.<ref name="Filing">[http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20090505006774&newsLang=en Phoenix Coyotes File for Bankruptcy]</ref> As part of the deal, Balsillie intended to move the Coyotes to [[Hamilton, Ontario]].<ref name="ESPNHearing">http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=4150580</ref> Although initial reports said that Balsillie was considering [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] as well,<ref name="CBCBalsillie">[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/05/05/spphoenixbalsillie.html?ref=rss&cmp=AFC-I78V04166919 Balsillie offers $212.5M to bring Coyotes to Ontario ]</ref> Hamilton already has an NHL-sized arena in place, [[Copps Coliseum]], and Balsillie was already in talks with city officials to secure a lease for the arena.<ref name="ESPNHearing"/> Hamilton had previously bid for an NHL team in the 1990s, narrowly losing out to [[Ottawa Senators|Ottawa]]. Balsillie had previously made unsuccessful approaches to purchase the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and [[Nashville Predators]], with the [[Potential National Hockey League expansion|intent of relocating]] either team to Hamilton.<ref name="network.nationalpost.com">[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/09/08/balsillie-puts-bettman-to-the-dufus-test.aspx Balsillie puts Bettman to the doofus test]</ref>

The NHL opposed the bankruptcy and the matter went to Phoenix bankruptcy court. Two other potential bidders for the team emerged, Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago White Sox and Ice Edge Holdings. Bankruptcy hearings were held from May until September. Reinsdorf and Ice Edge did not bid for the team, and the NHL put in the only rival bid for the team at court.

In September, a Phoenix bankruptcy court rejected offers from the NHL and Jim Balsillie, ending Balsillie's plan to move the Coyotes to Hamilton. The NHL's offer was rejected because it left out creditors [[Jerry Moyes]] and [[Wayne Gretzky]]. On Balsillie's offer, Judge [[Redfield T. Baum]] refused to sanction the use of bankruptcy to force relocation of a franchise on a league. Gretzky, who was head coach of the team for the [[List of Phoenix Coyotes seasons|previous four seasons]], stayed away from training camp and was replaced. The Coyotes played their first home game to a sell-out; however, attendance was lower at other games in the month of October. Later in the month, the NHL and Moyes came to a tentative agreement to transfer ownership of the Coyotes to the NHL.

In December, the NHL announced that Ice Edge Holdings, a partnership of Canadians and Phoenix-area businessmen, had signed a letter of intent with the NHL to purchase the Coyotes. Ice Edge, which plans to keep the team in Phoenix, plans to play five Coyotes home games in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], each season as part of a five-year plan to return the Coyotes to profitability. Ice Edge would still have to negotiate a lease agreement with the [[Glendale, Arizona|City of Glendale]], and have its ownership approved by the NHL Board of Governors.<ref>{{cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |title=Ice Edge laughing all the way to the bank? |date=December 18, 2009 |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/ice-edge-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/article1403303/ | accessdate=May 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

On March 6, the NHL launched a lawsuit for $61 million against former Coyotes owner [[Jerry Moyes]] to recover $10 million in bankruptcy court costs, $20 million in losses for 2009–10 and $11.6 million owed to creditors.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=March 9, 2010 |title=NHL sues ex-Coyotes owner for $61M |author=McGran, Kevin |url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/article/777181| accessdate=May 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Three weeks later, the Coyotes clinched their first playoff berth since 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=522978 |title= Coyotes clinch first playoff berth since 2002 |publisher= National Hockey League |date= March 27, 2010 | accessdate=May 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100330055047/http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=522978| archivedate= March 30, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On April 13, Glendale, Arizona City Council approved a lease and sale agreement with [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] to take over the Coyotes and their lease of the Jobing.com Arena. The Council rejected the Ice Edge group. The agreement will create a special tax district surrounding the arena. Businesses in that district will pay $47 million annually to support the team. The agreement gives Reinsdorf the option to move the team after five years if revenues are not up to expectations. Former Coyotes CEO Jeff Shumway criticized the deal, saying that the team would not have gone bankrupt if the same deal had been available two years earlier. Reinsdorf's bid, which will pay the NHL $65 million for the team, has to be approved by the league board of governors.<ref>{{cite news |work=Winnipeg Free Press |date=April 14, 2010 |title=Steal of a deal gets nuttier: Reinsdorf gets $200K if it flops |author=Turner, Randy |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/columnists/steal-of-a-deal-gets-nuttier-reinsdorf-gets-200k-if-it-flops-91014199.html| accessdate=May 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100420061246/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/columnists/steal-of-a-deal-gets-nuttier-reinsdorf-gets-200k-if-it-flops-91014199.html| archivedate= April 20, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref>

== Pre-season ==
The 2009–10 pre-season for most teams started on September 14, 2009.

=== 2009 Kraft Hockeyville ===
Since 2006, [[Kraft Foods]] has sponsored a sweepstakes called ''[[Kraft Hockeyville]]'', in which various small cities across Canada compete against each other with the hopes of winning the privilege of having an NHL pre-season game played in a local sports complex or arena, along with a hockey festival named the ''Stanley Cup Jamboree''. The 2009 winner was the city of [[Terrace, British Columbia]]. The pre-season matchup was between the home town favorite [[Vancouver Canucks]] and the [[New York Islanders]].

=== Victoria Cup ===
{{Main|2009 Victoria Cup}}
The [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]], which was held in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, on September 29, 2009, just prior to the regular-season games, was contested between [[ZSC Zurich Lions]] and the NHL's [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. The game was won by Zurich 2–1.

== Regular season ==
{{anchor|Premiere in Europe}}
Four teams ([[Chicago Blackhawks|Blackhawks]], [[St. Louis Blues|Blues]], [[Florida Panthers|Panthers]] and [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]]) began their season in the NHL Premiere series, each playing two regular-season games in Europe. The Red Wings played the Blues in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, at [[Ericsson Globe]] while the Blackhawks and Panthers played in [[Helsinki]], Finland, at [[Hartwall Areena]] on October 2 and October 3.<ref>{{cite news |work=CBC |title=4 NHL teams to start '09–10 season in Europe |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/02/19/hockey-nhl-europe.html |date=February 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 19, 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090220204302/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/02/19/hockey-nhl-europe.html| archivedate= February 20, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> This is the second-straight season that Sweden has hosted an NHL regular season game, and the third season of the Premiere series, in which NHL regular season games are held in Europe. Unlike in previous years, the European games are not the inaugural games, as the regular season began October 1 in North America.

The [[Colorado Avalanche|Avalanche]], picked by many in the media{{Who|date=April 2010}} to finish last in the Western Conference, instead roared to a 10–2–2 mark for the month of October to lead the Western Conference, partly on the strong play of [[Craig Anderson (ice hockey)|Craig Anderson]] in net and rookies [[Ryan O'Reilly (ice hockey)|Ryan O'Reilly]] and [[Matt Duchene]]. The Coyotes, who were also not expected{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} to make the playoffs, started strongly. The team had signed some veterans and demoted some young players to the minors. The Coyotes surprised the Stanley Cup champion [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Penguins]] 3–0 in [[Pittsburgh]].

In the Eastern Conference, the Penguins had the best record after the first month. Teams playing at a higher level than predicted included the [[Buffalo Sabres|Sabres]], which led the Northeast Division through most of October. On the other end of the scale, 2009 Conference finalist [[Carolina Hurricanes|Hurricanes]] had a 2–8–3 record for October, the worst in franchise history.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In early November, the Columbus Chamber of Commerce released a report detailing how the Blue Jackets were losing $12 million per year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} According to ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'', the team's ownership is not prepared to continue funding the 'structural problem'. The Blue Jackets spend $5 million annually in arena rent, and lose around $4 million per year on events at the [[Nationwide Arena]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The arena district is estimated to provide $30 million in taxes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The report by Stephen A. Buser, suggests some options including the use of local and state taxes.<ref>{{cite news |work=Columbus Dispatch |title=Saving the Jackets |date=November 5, 2009 |last1= Bush |first1= Bill |last2= Carmen |first2= Barbara}}</ref>

Two streaks came to an end in November. The [[New Jersey Devils|Devils]] won nine games in a row on the road to start the season, one short of the league record set in the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07 season]] by the Sabres, before losing in Philadelphia to the [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]]. The Hurricanes lost a franchise-high 14 games in a row before defeating the [[Minnesota Wild|Wild]] in a shootout on November 15. The streak included overtime and shootout losses.

The [[2009 flu pandemic]] hit the [[Edmonton Oilers|Oilers]] hard with several players out for stretches in October. The [[Calgary Flames|Flames]] received their flu shots ahead of the general public, causing an [[Alberta]] health official to be fired.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Maple Leafs]] and the [[Vancouver Canucks|Canucks]] teams both had members of their staff "jump the queue" and receive flu shots ahead of the general public and were criticized in the media.

In December, [[Shane Doan]] of the Coyotes played his 1,000th game in a 2–1 shootout win over the Blue Jackets. On December 21, New Jersey Devils goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] recorded his 104th [[shutout]], breaking a record set by [[Terry Sawchuk]] during the [[1969–70 NHL season]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=509494 |title= Martin Brodeur and Terry Sawchuk by the numbers |first= John |last= Kreiser |date= December 22, 2009 |publisher= NHL.com |accessdate=December 22, 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100107170933/http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=509494| archivedate= January 7, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Three head coaches lost their positions in mid-season. Despite being early favorites for the Stanley Cup, the Philadelphia Flyers were 13–11–1 and 10th in the Eastern Conference when [[John Stevens (ice hockey)|John Stevens]] was fired on December 4, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/pages/landing/?blockID=99097&feedID=695 |title=Flyers Replace Stevens with Laviolette| accessdate=June 24, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>  On January 2, 2010, the Blues fired Head Coach [[Andy Murray]]. In 2008–09, the Blues had made the playoffs but struggled during 2009–10. [[Davis Payne]] was named interim head coach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blues.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=512037 |title=Payne Named Interim Head Coach |publisher=St. Louis Blues |date=January 2, 2010 | accessdate=May 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> One month later, on February 3, 2010, the Blue Jackets, unhappy with their slide in the standings after a good start, fired defensive-minded Head Coach [[Ken Hitchcock]].

[[2009–10 NHL transactions|Player trades]] started in earnest a month before the March 3, 2010, [[NHL trade deadline|trade deadline]]. On January 31, the Maple Leafs made two large trades, getting [[Dion Phaneuf]] from the Flames in a seven-player trade, and [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] from the [[Anaheim Ducks|Ducks]] for two players. The Flames were not done, trading [[Olli Jokinen]] to the [[New York Rangers|Rangers]] the next day. After top scorer and pending free agent [[Ilya Kovalchuk]] turned down a $101 million contract offer from the [[Atlanta Thrashers|Thrashers]], he was traded to the Devils on February 4.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kovalchuk a Devil |date=February 4, 2010 |publisher=Sportsnet.ca}}</ref>

On February 5, Boston investment banker [[Jeff Vinik]] agreed to buy the [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Lightning]] from owners OK Hockey, headed by [[Oren Koules]] and [[Len Barrie]]. The sale price was not disclosed, although the media speculated it was much less than the US$206 million that OK Hockey paid. The purchase is contingent on the approval of the NHL Board of Governors.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Sportsnet.ca |agency=Associated Press |title=Vinik agrees to buy Lightning |date=February 5, 2010}}</ref>

On February 8, [[Montreal Canadiens|Canadiens]]' General Manager [[Bob Gainey]] announced his retirement as GM, staying on as advisor to the club. Assistant GM [[Pierre Gauthier]] became the interim GM. Gauthier and Coach [[Jacques Martin (ice hockey)|Jacques Martin]] held the same positions with the [[Ottawa Senators|Senators]] in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Habs' Gainey to step down |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2010/02/08/habs_management/ |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=February 8, 2010 |publisher=Sportsnet.ca | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100210062538/http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2010/02/08/habs_management/| archivedate= February 10, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

From 3&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on February 12 until 11:59&nbsp;pm on Feb. 28, teams were not permitted to make any trades, since many NHL players were competing at the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|2010 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=517347 |title= Few trades made before market closes for a while |first= Adam |last= Kimelman |publisher= National Hockey League |date= February 12, 2010 | accessdate=May 14, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The March 3 trade deadline produced 31 trades involving 55 players, the largest number in NHL history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The most active team was the Coyotes, who were involved in seven deals. Unlike previous seasons, the Coyotes were in a playoff position at the trade deadline and were "buyers" of players rather than "sellers" (that is, they were looking to acquire key players to give the team a chance in the playoffs, rather than trading away players to other teams seeking playoff success). Only the [[Dallas Stars]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]] did not make any trades between March 1 (after the Olympic roster freeze was lifted) and the trade deadline on March 3 at 3:00&nbsp;pm EST. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The Canadiens celebrated their [[Montreal Canadiens centennial|centennial]] on December 4 and retired the number 3 for [[Émile Bouchard|Emile Bouchard]] and number 16 for [[Elmer Lach]] (which was already previously retired for [[Henri Richard]]). The Phoenix Coyotes retired 27, the number of [[Teppo Numminen]] at their home game.

=== Winter Classic ===
{{Main|2010 NHL Winter Classic}}
On July 15, 2009, the NHL announced that the third installment of the [[NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]] would take place on January 1, 2010, at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], with the [[Boston Bruins|Bruins]] hosting the [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]]. Because the NHL did not host an [[NHL All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in the 2009–10 season due to the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Olympics]], this became the league's showcase event. The Bruins won the game 2–1 in overtime. [[Marco Sturm]] scored the game-winning overtime goal, after the Bruins were initially down 1–0 in regulation. After the game, the roster of the United States men's hockey team for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] was released, which included Bruins' goaltender [[Tim Thomas (ice hockey)|Tim Thomas]].

=== Olympics ===
{{Main|Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament}}
The NHL did not hold an All-Star Game this season. Instead, many of the league's players participated in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. The Olympic [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|men's ice hockey tournament]] ran from February 16 to February 28, 2010. It was the first time since the NHL allowed its players to compete in the Olympics that the Winter Olympics were held in an NHL market, as well as the first to use an NHL-sized ice rink (as opposed to the bigger one normally used for international play). [[Rogers Arena|General Motors Place]], the [[Vancouver Canucks|Canucks]]' home arena, was the primary ice hockey venue for the Olympics, and was formally called Canada Hockey Place. The temporary name change reflects the [[International Olympic Committee]] policy against selling or promoting naming rights for its competition venues. Another example of this policy is that the ice surface and dasher boards had their advertisements removed.<ref name="Olympics"/> The [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canadian team]] won gold, the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|American team]] won silver, and the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finnish team]] won bronze. At the end of the tournament, United States goaltender [[Ryan Miller (ice hockey)|Ryan Miller]] was named Tournament MVP.

In order to prepare General Motors Place for the Olympics, the Canucks were required to face the longest road trip in NHL history, playing 14 straight road games from January 27 to March 13, 2010<ref name="Olympics">{{cite web|last=Sekeres|first=Matthew|title=Canucks take one for the Olympic team|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/hockey/news/newsid=12893.html|date=July 15, 2009|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Olympics put Canucks on record road grind|publisher=CBC Sports|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/07/15/sp-canucks-olympics.html|date=July 16, 2009|accessdate=July 16, 2009|agency=Canadian Press}}</ref>

===Notes===
* Totals do not include two regular-season opening games played in Europe. The Detroit Red Wings played the St. Louis Blues at the [[Ericsson Globe]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], and the Chicago Blackhawks played the Florida Panthers at [[Hartwall Areena]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].
* The Pittsburgh Penguins began play in their new arena ([[Consol Energy Center]]) on Wednesday, September 22, 2010. With a larger capacity, more luxury seating, and better amenities than their former home Mellon Arena, the Penguins are expected to have a larger average and overall attendance record in the 2010–11 season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leahy |first=Sean |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Photo-Expedition-Consol-Energy-Center-new-home?urn=nhl-233424 |title=Photo Expedition: Consol Energy Center, new home of the Pens - Puck Daddy - NHL Blog - Yahoo!

==Playoffs==
{{Main|2010 Stanley Cup playoffs}}

[[File:Hhof stanley cup.jpg|right|175px|thumb|The [[Stanley Cup]]]]

After the regular season, the standard of 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The [[Washington Capitals]] won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for having the best record in the league, at 121 points. Division champions maintained their relative ranking during the entire playoffs while the remaining teams were reseeded below them after each round.

These playoffs featured a rare event in professional sports, as the Flyers emerged from trailing three games to none against the Boston Bruins, and then after trailing three goals to none in game seven, they came back to win game seven and the series 4–3.

===Stanley Cup Final===
{{main|2010 Stanley Cup Finals}}
The [[Chicago Blackhawks]] won their first Stanley Cup since {{scfy|1961}}, defeating the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in six games. Their overtime win in Game 6 marked the first time that the [[List of Stanley Cup Final overtime series winners|Cup was won in overtime]] since the [[New Jersey Devils]] in {{scfy|2000}}.

===Playoff bracket===
In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice was determined based on regular season points. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team played at home for games one and two (plus five and seven if necessary), and the lower-seeded team was at home for games three and four (and if necessary, game six). This was determined on April 11.
