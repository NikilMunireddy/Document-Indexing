The '''2013–14 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|97th]] season of operation (96th season of play) of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). This season features a realignment of the league's 30 teams from a six to a four division format. The regular season began Tuesday, October 1, and concluded Sunday, April 13. The Stanley Cup playoffs began April 16.

==League business==

===Realignment===
The relocation of the former [[Atlanta Thrashers]] franchise to the current [[Winnipeg Jets]] in 2011 prompted the league to discuss realignment. On December 5, 2011, the NHL Board of Governors approved a conference realignment plan that would eliminate the current six-division setup and move into a four-conference structure from the 2012–2013 season.<ref name="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=604852">{{cite news | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=604852 | title=Governors adopt radical four-conference realignment plan | date=December 5, 2011 | first=Dan | last=Rosen | work=NHL.com | accessdate=December 5, 2011}}</ref> Under the plan, which was designed to better accommodate the [[Effects of time zones on North American broadcasting|effects of time zone differences]], each team would have played 50 or 54 intra-conference games, depending on whether it was in a seven- or eight-team conference, and two games (home and road) against each non-conference team. On January 6, 2012, the league announced that the [[National Hockey League Players' Association|NHLPA]] had rejected the proposed realignment, citing concerns about fairness, travel and the inability to see a draft schedule before approving, and that as a result, it would not implement the realignment until at least 2013–14.<ref>[http://www.wgrz.com/sports/article/149232/4/NHL-realignment-on-hold-after-union-balks NHL realignment on hold after union balks]. ''The Sports Network''. Retrieved January 6, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.hockeybuzz.com/blog.php?post_id=41111&blogger_id=1 NHL Alignment Will NOT Change as NHLPA Rejects Re-alignment. Here's why...]. ''Hockeybuzz.com''. Retrieved January 8, 2012.</ref>

Upon NHLPA rejection of the previous realignment, a new joint NHL-NHLPA plan was proposed in February 2013 as a modification of the previous plan with both the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]] moving to the East and the Winnipeg Jets moving to the West. This revised plan also adjusted the previously proposed four-conference system to a four-division/two-conference system, with the Eastern Conference consisting of two eight-team divisions, and the Western Conference consisting of two seven-team divisions. A new playoff format was also introduced to accommodate the new proposal, with the top three teams in each division making the playoffs, along with two wild-cards in each conference (for a total of 16 playoff teams).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=416887|title=NHL Realignment Includes Four Divisions, Wild Card Teams|work=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date=February 26, 2013}}</ref> The NHLPA officially gave its consent to the NHL's proposed realignment plan on March 7,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=659069&navid=nhl:topheads|title=Board of Governors Vote Next Step For Realignment Plan|work=[[NHL.com]]|author= Dan Rosen|date=March 8, 2013}}</ref> and then the NHL's Board of Governors approved the realignment and the new playoff format on March 14, to be implemented prior to the 2013–2014 season.<ref name=Realignment20130314>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=660138|title=Realignment plan approved by Board of Governors|work=[[NHL.com]]|author=Dan Rosen|date=March 14, 2013}}</ref> The league then announced the names of the divisions on July 19: the two eight-team divisions in the Eastern Conference would be the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] and the [[Metropolitan Division]], and the two seven-team divisions in the Western Conference would be the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] and the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=678456|title=NHL introduces new division names with schedule|work=[[NHL.com]]|author=Dan Rosen|date=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

===Canadian TV deals===
The league's Canadian broadcast agreements with [[Hockey Night in Canada|CBC]] and [[NHL on TSN|TSN]]/[[NHL on RDS|RDS]] expired at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/cbc-has-much-at-stake-in-next-nhl-television-rights-negotiation/article4601079/ | title=CBC has much at stake in next NHL television rights negotiation  | publisher=The Globe and Mail | date=October 11, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2013 | location=Toronto}}</ref> At the same time, the league had reportedly aimed for its next round of Canadian television contracts to have a value of at least $3.2 billion in total. During negotiations, NHL commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] had reportedly recognized the broadcaster's financial difficulties and budget cuts imposed by the [[Conservative Party of Canada|federal Conservative government]] which had decreased CBC's chances of maintaining rights to ''Hockey Night in Canada'' and offered CBC a simplified broadcast package which would have consisted of a national doubleheader on Saturday nights (as opposed to regional coverage of multiple games), reduced playoff coverage, and the loss of digital rights and the All-Star Game. Rights to the remaining properties not covered under the CBC's contract would have been offered to other broadcasters.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/cbcs-hockey-night-in-canada-window-set-to-close/article13571882/ | title=CBC's Hockey Night in Canada window set to close  | publisher=The Globe and Mail | date=August 2, 2013 | accessdate=November 3, 2013 | location=Toronto}}</ref><ref name=gandm-howcbclost>{{cite news|last1=Shoalts|first1=David|title=Hockey Night in Canada: How CBC lost it all|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/hockey-night-in-canada-how-cbc-lost-it-all/article21072643/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=11 October 2014|location=Toronto|date=October 10, 2014}}</ref>  However, CBC Sports' staff, including executive director [[Jeffrey Orridge]], continued to insist that it have exclusivity for every Saturday night game involving Canadian teams. In turn, CBC was failed to reach a deal;  [[BCE]] (owners of [[Bell Media]] and previous cable rightsholder [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and over the air broadcaster, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]) made a bid for sole national rights to the NHL, and attempted to contact the CBC in regards to forming a partnership. However, CBC Sports' staff did not respond. In turn, [[Rogers Communications]] also made a bid of its own.<ref name=gandm-howcbclost/>

On November 26, 2013, the NHL announced it had sold twelve seasons' worth of exclusive national broadcast rights to NHL games to Rogers, who would broadcast games across its numerous platforms, including [[Sportsnet]], [[Sportsnet One]], and [[City (TV network)|City]], at a price of C$5.2 billion. ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' would continue on the CBC for the next four seasons; the CBC would give Rogers six hours of free airtime each night to air the broadcasts but paid no rights fee. CBC would be allotted time during the broadcasts to promote its other programming. French language broadcasts were moved to [[TVA Sports]] under a sub-licensing deal with Rogers. The moves have left both Bell Media (except for its regional properties) and the CBC (which in turn, it would no longer compete with private broadcasters for professional sports) officially shut out of the national NHL broadcasts.<ref name=gandm-rogersnhl14>{{cite news|title=Rogers reaches 12-year broadcast deal with NHL worth $5.2-billion|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rogers-reaches-12-year-broadcast-deal-with-nhl-worth-52-billion/article15600412/|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=November 26, 2013|location=Toronto|date=November 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cbc-to-cut-657-jobs-will-no-longer-compete-for-professional-sports-rights-1.2605504|title=CBC to cut 657 jobs, will no longer compete for professional sports rights|publisher=CBC News|date=10 April 2014|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>

===Rule changes===
* All players with fewer than 25 games experience were required to wear visors. The additional minor penalty for instigating a fight when wearing a visor was removed. Players were now assessed an extra minor penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct should they remove their helmet prior to fighting.<ref name=nhl-rule-changes-2013 />
*Jerseys which were not worn properly (such as being tucked in), and other equipment infractions would now result in a minor penalty.
*The base of the goal frame was now shallower and narrower by 4 inches. The overall width of the base of the frame was reduced from 96 to 88 inches and the depth of the base of the frame was reduced from 44 to 40 inches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ingoalmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Approved-Goal-Frame-2013-2014.jpg|title=Approved Goal Frame 2013-14|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, the corners where the goal post meets the crossbar were bent with a smaller radius, allowing more area across the goal plane.<ref>[http://bluejacketsxtra.dispatch.com/content/blogs/puck-rakers/2013/09/little-change-big-difference.html ] {{wayback|url=http://bluejacketsxtra.dispatch.com/content/blogs/puck-rakers/2013/09/little-change-big-difference.html |date=20130910040230 }}</ref> The size of the goal itself remains 6 feet wide and 4 feet tall.
*The attainable pass exception to the icing rule was removed. Officials would nullify a potential icing only if a player made contact with the puck.
*Goaltender's equipment was modified. Pads couldn't rise higher on the goaltender's leg than 45 percent of the distance between the center of the knee and pelvis. The pads could rise no higher than nine inches above the knee for goalies with an upper-leg measurement of 20 inches.
*A new hybrid icing rule was adopted. The hybrid icing rule required officials to stop play immediately in a potential icing situation where, in the judgement of the official, the defender would win a race to the puck ahead of an attacker, and the puck would cross the goal line. The official was to make his judgement when a player gains an imaginary line connecting the end-zone faceoff dots. Note that the first player to gain this imaginary line may not have been the one who would win a race to the puck.<ref name=nhl-rule-changes-2013>[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=684940 Hybrid icing tops list of rule changes for 2013-14]. NHL.com Retrieved September 30, 2013.</ref>

===Uniforms===
*The Dallas Stars debuted a new logo, featuring a star with the letter D on it, as well as redesigned uniforms. The green on the uniform was restored as the dominant color, using a brighter shade called "Victory Green," reminiscent of the [[Minnesota North Stars|team]] before their move to Dallas, thus making the colors easier to distinguish.<ref>{{cite web | title=Behind The Scenes: The Creation of the Stars' New Logo and Uniforms | url=http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=672977 | publisher=NHL.com | date=June 4, 2013 | accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>
*The Nashville Predators add a slightly tapered gold stripe to the pants and they reverse the color pattern on their road socks. Previously, the color pattern matched that of the ends of the sleeves.
*The Anaheim Ducks introduced a replica of their inaugural 1993–94 jersey to wear in a regular season game against the Ottawa Senators on October 13.
*The Anaheim Ducks, Florida Panthers, and Boston Bruins were all wearing special patches to commemorate their first season in the NHL. The Ducks and Panthers were each wearing 20th season patches, and the Bruins were wearing 90th season patches. The Bruins' commemorative patch features six stars which signify the franchise's six Stanley Cup victories.
*The Carolina Hurricanes debuted a new uniform design that features different striping patterns on the home and away jerseys.<ref>{{cite web | title=Hurricanes Introduce New Home and Road Uniforms | url=http://hurricanes.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=672903 | publisher=NHL.com | date=June 4, 2013 | accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>
*The Toronto Maple Leafs and Detroit Red Wings wore specialized jerseys for the [[2014 Winter Classic]].
*The Los Angeles Kings and Pittsburgh Penguins retired their third jerseys.
*The San Jose Sharks modified their home and away jerseys.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stubits|first=Brian|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/eye-on-hockey/23236738/sharks-unveil-newlook-jerseys-with-classic-approach-less-orange|title=Sharks unveil new-look jerseys with classic approach, less orange|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref>
*The Minnesota Wild changed their away jersey.
*The Buffalo Sabres added a new third jersey, featuring a gold front and navy back.
*The Calgary Flames retired their throwback third, and added a new third jersey partially inspired by [[Western wear]].
*The New York Islanders, New York Rangers, Chicago Blackhawks, Pittsburgh Penguins, Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks each unveiled new jerseys featuring chromed logos for the [[2014 Stadium Series]].
*Although the New Jersey Devils also introduced a chromed version of their original red and green logo, they wore their red and green throwback jerseys unaltered (save for a Stadium Series patch) for their Stadium Series game against the Rangers.
*The Ottawa Senators and Vancouver Canucks wore specialized jerseys for the 2014 Heritage Classic. The Canucks reused the 1915 [[Vancouver Millionaires]] design from the previous season, while the Senators wore an off-white version of their black third jersey.

With realignment, a new scheduling format was introduced. Among the changes, the scheduling of inter-conference games ensured that all 30 teams would play in all 30 arenas at least once per season.<ref name=Realignment20130314/> Each team played 82 games – 50 or 54 games within their conference, depending on whether they were in a seven- or eight-team division, and two games (home and road) against each non-conference club. The regular season opened on October 1, 2013, with the first game seeing the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] defeat the home team [[Montreal Canadiens]] by a score of 4–3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/schedulebyweek.htm?date=09/26/2013 |title=NHL Hockey Schedule for September 26, 2013 to October 3, 2013 - NHL.com - Schedule |publisher=NHL.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

===Olympics===
{{Main|Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament}}
There was no [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|all-star game]] this season, due to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]]. Prior to the season, NHL, [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) and Olympic officials reached an agreement to send NHL players to the Olympics game. The league took a break on February 9 and resumed play on February 25.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2013/07/19/sp-olympics-nhl-sochi-russia-gary-bettman.html |title=NHL players to compete at 2014 Sochi Olympics |publisher=CBC |date=July 19, 2013}}</ref> All players participating in their respective national teams gathered in four U.S. airports and flew to Sochi on February 9 and 10.

===Winter Classic===
{{main|2014 NHL Winter Classic}}
The [[2014 NHL Winter Classic]] was held on January 1, 2014. The game, the sixth Winter Classic, featured the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the [[Detroit Red Wings]] at [[Michigan Stadium]] at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. The game was originally planned to be played on January 1, 2013, as the 2013 NHL Winter Classic, but was postponed due to the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]].<ref name=CBC20130407>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2013/04/07/sp-nhl-hockey-2014-winter-classic-detroit-red-wings-toronto-maple-leafs.html | title=Red Wings, Maple Leafs to meet in 2014 NHL Winter Classic | publisher=CBC Sports | date=April 7, 2013 | accessdate=April 7, 2013}}</ref>

[[HBO]] once again produced a four-part documentary chronicling the preparation of the two teams for the Winter Classic as part of its sports series ''[[24/7 (TV series)|24/7]]'' The special also aired in Canada on [[Sportsnet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=688204 |title=24/7 on HBO to feature 2014 NHL Winter Classic, Detroit Red Wings, Toronto Maple Leafs - Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic - Maple Leafs vs. Red Wings |publisher=Nhl.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

===Heritage Classic returns===
{{main|2014 Heritage Classic}}
The [[2014 NHL Heritage Classic]] featured the [[Ottawa Senators]] facing off against the home team [[Vancouver Canucks]] at [[BC Place]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. This was third Heritage Classic game held in Canada following the [[2011 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]] in 2011 when the Calgary Flames defeated the Montreal Canadiens 4–0 at [[McMahon Stadium]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. Unlike previous Heritage Classics, the 2014 event was technically held indoors; BC Place kept its [[retractable roof]] closed because of inclement weather.

===Debut of the Stadium Series===
{{main|2014 NHL Stadium Series|}}
On May 1, 2013, the NHL announced that the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] would host the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] at [[Soldier Field]] in [[Chicago]] on March 1, 2014, as part of the new [[NHL Stadium Series]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hawks to host Pens outside as part of 'Stadium Series'|publisher=National Hockey League|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=668718|date=May 1, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}</ref> The NHL announced an unprecedented six outdoor NHL games for the 2013–14 season: one Winter Classic, four Stadium Series games, and a Heritage Classic game.

For the two Stadium Series games they were involved in at [[Yankee Stadium]], the [[New York Rangers]] were the away team due to contract obligations with [[Madison Square Garden]] as they can't receive income from other venues in New York as the home team (this claim is dubious as Madison Square Garden owns the team and could theoretically waive that clause with its own team at any time).{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The six outdoor games were:

On November 18, 2013, the league announced ''NHL Revealed: A Season Like No Other'', a new seven-part series showing behind-the-scenes footage of top NHL players during the season. The program followed multiple players as they competed in the regular season, the Stadium Series, the Heritage Classic, and the Sochi Olympics. Unlike ''24/7'', language by players and coaches would be censored. The program aired in the United States on the [[NBC Sports Network]] starting on January 22, and in Canada on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] starting on January 23.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blackburn |first=Pete |url=http://thenosebleeds.com/nhl-announces-behind-the-scenes-documentary-series-on-top-players/ |title=NHL announces behind-the-scenes documentary series following star players |publisher=The Nosebleeds |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

===Postponed games===
The [[Carolina Hurricanes]]-[[Buffalo Sabres]] game originally scheduled for January 7 was postponed due to the [[2014 North American cold wave]].  It was rescheduled for February 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=699803&navid=nhl:topheads |title=Game between Carolina Hurricanes, Buffalo Sabres rescheduled for Feb. 25 - NHL.com - News |publisher=NHL.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

The [[Philadelphia Flyers]] postponed their game against the Hurricanes from January 21 to 22 due to the city of Philadelphia declaring a snow emergency. This resulted in the Hurricanes postponing their match with the [[Ottawa Senators]] from January 24 to 25 due to a rule stating that a team may not play games on three consecutive days.

The [[Dallas Stars]] postponed their March 10 game versus the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] after Dallas player [[Rich Peverley]], who had a history of heart problems, collapsed while on the players' bench midway through the first period, with Columbus leading 1–0. The game was abandoned at that point. This game was rescheduled for April 9. The game ran for 60 minutes, with Columbus leading 1–0 to start the game with a goal credited to [[Nathan Horton]] and assists credited to [[Matt Calvert]] and [[James Wisniewski]]. All other statistics were expunged. In the rescheduled game, the Blue Jackets won 3–1. This mirrors the actions taken by the league during a game between the Detroit Red Wings and Nashville Predators on November 21, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=709778&navid=nhl:topheads |title=Postponed Dallas Stars-Columbus Blue Jackets game rescheduled for April 9 - NHL.com - News |publisher=NHL.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

3. Greater number of points earned in head-to-head play.  (If teams played an unequal # of head-to-head games, the result of the first game on the home ice of the team with the extra home game is discarded.)<br />
4. Greater Goal differential

*Columbus were given a higher wild card seed than Detroit due to a higher amount of ROW's (38 to 34)
