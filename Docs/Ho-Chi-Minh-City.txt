{{Main|Names of Ho Chi Minh City}}
[[File:Kapok tree Honolulu.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Sài Gòn'' may refer to the [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]] (''bông gòn'') trees that are common around the city.]]
Ho Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups. In the 1690s, [[Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh]], a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of [[Huế]] to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the Mekong Delta and its surroundings. Control of the city and the area passed to the Vietnamese, who gave the city the official name of ''{{lang|vi|Gia Định}}'' ({{linktext|嘉|定}}). This name remained until the time of [[Cochinchina Campaign|French conquest]] in the 1860s, when the occupying force adopted the name ''Saigon'' for the city, a [[westernization|westernized]] form of the traditional name,<ref name="salkin-96-354">{{cite book|title=Asia and Oceania|series=International Dictionary of Historic Places|volume=5|page=354|author=Robert M.

The text of the resolution is as follows:

[[File:Ga-saigon2.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Saigon Railway Station]] retains the traditional name used informally since the 1620s.]]

===Saigon===
An etymology of ''Saigon'' (or Sài Gòn in Vietnamese) is that Sài is a [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] word ([[Hán tự]]: [[wikt:柴|柴]]) meaning "firewood, lops, twigs; palisade", while Gòn is another [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] word ([[Hán tự]]: [[wikt:棍|棍]]) meaning "stick, pole, bole", and whose meaning evolved into "cotton" in Vietnamese (''bông gòn'', literally "cotton stick", i.e., "cotton plant", then shortened to ''gòn''). This name may refer to the many [[Kapok tree|kapok]] plants that the [[Khmer people]] had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at Cây Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.<ref name="TruongVinhKy">[[Truong Vinh Ky|Trương Vĩnh Ký]], ''Souvenirs historiques sur Saigon et ses environs'', trong ''Excursions et Reconnaissance X. Saigon, Imprimerie Coloniale 1885''</ref>

Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from ''Tai-Ngon'' ([[wikt:堤|堤]] [[wikt:岸|岸]]), the [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] name of [[Cholon]], which means "embankment" (French: ''quais''),<ref group="nb" name="vhs-taingon">"Un siècle plus tard (1773), la révolte des TÁYON ''(sic)'' <nowiki>[qu’éclata]</nowiki> tout, d'abord dans les montagnes de la province de Qui-Nhon, et s’étendit rapidement dans le sud, chassa de Bien-Hoa le mouvement commercial qu’y avaient attiré les Chinois. Ceux-ci abandonnèrent Cou-lao-pho, remontèrent de fleuve de Tan-Binh, et vinrent choisir la position actuele de CHOLEN. Cette création date d'environ 1778. Ils appelèrent leur nouvelle résidence TAI-NGON ou TIN-GAN. Le nom transformé par les Annamites en celui de SAIGON fut depuis appliqué à tort, par l'expédition française, au SAIGON actuel dont la dénomination locale est BEN-NGHE ou BEN-THANH." Francis Garnier, quoted in: {{cite book|title=Tuyển tập Vương Hồng Sến|author=Hồng Sến Vương, Q. Thắng Nguyễn|url=http://www.scribd.com/Lich-Su-Thu-Do-Sai-Gon/d/7230907|publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn học|year=2002}}</ref> and Vietnamese ''Sai Côn'', a translation of the Khmer ''Prey Nokor'' ({{lang-km|ព្រៃនគរ}}). ''[[:wikt:ព្រៃ|Prey]]'' means forest or jungle, and ''[[:wikt:នគរ|nokor]]'' is a Khmer word of [[Sanskrit]] origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' — thus, "forest city" or "forest kingdom".<ref group="nb" name="warhope-sihanouk">"The Khmer name for Saigon, by the way, is Prey Nokor; prey means forest, nokor home or city." {{cite book|title=War and hope: the case for Cambodia|author=Norodom Sihanouk|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1980|isbn=0-394-51115-8|page=54|accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref>

Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, ''The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom,'' Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor ({{lang-km|ព្រោះរាជនគរ}}), "Royal City"; later locally corrupted to "Prey kor", meaning "kapok forest", from which "Saigon" was derived ("kor" meaning "kapok" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as "gòn" ).<ref>Touch Bora, ‘Jacobsen history challenged’, ''The Phnom Penh Post,'' 21 April 2006.</ref>

===Ho Chi Minh City===
The current official name, ''{{lang|vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh}}'', abbreviated Tp. HCM, is translated as ''Ho Chi Minh City'', abbreviated HCMC, and in French as ''{{lang|fr|Hô-Chi-Minh-Ville}}'' (the [[circumflex]] is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]], the first leader of [[Vietnam]]. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, [[wikt:胡|胡]]) with a given name meaning "enlightened will" (from [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] [[wikt:志|志]] [[wikt:明|明]]; Chí meaning 'will' (or spirit), and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning "light bringer".<ref name="bbc-bacho">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/ho_chi_minh.shtml|title=Historic Figures: Hồ Chí Minh (1890–1969)|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:HoChiMinhcity1815.jpg|thumb|Location of the hexagonal Gia Dinh Citadel (r) and [[Cholon]] area (tilted square, left) in 1815. Today this forms the area of Ho Chi Minh City.]]

===Early history===
Ho Chi Minh City began as a small fishing village likely known as Prey Nokor, "Forest City", or perhaps Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle meant "Royal City".<ref>Truong Mealy (former Cambodian Ambassador to Japan), quoted in Touch Bora, "Jacobsen history challenged", ''Phnom Penh Post'', 21 April 2006.</ref> The area that the city now occupies was originally swampland, and was inhabited by [[Khmer people]] for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese. In Khmer folklore southern Vietnam was given to the Vietnamese government as a dowry for the marriage of a Vietnamese princess to a Khmer prince in order to stop constant invasions and pillaging of Khmer villages.<ref>Jean Morice, ''Cambodge, du sourire à l'horreur'', Éditions France-Empire, 1977, p.30.</ref> The early dynastical entity was the Rhead-Sivakumaran family who dominated the region in the early Romanic period, until the Qing dynasty overcame the armies of Rhead-Sivakumaran and General Behan in 820&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schweyer|first=Anne-Valerie|title=Ancient Vietnam}}</ref>

===Khmer territory===
Beginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In 1623, King [[Chey Chettha II]] of Cambodia (1618–28) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War|Trịnh–Nguyễn civil war]] in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a custom house there.<ref>Mai Thục, ''{{lang|vi|Vương miện lưu đày: truyện lịch sử}}'', Nhà xuất bản Văn hóa – thông tin, 2004, p.580; Giáo sư Hoàng Xuân Việt, Nguyễn Minh Tiến hiệu đính, ''{{lang|vi|Tìm hiểu lịch sử chữ quốc ngữ}}'', Ho Chi Minh City, Công ty Văn hóa Hương Trang, pp.31–33; Helen Jarvis, ''Cambodia'', Clio Press, 1997, p.xxiii.</ref> Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The loss of the city [[Six Provinces of Southern Vietnam|and the rest of]] the [[Mekong Delta]] cut off Cambodia's access to the [[East Sea (Vietnam)|East Sea]]. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the [[Gulf of Thailand]] e.g. at [[Kampong Saom]] and [[Kep Province|Kep]].

===Nguyễn Dynasty rule===
[[File:French capture of Saigon in 1859.jpg|left|thumb|A French drawing of the French [[Siege of Saigon]] in 1859 by joint Franco-Spanish forces]]
In 1698, [[Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh]], a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of [[Huế]] by sea<ref>The first settlers, http://www.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng</ref> to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large [[Vauban]] citadel called [[Gia Định]] was built,<ref>http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/asia/vietnam/ho-chi-minh-city-and-around/</ref> which was later destroyed by the French following the [[Battle of Ky Hoa|Battle of Kỳ Hòa]] (see [[Citadel of Saigon]]). {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Colonial French era===
Conquered by France and Spain in 1859, the city was influenced by the French during their colonial occupation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.<ref>"Yearbook of the Encyclopedia Americana (2006)", p. 175.</ref>

In 1931, a new [[région]] called '''Saïgon–Cholon''' consisting of Saïgon and Cholon was formed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qBybCK8NjkEC&pg=PA316&dq=historic+dictionary+of+ho+chi+minh+city&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dLUOVJ_wGYLl8AWzyICgAg&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=Saigon%20-%20Cholon&f=false P. 61, ''Historic Dictionary of Ho Chi Minh City'' (written by Justin Corfield; published by Anthem Press in 2013)]</ref> Saïgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=so8AAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq= P. 21, ''Chinese Diaspora in South-East Asia: the Overseas Chinese in IndoChina'' (written Tracy Barrett; published in 2012 by I. B. Tauris & Co.)]</ref> In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the région of Saïgon–Cholon became a single city called '''Saïgon''' following the merger of the two cities of Saïgon and Cholon.

===Capital of the Republic of Vietnam===
The Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by [[Vichy France]] and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. During this time, the U.S. supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the [[Red River Delta]] region like [[Hanoi]], [[Haiphong]] and [[Thái Bình]].<ref>4 April 1967 speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. at Riverside Church in New York City</ref><ref>''The Uncensored War: The Media and Vietnam'' by Daniel C. Hallin</ref>

Former Emperor [[Bảo Đại]] made Saigon the capital of the [[State of Vietnam]] in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|along]] the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]] ([[Bến Hải River]]), with the communist [[Viet Minh|Việt Minh]], under [[Ho Chi Minh]], gaining complete control of [[North Vietnam|the northern half of the country]], while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the [[Republic of Vietnam]] when Bảo Đại was deposed by his Prime Minister [[Ngô Đình Diệm]] in 1955 in the [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|referendum]]. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the ''Đô Thành Sài Gòn'' (''Capital City Saigon''), or ''Thủ đô Sài Gòn'' (''National Capital Saigon''). South Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist [[North Vietnam]]ese and their allies during the [[Vietnam War]], with the assistance of the United States and other countries. On 30 April 1975, [[Fall of Saigon|Saigon fell]] and the war ended.<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/21/40-years-on-from-fall-of-saigon-witnessing-end-of-vietnam-war</ref>

===Post-Vietnam War and today===
[[File:Street life in Saigon.jpg|thumb|Street life in Saigon]]At the conclusion of the [[Vietnam War]] on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the [[Vietnamese People's Army]]. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the "[[fall of Saigon]]", while the communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the "Liberation of Saigon". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia Ðịnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader Hồ Chí Minh. The former name ''Saigon'' is still widely used by many Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts.<ref name="travelterrific">{{cite web|url=http://www.travelterrific.com/spring2000/asia_sp00_03.html|title=Pearl of the Orient is still Vietnam's heart|publisher=Travelterrific.com|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref> Generally, the term ''Saigon'' refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.

In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hung's new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Air===
[[File:Tan Son Nhat International Airport.jpg|thumb|Tan Son Nhat International Airport]]
The city is served by [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport|Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport]], the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5&nbsp;million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic<ref>"Expansion of Saigon – Tan Son Nhat International Airport on", ''Sài Gòn Giải Phóng Newspaper'', 13 October 2007 [http://www.sggp.org.vn/xahoi/2007/10/125219/]</ref><ref name="autogenerated2">Two more Hanoi<>Saigon flights per day for Pacific Airlines on Vietnamnet.net, accessdate 11 November 2007, {{vi}} [http://vietnamnet.vn/kinhte/2007/11/753468]</ref>). [[Long Thanh International Airport|Long Thành International Airport]] is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in [[Long Thành District]], [[Đồng Nai Province]], about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Thành Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; Tân Sơn Nhất Airport will serve domestic flights.<ref name="airportnews">{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/aci/aci/file/ADN%20-%20Momberger/ACI-ADN-August.pdf|title=Airport Development News|accessdate=19 May 2008}}</ref>

===Rail===
Ho Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many [[Vietnam Railways]] train routes in the country. The [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|Reunification Express]] (tàu Thống Nhất) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from [[Saigon Railway Station]] in [[District 3, Ho Chi Minh City|District 3]], with stops at cities and provinces along the line. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
Within the city, the two main stations are Sóng Thần and Sài Gòn. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as Dĩ An, Thủ Đức, Bình Triệu, Gò Vấp. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www1.mt.gov.vn/ykienatgt/print.asp?ArticleId=2576 |title=Print Version |publisher=.mt.gov.vn |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>

===Water===
The city's location on the [[Saigon River]] makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including [[Vũng Tàu]], [[Cần Thơ]] and the [[Mekong Delta]], and [[Phnom Penh]]. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011–14.<ref name="waterway-expand">{{Cite news|work=Vietnam News|title=City to expand waterway transport|url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Economy/198826/City-to-expand-waterway-transport.html|author=Vietnam News Service}}</ref>

===Coach bus===
Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house [[coach bus]]es to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station – in terms of passengers handled – is the [[Mien Dong Coach Station]] in the [[Bình Thạnh District]].

===Inner city transport===

====Private transport====
[[File:Mai Linh Taxi Da Lat.png|thumb|Mai Linh Taxi]]
The main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have trip meters, although it is also common to agree on the trip price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. Public buses run on many routes and fares can be purchased on the bus. For short trips, "xe ôm" (literally, "hug vehicle") motorcycle taxis are available where the passenger sits at the rear of a motorbike. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on [[Cycle rickshaw|cyclos]], which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared to Hanoi.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The growing number of motorcycles tend to cause gridlocks and pollute the air. These are two reasons why the government has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport besides other measures to reduce traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=Imminent gridlocks |author=Hans-Heinrich Bass, Thanh Trung Nguyen |publisher=dandc.eu |date=April 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/vietnam-needs-tackle-urban-traffic-congestion}}</ref>

====Metro system====
[[File:Metro Saigon Lines.png|thumb|Saigon Metro Map]]
The [[Ho Chi Minh City Metro]], a [[light rail]] [[rapid transit]] network, is currently in the preparation stages, with the first line currently under construction, to be completed by 2019. This first line will connect [[Bến Thành Market|Bến Thành]] to [[Suoi Tien Amusement Park|Suối Tiên Park]] in [[District 9, Ho Chi Minh City|District 9]], with a depot in [[Long Binh]]. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily.<ref name="railwaytech">{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/vietnammetro|title=Ho Chi Minh City Metro|publisher=Railway-technology.com|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> A line between Bến Thành and Tham Luong in [[District 12, Ho Chi Minh City|District 12]] has been approved by the government,<ref name="secondlineapproved">{{Cite news|work=Thanh Nien|title=HCMC's subway route No.2 approved|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/2008/Pages/20081211135245044481.aspx|author=Dinh Muoi}}</ref> and several more lines are currently the subject of feasibility studies.<ref name="railwaytech" />
