*The fossil plant ''[[Paradinandra|Paradinandra suecica]]'' could not be assigned to any family, but was placed ''incertae sedis'' within the order [[Ericales]] when described in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jürg Schönenberger |author2=Else Marie Friis |year=2001 |title=Fossil flowers of ericalean affinity from the Late Cretaceous of Southern Sweden |journal=[[American Journal of Botany]] |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=467–480 |url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/88/3/467.full | pmid = 11250825 |doi=10.2307/2657112}}</ref>

==In formal nomenclature==
When formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], stipulates that "species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations", but ranks higher than the [[genus]] may be assigned ''incertae sedis''.<ref name=ICN>{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

==Reason for use==

===Poor description===
This excerpt from a 2007 [[Academic publishing|scientific paper]] about [[crustacean]]s of the [[Kuril-Kamchatka Trench]] and the [[Japan Trench]] describes typical circumstances through which this category is applied in discussing:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Graham J. Bird |year=2007  |journal=[[Zootaxa]] |volume=1599 |pages=121–149 |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01599p149.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] excerpt |editor1=K.

<blockquote>...the removal of many [[genus|genera]] from new and existing [[family (biology)|families]] into a state of incertae sedis. Their reduced status was attributed largely to poor or inadequate descriptions but it was accepted that some of the vagueness in the analysis was due to insufficient character states. It is also evident that a proportion of the characters used in the analysis, or their given states for particular taxa, were inappropriate or invalid. Additional complexity, and factors that have misled earlier authorities, are intrusion by extensive [[homoplasies]], apparent character state reversals and [[convergent evolution]].</blockquote>

===Not included in an analysis===
If a formal [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] analysis is conducted that does not include a certain taxon, the authors might choose to label the taxon ''incertae sedis'' instead of guessing its placement. This is particularly common when [[molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenies]] are generated, since tissue for many rare organisms is hard to obtain. It is also a common scenario when [[fossil]] taxa are included, since many fossils are defined based on partial information. For example, if the phylogeny was constructed using soft tissue and [[vertebra]]e as principal characters and the taxon in question is only known from a single tooth, it would be necessary to label it ''incertae sedis''.<ref name=Matthews1973/>

=== Controversy ===
If conflicting results exist or if there is not a consensus among researchers as to how a taxon relates to other organisms, it may be listed as ''incertae sedis'' until the conflict is resolved.<ref name=Matthews1973/>

== In zoological nomenclature ==
In botany, a name is not validly published if it is not accepted by the author in the same publication.<ref name=ICN/><sup>Article 36.1</sup> In zoology, a name proposed conditionally may be [[available name|available]] under certain conditions.<ref name=ICZN/><sup>Articles 11 and 15</sup> For uncertainties at lower levels, the system of open nomenclature suggests that question marks be used to denote a questionable assignment.<ref name=Matthews1973/> For example, if a new species was given the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''album'' by Anton and attributed with uncertainty to ''Agenus'', it could be denoted "''Agenus? album'' Anton (?Anton)"; the "(?Anton)" indicates the author that assigned the question mark.<ref name=Matthews1973/> So if Anton described ''Agenus album'', and Bruno called the assignment into doubt, this could be denoted "''Agenus? album'' (Anton) (?Bruno)", with the parentheses around Anton because the original assignment (to ''Agenus'') was modified (to ''Agenus?'') by Bruno.<ref name=Matthews1973/>
