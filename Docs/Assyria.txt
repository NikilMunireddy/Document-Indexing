'''Assyria''', a major [[Mesopotamia]]n [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic-speaking]] kingdom and empire of the [[ancient Near East]], existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC,<ref>Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq, p. 187</ref> until its collapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the mid to [[Early Bronze Age]] through to the late [[Iron Age]].<ref name=edwards>{{cite book | title = Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 2, Part 2, History of the Middle East and the Aegean Region, c. 1380–1000 BC | chapter = Assyrian Military Power, 1300–1200 B.C. | author = J.

From the end of the seventh century BC to the mid-seventh century AD, it survived as a [[geopolitical]] entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] and successor states arose at different times during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and early [[Sasanian Empire]]s between the mid-second century BC and late third century AD, a period which also saw Assyria become a major centre of [[Syriac Christianity]] and the birthplace of the [[Church of the East]].<ref name="Winkler p. 1">Winkler, Church of the East: a concise history, p. 1</ref>

Centered on the [[Tigris]] in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] (modern northern [[Iraq]], northeastern [[Syria]], southeastern [[Turkey]] and the northwestern fringes of [[Iran]]), the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times. Making up a substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian "[[cradle of civilization]]", which included [[Sumer]], the [[Akkadian Empire]], and [[Babylonia]], Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements for its time. At its peak, the Assyrian empire stretched from [[Cyprus]] in the Mediterranean Sea to [[Iran]], and from what is now [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] in the [[Caucasus]], to the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Egypt]] and eastern [[Libya]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Assyrian Royal Inscriptions: Volume I | author = Albert Kirk Grayson | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | location = Wiesbaden | year = 1972 | page = 108 }} §716.</ref>

Assyria is named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur|Aššur]], which dates to c. 2600 BC, originally one of a number of Akkadian city states in Mesopotamia. In the 25th and 24th centuries BC, Assyrian kings were pastoral leaders. From the late 24th century BC, the Assyrians became subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian-]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian-speaking]] peoples of Mesopotamia under the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC.<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 161–191.</ref>

After its fall, Assyria, apart from a patchwork of small independent Assyrian kingdoms extant between the mid-2nd century BC and late 3rd century AD, largely remained a [[province]] and geopolitical entity under the successive control of the [[Medes]], the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Seleucid Empire]], the [[Parthian Empire]], the [[Roman Empire]] and the Sasanian Empire. The [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the mid-seventh century finally dissolved it as a single entity, after which the remnants of the [[Assyrian people]] gradually became an ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious minority in the [[Assyrian homeland]], surviving there to this day as the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people of the region.<ref name="Parpola, Simo 2004">Parpola, Simo (2004).

==Names==

Assyria was also sometimes known as [[Subartu]] and ''Azuhinum'' prior to the rise of the [[city-state]] of Aššūr, after which it was Aššūrāyu, and after its fall, from 605 BC through to the late seventh century AD variously as [[Achaemenid Assyria]], and also referenced as Atouria, [[Ator]], [[Hathor|Athor]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Y Odisho|first=George|title=The sound system of modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic)|year=1998|publisher=Harrowitz|isbn=3-447-02744-4|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ON7BEtQvejcC&lpg=PA8&dq=strabo%20atouria&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q=strabo%20atouria&f=false}}</ref> according to [[Strabo]], ''Syria'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]), ''Assyria'' ([[Latin]]) and [[Asōristān]] (Middle Persian). "Assyria" can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where Assyria, its empires and the Assyrian people were (and still are) centered. The modern [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic-speaking]] Christian ethnic minority in northern [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], southeast [[Turkey]] and northwest [[Iran]] are the descendants of the ancient Assyrians (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).<ref name="H.W.F. Saggs">Saggs notes that: "the destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers and, since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, their descendants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians" (''[[The Might That Was Assyria]]'', p. 290).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |title=Parpola identity_article|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf| archivedate= 17 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Pre-history==

In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a [[Neanderthal]] culture such as has been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in Assyria were the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100&nbsp;BC and [[Tell Hassuna]], the centre of the ''Hassuna culture'', c. 6000&nbsp;BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians throughout [[Mesopotamia]], which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name='Deutscher'>{{Cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}</ref> The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (a [[language isolate]]) on Akkadian, and vice versa, is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name='Deutscher'/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name='Deutscher'/> Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere after the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods">Woods C. 2006 "Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian".

The cities of [[Assur]] and [[Nineveh]], together with a number of other towns and cities, existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC), although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states.

Greco-Roman classical writers such as [[Julius Africanus]], [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]] dated the founding of Assyria to various dates between 2284&nbsp;BC and 2057&nbsp;BC,<ref>''[[Cory's Ancient Fragments]]'', [[Isaac Preston Cory]], 1832, p.&nbsp;74.</ref><ref>''Roman History'', Book 1, Chapter 6.</ref><ref>''The History of Antiquity'' by Maximilian Duncker, 1877, p.&nbsp;26–30.</ref> listing the earliest king as [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] or [[Ninus]].

However, the far older and more numerous written records of the Assyrians and Mesopotamians themselves (Akkadian-Assyrian annals dating from c. 25th century BC) make no mention whatsoever of the historically much later appearing [[Judeo-Christian]] figures of Shem and Ashur, and Assyrian tradition itself lists the first king of Assyria as the 25th century BC [[Tudiya]], and an early urbanised Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] (c. 2050 BC) as having dedicated the first temple to the god Ashur in the city in the mid-21st century BC. It is highly likely that the city was named in honour of its patron Assyrian god with the same name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The city of [[Assur|Aššur]], together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC. However it is likely that they were initially Sumerian-dominated administrative centres. In the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]]ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions "smiting [[Subartu]]" (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in ''c.'' the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is known. In the [[Assyrian King List]], the earliest king recorded was [[Tudiya]]. According to [[Georges Roux]] he would have lived in the latter half of the 25th century BC, i.e. somewhere between 2450 BC and 2400 BC. In archaeological reports from [[Ebla]], it appeared that Tudiya's activities were confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'' (trading colony) in Eblaite territory, with "king" Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the [[vizier]] of Ebla for king Ishar-Damu).

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by [[Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers (Yangi, Shuhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imshu, Harshu, Didanu, Hanu, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu and Azarah). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of [[Hammurabi]], the [[Amorite]] king of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'', were independent semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers. These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Ashur]] in the mid 21st century BC.<ref>Saggs, ''The Might'', 24.</ref>

====Akkadian Empire and Neo-Sumerian Empires====
[[File:Arquero asirio.jpg|thumb|Assyrian archer]]
During the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334–2154 BC), the Assyrians, like all the Mesopotamian Semites (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by [[Sargon the Great]] claimed to encompass the surrounding "four quarters". The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia, had also been known as [[Subartu]] by the Sumerians, and the name Azuhinum in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=EwBuAAAAMAAJ |page=32 }} |title=Prehistory and Protohistory of the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain|work=M. A. Nayeem|year=1990|page=32}}</ref>

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the [[Nuzi#Archaeology|Nuzi tablets]].<ref name="Shendge1997">{{cite book|author=Malati J. Shendge|title=The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb6CZMmwo00C&pg=PA46|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-325-0|page=46}}</ref> During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of Asia Minor, ancient Iran, Elam, the [[Arabian Peninsula]], Canaan and Syria.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]''s in [[Hittite empire|Hatti]] was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BC). On those tablets, Assyrian traders in [[Burushanda]] implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name "Hatti" itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], campaigning in Anatolia.

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] script to [[Asia Minor]] and [[The Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]). However, towards the end of the reign of [[Sargon the Great]], the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; "the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously".<ref>Malati J. Shendge (1 January 1997). The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit. Abhinav Publications. p. 46. ISBN 978-81-7017-325-0. Retrieved 22 April 2011.</ref>

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian [[Gutian people]] in 2154 BC. The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BC and 2112 BC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (or [[3rd dynasty of Ur]]) founded in c. 2112 BC. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur, but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler (''shakkanakku'') named Zāriqum (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to [[Amar-Sin]] of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC (c. 2050 BC); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of ''shakkanakka'' or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=fhMTRcUm9WsC |page=7 }} |title=The Invention of Cuneiform: Writing in Sumer|work=Jean-Jacques Glassner|year=1990|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=BPX0h_wbFtEC |page=11 }} |title=Area Handbook for the Persian Gulf States|work=Richard F.

Assyria became a regionally powerful nation in the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] from the late 21st century to the mid 18th century BC. Following this, it found itself under short periods of Babylonian and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] rule in the 18th and 15th centuries BC respectively. From the mid 18th century BC, Assyria came into conflict with the newly created city state of [[Babylon]], which eventually eclipsed the far older [[Sumero-Akkadian]] states and cities in the south.

The first written inscriptions by 'urbanised' Assyrian kings appear in the mid-21st century BC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city states and small kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of Ashur was traditionally ascribed to king [[Ushpia]] who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of [[Ishbi-Erra]] of [[Isin]] and [[Naplanum]] of [[Larsa]]. He was reputedly succeeded by kings named [[Apiashal]], [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]] (died c. 2026 BC), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Ashur.

The Amorites had overrun the kingdoms of southern Mesopotamia and the Levant between the 21st and 19th centuries BC, but had hitherto been successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings during this period. However, [[Erishum II]] (c. 1818–1809 BC) was to be the last king of the dynasty of [[Puzur-Ashur I]], founded c. 2025 BC. In 1808 BC he was deposed and the throne of Assyria was usurped by [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1809 – 1776 BC) in the expansion of Amorite tribes from the [[Khabur River]] delta in the north eastern Levant.

After securing its borders on all sides, Assyria entered into a quiet and peaceful period in its history which lasted for two and a half centuries, remaining untroubled by the emergence of the [[Hittite Empire]] and Hurri-Mitanni [[Empire]], both to the north of Assyria, and by the [[Kassites]] who had seized [[Babylonia]] from its Amorite founders.

Assyria found itself under short periods of Babylonian and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] rule in the 18th and 15th centuries BC respectively. The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic Mitannian-Hurrian domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Indo-European-speaking Mitannians are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a [[language isolate]], i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.

{{main|Middle Assyrian Empire}}
Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] from 911 BC, it again became a great power over the next three centuries, overthrowing the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt]] and conquering [[Egypt]], driving the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Kushites]] and [[Nubians]] from Egypt. The Middle period (1365 BC - 1056 BC) saw reigns of great kings, such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Arik-den-ili]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period, Assyria overthrew the empire of the [[Hurri]]-[[Mitanni]] and eclipsed the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Canaan]] and [[Phrygia]] in the [[Near East]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Calculated Frightfulness of Ashur Nasir Pal|first=A.T.|last= Olmstead|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=38|year=1918|pages=209–263}}</ref>

====Society and law in the Middle Assyrian Period====

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

The Middle Assyrian Period was marked by the long wars fought that helped build Assyria into a [[warrior society]]. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society.

Assyria needed less artificial [[irrigation]] than Babylonia, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common ''casus belli''.

All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. A [[legal code]] was produced during the 14th and 13th centuries which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to [[divorce]] their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed [[adultery]], she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce.

The women of the king's harem and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as [[Strike (attack)|beatings]], [[mutilation]], and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. [[Execution]]s were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by forced labour. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture/duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.

Assyria was open to [[homosexual]] relationships between men.<ref name="Dynes">Homosexuality in the Ancient World, by Wayne R. Dynes, Taylor & Francis, 1992, p.

====Assyrian expansion and empire, 1392–1056 BC====
[[File:Assyrian troops return.png|260px|thumb|Assyrian troops return after victory.]]
Assyria had difficulties with keeping the trade routes open. Unlike the situation in the Old Assyrian period, the Anatolian metal trade now was effectively dominated by the empires of the [[Hittites]] and the [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrians]]. These people now controlled the Mediterranean ports, while the [[Kassites]] controlled the river route south to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The main Assyrian cities of the middle period were [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Nimrud]]) and [[Nineveh]], all situated in the [[Tigris]] River valley, together with [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]), [[Gasur]], [[Ekallatum]] and Arbela (modern [[Irbil]]).

The Aramaeans of northern and central Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the Tigris.{{sfnp|''EB'', "Tiglath-Pileser"|1911}} The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pitru]]<ref>Bryce, Trevor.

Late in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by Tukulti-Mer, a pretender to the throne of Assyria. Ashur-bel-kala eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of Arameans to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as Carchemish and the source of the [[Khabur river]], but by the end of his reign many of the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the Mediterranean, previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Assyrian Empire.

====Assyria during the Bronze Age Collapse, 1055–936 BC====

The [[Bronze Age Collapse]] from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Assyria and its empire were not unduly affected by these tumultuous events for some 150 years, perhaps the only ancient power that was not. However, upon the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a ''comparative'' decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern Aramea, south eastern Asia Minor, central Mesopotamia and north western Iran.

New [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic-speaking]] peoples such as the Arameans, [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Suteans]] moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of Babylonia to the south, Indo-European speaking [[Iranic]] peoples such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Parthians]] moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native Gutians and pressuring Elam and [[Mannea]] (which were all ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Iran), and to the north the Phrygians overran the Hittites, a new Hurrian state named Urartu arose in the Caucasus, and Cimmerians, [[Colchians]] (Georgians) and Scythians around the Black Sea and Caucasus. Egypt was divided and in disarray, and Israelites were battling with other [[West Asia]]n peoples such as the [[Amalekites]], [[Moabites]], [[Edomites]] and [[Ammonites]] and the non-Semitic-speaking [[Peleset]]/[[Philistines]] (who have been conjectured to be one of the so-called [[Sea Peoples]])<ref name=AK2013>{{citation|title=The Philistines and Other "Sea Peoples" in Text and Archaeology|work=Society of Biblical Literature Archaeology and biblical studies|volume=15|first=Ann E.|last=Killebrew|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|date=2013|isbn=978-1-58983-721-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBCl2IQfNioC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=2}}. Quote: "First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term "Sea Peoples" encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term "Sea Peoples" refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from "islands" (tables 1–2; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g., [[Robert Drews|Drews]] 1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term "Sea Peoples" in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation "of the sea" appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006). Hencefore the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.]"</ref><ref name=Drews48>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48 The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C., Robert Drews, p48–61] Quote: "The thesis that a great "migration of the Sea Peoples" occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions, one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III. Yet in the inscriptions themselves such a migration nowhere appears. After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about 'the sea peoples', one Egyptologist (Wolfgang Helck) recently remarked that although some things are unclear, "eins ist aber sicher: Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer 'Volkerwanderung' zu tun." Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation."</ref> for the control of southern Canaan.

Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria in comparison to its former might, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world. Assyria, with its stable monarchy, powerful army and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia and Media. Kings such as [[Ashur-bel-kala]], [[Eriba-Adad II]], [[Ashur-rabi II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I]], [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] and [[Ashur-Dan II]] successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time.

Assyrian kings during this period appear to have adopted a policy of maintaining and defending a compact, secure nation and satellite colonies immediately surrounding it, and interspersed this with sporadic punitive raids and invasions of neighbouring territories when the need arose.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of [[Adad-nirari II]], in 911 BC, lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the [[Babylonians|Babylonians, Chaldeans]], [[Medes|Medes/Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] in 612 BC.<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=ae_chart Chart of World Kingdoms, Nations and Empires—All Empires]</ref>

====Expansion, 911–627 BC====
Tiring of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian interference in the Assyrian Empire, [[Esarhaddon]] decided to conquer Egypt. In 671 BC crossed the [[Sinai Desert]], and invaded and took Egypt with surprising ease and speed, driving its foreign [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and [[Ethiopia]]n rulers out and destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] in the process. Esarhaddon declared himself "king of [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]". Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how; "All Ethiopians (read Nubians/Kushites) I deported from Egypt, leaving not one left to do homage to me". He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf.

Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–627 BC), Assyrian domination spanned from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (modern [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and [[Arabia]] in the south, and from the [[East Mediterranean]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west to [[Persia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] in the east.

[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal's brutal campaign against [[Elam]] in 647 BC is recorded in this relief.]]

Ultimately, Assyria conquered [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites|Neo-Hittite States]], the [[Hurrian|Hurrian lands]], [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]], and [[Cyprus]], and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimean Peninsula|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others. At its height, the Empire encompassed the whole of the modern nations of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Cyprus]], together with large swathes of [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

Assyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, the long struggles pacifying the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Arameans and Elamites, the exertions undertaken in keeping the Medes, Scythians, Persians, Urartians and Cimmerians subjugated, and the constant campaigning over three centuries to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, had left Assyria materially, economically and physically exhausted. It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison and effectively control the huge empire, and after the death of Ashurbanipal severe civil unrest broke out in Assyria itself, and the empire began to unravel.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>

====Downfall, 626–605 BC====
The Assyrian Empire was severely crippled following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC—the nation and its empire descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sin-shar-ishkun]]. [[Egypt]]'s 26th Dynasty, which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals, quietly detached itself from Assyria, although it was careful to retain friendly relations.

The Scythians and Cimmerians took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid Assyrian colonies, with hordes of horse borne marauders ravaging parts of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], where the vassal kings of [[Urartu]] and [[Lydia]] begged their Assyrian overlord for help in vain. They also raided the [[Levant]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (where [[Ashkelon]] was sacked by the Scythians) and all the way into [[Egypt]] whose coasts were ravaged and looted with impunity.

The [[Iranic]] peoples (the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]]), aided by the previous Assyrian destruction of the hitherto dominant [[Elamites]] of [[Ancient Iran]], also took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to coalesce into a powerful Median dominated force which destroyed the ''pre-Iranic'' Assyrian vassal kingdom of [[Mannea]] and absorbed the remnants of the pre-Iranic [[Elamites]] of southern Iran, and the equally pre-Iranic [[Gutians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].

[[Cyaxares]] (technically a vassal of Assyria), in an alliance with the Scythians and Cimmerians, launched a surprise attack on a civil war bleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking Kalhu (the Biblical Calah/Nimrud) and taking Arrapkha (modern Kirkuk) and [[Gasur]]. Nabopolassar, still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia by Assyrian forces, was completely uninvolved in this major breakthrough against Assyria.

Despite the sorely depleted state of Assyria, bitter fighting ensued; throughout 614 BC the alliance of powers continued to gradually make hard fought inroads into Assyria itself, however in 613 BC the Assyrians somehow rallied against the odds and scored a number of counterattacking victories over the Medes-Persians, Babylonians-Chaldeans and Scythians-Cimmerians. This led to the coalition of forces ranged against it to unite and launch a massive combined attack in 612 BC, finally besieging and entering Nineveh in late 612 BC, with Sin-shar-ishkun being slain in the bitter street by street fighting. Despite the loss of almost all of its major cities, and in the face of overwhelming odds, Assyrian resistance continued under [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612-605 BC), who fought his way out of Nineveh and coalesced Assyrian forces around [[Harran]] (in modern south east Turkey), [[Carchemish]] (modern [[Jarablus]] in north east Syria) and in the vassal kingdom of [[Urartu]] (in modern north eastern Turkey).<ref>K.B. Matveev, Al-Ashuriyyun wal Mas'ala Al-Ashuriyya - ''As for what was was remaining of the Assyrian army, they were led by the brother of the King Ashurbanipal from the city of Ashur towards Haran, located Northwest of the city of Nineveh. From there they pushed further North in the district of Eysala for the purpose of being hidden from the eyes from neighbouring Urartu. The Medeans however eventually took control of the latter and actually reached their very capital, Ushpi. Part of this Assyrian army remained in the mountains of Eysala,along with the peaceful populations from home who followed them there. The other portion of the army crossed the Euphrates and took refuge in the castle of Charchemish (currently Jarablus) where most of  the Assyrian army was finally destroyed in 605BC.''</ref> However, the alliance of powers took Harran in 608 BC, and after a failed bid to recapture the city by the Assyrian king the same year, Carchemish too fell in 605 BC.

Sections of the Assyrian army retreated to the western corner of Assyria after the fall of Harran and Carchemish, and a number of Assyrian imperial records survive between 604 BC and 599 BC in and around the Assyrian city of Dur-Katlimmu in what is today north eastern Syria, and so it is possible that remnants of the Assyrian administration and army still continued to hold out in the region for a few years.<ref>Assyria 1995: Proceedings of the 10th Anniversary Symposium of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project / Helsinki, September 7–11, 1995.</ref> Certainly by 599 BC at the very latest, Assyria had been destroyed as an independent political entity, although it was to launch major rebellions against the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 546 BC and 520 BC, and remained a [[geo-political]] region, ethnic entity and colonised province until the late 7th century AD, with small Assyrian states emerging in the region between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.

===Assyria after the empire===

====Achaemenid Assyria, Osroene, Adiabene, Asōristān, Athura and Hatra====
{{main|Osroene|Adiabene|Asōristān}}

Assyria was initially ruled by the short lived [[Median Empire]] (605–549 BC) after its fall. In a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]] the last king of Babylon (together with his son and co-regent [[Belshazzar]]) was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]]. He had overthrown the short lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty in Babylonia, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, being fully absorbed into the native population of Babylonia. However, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in the city of Harran, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins with only small numbers of Assyrians living within them, conversely a number of towns and cities such as [[Arrapkha]], [[Guzana]], [[Nohadra]] and [[Harran]] remained intact, and [[Assur]] and [[Arbil|Arbela]] ([[Irbil]]) were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival. However, Assyria spent much of this short period in a degree of devastation following its fall.

====Achaemenid Assyria (549–330 BC)====

{{main|Achaemenid Assyria}}

After the Medes were overthrown by the [[Persian people|Persians]] as the dominant force in Ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion centered around [[Tyareh]] was eventually quashed by [[Cyrus the Great]].

Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria|publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html| archivedate= 14 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520–519 BC.

The Persians had spent centuries under Assyrian domination (their first ruler [[Achaemenes]] and his successors, having been vassals of Assyria), and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years, and Greek writers such as [[Thucydides]] still referred to it as ''the Assyrian language''.<ref>Van de Mieroop, ''History'', p. 293.</ref> [[Nineveh]] was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked [[Xenophon]] reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins. Conversely the ancient city of [[Assur]] once more became a rich and prosperous entity.<ref>Curtis, John (November 2003). "The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq". L'archéologie de l'empire achéménide (Paris, France): 12.</ref>

It was in 5th century BC Assyria that the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] evolved. Five centuries later these were later to have a global influence as the liturgical language and written script for [[Syriac Christianity]] and its accompanying [[Syriac literature]] which also emerged in Assyria before spreading throughout the Near East, Asia Minor, The Caucasus, Central Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and China.

====Macedonian and Seleucid Assyria====
In 332 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Emperor from [[Greece]], who called the inhabitants ''Assyrioi''. The [[Macedonian Empire]] (332–312) was partitioned in 312 BC. It thereafter became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (312 BC). It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria'' Vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises]], the Seleucids applied the name not only to Assyria itself, but also to the Levantine lands to the west (historically known as [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and [[Eber Nari]]), which had been part of the Assyrian empire but, the north east corner aside, never a part of Assyria proper.

When the Seleucids lost control of Assyria proper, the name ''Syria'' survived but was erroneously applied only to the land of [[Aramea]] (also known as [[Eber Nari]]) to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, but apart from the north eastern corner, had never been a part of Assyria itself, nor inhabited by Assyrians. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Northern Mesopotamia and the Arameans and Phoenicians from the Levant being collectively dubbed '''Syrians''' (and later also '''Syriacs''') in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] and later European culture, regardless of ethnicity, history or geography.

During Seleucid rule, Assyrians ceased to hold the senior military, economic and civil positions they had enjoyed under the Achaemenids, being largely replaced by Greeks. The Greek language also replaced Mesopotamian East Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, although this did not affect the Assyrian population themselves, who were not Hellenised during the Seleucid era.

During the Seleucid period in southern Mesopotamia, [[Babylon]] was gradually abandoned in favour of a new city named [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], effectively bringing an end to ''Babylonia'' as a geo-political entity.

====Parthian Assyria (150 BC – 225 AD)====

{{main|Achaemenid Assyria}}

By 150 BC, Assyria was largely under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]]. The Parthians seem to have exercised only loose control over Assyria, and between the mid 2nd century BC and 4th century AD a number of [[Neo-Assyrian]] states arose; these included the ancient capital of [[Assur]] itself, [[Adiabene]] with its capital of [[Irbid|Arbela]] (modern [[Irbil]]), [[Beth Nuhadra]] with its capital of [[Nohadra]] (modern [[Dohuk]]), [[Osroene]], with its capitals of [[Edessa]] and [[Amid]] (modern [[Sanliurfa]] and [[Diyarbakir]]), [[Hatra]], and "ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ" ([[Beth Garmai]]) with its capital at [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Mohsen|first=Zakeri|title=Sasanid soldiers in early Muslim society: the origins of 'Ayyārān and Futuwwa|year=1995|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-03652-8|pages=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfYnu5F20coC&pg=PA135}}</ref>

These freedoms were accompanied by a major Assyrian cultural revival, and temples to the Assyrian national gods [[Ashur]], [[Sin]], [[Hadad]], [[Ishtar]], [[Ninurta]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Shamash]] were once more dedicated throughout Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia during this period.<ref>Crone & Cook 1977, p. 55</ref>

In addition, [[Christianity]] arrived in Assyria soon after the death of Christ and the Assyrians began to gradually convert to [[Christianity]] from the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] during the period between the early first and third centuries. Assyria became an important centre of [[Syriac Christianity]] and [[Syriac Literature]], with the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] evolving in Assyria, and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] partly also, indeed Osroene became the first independent [[Christian]] state in history.<ref name="Winkler p. 1"/>

====Roman Assyria (116–8)====
{{main|Assyria (Roman province)}}
However, in 116, under [[Trajan]], Assyria and its independent states were briefly taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|province of Assyria]]. The Assyrian kingdom of [[Adiabene]] was destroyed as an independent state during this period. Roman rule lasted only a few years, and the Parthians once more regained control with the help of the Assyrians, who were incited to overthrow the Roman garrisons by the Parthian king. However, a number of Assyrians were conscripted into the [[Roman Army]], with many serving in the region of [[Hadrians Wall]] in [[Roman Britain]], and inscriptions in Aramaic made by soldiers have been discovered in [[Northern England]] dating from the second century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall|title=When Syrians, Algerians and Iraqis patrolled Hadrian's Wall|author=Charlotte Higgins|work=the Guardian|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>

With loose Parthian rule restored, Assyria and its patchwork of states continued much as they had before the Roman interregnum, although Assyria and Mesopotamia as a whole became a front line between the Roman and Parthian empires.. Other new religious movements also emerged in the form of [[gnosticism|gnostic sects]] such as [[Mandeanism]], as well as the now extinct [[Manichean]] religion.

====Sassanid Assyria (226–c.650)====
{{main|Asōristān}}
In 226, Assyria was largely taken over by the [[Sasanian Empire]]. After driving out the Romans and Parthians, the Sassanid rulers set about destroying the independent states within Assyria during the mid to late 3rd century; Hatra was dissolved in 241, Osroene in 244 and Assur was sacked by [[Shapur I]] in 256, and Beth Nuhadra and Beth Garmai during this period also.

The land was known as [[Asōristān]] (the Sassanid Persian name meaning "Land of the Assyrians") during this period, and became the birthplace of the distinct [[Church of the East]] (now split into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]) and a centre of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], with a flourishing [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur]] (as well as other Mesopotamian gods) in his home city, in [[Harran]] and elsewhere during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, indicating the ancient pre-Christian Assyrian identity was still extant to some degree.

During the Sasanian period, much of what had once been [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia was incorporated into Assyria, and in effect the whole of Mesopotamia came to be known as Asōristān.

Parts of Assyria appear to have been semi independent as late as the latter part of the 4th century AD, with a king named [[Sennacherib II]] reputedly ruling the northern reaches in 370s AD.

[[File:Assyria Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Assyrian populated areas]]
Centuries of constant warfare between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]] left both empires exhausted, depleted and battle-fatigued, allowing the [[Muslim]] [[Arab people|Arabs]] to break from the [[Arabian peninsula]] and invade territories hitherto held by these empires. After the [[early Islamic conquests]] in the seventh century, Assyria was dissolved as an entity, although the native population still regarded the region as Assyria, an appellation which survived until the 19th century. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of [[Arabisation]] and [[Islamification]], and the region saw a gradual large influx of ''non indigenous'' Arabs, [[Kurds]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. However, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of northern Mesopotamia resisted this process, retaining their language, religion, culture and identity.

The previously basic civilisation of the desert-dwelling Arabs was greatly enhanced and enriched by the influence and knowledge of native Mesopotamian scientists, physicians, mathematicians, theologians, astronomers, architects, agriculturalists, artists and astrologers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phoenicia.org/xtiantranslateforarabs.html|title=Syriac Christians Passed Greek Science to the Arabs|publisher=}}</ref>

Under the Arab Islamic empires, the Christian Assyrians were classed as ''[[dhimmis]]'', a kind of second-class citizens who had certain restrictions imposed upon them but had their reduced rights fully protected and were granted a degree of freedom in some matters. They were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters without a Muslim witness, as Christians they were subject to payment of a special tax ([[jizyah]]), they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim ruled lands, men were banned from marrying Muslim women, but at the same time they were also expected to adhere to the same laws of property, contract and obligation as the Muslim Arabs. They were however also allowed freedom in other matters. Personal matters such as marriage and divorce were governed by the cultural laws of the Assyrians, the internal discipline was ensured by religious leaders who were however answerable to the Muslims, they were allowed the consumption of alcohol, were punished equally for a crime as the Muslims and technically had protection from any aggression.<ref>H.

Although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held on to their ancient [[Mesopotamian religion]] until as late as the 10th or 11th century AD.<ref name="nineveh.com">{{cite web|last=Parpola |first=Simo |title=ASSYRIAN IDENTITY IN ANCIENT TIMES AND TODAY |url=http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf}}</ref><ref>Fuller, 1864, pp. 200–201.</ref>

Assyrian Christians maintained relations with fellow Christians in [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 12th century AD, Assyrian priests interceded on behalf of persecuted Arab Muslims in Georgia.<ref>Ecclesiastical History of Bar Hebraeus (ii 354)</ref>

When the Mongols [[Mongol Empire#Middle East|invaded]] the Near East in the 13th century, they conquered Mesopotamia,<ref>{{harvnb|Woods|1977|pp=49–50}}</ref> after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] to [[Hulagu Khan|Hülegü]]. The [[Shamanist]] Mongols were initially sympathetic to the Assyrians, whose priests had travelled to Mongolia centuries before, and Hülegü appointed an [[Assyrian Christian]] governor to [[Erbil]] ([[Erbil|Arbela]]), and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] was also allowed to build a church there.<ref name=novacek261>{{harvnb|Nováček|Chabr|Filipský|Janiček|2008|p=261}}</ref>

However, as time passed, the Mongol rulers in the Near East converted to [[Islam]], and sustained persecutions of all Christians throughout the [[Ilkhanate]] began in earnest in 1295 under the rule of [[Oïrat]] amir [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nauruz]], which affected the indigenous Assyrian Christians greatly.<ref>Grousset, p. 379</ref> This manifested early on in the reign of the [[Ilkhan]] [[Ghazan]]. During the reign of the Ilkhan [[Öljeitü]] the Assyrian Christian inhabitants of Erbil seized control of the citadel and much of the city in oder to escape the relentless religious persecution. In spring 1310, the Mongol [[Malik|Malek]] (governor) of the region attempted to seize it from them with the help of the [[Kurds]] and Arabs, but was defeated. The Assyrians held out for three months, but the citadel was at last taken after a siege by Ilkhanate troops and Arab, Turkic and Kurdish tribesmen on July 1, 1310, the defenders of the citadel fighting to the last man, and many of the Assyrian inhabitants of the lower town were subsequently massacred.<ref name=sourdel>{{harvnb|Sourdel|2010}}</ref><ref>Grousset, p. 383</ref>

Assyrian people, still retaining [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] infused and influenced [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]] [[Christianity]], remained numerically dominant in the north of Mesopotamia (what had been Assyria) as late as the 14th century AD and the city of [[Assur]] was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the [[Muslim]] Turco-Mongol ruler [[Tamurlane]] conducted a religiously motivated massacre of indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]]. After that, there are no traces of a settlement at Ashur in the archaeological and numismatic record, and from this point the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>

A religious [[schism]] among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries AD, when a large number of hitherto [[Assyrian Church of the East]] Assyrians from the far north of Mesopotamia entered communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after becoming dissatisfied with the [[Abuna]] family's leadership of the Assyrian Church, and after at first failing to gain acceptance within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Rome named this new church ''The Church of Assyria and Mosul'' and its first leader ''Patriarch of the East Assyrians'' in 1553 AD. However, in 1683 AD, Rome altered the name to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. This group of Assyrians eventually drifted back to the Assyrian Church, however a decade or so before they did so another faction within the Assyrian Church entered communion with Rome, and this group eventually became known as [[Chaldean Catholics]] or [[Chaldo-Assyrians]] despite having no ethnic, historical, linguistic, cultural or geographic connections whatsoever to the by now long extinct Chaldean tribe of south east Mesopotamia.

The Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries,<ref>Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. pp. 218–219. ISBN 978-1-60497-583-3.</ref> culminating in the large scale [[Hamidian massacres]] of unarmed men, women and children by [[Muslim]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] in the late 19th century at the hands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its associated (largely [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Arab]]) militias, which further greatly reduced numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey.

[[File:Burning of Assyrians.jpg|thumb|The burning of bodies of Christian Assyrian women]]

The Assyrians suffered a further catastrophic series of events during [[World War I]] in the form of the religiously and ethnically motivated [[Assyrian Genocide]] at the hands of the [[Ottomans]] and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and Arab allies from 1915 to 1918.<ref>Akçam, Taner (2012).

The Assyrian Genocide ran largely in conjunction to the similarly motivated [[Armenian Genocide]] and [[Greek Genocide]].

In reaction against Ottoman cruelty, Assyrians took up arms, and an [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]]. For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories over the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups; then their [[Russia]]n allies left the war following the [[Russian Revolution]], and [[Armenia]]n resistance broke. The Assyrians were left vastly outnumbered and outgunned, cut off, surrounded, and without supplies, forcing those in Asia Minor and Northwest Iran to fight their way, with civilians in tow, to the safety of [[United Kingdom|British]] lines and their fellow Assyrians in northern Iraq. The sizeable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.

The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and Turtanu, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs, Kurds and Turcoman, guard the borders with Iran and Turkey, and protect British military installations.<ref>[[Len Deighton]] (1993), ''[[Blood, Tears and Folly]]''</ref>

After Iraq was granted independence by the British in 1933, the Assyrians suffered the [[Simele Massacre]], where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. The Muslim population was fearful and resentful of the presence of well armed and well trained Assyrian Christian communities within the new state. The massacres of civilians followed a clash between armed Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed [[Iraq Levies|Assyrian Levies]] were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these civilians, and the British government then whitewashed the massacres at the [[League of Nations]].

Despite these betrayals, the Assyrians were allied with the British during [[World War II]], with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]/[[Israel]] and another four serving in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and was involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Habbaniya]] and elsewhere in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join World War II on the side of [[Nazi Germany]]. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1955, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time, after which they were disarmed and disbanded.

A minority of Assyrians have converted to [[Protestantism]] during the 20th century, leaving the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Orthodox church in favour of the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]].

A further persecution of Assyrians took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1940s and early 1950s when thousands of Assyrians settled in Georgia, Armenia and southern Russia were forcibly deported from their homes in the dead of night by [[Stalin]] without warning or reason to [[Central Asia]], with most being relocated to [[Kazakhstan]], where a small minority still remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astanatimes.com/2014/12/assyrian-community-kazakhstan-survived-dark-times-now-focuses-education/|title=Assyrian Community in Kazakhstan Survived Dark Times, Now Focuses on Education|work=The Astana Times|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 was a period of respite for the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria. The regime of Iraqi President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, a number of Assyrians moved south to cities such as [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Nasiriyah]] to enhance their economic prospects, others were well represented in politics, the military, the arts and entertainment, Assyrian towns, villages, farmsteads and Assyrian quarters in major cities flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel and be over-represented in sports such as boxing, football, athletics, wrestling and swimming.

[[File:Assyrian wedding, Mechelen.jpg|thumb|180px|Assyrian wedding, diaspora in Belgium]]

However, in 1963, the [[Ba'ath Party]] took power by force in Iraq, and came to power in Syria the same year. The Baathists, though secular, were [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalists]], and set about attempting to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the many non-Arab peoples of Iraq and Syria, including the Assyrians. Other ''non-Arab'' ethnic groups targeted for forced Arabization included [[Kurds]], [[Armenians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turcomans]], [[Mandeans]], [[Yezidi]], [[Shabaki]], [[Kawliya]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Circassians]], and [[Mhallami]]. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, banning parents giving Assyrian names to their children, banning Assyrian political parties, taking control of Assyrian churches, attempting to create divisions amongst Assyrians on denominational lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox vs Assyrian Protestant), forced relocations of Assyrians from their traditional homelands to major cities, together with an attempt to ''Arabize'' the ancient pre-Arab heritage of Mesopotamian civilisation.

A further schism within the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] led to the founding of a breakaway [[Ancient Church of the East]] in the late 1960s.

In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi regime in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=زوعا|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> and then joined up with the [[Iraqi-Kurdistan Front|IKF]] in early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna in particular was a target of the Ba'ath regime for many years.

The policies of the Baathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose nationalist governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to [[Turkification|Turkify]] the Assyrians by calling them "Semitic Turks" and forcing them to adopt Turkish names and language. In Baathist Syria too, the Assyrian (and Syriac-Aramean) Christians faced pressure to identify as "Arab Christians", while in Iran, Assyrians continued to enjoy full cultural, religious and ethnic rights for a time, until the Islamic Revolution of 1979, where after they suffered by being forcibly subject to strict Islamic Law.

Many persecutions have befallen the Assyrians since, such as the [[Anfal]] campaign and Baathist, Arab, Kurdish, Turkish nationalist and [[Islamist]] persecutions.

In recent years, particularly since 2014, the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria have become the target of unprovoked [[Islamic terrorism]]. As a result, Assyrians have taken up arms, alongside other groups (such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians) in response to unprovoked attacks by [[Al Qaeda]], [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]], [[Nusra Front]], and other [[Wahhabi]] [[terrorist]] [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIS attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the [[Assyrian homeland]]s of northern Iraq and north east Syria, together with cities such as [[Mosul]], [[Kirkuk]] and [[Hasakeh]] which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of a litany of religiously motivated atrocities committed by ISIS terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape of women and girls, torture, forced conversions, [[ethnic cleansing]], robbery, kidnappings, theft of homes, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non Muslims. Assyrians forced from their homes in cities such as Mosul have had their houses and possessions stolen, and given over to ISIS terrorists or Sunni Arabs.<ref name="newyorknewsgrio.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorknewsgrio.com/world/117902-isis-destroy-the-oldest-christian-monastery-in-mosul-iraq.html|title=ISIS destroy the oldest Christian monastery in Mosul, Iraq|work=NewyorkNewsgrio.com|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>

[[File:The part time of Assyrian King by F.A. Bridgman.jpg|thumb|The past time of Assyrian King by F.A. Bridgman]]
Assyrian was a dialect of Akkadian language, a member of the eastern branch of the Semitic family and the oldest historically attested of the Semitic languages, which began to appear in written form in the 29th century BC. The first inscriptions in Assyria proper, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period.<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 188</ref>

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and Akkadian-speakers, which included widespread [[bilingualism]].<ref name='Deutscher'/> The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name='Deutscher'/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name='Deutscher'/>

Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods"/> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In the Neo-Assyrian period, the [[Aramaic language]] became increasingly common,<ref name="Roux 1964 308">Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308.</ref> more so than Akkadian—this was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings,<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382">Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 382</ref> in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians, and due to the fact that [[Tiglath-pileser II]] made it the [[lingua franca]] of Assyria and its empire in the 8th century BC.

The ancient Assyrians also used the Sumerian in their literature and liturgy,<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/> although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/>

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used distinct Akkadian influenced [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic varieties]] and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. The [[Syriac language]] also emerged in Assyria during the 5th century BC, and during the Christian era, [[Syriac literature]] and [[Syriac script]] were to become hugely influential.

However, the descendant Eastern Aramaic dialects from the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal, tribal, family and place names, still survive to this day among [[Assyrian people]] in the regions of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northwest [[Iran]] and northeast [[Syria]] that constituted old Assyria, and are spoken fluently by up to 1,000,000 Assyrians, with a further number having lesser and varying degrees of fluency.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/> These dialects are very different from the now almost extinct [[Western Aramaic]] of the [[Arameans]] in the [[Levant]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Trans-Jordan]], which does not have an Akkadian grammatical structure or loan words.

After 90 years of effort, the [[University of Chicago]] in 2011 completed an Assyrian [[dictionary]], the style of which is more like an [[encyclopedia]] than a dictionary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/science/07dictionary.html|title=After 90 Years, a Dictionary of an Ancient World|date=7 June 2011|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Religion===

{{main|Mesopotamian Religion}}

The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]], with the national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] having pride of place at the head of the Assyrian Emppire. This religion gradually declined in the face of Christianity between the first and tenth centuries.<ref name="nineveh.com"/>

Other major gods within the pantheon were [[Anu]], [[Baal]], [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]], [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Dagon|Dagan]], [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Ninlil]], [[Mullissu]], [[Zababa]] and [[El (deity)|El]].

Native religion was still strongly followed at least until the 4th century, and survived in pockets until at least the 10th century,<ref name="nineveh.com"/> although Assyrians had begun to adopt [[Christianity]] (as well as for a time [[Manicheanism]] and [[gnosticism]]) which, like [[Syriac literature]], had its birthplace in Assyria between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. Assyrians today are exclusively [[Christian]], with most following the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]].

===Architecture===

{{main|Architecture of Mesopotamia}}

Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by Sumero-Akkadian styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour.

The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of [[ziggurat]], with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.

{{main|Art of Mesopotamia}}

[[File:Transport of cedar Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar (8th century BC)]]
Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).

[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2350.jpg|thumbnail|Assyria. Head of winged bull, 9th c. B.C.; Brooklyn Museum Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull [[lamassu]] or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that lamassi were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Although works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.<ref name = "Muſeum">[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&partid=1 Lens], British Museum.</ref>

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers, siege engines etc.

[[Achaemenid Assyria]] (539–330 BC) retained a separate identity, official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under Seleucid rule, however, Aramaic gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the Arab period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the [[Parthian Empire]] and the Romans until coming under the rule of the [[Sasanian Empire]] from 226–651, where it was known as [[Asōristān]].

A number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].

[[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|Classical historiographers]] and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in the ''[[Canon of Kings]]'', beginning with [[Nabonassar]].

Mesopotamian empires such as the [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] and the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] asserted Mesopotamian dominance from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Egypt]], and from [[Cyprus]] and the east [[Mediterranean Sea]] to [[Iran]]. Thus the influence exerted by the Babylonian-Assyrian religion was particularly profound on groups including the [[Hebrews]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Canaan#Canaan in the Bible|Canaanites]], [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicia]] and [[Arabs]], while their astral theology affected the ancient world in general, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and the later [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The impetus to the purification of the older religions to which the [[Hebrews]] for a long time clung in common with their fellows—the various branches of nomadic [[Arameans]] and [[Arabs]]—was largely furnished by the remarkable civilization unfolded in the [[Euphrates]] valley and in many of the traditions, myths and legends embodied in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; traces of direct adaptation from and responses to Babylonia and Assyria may be discerned, while the indirect influences in the domain of the prophetical books, as also in the [[Psalms]] and in the so-called "wisdom literature", are even more noteworthy. Stories in the [[Tanakh]], [[Old Testament]] and [[Quran]] such as the [[Genesis creation narrative]], [[Tower of Babel]], the [[Flood myth]] and the book of [[Esther]], as well as various biblical characters such as [[Noah]], [[Nimrod]], [[Lilith]] and [[Ashurbanipal|Asnapper]] bear clear influence from Assyria and Babylonia.<ref>Julian Jaynes (2000). The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Mariner Books. Retrieved 2013-06-16</ref><ref>Georges Contenau La Magie chez les Assyriens et les Babyloniens, Paris, 1947</ref><ref>Harris, Stephen L. (2002). Understanding the Bible. McGraw-Hill. pp. 50–51.ISBN 978-0-7674-2916-0</ref>

Even when we reach the [[New Testament]] period, we have not passed entirely beyond the sphere of Babylonian-Assyrian influences. In such a movement as early Christian [[gnosticism]], Assyrio-Babylonian elements—modified, to be sure, and transformed—are largely present, while the growth of an apocalyptic literature is ascribed with apparent justice by many scholars to the recrudescence of views, the ultimate source of which is to be found in the astral-theology of the Babylonian and Assyrian Priests.

The Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct [[Eastern Christianity]], with its accompanying [[Syriac literature]], between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD; however, [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] was still alive and well into the fourth century and pockets survived into the 10th century and possibly as late as the 17th century in [[Mardin]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} However, the religion is now dead, and the Assyrian people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.

The [[Assyriology#History of the field|modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of the [[cuneiform script]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological rediscovery of ancient Assyria, [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people]], who have come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.
