The '''All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship''', the premier competition in [[hurling]], is an annual series of games played in Ireland during the summer and early autumn, and organised by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA). Contested by the top inter-county hurling teams in Ireland, the tournament has taken place every year since 1887&mdash;except in 1888, when the competition was not played due to a tour of the United States by would-be competitors.

The final, usually held on the first Sunday of September, serves as the culmination of a series of games played during the summer months, and the results determine which county's team receives the [[Liam McCarthy Cup]]. Where five Sundays occur in September (as in 2012 and 2013), the final is held on the second Sunday in September. The Championship was initially a straight knockout competition open only to the champions of each of the four provinces of Ireland. During the 1990s the competition was expanded, firstly incorporating a "back-door system" and later a round-robin group phase involving more games. The Championship currently consists of several stages. In the present format, it begins in late May with provincial championships held in [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship|Leinster]] and [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship|Munster]]. Once a team is defeated in the provincial stage they are granted one more chance to compete for the title. The Munster and Leinster champions gain automatic admission to the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship semi-finals, where they are joined by the two winners of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship qualifiers via two lone quarter-finals.

Thirteen teams currently participate in the Championship, the most dominant teams coming from the provinces of Leinster and Munster. [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]], [[Cork GAA|Cork]] and [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] are considered "the big three" of hurling. Between them, these teams have won 90 out of 126 (approx 72%) championships completed during its history. The title has been won by 13 different teams, 10 of which have won the title more than once. The all-time record-holders are Kilkenny, who have won the competition 36 times.

The All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final was listed in second place by [[CNN]] in its "10 sporting events you have to see live", after the [[Olympic Games]] and ahead of both the [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Shawn|last=Donnelly|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/play/outdoor-adventures/10-sporting-events-you-have-see-live-281805|title=10 sporting events you have to see live: Because the real glory of athletic competition is being able to say, "I was there!"|work=CNN|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref> After covering the [[1959 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]] between [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] and [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] for [[BBC Television]], English commentator [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]] was moved to describe hurling as his second favourite sport in the world after his first love, soccer.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kenneth|last=Wolstenholme|authorlink=Kenneth Wolstenholme|url=http://daltonr.wordpress.com/2007/02/08/52/|title=Why Keep This Great Game Such A Big Secret?|newspaper=Sunday Press|date=13 September 1959|accessdate=8 February 2007}}</ref> The current All-Ireland champions are Kilkenny.

==History==
{{Main|History of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship}}
Following the foundation of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] on November 1, 1884, one of the association's early aims was the promotion of a national competition that involved the [[Gaelic games]] of [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]]. At the third meeting of the new organisation in January 1885, new rules for the ancient game of [[hurling]] were drawn up and were soon published in local newspapers throughout the country. In 1886 county boards were created to run the affairs of the various [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] that participated in the competition. By 1887 the first All-Ireland Hurling Championship took place with five teams participating.

For the first few years of the championship the various counties were represented by the team who won the county club championship. For instance, the 1887 championship saw [[Thurles]] representing Tipperary and [[Meelick, County Galway|Meelick]] representing Galway. Dedicated inter-county teams were only introduced in 1895 when Cork put forward a mixture of all the best players from that county's best local clubs. Over the early years various changes were made in the rules of hurling, and its sister sport, [[Gaelic football]]. Teams were reduced from 21 players to 17 and eventually to the current number of 15, and the rules regarding the value of a goal were also tweaked in the first few years of the competition.

The provincial championships were introduced in 1888 in [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship|Munster]], [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship|Leinster]], [[Connacht Senior Hurling Championship|Connacht]] and [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship|Ulster]] on a knock-out basis. The winners of the provincial finals participated in the All-Ireland semi-finals. Over time the Leinster and Munster teams grew to become the superpowers of the game, as [[Gaelic football]] was the more dominant sport in Ulster and Connacht. After some time [[Galway GAA|Galway]] became the only credible team in Connacht and was essentially given an automatic pass to the All-Ireland semi-final every year. This knock-out system persisted for over 100 years and was considered to be the fairest system as the All-Ireland champions would always be the only undefeated team of the year.

In the mid-1990s the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] looked at developing a new system whereby a defeat in the championship for certain teams would not mean an immediate exit from the Championship. In the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 1997|1997 championship]] the first major change in format arrived when the 'back-door system' was introduced. This new structure allowed the defeated Munster and Leinster finalists another chance to regain a place in the All-Ireland semi-finals. [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] and [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] were the first two teams to benefit from the new system when they defeated [[Down GAA|Down]] and Galway respectively in the quarter-finals. The All-Ireland final in the first year of this new experiment was a replay of the Munster final with [[Clare GAA|Clare]] defeating Tipperary. The first team to win the All-Ireland through the 'back-door' was Offaly in 1998, winning a replay of the Leinster final by beating Kilkenny 2-16 to 1-13.

The new 'back-door system' proved successful and was expanded over the following years. The [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 2005|2005 Championship]] saw even bigger changes in the 'back-door' or qualifier system. Now the Munster and Leinster champions and defeated finalists automatically qualified for the new quarter-final stages. While two groups of four other teams played in a league format to fill the vacant four places in the quarter-finals. Many criticised the structure for not being a real championship at all, for degrading the Munster and Leinster championships and for penalising the strongest teams.

In 2008 the current championship structure was adopted, whereby the winners of the Leinster and Munster championships advanced to the All Ireland semi finals, and the 2 losers of the provincial finals advance to 2 quarter finals. A series of knockout qualifiers for the remaining teams decides what other 2 teams reach the quarter finals. The new qualifier structure, has provided more games and has given hope to the 'weaker' teams, as a defeat in the first round no longer means the end of a county's All-Ireland ambitions.

==Notable events==
*At the third meeting of the newly founded [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] in 1885 new rules for the game of hurling are drawn up and published in national newspapers.
*The first All-Ireland Hurling Championship takes place in 1887 with only five teams participating.

In the actual 1924 final he played on the victorious [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] team.
*The All-Ireland Final of 1931 between [[Cork GAA|Cork]] and [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] had to be played no less than three times before a team emerged as the winner.
*The 1939 All-Ireland Final is remembered as the "thunder and lightning" final. On the eve of the outbreak of [[World War II]] [[Cork GAA|Cork]] and [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] played the first half of the game at a frantic pace. The climax of the final was played in a ferocious storm with victory eventually going to [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]].

[[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] looked set to win their first All-Ireland title since 1973 until [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] stage one of the greatest comebacks of all time, scoring two goals and most of their points in the last few minutes.
*The Championship of 1997 sees the introduction of the so-called "back-door" system where the beaten [[Munster]] and [[Leinster]] finalists are allowed back to contest the All-Ireland series.
*In the All-Ireland Semi-Final replay of 1998 between [[Clare GAA|Clare]] and [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]], referee Jimmy Cooney blows the whistle two minutes early. Offaly's players and supporters launch a sit-down protest on the pitch due to the fact that they were losing when the whistle was blown early. An extra replay was forced, which Offaly won.
*The All-Ireland Final on September 11, 2005 was the first to be played at the fully refurbished [[Croke Park]]. The Cusack Stand, the Canal Stand, the Hogan Stand and the new Hill 16 and Nally End all have a combined capacity of 82,300.
*In 2009 [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] equal [[Cork GAA|Cork]]`s historic achievement by winning their fourth All-Ireland title in a row.

[[Eddie Keher]] of the [[Rower-Inistioge GAA|Rower-Inistioge]] holds numerous championship scoring records. In 50 championship appearances between 1959 and 1977 he scored 35 goals and 334 points. Not only that but Keher also set and broke a number of individual records. In the 1963 All-Ireland final he scored 14 points, a verifiable record for a final up to that point. In 1971 Keher broke his own record when he captured 2 goals and 11 points in the All-Ireland final against [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]]. What is more remarkable is the fact that he ended up on the losing side on that occasion. This record was broken by [[Nicky English]] in 1989 when he scored 2 goals and 12 points in a 70-minute All-Ireland final. Keher's tally of 6 goals and 45 points in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 1972|1972 championship]] is also a record.

[[Nicky Rackard]] of [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] got the highest confirmed total in a major championship game. In Wexford's 12-17 to 2-3 defeat of [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in the 1954 All-Ireland semi-final he scored a remarkable 7 goals and 7 points. His tally of 6 goals and 4 points against [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] is also a scoring record. Rackard also scored 5 goals and 4 points against [[Galway GAA|Galway]] in the 1956 All-Ireland semi-final.

Prior to the 1930s scoring records for championship games were rarely kept. A number of players have been credited with enormous tallies. [[Andy 'Dooric' Buckley]] scored at least 6 goals when [[Cork GAA|Cork]] beat Kilkenny by 8-9 to 0-8 in the 1903 All-Ireland 'home' final. Other newspaper reports credit him with 7 goals and 4 points.

[[P. J. Riordan]] is alleged{{By whom|date=January 2010}} to have scored all but 1 point of [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]]'s total when they beat [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] by 6-8 to 0-1 in the 1895 All-Ireland final.

[[Jimmy Kelly (hurler)|Jimmy Kelly]] of Kilkenny is said{{By whom|date=January 2010}} to have scored 7 goals in 30 minutes against Cork in the replay of the 1905 final.

In 1990 the rule prohibiting a hand-passed score was introduced. This had a large bearing on the scoring records above with less goals being scored in open play following its introduction. In the 1990 Congress the score rule was changed to read:
"''A Goal is scored when the ball is played by either team between the goalposts and under the crossbar. A point is scored when the ball is played by either team between the uprights and over the crossbar. The ball shall not be thrown or carried over the goal-line by an attacking player.
''In Hurling a score may not be made by an attacking player in possession fisting or handpassing the ball but a score may be made by a player stricking the ball in flight with the fist or open hand.''''"
