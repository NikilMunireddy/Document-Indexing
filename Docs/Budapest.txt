"Budapest" is the combination of the city names [[Buda]] and [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], which were (together with [[Óbuda]]) [[Merger (politics)|united into a single city]] in 1873.<ref>{{cite book| editor1-first=Peter| editor1-last=Meusburger| editor2-first=Heike| editor2-last=Jöns| title=Transformations in Hungary: Essays in Economy and Society| publisher=Springer Verlag| year=2001| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXodLH8brNQC&pg=PA291 | isbn=3-7908-1412-1| accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> One of the first documented occurrences of the combined name "Buda-Pest" was in 1831 in the book "Világ" ("World" / "Light"), written by Count [[István Széchenyi]].<ref>[http://bparchiv.hu/magyar/kiadvany/bpn/02/bacskai.html Bácskai Vera: Széchenyi tervei Pest-Buda felemelésére és szépítésére] {{wayback|url=http://bparchiv.hu/magyar/kiadvany/bpn/02/bacskai.html |date=20090615094722 |df=y }}</ref>

The origins of the names ''Buda'' and ''Pest'' are obscure. According to chronicles from the Middle Ages, the name ''Buda'' comes from the name of its founder, [[Bleda]] (Buda), brother of the Hunnic ruler [[Attila]]. The theory that "Buda" was named after a person is also supported by modern scholars.<ref>{{cite book| last=Kiss| first=Lajos| title=Földrajzi nevek etimológiai szótára| trans_title=Etymological Dictionary of Geographic Names| location=Budapest| publisher=Akadémiai| year=1978| pages=131–132}}</ref> An alternative explanation suggests that ''Buda'' derives from the Slavic word вода, ''voda'' ("water"), a translation of the Latin name [[Aquincum]], which was the main Roman settlement in the region.<ref>{{cite book| last=Györffy| first=György| title=Pest-Buda kialakulása: Budapest története a honfoglalástól az Árpád-kor végi székvárossá alakulásig| trans_title=The Development of Pest and Buda: History of Budapest from the Great Migration until the End of the Árpád Dynasty| location=Budapest| publisher=Akadémiai| year=1997| page=242| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pest_Buda_kialakul%c3%a1sa.html?id=uDUyAAAAMAAJ| isbn=978-963-05-7338-2| accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - BVJA.png|left|thumb|400px|[[Buda]] during the [[Middle Ages]], woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] (1493)]]

The first settlement on the territory of Budapest was built by [[Celts]]<ref name=Aqua /> before 1&nbsp;AD. It was later occupied by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Roman settlement – Aquincum – became the main city of [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia Inferior]] in 106&nbsp;AD.<ref name=Aqua />  At first it was a military settlement, and gradually the city rose around it, making it the focal point of the city's commercial life. Today this area corresponds to the Óbuda district within Budapest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovelybudapest.com/en/about-budapest/budapest-attractions.html |title=Association of professional tour guides |publisher=Lovely Budapest |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> The Romans constructed roads, [[amphitheater]]s, [[Public bathing|baths]] and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp.<ref name=Frank>{{cite book |last=Sugar |first=Peter F. |title=A History of Hungary |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SKwmGQCT0MAC&pg=PR9&dq=The+Romans+roads,+amphitheaters+Aquincum+%C3%93buda |accessdate=3 June 2008 |year=1990 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn= 978-0-253-20867-5 |page=5 |chapter=Hungary before the Hungarian Conquest}}</ref> The Roman city of Aquincum is the best-conserved of the Roman sites in [[Hungary]].

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] pillaged Buda in 1526, besieged it in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/400|title=Budapest, including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|date=|work=unesco.org|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref> The [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] lasted for more than 140 years.<ref name=Encarta /> The [[Turkish people|Turks]] constructed many fine bathing facilities within the city.<ref name=Travel /> Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their occupation period are still in use 500 years later ([[Rudas Baths]] and [[Király Baths]]).

Sugar page 88" /> The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the [[Habsburg Empire]] as [[Royal Hungary]].

In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful [[siege of Buda (1684)|siege of Buda]], a renewed campaign was started to enter the Hungarian capital. This time, the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]]'s army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including [[Holy Roman Empire|German]], [[Croat]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], Hungarian, [[England|English]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Czechs|Czech]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[French people|French]], [[Burgundians|Burgundian]], [[Danes|Danish]] and [[Swedes|Swedish]] soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers. The Christian forces reconquered Buda, and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near [[Timișoara]] (Temesvár), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] these territorial changes were officially recognised, and in 1718 the entire [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was removed from Ottoman rule.

=== Contemporary history after Unification ===
{{See also|Hungary during World War II}}

The 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence<ref name=Encarta /> and modernisation. The national insurrection against the [[Habsburgs]] began in the Hungarian capital [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|in 1848]] and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Reconciliation]] that brought about the birth of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the [[history of Budapest]], lasting until [[World War I]]. In 1849 the [[Chain Bridge (Budapest)|Chain Bridge]] linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube<ref>{{cite book| last=Hughes| first=Holly| title=Frommer's 500 Places to Take Your Kids Before They Grow Up| publisher=Wiley Indianapolis Composition Services| chapter=7 Famous Briges| isbn= 0-470-57760-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wd0znOQhqOwC&pg=PA91&dq=chain+bridge+budapest#v=onepage&q=chain%20bridge%20budapest&f=false| date=13 August 2009}}</ref> and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Ancient Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic [[Hungarians]] overtook [[Germans]] in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural [[Transdanubia]] and [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%.<ref>Budapest statisztikai évkönyve 1943 (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1943), p. 33, Hungarian Central Statistical Office</ref><ref>''Budapest székes főváros Statisztikai és Közigazgatási Évkönyve 1921–1924'' (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1921–1924), p. 38, Hungarian Central Statistical Office</ref><ref name="Budapest 1946 p. 12">Budapest statisztikai évkönyve 1944–1946 (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1944–1946), p. 12, Hungarian Central Statistical Office</ref> Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the "Jewish Mecca"<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica 1911, Budapest article</ref> or "Judapest".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judapest.org/faq/ |title=History of the word (Jewish-Hungarian Cultural Site) |language=Hungarian |publisher=Judapest.org |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531202859/http://www.judapest.org:80/faq/ |archivedate=31 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jüdische Nachrichten |url=http://buecher.hagalil.com/mandelbaum/budapest.htm |title=Karl Pfeifer: Jüdisches Budapest (Jewish Budapest) |language=German |publisher=Buecher.hagalil.com |date=28 November 2004 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>
In 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic ([[Republic of Hungary]]). In 1920 the [[Treaty of Trianon]] partitioned the country, and as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.<ref name="Macartney37">{{cite book| last=Macartney| first =C.A.| title=Hungary and her successors – The Treaty of Trianon and Its Consequences 1919–1937| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1937}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=East on the Danube: Hungary's Tragic Century |work=[[The New York Times]]| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3D91531F93AA3575BC0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|date=9 August 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2008 |first=Richard |last=Bernstein}}</ref>

In 1944, about one year before the end of [[World War II]], Budapest was partly destroyed by [[Royal Air Force|British]] and [[United States Army Air Forces|American]] air raids (first attack 4 April 1944,<ref>{{cite news| work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]| url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/17889740| title=RAF raids Budapest – second heavy attack| date=5 April 1944}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/47691625| title=RAF Follows US Raid on Budapest| date=5 April 1944| work=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/11807143| title=Budapest bombed by RAF| date=5 April 1944| work=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>).
From 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the [[Battle of Budapest]]. Budapest suffered major damage caused by the attacking [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Romania]]n troops and the defending [[Wehrmacht|German]] and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians lost their lives during the conflict. [[List of crossings of the Danube#Hungary|All bridges]] were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Between 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 [[Jew]]ish inhabitants died through [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Arrow Cross Party]], during the [[Operation Panzerfaust|Germany occupation of Hungary]], from 1944 to early 1945.<ref>{{cite web| title=Budapest| publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|   url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005264| accessdate=18 July 2007}}</ref> <!-- links to relevant materials in the ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'' on the site of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. -->

Swiss diplomat [[Carl Lutz]]  rescued tens of thousands of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] managed to save the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wallenberg.html| title=Raoul Wallenberg| publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]| accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom. Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg and one for Carl Lutz in Budapest.

Following the liberation of Hungary from [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[Red Army]], [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|Soviet military occupation]] ensued, which ended only in 1991. The Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs. In 1949, Hungary was declared a [[Communism|communist]] People's Republic ([[People's Republic of Hungary]]). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the [[Buda Castle]] symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see [[Stalin era]]).
On 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic reform. The demonstrators went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered troops to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. This initiated the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. The demonstrators demanded to appoint [[Imre Nagy]] to be [[Prime Minister of Hungary]]. To their surprise, the central committee of the "[[Hungarian Working People's Party]]" did so that same evening. This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared that Hungary was to leave the [[Warsaw Pact]] and become neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]]. Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

From the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as "[[Goulash Communism|the happiest barrack]]" within the [[Eastern bloc]], and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on [[Erzsébet Bridge]], the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, [[Budapest Metro]]'s East-West [[Line 2 (Budapest Metro)|M2 line]] was first opened, followed by the [[Line 3 (Budapest Metro)|M3 line]] in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]]. [[Andrássy Avenue]] (including the [[Millennium Underground Railway]], [[Hősök tere]], and [[Városliget]]) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s, the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in [[Pest county]], i.e., suburbanisation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989–90 ([[Fall of the Iron Curtain]]) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were removed from public places, into [[Memento Park]]. In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by its mayor, [[Gábor Demszky]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Budapest, strategically placed at the centre of the [[Carpathian Basin]], lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the [[Great Plain]].  By road it is {{convert|216|km}} south-east of [[Vienna]], {{convert|545|km}} south of [[Warsaw]], {{convert|1565|km}} south-west of [[Moscow]], {{convert|1122|km}} north of [[Athens]], {{convert|788|km}} north-east of [[Milan]], and {{convert|443|km}} south-east of [[Prague]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Budapest| url=https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Budapest/@47.4812134,19.1303031,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4741c334d1d4cfc9:0x400c4290c1e1160| publisher=Google Maps| accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref>

The {{convert|525|sqkm|sqmi}} area of Budapest lies in [[Central Hungary]], surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends {{convert|25|and|29|km|0|abbr=on}} in the north-south, east-west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, [[Óbuda Island]] and [[Margaret Island]].<ref name=Encarta /> The third island [[Csepel Island]] is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is {{convert|230|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly.<ref name=Encarta />

The wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river’s opposite bank.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83080/Budapest#toc59294| title=Budapest| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica| date=21 November 2013| first=Laszlo| last=Péter| accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref>  Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably [[Gellért Hill]] and Castle Hill.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created [[speleothem]]s, the most famous ones being the Pálvölgyi cave (total length 7200&nbsp;m) and the Szemlőhegyi cave (total length 2200&nbsp;m). The hills were formed in the Triassic Period. The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is János hill, at {{convert|527|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is {{convert|96|m}} Above mean sea level|above sea level.  Budapest is also rich in green areas. Of the {{convert|525|sqkm|sqmi}} occupied by the city, {{convert|83|sqkm|sqmi}} is green area, [[park]] and [[forest]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.budapest-tourist.info/en/geography.php| title=Geography of Budapest| publisher=Budapest Tourist Info| accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> The forests of [[Buda hills]] are environmentally protected.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Budapest is the only capital city in the world which has [[Hot spring|thermal springs]]. Some 125 springs produce 70 million litres of thermal water a day, with temperatures ranging up to 58 Celsius. Some of these waters have medicinal effects due to their medically valuable mineral contents.<ref name="budapest.com" />

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Budapest}}

Budapest has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') using the {{convert|-3|°C|1}} isotherm of the original Köppen scheme, or a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), using the {{convert|0|°C|0}} isotherm preferred by some climatologists, with relatively cold winters and warm summers.<ref name="Peel, M.

C.| last2=Finlayson| first2=B. L.| last3=McMahon| first3=T. A. |publisher=The University of Melbourne |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>
Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of {{convert|-10|C|F|}} are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. Budapest's long summer – lasting from May until mid-September – is warm or very warm. Budapest has as much summer sunshine as many Mediterranean resorts. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. The autumn in Budapest (mid-September until late October) is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October.

Budapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in Óbuda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern [[Palace of Arts (Budapest)|Palace of Arts]], the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.<ref name="Budapest Architecture">{{cite web |url=http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-architecture/ |title=Budapest Architecture |publisher=visitbudapest.travel |year=2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbase.com/helenpb/the_incredible_architecture_of_budapest |title=The Incredible Architecture of Budapest|publisher=pbase.com |year=2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budapest.com/city_guide/attractions/exceptional_buildings.en.html|title= Exceptional Buildings Budapest|publisher=budapest.com |year=2014 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>

Most buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than {{convert|45|m}}. The number of [[high-rise]] buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the [[World Heritage Site]]. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the [[inner city]] does not have any. But Budapest is planning to ease rules for the construction of [[skyscraper]]s and in the near future would like to build skyscrapers around the city's historic core.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prestigecity.hu/towers/en/lakasok/magas |title=The high-rise buildings as emblematique element of luxury district, 13th District of Budapest |publisher=Prestigecity |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euscreen.eu/play.jsp?id=EUS_D1935399A8EF4E8891F15BA4C0800C86 |title=The coming of skyscrapers?|publisher=euscreen.eu |date=17 December 2006 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>

In the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest represents on the entire timeline. Start with the Roman City of Aquincum represents the [[History of architecture|ancient architecture]].

[[File:Matthias Church Budapest Corrected.jpg|thumb|left|[[Matthias Church]] in Budapest, built in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Gothic revival style]]]]

The next determinative style is the [[Gothic architecture]] in Budapest. The few remaining ones can be found in the Castle District. Buildings to look for are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Another building with Gothic remains is the Inner City Parish Church in Pest, built in the 12th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visitbudapest.travel/local-secrets/inner-city-parish-church/ |title=The oldest church in Pest |publisher=visitbudapest.travel |year=2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]], like the most well-known Budapest [[landmark]]s, the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] and the [[Matthias Church]], where much of the original material was used (originally built in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] in 1015).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The next chapter of the human architecture is the [[Renaissance architecture]] and one of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary and Budapest. The style appeared following the marriage of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous [[Hungarian State Opera House]], the [[St. Stephen's Basilica]] and the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

During the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of [[Ottoman architecture]], which was influenced by Iranian, and to a larger extent, [[Byzantine architecture]] as well as Islamic traditions. Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original [[Turkish bath]]houses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or [[Király Baths]]. Another little known fact is that Budapest is home to the northernmost holy place of [[Islam]], the [[Tomb of Gül Baba]], tomb of a [[Turkey|Turkish]] dervish. After 1686, the [[Baroque architecture]] designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[File:University Church (Egyetemi templom), Budapest.jpg|thumb|right|University Church (Egyetemi templom), a well-preserved example of [[Baroque architecture]] in Budapest]]

There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of original Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in [[Batthyány tér|Batthyhány square]]. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful historic buildings with original Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[Classical architecture]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]] are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two [[architect]]s that were masters of the Classicist style. [[Mihály Pollack]] (1773–1855) and [[József Hild]] (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the [[Hungarian National Museum]], the [[Lutheran Church of Budavár]] (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the [[List of heads of state of Hungary|Hungarian president]], the [[Sándor Palace, Budapest|Sándor Palace]]. The most iconic Classicist-style attraction in Budapest, the most widely known Chain Bridge. A bit of maverick in architectural styles the Romanticism. Budapest's two most beautiful [[Gothic Revival architecture#Romanticism and nationalism|Romantic architecture]] buildings are the [[Dohány Street Synagogue|Great Synagogue]] in Dohány Street and the [[Vigadó Concert Hall]] on the [[Danube Promenade]], both designed by architect [[Frigyes Feszl]] (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the [[Budapest-Nyugati Railway Terminal|Budapest Western Railway Station]], which was designed by August de Serres and built by the [[Eiffel (company)|Eiffel Company]] of [[Paris]] in 1877.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Art Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian [[Millennium]] celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boedapestrondleiding.com/text/rondleidingen/artnouveaurondleiding_en.php#.U2e1EPl_vz5 |title=Budapest Tour: Early Art Nouveau 1897–1904 |publisher=budapestarchitect.com |year=2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529120059/http://www.boedapestrondleiding.com:80/text/rondleidingen/artnouveaurondleiding_en.php |archivedate=29 May 2014 }}</ref> Art Nouveau in Hungary (''Szecesszió'' in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary's specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, [[Ödön Lechner]] (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]]. Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the [[Gresham Palace]] in front of the Chain Bridge, the [[Hotel Gellért]], the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] or [[Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden]].<ref name="Budapest Architecture" />

In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving Budapest's unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, is force Budapest to balance between them. The [[Contemporary architecture]] has wide margin in the city. [[Public space]]s attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central [[Kossuth Lajos tér, Budapest|Kossuth Lajos square]], [[Deák Ferenc tér|Deák Ferenc square]] and [[Liberty Square (Budapest)|Liberty Square]]. Budapest's current urban landscape is one of the modern and contemporary architecture. Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in Budapest, like the [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National Theatre]], Palace of Arts, [[Rákóczi Bridge]], [[Megyeri Bridge]], [[Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport#Sky Court between Terminal 2A and 2B|Budapest Airport Sky Court]] among others, and millions of square meters of new [[office buildings]] and [[residential area|apartments]]. But there are still large opportunities in [[real estate development]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joneslanglasalle.eu/ResearchLevel1/Budapest%20high%20streets%20_%20electronic%20version.pdf |title=Budapest High Street Overview 2013 |publisher=[[Jones Lang LaSalle]] |date=October 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com/en_gx/gx/asset-management/emerging-trends-real-estate/assets/pwc-emerging-trends-in-real-estate-2013-europe.pdf |title=Emerging Trends in Real Estate, 2013 Europe |publisher=[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] |year=2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbre.hu/hu_en/news_events/news_detail?p_id=16464 |title=Bulls return to the European commercial real estate market (Budapest)|publisher=[[CBRE Group]] |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>

Most of today's Budapest is the result of a late-nineteenth-century renovation, but the wide [[boulevard]]s lain then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of Budapest's city evolution.
Budapest's vast [[urban area]] is often described using a set of district names. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units of former boroughs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/budapest/729051#sthash.WyAc5THZ.dpbs |publisher=Frommer's Budapest| title=Neighborhoods in Brief |year=2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>
Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budapestbydistrict.com/ |publisher=budapestbydistrict.com |title=Budapest district by district |year=2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506005516/http://www.budapestbydistrict.com/ |archivedate=6 May 2014 }}</ref>
Originally Budapest had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in 1873. Since 1950, [[Greater Budapest]] has been divided into 22 [[borough]]s (and 23 since 1994). At that time there were changes both in the order of districts and in their sizes. The city now consists of 23 districts, 6 in Buda, 16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them.
The city centre itself in a broader sense comprises the District '''V, VI, VII, VIII, IX'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urbandivercities.eu/budapest/ |title=Urbandivercities.eu, Case study Budapest and Budapest's 8th district |year=2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> and '''XIII''' on the Pest side,<ref>{{citation |url=http://geogr.elte.hu/TGF/TGF_Doktorik/eberenyitezisangol.pdf |first=Eszter B.| last=Berényi| location=Budapest| title=The transformation of historical city districts in inner city of Budapest (PhD dissertation) |format=PDF |year=2010 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>  and the '''I, II, XI''' and '''XII''' on the Buda side of the city.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

District I is a small area in central Buda, including the historic Buda Castle. District II is in Buda again, in the northwest, and District III stretches along in the northernmost part of Buda. To reach District IV, one must cross the Danube to find it in Pest (the eastern side), also at north. With District V, another circle begins, it is located in the absolute centre of Pest. Districts VI, VII, VIII and IX are the neighbouring areas to the east, going southwards, one after the other.
District X is another, more external circle also in Pest, while one must jump to the Buda side again to find Districts XI and XII, going northwards. No more districts remaining in Buda in this circle, we must turn our steps to Pest again to find Districts XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX (mostly external city parts), almost regularly in a semicircle, going southwards again.
District XXI is the extension of the above route over a branch of the Danube, the northern tip of a [[Csepel-sziget|long island]] south from Budapest. District XXII is still on the same route in southwest Buda, and finally District XXIII is again in southernmost Pest, irregular only because it was part of District XX until 1994.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

As the capital of Hungary, Budapest is the seat of the country's [[Central government|national government]]. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of Hungary resides at the Sándor Palace in the District I (Buda Castle District),<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.keh.hu/about_the_institution_of_the_president_of_the_republic/1586-About_the_institution_of_the_President_of_the_Republic| title=About the institution of the President of Hungary| publisher=Office of the President of the Republic| accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref> while the office of the Hungarian Prime Minister is in the Hungarian Parliament. [[Ministry (government department)|Government ministries]] are all located in various parts of the city, most of them are in the District V, [[Inner City (Budapest)|Leopoldtown]]. The [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] is seated in the Hungarian Parliament, which also located in the District V.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.parlament.hu/fotitkar/angol/general_info.htm| title=The Hungarian National Assembly| year=2014| publisher=Office of the National Assembly| accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref> The [[List of Speakers of the National Assembly of Hungary|President of the National Assembly]], the third-highest public official in Hungary, is also seated in the largest building in the country, in the Hungarian Parliament.

Hungary's highest [[court]]s are located in Budapest. The Curia ([[supreme court]] of Hungary), the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the District V, Leopoldtown. Under the authority of its President it has three departments: criminal, civil and administrative-labour law departments. Each department has various chambers. The Curia guarantees the uniform application of [[law]]. The decisions of the Curia on uniform [[jurisdiction]] are binding for other courts.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.birosag.hu/en/curia-hungary| title=Curia of Hungary| publisher=National Office for the Judiciary| accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>
The second most important judicial authority, the National Judicial Council, is also housed in the District V, with the tasks of controlling the financial management of the judicial administration and the courts and giving an opinion on the practice of the president of the National Office for the Judiciary and the Curia deciding about the applications of judges and court leaders, among others.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://birosag.hu/en/njc/front-page| title=The National Judicial Council| date=23 March 2012| publisher=National Judicial Council| accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>
The [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]] is one of the highest level actors independent of the politics in the country. The Constitutional Court serves as the main body for the protection of the [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]], its tasks being the review of the constitutionality of statutes. The Constitutional Court performs its tasks independently. With its own budget and its judges being elected by Parliament it does not constitute a part of the ordinary judicial system. The constitutional court passes on the [[constitutionality]] of laws, and there is no right of [[appeal]] on these decisions.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mkab.hu/constitutional-court/about-the-constitutional-court/history| title=Brief history of the Constitutional Court of Hungary| year=2014| publisher=The Constitutional Court| accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>

Another historical museum is the [[House of Terror]], hosted in the building that was the venue of the [[Nazi Headquarters]]. The Castle Hill, the River Danube embankments and the whole of Andrássy út have been officially recognized as [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].

Castle Hill and the [[Castle District, Buda|Castle District]]; there are three churches here, six museums, and a host of interesting buildings, streets and squares. The former Royal Palace is one of the symbols of Hungary – and has been the scene of battles and wars ever since the 13th century. Nowadays it houses two impressive museums and the [[National Széchenyi Library]]. The nearby Sándor Palace contains the offices and official residence of the [[President of Hungary]]. The seven-hundred-year-old Matthias Church is one of the jewels of Budapest, it is in neo-Gothic style, decorated with coloured shingles and elegant pinnacles. Next to it is an equestrian statue of the first king of Hungary, King Saint Stephen, and behind that is the [[Fisherman's Bastion]], built in 1905 by the architect [[Frigyes Schulek]], the Fishermen's Bastions owes its name to the namesake corporation that during the [[Middle Ages]] was responsible of the defence of this part of ramparts, from where opens out a panoramic view of the whole city.

=== Islands ===

[[File:Girl in the Margit-sziget Garden (5978988972).jpg|thumb|right|Park on [[Margaret Island]]]]

[[File:Dunapartlatkep4.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial panorama with the [[Margaret Island]]]]

Seven islands can be found on the Danube: Shipyard Island, Margaret Island, Csepel Island, Palotai-sziget (now a peninsula), Népsziget, Háros-sziget, and Molnár-sziget.
Notable islands include:
* Margaret Island is a {{convert|2.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long island and {{convert|0.965|km2|acre}} in area. The island mostly consists of a park and is a popular recreational area for tourists and locals alike. The island lies between bridges Margaret Bridge (south) and Árpád Bridge (north). Dance clubs, [[swimming pool]]s, an [[aqua park]], athletic and fitness centres, bicycle and running tracks can be found around the Island. During the day the island is occupied by people doing sports, or just resting. In the summer (generally on the weekends) mostly young people go to the island at night to party on its terraces, or to recreate with a bottle of alcohol on a bench or on the grass (this form of entertainment is sometimes referred to as bench-partying).
* [[Csepel Island]] (Csepel-sziget, {{IPA-hu|ˈtʃɛpɛlsiɡɛt}}) is the largest island of the River Danube in Hungary. It is {{convert|48|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long; its width is {{convert|6|to|8|km|0|abbr=on}} and its area comprises {{convert|257|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, whereas only the northern tip is inside the city limits.
* Hajógyári-sziget ({{IPA-hu|ˈhɒjoːɟaːri siɡɛt|}}, or Óbudai-sziget) is a man-made island located in the third district. This island hosts many activities such as: wake-boarding, jet-skiing during the day, and [[Nightclub|dance clubs]] during the night. This is the island where the famous [[Sziget Festival]] takes place, hosting hundreds of performances per year and now around 400,000 visitors in its last edition. Many building projects are taking place to make this island into one of the biggest entertainment centres of Europe. The plan is to build [[apartment building]]s, hotels, casinos and a marina.
* Luppa-sziget is the smallest island of Budapest and is located in the northern region of the city.
* Rock of Ínség can be found in the river Danube under the Gellért mountain. It can be seen only during a drought period when the river level is very low.

=== Spas ===

[[File:Budapest Széchenyi Baths R02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Széchenyi Medicinal Bath|Széchenyi Thermal Bath]] in [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]]]]

One of the reasons the Romans first colonised the area immediately to the west of the River Danube and established their regional capital at Aquincum (now part of Óbuda, in northern Budapest) is so that they could utilise and enjoy the thermal springs. There are still ruins visible today of the enormous baths that were built during that period. The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541–1686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day. Budapest gained its reputation as a city of [[Spas in Budapest|spas]] in the 1920s, following the first realisation of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 Budapest was officially ranked as a "City of Spas". Today, the baths are mostly frequented by the older generation, as, with the exception of the "Magic Bath" and "Cinetrip" water discos, young people tend to prefer the lidos which are open in the summer.
Construction of the Király Baths started in 1565, and most of the present-day building dates from the Turkish period, including most notably the fine cupola-topped pool.
The Rudas Baths are centrally placed – in the narrow strip of land between Gellért Hill and the River Danube – and also an outstanding example of architecture dating from the Turkish period. The central feature is an octagonal pool over which light shines from a {{convert|10|m|ft}} diameter cupola, supported by eight pillars.
The [[Gellért Baths]] and Hotel were built in 1918, although there had once been Turkish baths on the site, and in the Middle Ages a hospital. In 1927, the Baths were extended to include the wave pool, and the effervescent bath was added in 1934. The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues.
The Lukács Baths are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. There is still something of an atmosphere of fin-de-siècle about the place, and all around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.

The [[Széchenyi Baths]] are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only "old" medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city. The indoor medicinal baths date from 1913 and the outdoor pools from 1927. There is an atmosphere of grandeur about the whole place with the bright, largest pools resembling aspects associated with Roman baths, the smaller bath tubs reminding one of the bathing culture of the Greeks, and the saunas and diving pools borrowed from traditions emanating in northern Europe. The three outdoor pools (one of which is a fun pool) are open all year, including winter. Indoors there are over ten separate pools, and a whole host of medical treatments is also available. The Szécheny Baths are built in modern Renaissance style.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Further|Hungarian cuisine}}

In the modern age, Budapest developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby region, as lamb, pork and vegetables special in the region. Modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with French, Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary can be considered a melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine. Considerable numbers of [[Saxons]], Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the Ottoman era, in the form of sweets (for example different [[nougat]]s, like white nougat called ''törökméz'', [[quince]] (''birsalma''), [[Turkish delight]], [[Turkish coffee]] or rice dishes like [[pilaf]], meat and vegetable dishes like the [[eggplant]], used in [[eggplant salads and appetizers]], stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called ''[[töltött káposzta]]''. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by [[Austrian cuisine]] under the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Germany-to-Japan/Hungary.html| title=Food in Hungary| publisher=foodbycountry.com| accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>

Budapest restaurants reflect diversity, with menus carrying traditional regional cuisine, fusions of various culinary influences, or innovating in the leading edge of new techniques. Budapest' food shops also have a solid reputation for supplying quality specialised culinary products and supplies, reputations that are often built up over generations. These include many shops, such as Café Gerbeaud, one of the greatest and most traditional [[coffeehouse]]s in Europe, or the [[Gundel]] restaurant and gastro shop in the City Park.
Diners can also find the highest quality foods served in several [[List of Michelin starred restaurants#By country|Michelin-starred]] restaurants, like Onyx, Costes, Borkonyha or Tanti.
