'''Riley B. King''', known professionally as '''B.B. King''' (September 16, 1925&nbsp;– May 14, 2015) was an American [[blues]] singer, electric guitarist, songwriter, and record producer.  King introduced a sophisticated style of [[guitar solo|soloing]] based on fluid [[string bending]] and shimmering [[vibrato]] that influenced many later electric blues guitarists.<ref>Komara, Edward M. ''Encyclopedia of the Blues'', Routledge, 2006, p. 385.</ref>

King was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, and is considered one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname "The King of the Blues", and one of the "Three Kings of the Blues Guitar" along with [[Albert King]] and [[Freddie King]].<ref name="hal">{{cite web | url=http://www.halleonard.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=393017| title=Three Kings of Blues| last=Trovato| first=Steve| publisher=[[Hal Leonard]]| accessdate=March 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="gibson">{{cite web | url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/3-kings-of-the-blues-1029-2012.aspx| title=3 Kings of the Blues| last=Leonard| first=Michael| publisher=[[Gibson]]| accessdate=March 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="cbs">{{cite web | url=http://wcbsfm.cbslocal.com/2011/04/25/happy-birthday-to-the-velvet-bulldozer-albert-king/| title=Happy Birthday to "The Velvet Bulldozer" Albert King| date=April 25, 2011| publisher=[[CBS]]|work=[[WCBS FM]]| accessdate=March 12, 2013}}</ref> King was known for performing tirelessly throughout his musical career, appearing at more than 200 concerts per year on average into his 70s.<ref name="halloffame"/> In 1956, he reportedly appeared at 342 shows.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-blues-guitarist-bb-king-dies-20150514-story.html| work=Los Angeles Times| title=Blues Guitarist B.B.

While young, King sang in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church in Kilmichael. King was attracted to the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Church of God in Christ]] because of its music. The local minister led worship with a [[Sears Roebuck]] Silvertone guitar. The minister taught King his first three chords.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/05/15/how-the-church-gave-b-b-king-the-blues/ |title=How the church gave B.B.

In November 1941 "[[King Biscuit Time]]" first aired, broadcasting on [[KFFA (AM)|KFFA]] in [[Helena, Arkansas]]. It was a radio show featuring the Mississippi Delta blues. King listened to it while on break at a plantation. A self-taught guitarist, he then wanted to become a radio musician.<ref name="Defining">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/arts/music/b-b-king-blues-singer-dies-at-89.html?_r=1 | title=B.

In 1943, King left Kilmichael to work as a tractor driver and play guitar with the Famous St. John's Quartet of [[Inverness, Mississippi]], performing at area churches and on [[WGRM (AM)|WGRM]] in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]].<ref name="nvlp3">{{cite web |publisher=National Visionary Leadership Project |title=B.B.

In 1946, King followed Bukka White to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. White took him in for the next ten months.<ref name="jazz"/> However, King returned to Mississippi shortly afterward, where he decided to prepare himself better for the next visit, and returned to [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], two years later in 1948. He performed on [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]]'s radio program on [[KWEM Radio|KWEM]] in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King's appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station [[WDIA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kwemradio.com/BBking.html|publisher=KWEM Radio|title=B.B.

==Career==

===1949–2005===
In 1949, King began recording songs under contract with Los Angeles-based [[RPM Records (USA)|RPM Records]]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [[Sam Phillips]], who later founded [[Sun Records]]. Before his RPM contract, King had debuted on [[Bullet Records]] by issuing the single "Miss Martha King" (1949), which did not chart well. "My very first recordings [in 1949] were for a company out of Nashville called Bullet, the Bullet Record Transcription company," King recalled. "I had horns that very first session. I had [[Phineas Newborn]] on piano; his father played drums, and his brother, [[Calvin Newborn|Calvin]], played guitar with me. I had [[Tuff Green]] on bass, [[Ben Branch]] on tenor sax, his brother, Thomas Branch, on trumpet, and a lady trombone player. The Newborn family were the house band at the famous Plantation Inn in West Memphis."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesaccess.com/No_37/bb_talk.html|title=''Blues Access'' Interview|publisher=|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}</ref>
[[File:B.B. King con Lucille.jpg|thumb|upright|King with his famous guitar, [[Lucille (guitar)|Lucille]]]]
King assembled his own band; the B.B. King Review, under the leadership of Millard Lee. The band initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Lawrence Burdin (alto saxophone), [[George Coleman]] (tenor saxophone),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=1078 |title=George Coleman: This Gentleman can PLAY |publisher=All About Jazz |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref> [[Floyd Newman]] (baritone saxophone), Millard Lee (piano), [[George Joyner]] (bass) and Earl Forest and Ted Curry (drums). Onzie Horne was a trained musician elicited as an arranger to assist King with his compositions. By his own admission, King could not play chords well and always relied on [[improvisation]].<ref>''U2 Rattle and Hum'' DVD, 1988.</ref>

King's recording contract was followed by tours across the United States, with performances in major theaters in cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, and St. Louis, as well as numerous gigs in small clubs and [[juke joint]]s of the southern United States. During one show in [[Twist, Arkansas]], a brawl broke out between two men and caused a fire. He evacuated along with the rest of the crowd but went back to retrieve his guitar. He said he later found out that the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. He named the guitar [[Lucille (guitar)|Lucille]], as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bluesobit: BB King|url=http://xrrf.blogspot.com/2015/05/bluesobit-bb-king.html|website=No Rock And Roll Fun|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldblues.com/bbking/prairie/lucille.html |title=B.B.

Discussing where he took the Blues, from "dirt floor, smoke in the air" joints to grand concert halls, King said the Blues belonged everywhere beautiful music belonged.

==Equipment==
{{for|more information about King's guitar|Lucille (guitar)}}
B.B. King used simple equipment. He played guitars made by various manufacturers early in his career: he played a [[Fender Telecaster]] on most of his recordings with [[RPM Records (USA)]].<ref>Burrows, Terry, ''The Complete Book of the Guitar'', p. 111. Carlton Books Limited, 1998, ISBN 1-85868-529-X</ref> However, he was best known for playing variants of the [[Gibson ES-355]]. In 1980, [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] launched the B.B. King Lucille model. In 2005, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles, referred to as the "80th Birthday Lucille", the first prototype of which was given as a birthday gift to King, and which he used thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |title=One Customer's Pawnshop Treasure |publisher=Guitarcenterblog.com |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100618045219/http://www.guitarcenterblog.com:80/?p=746 |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}</ref>

King used a Lab Series L5 2×12" combo amplifier and had been using this amplifier for a long time. It was made by Norlin Industries for Gibson in the 1970s and 1980s. Other popular L5 users are [[Allan Holdsworth]] and [[Ty Tabor]] of [[King's X]]. The L5 has an onboard compressor, parametric equalization, and four inputs. King also used a Fender Twin Reverb.<ref name=guitargear>{{cite web | author=Category: Who Plays What |url=http://www.uberproaudio.com/who-plays-what/232-bb-kings-guitar-gear-rig-and-equipment |title=B.B.

==Personal life==
King was married twice, to Martha Lee Denton, 1946 to 1952, and to Sue Carol Hall, 1958 to 1966. The failure of both marriages has been attributed to the heavy demands made on the marriage by King's 250 performances a year.<ref name="jazz"/> It is reported that he fathered 15 children with several different women.<ref name="jazz">{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzandbluesmasters.com/bbking.htm |title=BB King: American Blues Musician, b. 1925 |first=Quincy|last= Troupe |publisher=Jazzandbluesmasters.com |date=June 4, 1958 |accessdate=February 17, 2010| quote=...was born on a cotton plantation, in Itta Bene [sic], Mississippi, just outside the delta town of Indianola.}}</ref> He lived with diabetes for over 20&nbsp;years and was a high-profile spokesman in the fight against the disease, appearing in advertisements for diabetes-management products along with ''[[American Idol]]'' season nine contestant [[Crystal Bowersox]].<ref name="farewells"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mjsbigblog.com/crystal-bowersox-and-bb-king-in-new-diabetes-commercial.htm|agency=MJSBIGBLOG|title=Crystal Bowersox and BB King In New Diabetes Campaign| first=MJ| last=Santilli| date=March 15, 2011| accessdate=May 15, 2015}}</ref>

King's favorite singer was [[Frank Sinatra]]. In his autobiography he spoke about how he was a "Sinatra nut" and how he went to bed every night listening to Sinatra's classic album ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]''. During the 1960s Sinatra had arranged for King to play at the main clubs in Las Vegas. He credited Sinatra for opening doors to black entertainers who were not given the chance to play in "white-dominated" venues.<ref>{{cite book |last1=King |first1=B.B. |last2=Ritz |first2=David |author-link2=David Ritz |title=Blues All Around Me |year=2011 |publisher=[[It Books]] |page=266 |isbn=978-0062061034}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
In September 1970, King recorded [[Live in Cook County Jail]], during a time in which issues of race and class in the prison system were prominent in politics.

==Aftermath==

King is famously alleged to have fathered 15 children by 15 different women;<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Blues"/> and after his death, three more have come forward, claiming King as their father as well.<ref name="HR">Johnson, S. Battle Over B.B. King's Fortune. ''The Hollywood Reporter'', June 3, 2016 (No. 17), pp. 61-3.</ref>  Though neither of his marriages produced children, and biographer Charles Sawyer wrote that doctors found his sperm count too low to conceive children,<ref>Sawyer, C. ''The Arrival of B.B. King: The Authorized Biography''. Doubleday (1984), p. 221. ISBN 0385159293</ref> King never disputed paternity of any of the 15 who claimed it, and by all accounts was generous in bankrolling college tuitions and establishing trust funds.<ref name="HR"/>  

In May 2016, the 11 surviving children initiated legal proceedings against King's appointed trustee over his estimated $30 million to $40 million estate.  Several of them also went public with the allegation that King's business manager, LaVerne Toney, and his personal assistant, Myron Johnson, had fatally poisoned him.  When autopsy results showed no evidence of poisoning, the suit was dismissed; a defamation suit filed by Johnson against the accusing family members (including his own sister, Karen Williams) is pending.  Other children have filed lawsuits targeting King's music estate, which remains in dispute.<ref name="HR"/>
