The company was incorporated by [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[royal charter]] in 1670 as '''The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay''' and functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America before European states and later the United States laid claim to some of those territories.<ref name=charter>{{cite web |title=The Royal Charter of the Hudson's Bay Company |website=HBC Heritage |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/collections/archival/charter/charter |access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> It was at one time the largest landowner in the world, with the area of the [[Hudson Bay drainage basin|Hudson Bay watershed]], known as [[Rupert's Land]], having 15% of North American acreage. From its long-time headquarters at [[York Factory]] on [[Hudson Bay]], the company controlled [[North American fur trade|the fur trade]] throughout much of the English and later British controlled North America for several centuries. Undertaking early exploration, its traders and trappers forged early relationships with many groups of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]]. Its network of [[factory (trading post)|trading posts]] formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of [[Western Canada]] and the United States. In the late 19th century, with its signing of the Deed of Surrender, its vast territory became the largest portion of the newly formed Dominion of Canada, in which the company was the largest private landowner.

By the mid-19th century, the company evolved into a mercantile business selling everything from furs to fine homeware. They "quickly introduced a new type of client to the HBC – one that shopped for pleasure and not with skins"; the retail era had begun as the HBC began establishing stores across the country.<ref name="HBC Heritage">{{cite web |title=Our History: Overview |website=HBC Heritage |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/overview |access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref>

==History==

===17th century===
[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a [[Great Britain|British]] trading company.]]

In the 17th century the French had a de facto monopoly on the Canadian [[fur trade]] with their colony of New France. Two [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] traders, [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[Médard des Groseilliers]] (Médard de Chouart, Sieur des Groseilliers), Radisson's brother-in-law, learned from the [[Cree]] that the best fur country lay north and west of [[Lake Superior]] and that there was a "frozen sea" still further north.<ref name="Newman 64">{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Peter C. |author-link=Peter C. Newman |title=Company of Adventurers: Vol I |publisher=Viking |date=1985 |page=64 |isbn=978-0-6708-0379-8 |ref=harv}}</ref> Assuming that this was Hudson Bay, they sought French backing for a plan to set up a trading post on the Bay, to reduce the cost of moving furs overland. According to [[Peter C. Newman]], "concerned that exploration of the Hudson Bay route might shift the focus of the fur trade away from the [[St. Lawrence River]], the French governor", [[Pierre de Voyer d'Argenson, Vicomte de Mouzay|Marquis d'Argenson]] (in office 1658–61), "refused to grant the [[Coureur des bois|coureurs de bois]] permission to scout the distant territory".<ref name="Newman 64"/> Despite this refusal, in 1659 Radisson and Groseilliers set out for the upper Great Lakes basin. A year later they returned from their expedition with premium furs, evidence of the potential of the Hudson Bay region. Subsequently they were arrested for trading without a licence and fined, and their furs were confiscated by the government.<ref name=Radisson>{{cite web |title=Our History: People: Explorers: Radisson and des Groseilliers |website=HBC Heritage |url=http://hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/people/explorers/radisson.asp |access-date=7 October 2015}}</ref>

Determined to establish trade in the Hudson Bay, Radisson and Groseilliers approached a group of business men in Boston, Massachusetts to help finance their explorations. The Bostonians agreed on the plan's merits but their speculative voyage in 1663 failed when their ship ran into [[Sea ice|pack ice]] in [[Hudson Strait]]. Boston-based English commissioner Colonel George Cartwright learned of the expedition and brought the two to England to raise financing.<ref name="Newman 64"/> Radisson and Groseilliers arrived in London in 1665 at the height of the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]]. Eventually, the two met and received the sponsorship of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]]. Prince Rupert also introduced the two to his cousin, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].{{sfn|Newman|1985|page= 65}} In 1668 the English expedition acquired two ships, the ''[[Nonsuch (1650 ship)|Nonsuch]]'' and the ''Eaglet'', to explore possible trade into Hudson Bay. Groseilliers sailed on the ''Nonsuch'', commanded by Captain [[Zachariah Gillam]], while the ''Eaglet'' was commanded by Captain William Stannard and accompanied by Radisson. On 5 June 1668, both ships left port at [[Deptford]], England, but the ''Eaglet'' was forced to turn back off the coast of Ireland.<ref name=Radisson/><ref>{{cite book |last=Rich |first=Edwin Ernest |title=The History of the Hudson's Bay Company, 1670–1870 |volume=Vol. I |date=1958 |publisher=Hudson's Bay Record Society |pages= 36, 38, 42 |ref=harv}}</ref>

''Nonsuch'' continued to [[James Bay]], the southern portion of Hudson Bay, where its explorers founded, in 1668, the first fort on Hudson Bay, Charles Fort (later Rupert House, now [[Waskaganish, Quebec|Waskaganish]], Quebec),<ref>{{cite web |title=1668: Des Groseilliers aboard the 12-metre ship Nonsuch travels to James Bay |website=HBC Heritage - Timeline |url=http://hbcheritage.ca/content/timeline |access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> at the mouth of the [[Rupert River]]. Both the fort and the river were named after the sponsor of the expedition, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, one of the major investors and soon to be the new company's first governor. After a successful trading expedition over the winter of 1668–69, ''Nonsuch'' returned to England on 9 October 1669 with the first cargo of fur resulting from trade in Hudson Bay.<ref name=Radisson/> The bulk of the fur - worth £1,233 - was sold to Thomas Glover, one of London's most prominent furriers. This and subsequent purchases by Glover made it clear that the fur trade in Hudson Bay was indeed viable.{{sfn|Rich|1958|pages= 38, 42}}

[[File:Ruperts land.svg|thumb|[[Rupert's Land]], the [[drainage basin]] of Hudson Bay, the company's grant.]]

'''The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson's Bay''' was incorporated on 2 May 1670, with a royal charter from King Charles II.<ref name=charter/> The charter granted the company a monopoly over the region drained by all rivers and streams flowing into Hudson Bay in northern Canada. The area gained the name "Rupert's Land" after Prince Rupert, the first governor of the company appointed by the King. This drainage basin of Hudson Bay constitutes {{convert|1.5|e6sqmi}}, comprising over one-third of the area of modern-day Canada and stretches into the present-day north-central United States.  The specific boundaries were unknown at the time. Rupert's Land would eventually become Canada's largest land "purchase" in the 19th century.

The HBC established six posts between 1668 and 1717.  Rupert House <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enhaut.ca/voor1/voorhis.html#f488|title=Historic Forts and Trading Posts of the French Regime and of the English Fur Trading Companies|last=Voorhis|first=Ernest|date=1930|website=www.enhaut.ca/voor1|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=2016-04-24}}</ref>(1668, southeast), [[Moose Factory]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enhaut.ca/voor1/voorhis.html#f368|title=Historic Forts and Trading Posts of the French Regime and of the English Fur Trading Companies|last=Ernest|first=Voorhis|date=2016-04-24|website=www.enhaut.ca/voor1|publisher=Government of Canada (orig.)|access-date=2016-04-24}}</ref> (1673, south) and Fort Albany,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enhaut.ca/voor1/voorhis.html#f8|title=Historic Forts of the French Regime and of the English Trading Companies|last=Voorhis|first=Ernest|date=1930|website=www.enhaut.ca/voor1|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=2016-04-24}}</ref> Ontario (1679, west) were erected on James Bay; three other posts were established on the western shore of Hudson Bay proper: [[Fort Severn First Nation|Fort Severn]] (1689), [[York Factory]] (1684) and [[Churchill, Manitoba|Fort Churchill]] (1717).  Inland posts [[Asleep by the frozen sea|were not built]] until 1774. After 1774, York Factory became the main post because of its convenient access to the vast interior waterway systems of the [[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] and [[Red River of the North|Red]] rivers. Called "factories" (because the "[[Factor (agent)|factor]]," i.e., a person acting as a mercantile agent did business from there), these posts operated in the manner of the Dutch fur trading operations in [[New Netherland]]s.adoption of Standard of Trade in the 18th century, the HBC ensured consistent pricing throughout Rupert's Land. A means of exchange arose based on the [[Made Beaver]] (MB); a prime pelt, worn for a year and ready for processing: "the prices of all trade goods were set in values of Made Beaver (MB) with other animal pelts, such as squirrel, otter and moose quoted in their MB (made beaver) equivalents.  For example, two otter pelts might equal 1 MB".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/business/fur/standardtrade|title=Hbc Heritage {{!}} The Standard of Trade|website=www.hbcheritage.ca|access-date=2016-04-24}}</ref>

During the fall and winter, [[First Nations]] men and European trappers did the vast majority of the animal trapping and pelt preparation. They travelled by [[canoe]] and on foot to the forts to sell their pelts. In exchange they typically received popular trade goods such as knives, kettles, beads, needles, and the [[Hudson's Bay point blanket]]. The arrival of the First Nations trappers was one of the high points of the year, met with pomp and circumstance. The highlight was very formal, an almost ritualized "Trading Ceremony" between the Chief Trader and the Captain of the aboriginal contingent who traded on their behalf.<ref>{{cite web|title= Our History: Business: Fur Trade: Trading Ceremony at York Factory, 1780s|url= http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/business/fur/tradingceremony |publisher= HBC Heritage}}</ref> During the initial years of the fur trade, prices for items varied from post to post.

The early coastal factory model contrasted with the system of the French, who established an extensive system of inland posts at native villages and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region. In March 1686, the French sent a [[Hudson Bay expedition (1686)|raiding party]] under the [[Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes|Chevalier des Troyes]] over {{convert|1,300|km|abbr=on}} to capture the HBC posts along James Bay. The French appointed [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1687 an English attempt to [[Battle of Fort Albany|resettle Fort Albany]] failed due to ruses and deceptions by d'Iberville. After 1688 England and France [[King William's War|were officially at war]]. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well-defended local headquarters at York Factory. In 1693 the company [[Battle of Fort Albany (1693)|recovered Fort Albany]]; d'Iberville [[Capture of York Factory|captured York Factory]] in 1694, but the company recovered it the next year.

In 1697, d'Iberville again commanded a French naval raid on York Factory. On the way to the fort, he defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Hudson's Bay]] (5 September 1697), the largest naval battle in the history of the North American Arctic. D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by a ruse; they laid siege to the fort while pretending to be a much larger army, the French held all of the outposts except Fort Albany until 1713. (Fort Albany was again [[Battle of Fort Albany (1709)|unsuccessfully attacked in 1709]] by a small French and Indian force.) The economic consequences of the French possession to the company were significant; it did not pay any dividends for more than 20 years. See [[Anglo-French conflicts on Hudson Bay]].

===18th century===
[[File:Indians at a Hudson Bay Company trading post.jpg|thumb|Trading at a Hudson's Bay Company trading post.]]

The war ended in 1713 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Among its many provisions, the Treaty required France to relinquish all claims to Hudson Bay, which again became a British possession.{{Sfn|Newman|1985|page=352}} The [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] had been established (following the union of Scotland and England in 1707). After the treaty, the company built [[Prince of Wales Fort]], a stone [[star fort]] at the mouth of the nearby [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]]. In 1782, during the [[Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War]], a French squadron under [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse]] [[Hudson Bay expedition|captured and demolished]] York Factory and Prince of Wales Fort in support of the American rebels.

In its trade with native peoples, Hudson's Bay Company exchanged wool blankets, called [[Hudson's Bay point blanket]]s, for the beaver pelts trapped by aboriginal hunters. By 1700, point blankets accounted for over 60% of the trade.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian Museum of Civilization Display}}</ref> The number of [[indigo]] stripes (a.k.a. points) woven into the blankets identified its finished size. A long-held misconception is that the number of stripes is related to its value in beaver pelts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/faq/pointblanketfaq/default#1 |title=Our History: The Hudson's Bay Company Point Blanket: FAQs |website=HBC Heritage |accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref>

A parallel may be drawn between the HBC's control over Rupert's Land with the trade monopoly and government functions enjoyed by the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]] over India during roughly the same period. Viewed as a major competitor, the HBC invested £10,000 in the East India Company in 1732.{{sfn|Rich|1958|pages=38, 42, 491}}

Hudson's Bay Company's first inland trading post was established by [[Samuel Hearne]] in 1774 in [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan|Cumberland House]], Saskatchewan.<ref name=DNB_Hearne>{{cite DNB |wstitle=Hearne, Samuel |last=Chichester |first=Henry Manners |authorlink=Henry Manners Chichester |volume=25 |page=335}}</ref><ref name=Hearne>{{cite web |title=Our History: People: Explorers: Samuel Hearne |website=Hudson's Bay Company |url=http://hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/people/explorers/samuelhearne.asp |accessdate=14 November 2007}}</ref>

In 1779, the [[North West Company]] (NWC) was founded in [[Montreal]] as a seasonal partnership to provide more capital and to continue competing with the HBC. It became operative for the outfit of 1780 and was the first joint stock company in Canada and possibly North America. The agreement lasted one year. A second agreement established in 1780 had a three-year term. The company became a permanent entity in 1783.{{sfn|Newman|1985|page=354}} By 1784, the NWC had begun to make serious inroads into the HBC's profits.<ref>{{cite web|last=HBC Heritage|title=Our History: Acquisitions: Fur Trade: The North West Company|url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/furtrade/nwc.asp}}</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:Hudson's Bay Company express canoe.jpg|thumb|Hudson's Bay Company officials in an express canoe crossing a lake, 1825]]
In 1821, the North West Company of Montreal and Hudson's Bay Company were forcibly merged by intervention of the British government to put an end to often-violent competition. A total of 175 posts, 68 of them the HBC's, were reduced to 52 for efficiency and because many were redundant as a result of the rivalry and were inherently unprofitable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/atlas/themes.aspx?id=earlytrade&sub=earlytrade_east_hudsons&lang=En |publisher=Canadian Geographic magazine |title=Early Trading Networks |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> Their combined territory was extended by a licence to the [[North-Western Territory]], which reached to the [[Arctic Ocean]] in the north and, with the creation of the [[Columbia Department]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]], to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west. The NWC's regional headquarters at [[Fort Astoria|Fort George]] (Fort Astoria) was relocated to [[Fort Vancouver]], which became the HBC base of operations on the Pacific Slope.

Before the merger, the employees of the HBC, unlike the North West Company, did not participate in its profits. After the merger, with all operations under the management of [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]] (1826–60), the company had a corps of commissioned officers, 25 chief factors and 28 chief traders, who shared in the profits of the company during the monopoly years. Its trade covered {{convert|7,770,000|km2|abbr=on}}, and it had 1,500 contract employees.<ref name=galbraith>{{cite book |last=Galbraith |first=John S. |title=Hudson's Bay Company As an Imperial Factor 1821–1869 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1957 |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |url={{google books|fOscZfLNOQkC|plainurl=yes|page=8}} |pp=8–23 |access-date=6 October 2015 |ref=harv}}</ref>

The progression for officers, together referred to as the Commissioned Gentlemen, was to enter the company as a fur trader. Typically, they were men who had the capital to invest in starting up their trading. They sought to be promoted to the rank of Chief Trader.  A Chief Trader would be in charge of an individual post and was entitled to one share of the profits of the company.  Chief Factors sat in council with the Governors and were the heads of districts. They were entitled to two shares of the profits or the losses of the company.  The average income of a Chief Trader was £360 and that of a Chief Factor was £720.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton |first1=Arthur S. |first2=Lewis G. |last2=Thomas |title=A History of the Canadian West to 1870–71 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1973 |orig-year=1939 |location=Toronto, Ontario |edition=2nd |isbn=0-8020-4033-0 |p=690}}</ref>

[[File:Hbc post Lake Winnipeg.jpg|thumb|left|A Hudson's Bay Company post on [[Lake Winnipeg]], [[Circa|c.]]1884.]]

Although the HBC maintained a monopoly on the fur trade during the early to mid-19th century, there was competition from James Sinclair and [[Andrew McDermot]] (Dermott), independent traders in the [[Red River Colony]].  They shipped furs by the [[Red River Trails]] to [[Norman Kittson]]{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=60–72}} a buyer in the United States. In addition, Americans controlled the [[Maritime fur trade]] on the Northwest Coast until the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=James R. |title=Otter Skins, Boston Ships, and China Goods: The Maritime Fur Trade of the Northwest Coast, 1785–1841 |year=1992 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal, Quebec |isbn=0-7735-2028-7 |pages=60–61 |url={{google books||plainurl=yes|page=60}} |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, the HBC controlled nearly all trading operations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], based at the company headquarters at [[Fort Vancouver]] on the [[Columbia River]].  Although claims to the region were by agreement in abeyance, commercial operating rights were nominally shared by the United States and Britain through the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], company policy, enforced via Chief Factor [[John McLoughlin]] of the company's [[Columbia District]], was to discourage U.S. settlement of the territory. The company's effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region.  It established [[Fort Boise]] in 1834 (in present-day southwestern Idaho) to compete with the American [[Fort Hall]], {{convert|483|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east.  In 1837, it purchased Fort Hall, also along the route of the [[Oregon Trail]], where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail.

[[File:Running them down.jpeg|thumb|Sketches of Hudson Bay Life: ''Running them down'', by [[Harry Bullock-Webster]]]]

The company's stranglehold on the region was broken by the [[Oregon Trail#Great Migration of 1843|first successful large wagon train to reach Oregon in 1843]], led by [[Marcus Whitman]].  In the years that followed, thousands of emigrants poured into the [[Willamette Valley]].  In 1846, the United States acquired full authority south of the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]; the most settled areas of the Oregon Country were south of the [[Columbia River]] in what is now Oregon.  McLoughlin, who had once turned away would be settlers as company director, then welcomed them from his general store at [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] and was later proclaimed the "Father of [[Oregon]]".  The company retains no presence today in what is now the United States portion of the Pacific Northwest.

During the 1820s and 1830s, HBC trappers were deeply involved in the early exploration and development of [[Northern California]].  Company trapping brigades were sent south from Fort Vancouver, along what became known as the [[Siskiyou Trail]], into Northern California as far south as the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] where the company operated a trading post at [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (San Francisco).  These trapping brigades in Northern California faced serious risks, and were often the first to explore relatively uncharted territory, among the lesser known [[Peter Skene Ogden]], [[Samuel Black]].

Between 1820 and 1870, the HBC issued its own [[Banknote|paper money]]. The notes, denominated in [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]], were printed in London and issued at the York Factory, [[Fort Garry]] and the Red River Colony.<ref>{{cite book |title=Money and Exchange in Canada to 1900 |first=A.B. |last=McCullough |publisher=Dundurn |year=1996 |pages=230–232 |url={{google books|ggUEMvdmNLgC|plainurl=yes|page=230}} | isbn=978-1-5548-8228-1 |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

The [[Guillaume Sayer]] Trial in 1849 contributed to the end of the HBC monopoly.  Sayer, a [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] trapper and trader, was accused of the illegal trading of furs.  The Court of [[Assiniboia]] brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters.  During the trial, a crowd of armed Métis men led by [[Louis Riel, Sr.]] gathered outside the courtroom.  Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge [[Adam Thom]] did not levy a fine or punishment.  Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, ''Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!'' ("Trade is free! Trade is free!"), the Métis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River.

Another factor was the findings of the [[Palliser Expedition]] of 1857 to 1860, led by Captain [[John Palliser]]. Although he recommended against settlement of the region the report sparked a debate. That ended the myth publicized by Hudson's Bay Company that the Canadian West was unfit for agricultural settlement. In 1863, the International Financial Society became the majority shareholders of the HBC.

In 1869, after rejecting the [[American government]] offer of {{CAD|10,000,000}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |title=John A. Macdonald |website=Canada History |publisher=Access HT |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> the company approved the return of Rupert’s Land to Britain which in turn gave it to Canada and loaned the new country the £300,000 required to compensate HBC for its losses. The deal, known as The Deed of Surrender, came into force the following year. The resulting territory, now known as the [[Northwest Territories]], was brought under Canadian jurisdiction under the terms of the [[Rupert's Land Act 1868]], enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Deed enabled the admission of the fifth province, [[Manitoba]], to the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] on 15 July 1870, the very same day that the deed itself came into force.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History: Business: Fur Trade: The Deed of Surrender |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/week/the-deed-of-surrender |website=HBC Heritage |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

During the 19th century the Hudson Bay's Company was going through a lot of change such as growth and settlement, ongoing pressure from Britain, and the future of the West seemed unlikely to remain in the hands of the company.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Owram |first1=Doug |editor1-last=Francis |editor1-first=R.

===Rent obligation under charter===
Under the charter establishing Hudson's Bay Company, the company was required to give two [[elk]] skins and two black [[beaver]] pelts to the English king, then Charles II, or his heirs, whenever the monarch visited Rupert's Land. The exact text from the 1670 Charter reads:{{quote|...Yielding and paying yearly to us and our heirs and successors for the same two Elks and two Black beavers whensoever and as often as We, our heirs and successors shall happen to enter into the said Countries, Territories and Regions hereby granted."<ref name=charter/>}}

The ceremony was first conducted with the [[Prince of Wales]] (the future Edward VIII) in 1927, then with King [[George VI]] in 1939, and last with his daughter, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1959 and 1970. On the last such visit, the pelts were given in the form of two live beavers, which the Queen donated to the Winnipeg Zoo in [[Assiniboine Park]]. However, when the company permanently moved its headquarters to Canada, the Charter was amended to remove the rent obligation. Each of the four "rent ceremonies" took place in or around Winnipeg.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History: Business: Fur Trade: The Rent Ceremony |website=HBC Heritage |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/business/fur/rentceremony |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

==Store operations==

===Department stores and diversification===
{{See also|Hudson's Bay (retailer)}}
The iconic department store today evolved from trading posts at the start of the 19th century, when they began to see demand for general merchandise grow rapidly. HBC soon expanded into the interior and set-up posts along river settlements that later developed into the modern cities of Winnipeg, [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]]. In 1857, the first sales shop was established in [[Fort Langley]]. This was followed by other sales shops in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Fort Victoria]] (1859), Winnipeg (1881), Calgary (1884), [[Vancouver]] (1887), [[Vernon, British Columbia|Vernon]] (1887), Edmonton (1890), [[Yorkton]] (1898), and [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]] (1902). The first of the grand "original six" department stores was built in Calgary in 1913. The other department stores that followed were in Edmonton, Vancouver, Victoria, [[Saskatoon]], and Winnipeg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/timeline/early/ |website=HBC Heritage |title=Our History: Timelines: Early Stores |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.hbc.com/hbc/history/ |website=Hudson's Bay Company |title=Our History |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

The First World War interrupted a major remodelling and restoration of retail trade shops planned in 1912. Following the war, the company revitalized its fur-trade and real-estate activities, and diversified its operations by venturing into the oil business.<ref name="HBC Heritage"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Our History: People: Builders: Burbidge |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/people/builders/burbidge |website=HBC Heritage |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>
Today, the department store business is the only remaining part of the company's operations, in the form of department stores under the Hudson's Bay brand.<ref>{{cite web |website=Funding Universe |title=Hudson's Bay Company History |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/hudson-s-bay-company-history/ |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref>

===Oil and gas operations===

The company co-founded Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company (HBOG) in 1926 with [[Marland Oil Company]] (which merged with [[Conoco]] in 1929). HBOG expanded during the 1940s and 1950s, and in 1960 began shipping Canadian crude through a new link to the Glacier pipeline and on to the refinery in Billings, Montana. The company became the sixth-largest Canadian oil producer in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.conocophillips.ca/who-we-are/our-history/Pages/1900s.aspx |website=ConocoPhilips Canada |accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref> In 1973, HBOG acquired a 35% stake in Siebens Oil and Gas, and, in 1979, it divested that interest. In 1980, it bought a controlling interest in Roxy Petroleum. In the 1980s, sales and oil prices slipped, while debt from acquisitions piled up which led to Hudson's Bay Company selling its 52.9% stake in HBOG to [[Dome Petroleum]] in 1981.<ref name="The Canadian Encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia |first=Deborah C. |last=Sawyer |date=2 February 2006 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/dome-petroleum-limited/ |title=Dome Petroleum Limited |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |edition=online |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref>

===Retail expansion===
[[File:HBC Logo.svg|thumb|HBC's coat of arms logo]]

In 1960, the company acquired [[Morgan's]] allowing it to expand into Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa. In 1965, HBC rebranded all its department stores as The Bay. The Morgan's logo was changed to match the new visual identity. But by 1972 the last of the former Morgan’s stores had been rebranded to Bay stores.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History: Acquisitions: Retail: Morgan’s |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/retail/morgans |website=HBC Heritage |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

In 1970, on the 300th anniversary of the company, as a result of punishing new British tax laws, the company relocated to Canada, and was rechartered as a Canadian business corporation under Canadian law,<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History: Timelines: HBC: 1970 |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/timeline/hbc/ |website=HBC Heritage}}</ref> Head Office functions were transferred from London to Winnipeg. By 1974, as the company expanded into eastern Canada, head office functions were moved to Toronto.

In 1972, the company acquired the four-store [[Shop-Rite (Canada)|Shop-Rite]] chain of [[catalog merchant|catalogue stores]]. The chain was quickly expanded to 65 stores in Ontario, but closed in 1982 due to declining sales.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19811118&id=2a4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5-4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1164,5107737 |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=18 November 1981 |title=600 to lose jobs as Bay closes Shop-Rite stores |first1=Keri |last1=Sweetman |first2=Denise |last2=Harrington |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> In these stores, little merchandise was displayed; customers made their selections from catalogues, and staff would retrieve the merchandise from storerooms. The HBC also acquired [[Freimans]] department stores in Ottawa and converted them to The Bay.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History: Timelines: Acquisitions |website=HBC Heritage |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/timeline/acquisitions/ |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

In 1978, the [[Zellers]] discount store chain made a bid to acquire the HBC, but the HBC turned the tables and acquired Zellers instead. Also in 1978, [[Simpsons (department store)|Simpson's]] department stores were acquired by Hudson's Bay Company, and were converted to Bay stores in 1991. (The related chain Simpsons-Sears was not acquired by the Bay, but became [[Sears Canada]] in 1978.) By 1991, Simpsons, originally operated as a stand-alone premium retail brand, had disappeared, having been folded into the Bay.

In 1979, Canadian billionaire [[Kenneth Thomson, 2nd Baron Thomson of Fleet|Kenneth Thomson]] won control of the company in a battle with [[George Weston Limited]], and acquired a 75% stake for $400 million.<ref name="CanEncycl_HBC">{{cite encyclopedia |first=Arthur J. |last=Ray |date=2 April 2009 |title=Hudson's Bay Company |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/hudsons-bay-company |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> Thomson sold the company's oil and gas business, financial services, distillery, and other interests for approximately $550 million, transforming the company into a leaner, more focused operation. In 1997, the Thomson family sold the last of its remaining shares.<ref name="CanEncycl_HBC"/>

Hudson's Bay Company reversed a formidable debt problem in 1987, by shedding non-strategic assets such as its wholesale division and getting completely out of the oil and gas business. HBC also sold its Canadian fur-auction business to Hudson's Bay Fur Sales Canada (now [[North American Fur Auctions]]). The Northern Stores Division was sold that same year to a group of investors and employees, which adopted [[The North West Company]] name three years later.<ref name="HBC.com HBC Heritage">{{cite web |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/timeline/hbc/home|title=Hbc Heritage - Timeline|work=hbcheritage.ca}}</ref>

The HBC acquired [[Towers Department Stores]] in 1990, combining them with the [[Zellers]] chain, and [[Woodward's]] stores in 1993, converting them into Bay or Zellers stores. [[Kmart#Canada, Europe, Mexico and Australia stores|Kmart Canada]] was acquired in 1998 and merged with Zellers.<ref name="HBC.com HBC Heritage"/>

In 1991, the Bay agreed to stop retailing [[fur]] in response to complaints from people opposed to killing animals for this purpose. In 1997, the Bay reopened its fur salons to meet the demand of consumers. [[Animal rights]] groups, such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) and Freedom for Animals, continue to try and induce retailers like HBC to stop selling furs, with varying success.

[[File:hudsonsbayco.jpg|left|thumb|The Hudson's Bay Company building in Montreal, originally the Morgan's flagship store]]

From 2004 to 2008, the HBC owned and operated a small chain of off-price stores called [[Designer Depot]]. Similar to the [[Winners]] and [[HomeSense]] retail format, Designer Depot did not meet sales expectations, and its nine stores were sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=428721 |title=Hudson's Bay Eager to Log Onto New Era |accessdate=8 April 2008 |work=Financial Post/National Post}}</ref> Another HBC chain, [[Fields (department store)|Fields]], was sold to a private firm in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/964933/fields-stores-to-flourish-again-in-western-canada |title=Fields Stores to Flourish Again in Western Canada |date=1 May 2012 |publisher=Canada Newswire |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref> Established in 1950, Fields was acquired by [[Zellers]] in 1976.

===Purchase by American interests, 2003===
In December 2003, Maple Leaf Heritage Investments, a [[Nova Scotia]]-based company created to acquire shares of Hudson's Bay Company, announced that it was considering making an offer to acquire all or some of the common shares of Hudson's Bay Company.<ref name=Privco>{{cite web |url=http://www.privco.com/private-company/hudson-bay-company |title=Hudsons Bay Company |website=Privco.com |access-date=7 October 2015}}</ref> Maple Leaf Heritage Investments is a subsidiary of B-Bay Inc. Its CEO and chairman is American businesswoman, Anita Zucker, widow of [[Jerry Zucker (businessman)|Jerry Zucker]]. Zucker had previously been the head of the [[Polymer Group]], which acquired another Canadian institution, [[Dominion Textile]].

On 26 January 2006, the HBC's board unanimously agreed to a bid of $15.25 CAD/share from Jerry Zucker whose original bid was $14.75 CAD/share, ending a prolonged fight between the HBC and Zucker. The South Carolina billionaire financier was a longtime HBC minority shareholder. In a 9 March 2006 press release,<ref>{{cite press release |title=Hudson’s Bay Company Announces Realignment of Senior Management Team and Appoints New Board of Directors |first=Hillary |last=Stauth |publisher=Hudson’s Bay Company |date=9 March 2006 |url=http://www.hbc.com/hbc/mediacentre/press/hbc/press.asp?prId=214 |archive-date=16 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316021530/http://www.hbc.com/hbc/mediacentre/press/hbc/press.asp?prId=214 |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> the HBC announced that Zucker would replace [[Yves Fortier (lawyer)|Yves Fortier]] as Governor and [[George Heller]] as CEO, becoming the first US citizen to lead the company.

On 16 July 2008, the company was sold to NRDC Equity Partners, a private equity firm based in [[Purchase, New York]] which already owned Lord & Taylor, the oldest luxury department store chain in the United States.<ref name=GT-DEX-2008-19>{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Bell |title=NRDC Buys Hudson's Bay, Says Lord & Taylor to Expand (Update2) |work=Bloomberg |date=1 September 2012 |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&refer=canada&sid=aycn1XaTmvXI |accessdate=16 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=New owner to spruce up Bay |first=David |last=Friend |date=16 July 2008 |publisher=Toronto Star |url=http://www.thestar.com/Business/article/461506 |accessdate=16 July 2008}}</ref> The Canadian and U.S. holdings were transferred to NRDC Equity Partners' holding company, Hudson's Bay Trading Company, as of the fall of 2008.

In September 2011, the HBC began downsizing the Zellers chain with the announcement that it would sell the majority of the leases for its locations to the U.S.-based retailer [[Target Corporation]] and close all of their remaining locations by early 2013. Target used the acquisition of this real estate as a means to enable its entry in the Canadian market. HBC used the proceeds to allow it to pay down debt and to invest in growing its Hudson's Bay and Lord & Taylor banners.

===Public offering, 2012 to present===

In October 2012, the HBC announced a $1.6 billion [[initial public offering]] (IPO); Baker planned to use the IPO to allow Canadian ownership to return to the company, and to help pay off debts with other partners. Additionally, the company also announced that it would re-brand The Bay department store chain as "Hudson's Bay".<ref name="gandm-ipo">{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Marina |title=HBC launches IPO as new rivals loom |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=17 October 2012 |location=Toronto |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/hbc-launches-ipo-as-new-rivals-loom/article4618187/ |accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref>

The new Hudson's Bay brand was launched in March 2013; incorporating a new logo with an updated rendition of the classic Hudson's Bay Company [[coat of arms]], designed to be modern and better reflect the company's heritage. Following the IPO, HBC had also introduced a new corporate logo of its own (reviving a [[wordmark]] from the original [[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company|HBC flag]]), but the new logo was not intended to be a consumer-facing brand.<ref name=gandm-hbcnewlogo>{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Krashinsky |title=New logo, old name: The Bay returns to its roots |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/new-logo-old-name-the-bay-returns-to-its-roots/article9356220/ |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=12 March 2013 |location=Toronto |date=11 March 2013}}</ref><ref name="name change">{{cite press release |title=Hudson's Bay Celebrates Its Past, Present and Future with Modern New Logo |url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/hudsons-bay-celebrates-its-past-present-and-future-with-modern-new-logo-tsx-hbc-1765078.htm |publisher=Hudson's Bay Company |accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/03/06/the-bay-gets-a-new-logo-for-first-time-in-almost-50-years/ |title=The Bay gets a new logo for first time in almost 50 years |work=National Post |date=13 March 2013 |access-date=7 March 2013 |first=Hollie |last=Shaw}}</ref>

In July 2013, the HBC announced its intent to purchase New York's Saks, Inc. for US$2.9 billion, or $16 per share.

The HBC is diversified into joint ventures and other types of business products. The HBC has credit card, mortgage, and personal insurance branches. These other products and services are joint partnerships with other corporations. The HBC also has other [[Hudson's Bay Rewards|HBC Rewards]] corporate partners such as: [[Imperial Oil]]/[[Esso]], [[M&M Meat Shops]], [[Chapters]]/[[Indigo Books and Music|Indigo]] Books, [[Kelsey's Neighbourhood Bar & Grill|Kelsey's]]/[[Montana's Cookhouse|Montana's]] Restaurants, [[Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group|Thrifty Car Rental]], [[Cineplex Entertainment]] Theatres, etc. HBC Rewards points can be redeemed in house or into corporate partners' gift cards and certificates.

The HBC is involved in community and charity activities. The HBC Rewards Community Program raises funds for community causes. The HBC Foundation is a charity agency involved in social issues and service. The HBC used to sponsor the annual HBC Run for Canada, a series of public-participation runs and walks held across the country on Canada Day to raise funds for Canadian athletes. The company discontinued this event in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=HBC Run for Canada |date=2008 |url=http://www.hbcrunforcanada.ca/2008/index.php |archive-date=21 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421224554/http://www.hbcrunforcanada.ca/2008/index.php}}</ref>

===Olympic outfitter===

The HBC was the official outfitter of clothing for members of the Canadian Olympic team in 1936, 1960, 1964, 1968, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. The sponsorship has been renewed through 2020. Since the late 2000s, HBC has used its status as the official Canadian Olympics team outfitter to gain global exposure, as part of a turnaround plan that included shedding under-performing brands and luring new high-end brands.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marina |last=Strauss |title=Meet the man trying to shake up luxury retail in Canada |location=Toronto |work=The Globe and Mail |date=28 November 2013 |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/saks-appeal-hbc-head-richard-baker-bets-canadians-are-dying-to-go-deluxe/article15633445/?page=all |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Vancouver 2010 red mittens HBC.JPG|thumbnail|left|The red Olympic mittens first sold for the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Vancouver Olympics]].]]

On 2 March 2005, the company was announced as the new clothing outfitter for the Canadian Olympic team, in a $100 million deal, providing apparel for the 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 Games, having outbid the existing Canadian Olympic wear-supplier, [[Roots Canada]], which had supplied Canada's Olympic teams from 1998 to 2004.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roots no longer outfitting Olympic teams, co-founder says |date=7 April 2008 |work=Toronto Star |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2008/04/07/roots_no_longer_outfitting_olympic_teams_cofounder_says.html |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stylish.ca/canadian-olympic-gear-courtesy-of-the-bay-zellers-020854.php |title=Canadian Olympic Gear, courtesy of The Bay & Zellers |work=Stylish.ca |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> The Canadian Olympic collection is sold through The Bay (and Zellers until 2013 when the Zellers leases were sold to [[Target Canada]]).

HBC's [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympic]]<nowiki/>s and [[2008 Summer Olympics]] uniforms and toques received a mixed reception for their multicoloured stripes (green, red, yellow, blue) which seemed to be not-so-subtle advertising for HBC rather than representing the Canadian Olympic team's traditional colours of red and white (with black as a secondary), in contrast to well-received Root's 1998 collection with its trendy red [[letter jacket]]s and Poor Boy caps. HBC produced 80% to 90% of their Olympic clothes in China which was criticized, as Roots ensured that the Olympic clothes were made in Canada using Canadian material.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080502/hbc_criticism_080502/20080502 |title=Canadian Olympic gear made in China, MPs cry foul |work=CTV News |accessdate=2 May 2008 |publisher=Bell Media Television}}</ref>

HBC's apparel for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] held in Vancouver proved to be extremely successful, in part because Canada was the host country and their athletes had a record medal haul. The "Red Mittens" (red-and-white mittens featuring a large maple leaf) that were sold for $10 CAD, with one-third of the proceeds going to the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]], proved very popular, as were the "Canada" hoodies.

The HBC's [[2010 Winter Olympics]] apparel was also controversial due to a knitted, machine-made sweater that looked like a [[Cowichan knitting|Cowichan sweater]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/first-nation-alleges-olympic-ripoff-1.829857|title = First Nation alleges Olympic ripoff|date = 7 October 2009|accessdate = 11 December 2015|website = |publisher = CBC News|last = |first = }}</ref> After a meeting between HBC representatives and [[Cowichan Tribes|Cowichan Tribe]]<nowiki/>s, a compromise was made between the parties; knitters would have an opportunity to sell their sweaters at the downtown Vancouver HBC store, alongside the HBC imitations.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cowichan-tribes-reach-olympic-sweater-deal-1.830116|title = Cowichan Tribes reach Olympic sweater deal|date = 28 October 2009|accessdate = 11 December 2015|website = |publisher = CBC News|last = |first = }}</ref>

Lord [[Sebastian Coe]], chairman of the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games|2012 London Olympic Games Organizing Committee]], who attended the [[2010 Winter Olympics|Vancouver Olympics]], noted that the Canadians were passionate in embracing the Games with 'their "Canada" hoodies and their red mittens (of which 2.6 million pairs sold that year).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/feb/18/sebastian-coe-winter-olympics |title=Sebastian Coe defends Vancouver Winter Olympics from critics |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 February 2010 |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/7293583/Winter-Olympics-2010-Vancouver-so-passionate-to-embrace-Games-says-Seb-Coe.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first1=Sebastian |last1=Coe |authorlink1=Sebastian Coe |title=Winter Olympics 2010: Vancouver so passionate to embrace Games, says Seb Coe |date=23 February 2010 |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> HBC has continued to produce these red mittens for subsequent Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sochi/putin-in-canada-house-good-luck-except-in-hockey-1.1686560 |title=Putin in Canada House: 'Good luck, except in hockey' |work=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media Television |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

==Archives==
{{See also|Hudson's Bay Company Archives}}
The legacy of the HBC has been maintained in part by the detailed record-keeping and archiving of material by the company. Before 1974, the records of the HBC were kept in the London office headquarters. The HBC opened an archives department to researchers in 1931. In 1974, Hudson's Bay Company Archives (HBCA) were transferred from London and placed on deposit with the Manitoba archives in Winnipeg. The company granted public access to the collection the following year.

On 27 January 1994, the company’s archives were formally donated to the Archives of Manitoba.<ref>{{cite web |title=HBCA History |website=Hudson's Bay Company Archives |publisher=Government of Manitoba |url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/archives/hbca/about/hbca_history.html |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

At the time of the donation, the appraised value of the records was nearly $60 million. A foundation, Hudson's Bay Company History Foundation funded through the tax savings resulting from the donation, was established to support the operations of the HBC Archive as a division of the Archives of Manitoba, along with other activities and programs.,<ref>{{cite web |title=HBC History Foundation |website=Hudson's Bay Company |url=http://www3.hbc.com/hbc/socialresponsibility/hbc-history-foundation/ |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> More than two kilometers of filed documents and hundreds of microfilm reels are now stored in a special climate-controlled vault in the Manitoba Archives Building.

In 2007, Hudson's Bay Company Archives became part of the United Nations "[[Memory of the World Programme]]" project, under [[UNESCO]]. The records covered the HBC history from the founding of the company in 1670. The records contained business transactions, medical records, personal journals of officials, inventories, company reports, etc.

===Corporate hierarchy===
Hudson's Bay Company operated with a very rigid hierarchy when it came to its employees. This hierarchy essentially broke down into two levels; the officers and the servants.  Comprising the officers were the factors, masters and chief traders, clerks and surgeons. The servants were the tradesmen, boatmen, and laborers. The officers essentially ran the fur trading posts.  They had many duties which included supervising the workers in their trade posts, valuing the furs, and keeping trade and post records.  In 1821, when Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company merged, the hierarchy became even stricter and the lines between officers and servants became virtually impossible to cross. Officers in charge of individual trading posts had much responsibility because they were directly in charge of enforcing the policies made by the governor and committee (the board) of the company. One of these policies was the price of particular furs and trade goods.  These prices were called the Official and Comparative Standards. Made-Beaver, the quality measurement of the pelt, was the means of exchange used by Hudson's Bay Company to define the Official and Comparative Standards. Because the governor was stationed in London, England, they needed to have reliable officers managing the trade posts halfway around the world. Because the fur trade was a very dynamic market, HBC needed to have some form of flexibility when dealing with prices and traders. Price fluctuation was deferred to the officers in charge of the trade posts, and the head office recorded any difference between the company's standard and that set by the individual officers. Overplus, or any excess revenue gained by officers was strictly documented to insure that it wasn't being pocketed and taken from the company. This strict yet flexible hierarchy exemplifies how Hudson's Bay Company was able to be so successful while still having its central management and trade posts located so far apart.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |first2=Frank D. |last2=Lewis |title=Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay: The Economics of Depletion in the Lands of Hudson's Bay Company, 1700–1763 |journal=Journal of Economic History |publisher=Economic History Association |volume=53 |issue=3 |date=September 1993 |pp=465–495 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2122402 |jstor=2122402 |access-date=6 October 2015 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700013450}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Judd |first=Carol |title=Native labour and social stratification in Hudson's Bay Company's Northern Department, 1770–1870 |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pp=305–314 |date=November 1980 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.1980.tb00707.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.1980.tb00707.x/abstract |subscription=yes}}</ref>
