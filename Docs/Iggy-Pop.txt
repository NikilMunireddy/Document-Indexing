'''James Newell Osterberg, Jr.''', known professionally as '''Iggy Pop''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|ɡ|i|_|p|ɒ|p}}; born April 21, 1947), is an American singer-songwriter, musician and actor. He is the vocalist of influential [[proto-punk]] band [[The Stooges]], who reunited in 2003,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iggypop.org/coachella2003.html |title=The Stooges Reuinion at Coachella 2003 |website=iggypop.org |accessdate=December 27, 2014}}</ref> and has been known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neatorama.com/2009/03/09/music-tidbits-iggy-pop/ |title=Music Tidbits: Iggy Pop – Neatorama |last=Harness |first=Jill |date=March 9, 2009 |website=Neatorama |accessdate=December 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/iggy-pop/biography|title=Iggy Pop Biography {{!}} Rolling Stone |website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/proto-punk-ma0000005021 AllMusic]</ref>

Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including [[garage rock]], [[punk rock]], [[hard rock]], [[art rock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[jazz]] and [[blues music|blues]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/iggy-pop/43705 |title=Iggy Pop announces release date for 'jazz' album &#124; News |work=NME |date=March 26, 2009 |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}</ref> Though his popularity has fluctuated through the years, many of Pop's songs have become well-known, including "[[Lust for Life (song)|Lust for Life]]", "[[The Passenger (song)|The Passenger]]", "[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)#Iggy Pop|Real Wild Child (Wild One)]]", "[[Candy (Iggy Pop song)|Candy]]" (a duet with [[Kate Pierson]] of [[The B-52's]]), "[[China Girl (song)|China Girl]]", "[[Nightclubbing (song)|Nightclubbing]]", "[[Search and Destroy (The Stooges song)|Search and Destroy]]" and "[[I Wanna Be Your Dog]]".

In 2010, [[The Stooges]] were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

== Early life ==
[[File:Iggy Pop HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Osterberg as a high school senior, 1965]]
James Newell Osterberg, Jr. was born in [[Muskegon, Michigan]], the son of Louella (''née'' Christensen) and James Newell Osterberg, Sr., a former high school English teacher and baseball coach at [[Fordson High School]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].<ref>Trynka (2007): pp.13–14</ref> Osterberg was raised in a [[trailer park]] in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]].<ref name="Brooklyn Rail">{{cite web|last=Simmons |first=Todd |url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/5/music/limping-with-the-stooges-in-washington-h |title=Limping with the Stooges in Washington Heights – The Brooklyn Rail |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}</ref> He is of [[English people|English]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent on his father's side, and [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and [[Danes|Danish]] ancestry on his mother's side.<ref name=bookref1>{{cite book|last=Ambrose|first=Joe|title=Gimme danger: the story of Iggy Pop|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2004|page=2|url=|isbn=1-84449-328-8}}</ref> His father was adopted by a [[Swedish American]] family and took on their surname (Österberg).<ref name=bookref1/> In a 2007 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Pop explained his relationship with his parents and their contribution to his music:

{{cquote|Once I hit junior high in Ann Arbor, I began going to school with the son of the president of Ford Motor Company, with kids of wealth and distinction. But I had a wealth that beat them all. I had the tremendous investment my parents made in me. I got a lot of care. They helped me explore anything I was interested in. This culminated in their evacuation from the master bedroom in the trailer, because that was the only room big enough for my drum kit. They gave me their bedroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rolling-stone-interview-iggy-pop-20070419 |title=Iggy Pop: The Rolling Stone Interview}}</ref>}}

== Music career ==

=== Early days: 1960–1967 ===

[[File:Primemoverslive.gif|thumb|The Prime Movers, featuring Pop on drums]]
Osterberg began his music career as a drummer in various high school bands in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], including the Iguanas, who cut several records such as [[Bo Diddley]]'s "[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|Mona]]" in 1965.<ref name="Ankeny (Iguanas)">{{cite web|last1=Ankeny|first1=Jason|title=The Iguanas: Artist Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-iguanas-mn0002295191/biography|website=AllMusic|publisher=AllMusic, a division of All Media Network, LLC.|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}</ref> His later stage name, Iggy, is derived from the Iguanas. After exploring local [[blues]]-style bands such as [[The Prime Movers (Michigan band)|the Prime Movers]] (with brothers Dan and [[Michael Erlewine]]), he eventually dropped out of the [[University of Michigan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/arts/iggy-pop-and-ann-arbor |title=Searching in Ann Arbor for the origins of Iggy Pop |publisher=MichiganDaily.com |date=2011-04-17 |accessdate=2015-04-29}}</ref> and moved to Chicago to learn more about blues. While in Chicago, he played drums in blues clubs, helped by [[Sam Lay]] (formerly of the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]]) who shared his connections with Iggy.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.iggypop.org/iggyinterviews.html | title =Weasel interviews Iggy Pop| date = December 1980 | accessdate = January 14, 2009| publisher = [[WDCH-FM|WHFS]], Bethesda, MD, USA }}</ref> Inspired by [[Chicago blues]] as well as bands like [[The Sonics]], [[MC5]] and [[The Doors]], he formed the Psychedelic Stooges and began calling himself Iggy. The band was composed of Iggy on vocals, [[Ron Asheton]] on guitar, Asheton's brother [[Scott Asheton|Scott]] on drums, and [[Dave Alexander (The Stooges)|Dave Alexander]] on bass. Their first show was played at a Halloween party at a house in Detroit, Michigan. Members of the MC5 were also in attendance.

=== The Stooges era: 1968–1974 ===

The seeds of Pop's stage persona were sown when he saw [[The Doors]] perform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was amazed by the stage antics and antagonism displayed by singer [[Jim Morrison]].<ref name="Brooklyn Rail"/> Morrison's extreme behavior, while performing in a popular band, inspired the young Pop to push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pop's vocals and persona were [[Mick Jagger]] and [[James Brown]]. Pop was the first performer to do a [[stage-dive]], which he started at a concert in Detroit.<ref name="Brooklyn Rail"/> Pop, who traditionally performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass, exposing himself to the crowd, and vomiting on stage.<ref name="Brooklyn Rail"/>

{{quote|I attended two concerts by the Doors. The first one I attended was early on and they had not gotten their shit together yet. That show was a big, big, big influence on me. They had just had their big hit, “[[Light My Fire]]” and [[The Doors (album)|the album]] had taken off.... So, here’s this guy, out of his head on [[LSD|acid]], dressed in leather with his hair all oiled and curled. The stage was tiny and it was really low. It got confrontational. I found it really interesting. I loved the performance ... Part of me was like, 'Wow, this is great. He’s really pissing people off and he’s lurching around making these guys angry.' People were rushing the stage and Morrison’s going 'Fuck you. You blank, blank, blank.”' You can fill in your sexual comments yourself. The other half of it was that I thought, 'If they’ve got a hit record out and they can get away with this, then I have no fucking excuse not to get out on stage with my band.' It was sort of the case of, 'Hey, I can do that.' There really was some of that in there.<ref>Wright, Jeb. [http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/show_interview.php?id=97 Irritatingly Interesting: An Interview with Iggy Pop"] www.classicrockrevisited.</ref>}}

In 1968, one year after their live debut and now dubbed [[The Stooges]], the band signed with [[Elektra Records]], again following in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (reportedly, Pop called [[Moe Howard]] to see if it was alright to call his band "The Stooges," to which Howard responded by merely saying "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not [[The Three Stooges|the ''Three'' Stooges]]!" and hung up the phone).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The Stooges' first album ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'', (on which Pop was credited as "Iggy Stooge"), was produced by [[John Cale]] in New York in 1969.  Both it and the follow-up, ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'' produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of ''Fun House'' did not receive the recognition it expected, it was later ranked #191 in ''Rolling Stone's'' '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-stooges-fun-house-20120524 "500 Greatest Albums of All Time: The Stooges: ''Fun House''] ''Rolling Stone''. November 2003.</ref> Shortly after the new members joined, the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening [[heroin addiction]].

In 1971, without a record deal, The Stooges kept performing in small clubs with a 5-piece line-up that included both Ron Asheton and [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] on guitars and Jimmy Recca on bass, Dave Alexander having been sacked by Pop the previous year when he turned up for a gig unable to play because of his chronic [[alcoholism]] (he died in 1975). That year Pop and [[David Bowie]] met at [[Max's Kansas City]], a nightclub and restaurant in New York City.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.maxskansascity.com/bowie/ | title =David Bowie and Iggy Pop Meet At Max's Kansas City| date = September 17, 2008 | accessdate = September 17, 2008| publisher = Max's Kansas City }}</ref> Pop's career received a boost from his relationship with Bowie when Bowie decided in 1972 to produce an album with Pop in England. With James Williamson  signed on as guitarist, the search began for a [[rhythm section]]. However, since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England, they decided to re-unite The Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmark ''[[Raw Power]]''. After its release [[Scott Thurston]] was added to the band on keyboards/electric piano and Bowie continued his support, but Pop's [[Drug abuse|drug problem]] persisted. The Stooges' last show in 1974 ended in a fight between the band and a group of [[motorcycling|bikers]], documented on the album ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' Drug abuse stalled his career again for several years.

=== Bowie and Berlin: 1976–1978 ===

[[File:Iggy-Pop 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Iggy Pop, October 25, 1977 at the State Theatre in Minneapolis]]

After the second breakup of The Stooges, Pop made some recordings with James Williamson, but these were not released until 1977 (as ''[[Kill City]]'', credited jointly to Pop and Williamson). Pop was unable to control his [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and checked himself into a [[mental institution]], [[UCLA]]’s neuropsychiatric institute, to try to clean up. Bowie was one of his few visitors there, and he continued to support his friend and collaborator. In 1976, Bowie took him along as his companion on the ''[[Station to Station]]'' tour. This was Pop's first exposure to large-scale professional touring and he was impressed, particularly with Bowie's work ethic. On March 21, 1976, Bowie and Pop were arrested together for [[marijuana]] possession in [[Rochester, New York]], although charges were later dropped.

Bowie and Pop relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions. In 1977, Pop signed with [[RCA Records]] and Bowie helped write and produce ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]'' and ''[[Lust for Life (album)|Lust for Life]],'' Pop's two most acclaimed albums as a solo artist, the latter featuring one of Pop's best-known songs "[[The Passenger (song)|The Passenger]]". ''[[Lust for Life (album)|Lust for Life]]'' also featured another team of brothers, [[Hunt Sales|Hunt]] and [[Tony Fox Sales]], sons of comedian [[Soupy Sales]]. Among the songs Bowie and Pop wrote together were "[[China Girl (song)|China Girl]]", "[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]", and "[[Red Money|Sister Midnight]]", all of which Bowie performed on his own albums later on (the last being recorded with different lyrics as "[[Red Money]]" on the album ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''). Bowie also played keyboards in Pop's live performances, some of which are featured on the album ''[[TV Eye Live 1977|TV Eye Live]]'' in 1978. In return, Pop contributed backing vocals on Bowie's ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''.

=== Arista albums: 1979–1981 ===
[[File:IggyPop1979.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Iggy Pop, Cardiff, 1979]]
Pop had grown dissatisfied with RCA, later admitting that he had made ''TV Eye Live'' as a quick way of fulfilling his three-album RCA contract. He moved to [[Arista Records]], under whose banner he released ''[[New Values]]'' in 1979. This album was something of a Stooges reunion, with James Williamson producing and latter-day Stooge [[Scott Thurston]] playing guitar and keyboards. Not surprisingly, the album's style harkened back to the guitar sound of the Stooges. Although highly regarded by many Iggy fans (some preferring it to the Bowie collaborations), ''New Values'' was not a popular success.

The album was moderately successful in Australia and New Zealand, however, and this led to Pop's first visit there to promote it. While in Melbourne, he made a memorable appearance on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s nationwide pop show ''[[Countdown (music show)|Countdown]]''. During his anarchic performance of "I'm Bored", Pop made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was [[lip-synch]]ing (shoving the microphone down his pants at one point), and he even tried to grab the teenage girls in the audience. He was also interviewed by host [[Ian Meldrum|Ian "Molly" Meldrum]], an exchange which was frequently punctuated by the singer jumping up and down on his chair and making loud exclamations of "G'day mate" in a mock [[Australian accent]]. His ''Countdown'' appearance is generally considered one of the highlights of the show's history and it cemented his popularity with Australian punk fans; since then he has often toured there. While visiting New Zealand, Pop recorded a music video for "I'm Bored", and attended a record company function where he appeared to slap a woman and throw wine over a photographer.<ref>''The Dominion'', July 16, 1979. "Iggy Pop sets tour scene" by Jane Clifton</ref> While in Australia, Pop was also the guest on a live late-night commercial TV interview show on the [[Ten Network]]. It is not known whether a recording of this interview exists, but the famous ''Countdown'' appearance has often been re-screened in Australia.

During the recording of ''[[Soldier (album)|Soldier]]'' (1980), Pop and Williamson quarreled over production (the latter apparently wanted a big, [[Phil Spector]]-type sound) and Williamson was fired. Bowie appeared on the song "Play it Safe", performing backing vocals with the group [[Simple Minds]]. The album and its follow-up ''[[Party (Iggy Pop album)|Party]]'' (1981) were both commercial failures, and Pop was dropped from Arista. His drug habit varied in intensity, but persisted.

=== 1980s ===
[[File:Iggy Pop - pinkpop87.jpg|thumbnail|right|Iggy Pop at The [[Pinkpop Festival]] in 1987]]
In 1980, Pop published his autobiography ''I Need More'', co-written with Anne Weher, an Ann Arbor arts patron. The book, which includes a selection of black and white photographs, featured a foreword by Andy Warhol. Warhol wrote that he met Iggy when he was Jim Osterberg, at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1966. "I don't know why he hasn't made it really big," Warhol wrote. "He is so good."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The 1982 album ''[[Zombie Birdhouse]]'' on [[Chris Stein]]'s Animal label, with Stein himself producing, was no more commercially successful than his Arista works, but again, in 1983, Pop's fortunes changed when David Bowie recorded a cover of the song "China Girl". The song had originally appeared on ''The Idiot'', and was a major hit on Bowie's blockbuster ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' album. As co-writer of the song, Pop received substantial [[royalties]]. On ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' in 1984, Bowie recorded two more of their co-written songs, this time from the ''Lust for Life'' album, "Tonight" and "Neighborhood Threat", assuring Pop financial security, at least for the short term. The support from Bowie enabled Pop to take a three-year break, during which he overcame his resurgent heroin addiction and took acting classes.

Additionally, Pop contributed the title song to the 1984 film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' (with [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], previously of the [[Sex Pistols]], on guitar, and [[Nigel Harrison]] and [[Clem Burke]], both of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] on bass and drums) as well as an instrumental called "Repo Man Theme" that was played during the opening credits.

In 1985, Pop recorded some demos with Jones. He played these demos for Bowie, who was sufficiently impressed to offer to produce an album for Pop: 1986's [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced ''[[Blah Blah Blah (Iggy Pop album)|Blah Blah Blah]]'', featuring the single
"[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)|Real Wild Child]]", a cover of "The Wild One", originally written and recorded by Australian rock 'n' roll musician [[Johnny O'Keefe]] in 1958. The single was a Top 10 hit in the UK and was successful around the world, especially in Australia, where for 20 years it has been used as the theme music for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s late-night music video show ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]''. ''Blah Blah Blah'' was Pop's highest-charting album in the U.S. since ''The Idiot'' in 1977, peaking at No. 75 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums chart.

Also in 1985, Pop and [[Lou Reed]] contributed their singing voices to the animated film ''[[Rock & Rule]]''. Pop performed the song "Pain & Suffering" in the final sequence of the film.<ref>{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Casey |title=Rock & Rule |url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/reviews/n-s/rockandrule83.htm |accessdate=July 1, 2007}}</ref>

In 1987, Pop appeared (along with [[Bootsy Collins]]) on a mostly instrumental album, ''[[Neo Geo (album)|Neo Geo]]'', by Japanese composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]. The music video for "Risky", written and directed by Meiert Avis, won the first ever MTV Breakthrough Video Award. The groundbreaking video explores [[wikt:transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[FM-2030]]'s ideas of ''Nostalgia for the Future'' in the form of an imagined love affair between a robot and one of [[Man Ray]]'s models in Paris in the late 1930s. Additional inspiration was drawn from [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Edvard Munch]]'s 1894 painting ''Puberty'', and [[Roland Barthes]] ''[[Death of the Author]]''. The surrealist black-and-white video uses stop motion, light painting, and other retro in-camera effects techniques. Meiert Avis recorded Sakamoto while at work on the score for ''The Last Emperor'' in London. Sakamoto also appears in the video painting words and messages to an open shutter camera. Iggy Pop, who performs the vocals on "Risky", chose not to appear in the video, allowing his performance space to be occupied by the surrealist era robot.

Pop's follow-up to ''Blah Blah Blah'', ''[[Instinct (Iggy Pop album)|Instinct]]'' (1988), was a turnaround in musical direction. Its stripped-back, guitar-based sound leaned further towards the sound of the Stooges than any of his solo albums to date. His record label dropped him, but the ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour|King Biscuit]]'' radio show recorded the ''Instinct'' tour (featuring guitarist [[Andy McCoy]] and [[Alvin Gibbs]] on bass) in Boston on July 19, 1988. Working with rock attorney Stann Findelle, Pop scored more movie soundtrack inclusions in 1989: "Living on the Edge of the Night" in the [[Ridley Scott]] thriller ''[[Black Rain (American film)|Black Rain]]''; and "Love Transfusion", a song originally written by [[Alice Cooper]] (who does backing vocals) and [[Desmond Child]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evenspot.com/html.folder/CDreview/AC_Soundtrack/Shocker.html |title=Alice Cooper Soundtracks |publisher=Evenspot.com |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref> in ''[[Wes Craven's Shocker]]''.

=== 1990s and early 2000s ===

In 1990, Pop recorded ''[[Brick by Brick]]'', produced by [[Don Was]], with members of [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[The B-52's]] as guests, as well as backup vocals by many local Hollywood groups, two of whom ([[Whitey Kirst]] and [[Craig Pike]]) would create his band to tour and perform on his ''Kiss My Blood'' video (1991), directed by [[Tim Pope]] and filmed at the Olympia in Paris. The video attracted much controversy, as it featured much footage of Pop performing with his penis exposed to the audience. The album was his first Gold-certified album in the U.S. (denoting sales of over 500,000 copies) and featured his first Top 40 U.S. hit, "[[Candy (Iggy Pop song)|Candy]]", a duet with B-52's singer [[Kate Pierson]].

Also in 1990, Pop starred in the controversial opera ''The Manson Family'' by composer [[John Moran (composer)|John Moran]], released on Point Music/Phillip Classics, where he sang the role of prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]]. That year he also contributed to the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s AIDS benefit album [[Red Hot + Blue]] project, singing a version of "[[Well Did You Evah! (1990)|Well Did You Evah!]]" in a duet with [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]].

In the early to middle 1990s, Pop would make several guest appearances on the [[Nickelodeon]] show ''[[The Adventures of Pete and Pete]]''. He played James Mecklenberg, Nona Mecklenberg's father.

In 1991, Pop and Kirst contributed the song "Why Was I Born (Freddy's Dead)" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]''. The song also plays over the end credits of the film, with a compilation of clips from the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series running alongside the end credits. In the same year, Pop sang a leading role in the [[John Moran (composer)|John Moran]] opera ''The Manson Family''.

In 1992, he collaborated with [[Goran Bregović]] on the [[Arizona Dream (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the movie ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' by [[Emir Kusturica]]. Pop sang four of the songs: ''In the Deathcar'', ''TV Screen'', ''Get the Money'', and ''This is a Film''. Also in 1992, he collaborated with the New York City band [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]. He recorded spoken word vocals on the intro and outro of the song "[[Black Sunshine]]" as well as playing the character of a writer in the video shot for the song. He is singled out for special thanks in the liner notes of the band's album ''[[La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One]]''.

In 1993, Pop released ''[[American Caesar (album)|American Caesar]]'', including two successful singles, "Wild America" and "Beside You". The following year Pop contributed to [[Buckethead]]'s album ''[[Giant Robot (Buckethead album)|Giant Robot]]'', including the songs "Buckethead's Toy Store" and "Post Office Buddy". He appears also on the [[Les Rita Mitsouko]] album ''[[Système D]]'' where he sings the duet "My Love is Bad" with [[Catherine Ringer]].

In 1996, Pop again found mainstream fame when his 1977 song "[[Lust for Life (song)|Lust for Life]]" was featured in the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. A new video was recorded for the song, with clips from the film and studio footage of Pop dancing with one of the film's stars, [[Ewen Bremner]]. An Iggy Pop concert also served as a plot point in the film. The song has also been used in TV commercials for [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] and as the theme music to ''[[The Jim Rome Show]]'', a nationally syndicated American sports talk show.

In 1996, Pop released ''[[Naughty Little Doggie]]'', with Whitey Kirst returning on guitar, and the single "I Wanna Live". In 1997, he [[remix]]ed ''Raw Power'' to give it a rougher, more hard-edged sound; fans had complained for years that Bowie's official "rescue effort" mix was muddy and lacking in bass. Pop testified in the reissue's liner notes that on the new mix, "everything's still in the red". He co-produced his 1999 album ''[[Avenue B (album)|Avenue B]]'' with [[Don Was]], releasing the single "Corruption".

In 1997, Pop was credited with the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Brave]]''.

On January 1, 1998, Pop made a guest appearance on [[Paramount Television]]'s science fiction series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. Pop played a [[Vorta]] in an episode based upon the movie ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', entitled "[[The Magnificent Ferengi]]". Pop also contributed the theme song for "[[Space Goofs]]".

Pop supplied vocals for the 1999 [[Death in Vegas]] UK Top-10 single ''Aisha''. The same year he appeared on Hashisheen, The End Of Law, a collaborative effort by [[Bill Laswell]], reading on the tracks ''The Western Lands'' and ''A Quick Trip to Alamut''. He also sang on the tracks "[[Rolodex Propaganda]]" and "Enfilade" by [[At the Drive-In]] in 2000.

For New Year's Eve 1997, Pop was the headliner for the annual Australian three-day concert the Falls Festival. He gave one of the most memorable performances in the history of the festival. A member of the audience got to do the countdown for the new year with Pop as part of a competition to guess Pop's new year's resolution (it was "To do nothing and make a lot of money!").

Pop produced 2001's ''[[Beat 'Em Up]]'', which gave birth to [[The Trolls]], releasing the single "Football" featuring Trolls alumni Whitey Kirst and brother Alex.

=== The Stooges reunion: 2003–present ===

Pop's 2003 album ''[[Skull Ring]]'' featured collaborators [[Sum 41]], [[Green Day]], [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], and [[The Trolls]], as well as Ron and Scott Asheton, reuniting the three surviving founding members of [[The Stooges]] for the first time since 1974. Pop made a guest appearance on [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]]'s song ''Kick It'' as well as the video. Also in 2003, his first full-length biography was published. ''Gimme Danger – The Story of Iggy Pop'' was written by Joe Ambrose; Pop did not collaborate on the biography or publicly endorse it. Having enjoyed working with the Ashetons on ''Skull Ring'', Pop reformed The Stooges with bassist [[Mike Watt]] (formerly of [[The Minutemen (band)|the Minutemen]]) filling in for the late [[Dave Alexander (musician)|Dave Alexander]], and ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'' saxophonist [[Steve Mackay]] rejoining the lineup. They have toured regularly since 2004. That year, Pop opened [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''Reinvention'' World Tour in Dublin.

Iggy and The Stooges played the Glastonbury Festival in June 2007. Their set included material from the 2007 album ''The Weirdness'' and classics such as "No Fun and "I Wanna Be Your Dog."

According to guitarist Ron Asheton, Madonna asked The Stooges to perform in her place, as a protest to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for not inducting The Stooges despite six appearances on the nomination ballot.<ref name="freep.com">Brian McCollum {{Wayback |date=20080314021804 |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080310/ENT04/80310062/&imw=Y |title=Why the Stooges performed for Madonna}}. freep.com (March 10, 2008)</ref> Pop also sang on the "No Fun" cover by [[Asian Dub Foundation]] on their 2008 album ''[[Punkara]]''.

He describes this new release as a "quieter album with some jazz overtones", the first single off the album, "King of the Dogs", bearing a sound strongly influenced by [[New Orleans jazz]] musicians such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Jelly Roll Morton]]. Pop said that the song was his response to being "sick of listening to idiot thugs with guitars banging out crappy music". The album is available on legal download sites, CD, and a Deluxe Boxset is available at only 6000 units worldwide.
