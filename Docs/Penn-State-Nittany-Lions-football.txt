==Traditions==

===Nittanyville===
"Nittanyville", originally known as Paternoville, is the name attributed to the student tradition of camping out in front of Beaver Stadium prior to a home football game. Each week before a home game, students camp out in front of the stadium in order to hold their positions in line for front-row seats. Football players, the [[Penn State Blue Band|Blue Band]], local food vendors and even the coaching staff frequently visit Nittanyville, pepping up the students as game days draw near. Nittanyville is governed by the student-run Nittanyville Coordination Committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paternoville Coordination Committee|url=http://www.clubs.psu.edu/up/paternoville/index.html|accessdate=Oct 10, 2011}}</ref> The tradition was established during the 2005 football season, when students began setting up tents and "camping" in front of Beaver Stadium one week before the game with rival school [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] on October 8.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Paternoville|url=http://www.clubs.psu.edu/up/paternoville/about.html|accessdate=Oct 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Success with Honor===
Joe Paterno was widely known for his "grand experiment" in which he challenged his players to be successful both on the field and in the classroom. In 2011, the Nittany Lion football team posted an 87% graduation rate, tied with Stanford for No. 10 overall among the nation's 120 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, above the national average of 67%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110211aaa.html |title=Penn State Football Tied For Best Graduation Success Rate Among BCS/AP Top 25 Teams|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=The Official Home of the Penn State Nittany Lions |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref>

The June 2012 conviction of former assistant coach [[Jerry Sandusky]] on multiple counts of child sexual abuse marred the "Success with Honor" image.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/06/23/juror-sandusky-lacked-emotion-confirming-correct-verdict/#ixzz1zMjaPKhU |title=Juror: Sandusky lacked emotion, confirming correct verdict |publisher=Fox News |date= June 23, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref> President Rodney Erickson, athletics director Dave Joyner, and head football coach Bill O'Brien, all of whom accepted their jobs in the wake of the scandal, have made statements in which they express commitment to maintaining integrity at the university and within the athletics programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackshoediaries.com/2012/7/23/3177470/erickson-joyner-obrien-release-statements |title=Erickson, Joyner, O'Brien Release Statements |publisher=Black Shoe Diaries |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref>

In 2012, a group of alumni and supporters established a non-profit organization (501.c.3 and registered trademark) that will build upon the "Success with Honor" motto. Their mission is to promote and support charitable endeavors as well as to inspire others to "Get in the Game." Success with Honor is a Social Network Community that has identified more than 60+ charities. Success with Honor helps individuals to identify and connect with causes they’d like to volunteer their skills, time, and/or money to. Similarly, SWH assists charities in finding individuals to meet their current needs.<ref>http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2013/02/01/Success_with_honor_alumni_group.aspx {{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref>

[[File:UVA v. Penn State, Sep. 8 2012.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Nittany Lions playing against the [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia Cavaliers]] in 2012 at [[Scott Stadium]]: note the simple uniforms of the Nittany Lions during their away games.]]

===Uniform===
The team is widely noted for their simple game uniforms. They only wear white pants, and the jerseys are simple blue for home games, and white for away games.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fornelli|title=Penn State making uniform change|url=http://college-football.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/24156338/27656427|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> The team is only allowed to wear simple black [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes with white calf socks for game days, though blue tights are permitted underneath the white socks for cold weather games. The helmet is white with a blue stripe down the center, and a blue on white "Penn State" sticker covers up the forehead helmet logo. No team logos, conference logos, numbers, or other stickers are permitted on the helmet, though two Nike logos are on facemask visors that some players choose to wear. Penn State has started to wear bowl decals only starting with [[1997 Fiesta Bowl (January)|1997 Fiesta Bowl]]. Before that, Penn State always declined the decals so they can play out of their simple game uniforms. The blue and white uniforms replaced pink and black ones in 1890.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studentblog.worldcampus.psu.edu/index.php/2009/10/bleed-pink-and-black/ |title=Bleed Pink and Black? &#124; Corner of College and Allen |publisher=Studentblog.worldcampus.psu.edu |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref>

The uniforms became even simpler for the 2011 season, as the white cuffs and collars on the home jerseys and the corresponding blue cuffs and collars on the road jerseys were eliminated, leaving the jerseys solid blue and white, respectively.

In 2012 Penn State started wearing names on their uniforms for the first time as a way to note the players who stuck with the school through the scandal and a blue ribbon in support the victims of child abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/colleges/Penn-State-to-add-names-to-back-of-football-jerseys.html |title=Penn State to add names to back of football jerseys |publisher=Philly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref>

In 2013 the Nittany Lion logo was added to the base of the jersey collar along with the Big Ten logo on the right side of the jersey.

Starting in 2015, the names that were added throughout the 2012–14 seasons to honor those who stayed with the program were removed and the team reverted to the traditional nameless jerseys while still retaining the Nittany Lion logo at the base of the jersey collar. The team also began sporting new Nike Elite 51 jerseys which feature a new design on the collars.<ref>http://www.gopsusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/071615aaa.html</ref> In addition, the team added the words Nittany Lions onto the back of the football helmets.

===Captains===
Captains are chosen by the team, with the head coach's approval. Being named a captain is an honor almost always given to a senior, but there are some notable exceptions: Linebacker [[Sean Lee]] was named a captain in the beginning of Spring practice in 2008, the beginning of his 4th year with the team. However, he suffered a torn ACL during spring practice, redshirted in 2008, and returned as a captain again in 2009. The most recent example of a "true" junior being named was [[Paul Posluszny]], who was named a captain in both 2005 and 2006, his junior and senior years, respectively. The last time a junior was named captain before Posluszny was in 1968, when [[Steve Smear]] and [[Mike Reid (singer)|Mike Reid]] were named captains during their junior years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hudson|first=Beth|title=PSU tri-captains bring a solid mix to the table|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2005-08-02/sports/3623814_1_posluszny-zemaitis-senior-quarterback-michael-robinson|accessdate=10 April 2013|newspaper=[[The Morning Call]]|date=2 August 2005|location=[[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]}}</ref>  In 2014, [[Christian Hackenberg]] became the first true sophomore to be named team captain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2014/08/13/4303432/penn-state-football-nittany-lions.html?sp=/99/116/|title=Community - CentreDaily.com|work=centredaily.com}}</ref>

===Linebacker U===
Penn State is often referred to as Linebacker U for its reputation of producing outstanding linebackers.

==Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal==
{{main|Penn State child sex abuse scandal}}

The [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal]] centered on then retired [[Pennsylvania State University]] football assistant coach [[Jerry Sandusky]]'s [[sexual assault]] of two underage boys on or near university property.  After an extensive [[grand jury]] investigation, Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation dating from 1994 to 2009, though some speculate the abuse may date as far back as the 1970s.<ref name=1970s>{{cite news|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/11/exclusive_jerry_sandusky_inter.html |title=Exclusive: Jerry Sandusky interview prompts long-ago victims to contact lawyer |author=Sara Ganim |work=[[The Patriot-News]] |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 21, 2011}}</ref> The trial of Jerry Sandusky on 52 charges of sexual crimes against children started on June 11, 2012, at the [[Centre County Courthouse]] in [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]]<ref name="Trial">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/sports/ncaafootball/jerry-sandusky-child-sexual-abuse-trial-begins.html?pagewanted=all |title=Sandusky's Trial Begins With Graphic Testimony|work=The New York Times|date=June 11, 2012|author=Belson, Ken|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name="contract">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/jerry-sandusky-trial-hears-victim-testify-years-sex/story?id=16539947#.T9hI4NWlWTU|title=Jerry Sandusky Offered Victim 4 a Contract to Keep Seeing Him|publisher=ABC News|date=June 11, 2012|author1=Curry, Colleen|author2=Avila, Jim|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref> and ended on the evening of June 22, 2012, when the jury found Sandusky guilty on 45 of the 48 counts against him.<ref name="apverdict">{{cite news|last1=Scolforo|first1=Mark|last2=Armas|first2=Genaro|title=Ex-Penn St. assistant Sandusky convicted of abuse|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PENN_STATE_ABUSE?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2012-06-22-22-18-58|accessdate=June 22, 2012|work=Associated Press|date=June 22, 2012}}</ref><ref name="NYT-guilty">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/sports/ncaafootball/jerry-sandusky-convicted-of-sexually-abusing-boys.html|title=Sandusky Convicted of Sexually Abusing Boys|last=Drape|first=Joe|date=June 22, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>

Several high-level school officials were charged with [[perjury]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Two Top Officials Step Down Amid Penn State Scandal|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2011/11/05/penn-state-ex-coach-others-charged-in-child-sex-case/|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=November 9, 2011|publisher=Fox News|date=November 7, 2011}}</ref> suspended, or dismissed for allegedly [[cover-up|covering up]] the incidents or failing to notify authorities. In the wake of the scandal, school president [[Graham Spanier]] was forced to resign, and head football coach [[Joe Paterno]] was fired without cause late in the season, while Sandusky maintained his innocence.<ref name="admission">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15730317 |title=Jerry Sandusky regrets showers with boys at Penn State |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |publisher=BBC News Online }}</ref>

Former [[FBI]] director [[Louis Freeh]], whose firm was hired by the Penn State Board of Trustees to conduct an independent investigation into the scandal, concluded, after, ostensibly, conducting over 400 interviews and reviewing over 3.5 million documents, that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Schultz had "repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky’s child abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large."<ref name="nyt-psu-child-abuse">{{cite news|title=Penn State’s Part|date=July 12, 2012|accessdate=July 13, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/opinion/penn-states-part-in-the-sandusky-sexual-abuse-scandal.html}}</ref><ref name="usa-psu-child-abuse">{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Kevin|last2=Marklein|first2=Mary Beth|title=Freeh report blasts culture of Penn State|date=July 13, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-07-12/louis-freeh-report-penn-state-jerry-sandusky/56181956/1|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/697dbG9uh|archivedate=July 13, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="psu-child-abuse">{{cite press release|title=Remarks of Louis Freeh in Conjunction with Announcement of Report Regarding the Pennsylvania State University|date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Kekst and Company|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/99901024/Freeh-Report-Release|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/697bWvS4B|archivedate=July 13, 2012|deadurl=no|quote=Although concern to treat the child abuser humanely was expressly stated, no such sentiments were ever expressed by them for Sandusky’s victims.}}</ref>  In an interview conducted by [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s [[60 Minutes Sports]], the former Chief Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Frank Fina, who investigated and prosecuted Jerry Sandusky, stated that he found no evidence that [[Joe Paterno]] participated in a cover-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-09-07/news/41836502_1_sandusky-prosecutor-jerry-sandusky-tim-curley|title=Sandusky prosecutor: Paterno not part of cover-up|work=Philly.com}}</ref>

On July 23, 2012, [[NCAA]] announced that it had fined the Penn State football program $60 million, levied a four-year ban from bowl games and vacated all of the program's 112 wins from 1998 to 2011. They were originally scheduled to lose 10 scholarships from the incoming classes in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, which would have been a loss of 40 total scholarships. They were set to have a maximum of 75 players on scholarship in 2013, then be down to 65 total scholarships for 2014, 2015 and 2016, before increasing back up to 75 in 2017 and return to a full allotment of 85 scholarships for the 2018 season.<ref name=USATodayNCAA>{{cite news|title=NCAA hands out severe punishment for Penn State|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/bigten/story/2012-07-23/ncaa-penn-state-punishment-sanctions/56427630/1|last=Prisbell|first=Eric|publisher=USA Today|date=July 22, 2012}}</ref>

However, on September 24, 2013, the NCAA announced they were restoring 25 of the 40 scholarships to Penn State. After losing 10 scholarships from the 2013–2014 incoming class (they only brought in 15 players instead of the normal 25) and only having 75 total players on scholarship, Penn State will have five scholarships added back for 2014–15, so they can bring in 20 new players and have 80 total players on scholarship. They will be back up to the full complement of 25 new players and 85 total scholarships restocked for 2016–17, two years ahead of schedule. So in total they will have only lost 15 scholarships, compared to the original penalty of 40 scholarships. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The NCAA’s executive committee unanimously approved giving back the scholarships, ostensibly after a recommendation from former U.S. Senator [[George J. Mitchell]], who was appointed by the NCAA to oversee Penn State’s progress in adopting a number of reforms to enhance its security, ethics, governance and compliance structure. NCAA officials said they took up the recommendation because the restored scholarships would benefit student-athletes.<ref name=CDTPennState>{{cite web|title=NCAA modifies sanctions against Penn State, restoring scholarships; may consider lifting bowl ban|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2013/09/24/3804708/breaking-penn-state-trustee-says.html|last=Dawson|first=Mike|publisher=Center Daily Times|date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>

Several lawsuits were filed against NCAA related to the levy of penalties.  In September 2014 the NCAA, under the auspices of favorable reports from Mitchell, announced that Penn State would be eligible for the 2014 postseason and all scholarships restored in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/11489258/ncaa-drops-postseason-ban-penn-state-nittany-lions|title=NCAA drops postseason ban of Penn State Nittany Lions|website=ESPN|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref> The team's wins and records that had previously been vacated due to the scandal were restored, pending full approval, as part of a legal settlement in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onwardstate.com/2015/01/16/paternos-wins-restored-and-consent-decree-replaced-in-corman-settlement/}|accessdate=2015-11-01|date=2015-01-16|first1=Zach|last1=Berger|publisher=Onward State|title=Corman Settlement: Paterno's Wins Restored and Consent Decree Replaced }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/12179571/joe-paterno-111-wins-were-vacated-restored|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=2015-11-01|date=2015-01-16|title=Joe Paterno is now winningest coach}}</ref>

===Conference championships===
Penn State played as an independent from 1887 through 1890.

On September 26, 1891, the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association (PIFA) was formed. The PIFA consisted of Bucknell, Dickinson, Franklin and Marshall, Haverford, Penn State and Swarthmore. Penn State won the championship with a 4–1–0 PIFA record losing only to Bucknell (Bucknell's record was 3–1–1). The PIFA dissolved prior to the 1892 season.

Penn State then played as an independent again until joining the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 1990 and beginning play in 1993.

==Rivalries==

===Michigan State===
Since 1993, Penn State played [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] for the [[Land Grant Trophy]]. Michigan State currently holds possession of the trophy after winning the 2015 contest. Penn State has a 13–7 record in these trophy games. The series is tied 14–14–1. Beginning with the league's expansion and new division format in 2011, the two teams were in different divisions and did not play annually, however this [[Michigan State–Penn State football rivalry|series]] renewed in the 2014 season and continue yearly as they will both be in the Big Ten's Eastern Division.

===Minnesota===
[[File:Taking the field.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Nittany Lions taking the field against Minnesota in 2005.]]
Since 1993, Penn State has played [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] for the Governor's Victory Bell sporadically in their Big Ten schedule. Penn State led 8–5 against the Golden Gophers after the last contest in which Minnesota won 24–10 in 2013.

Due to the latest changes in the Big Ten's scheduling procedures, the [[Minnesota–Penn State football rivalry|series]] will be held approximately two times every seven years starting in 2014; this will change to three times every seven years when the Big Ten adds another conference game effective 2016. Penn State will next play Minnesota in the 2016 football season.

===Pittsburgh===
The [[Penn State–Pittsburgh football rivalry]] is a currently dormant series between in-state rivals Penn State and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]. Once considered the fiercest and most important college football rivalry north of the [[Mason–Dixon line]], this rivalry was first played in 1893 when Penn State won 32–0. The most recent game in the series was played in 2000 with Pitt winning 12–0 over Penn State at [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. Penn State holds a 50–42–4 record in the series <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/penn_state/opponents_records.php?teamid=2581|title=Penn State vs Pittsburgh (PA)|accessdate=October 21, 2008|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse}}</ref>

Of the 96 games played between the two, 72 have been held in Pittsburgh. Twenty-two have been played in State College. Two games, in 1900 and 1901, were played in [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]].

Pitt and Penn State are scheduled to renew their rivalry with a 4-game home-and-home series starting in 2016 and continuing through 2019. The first and third games of the series will be played at [[Heinz Field]] in Pittsburgh, in 2016 and 2018, with the second and fourth games taking place in 2017 and 2019 at Beaver Stadium in State College.

===Ohio State===
The [[Ohio State–Penn State football rivalry|Penn State and Ohio State rivalry]] began before Penn State was a member of the Big Ten. The first four meetings in the series were stretched out over the course of 53 seasons between 1912 and 1964 which Penn State won all of. Then Ohio State won in 1975 in a game held in Columbus, Ohio and again in 1976 during the first ever match-up between the two teams in State College, Pennsylvania. Penn State and Ohio State would meet again in 1980 in their first and only postseason bowl, the 1980 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State won. After the Fiesta Bowl, the two teams would not meet again until Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993. Since then, the Nittany Lions and Buckeyes have played each other annually. The official record of the series is 16–13, with Ohio State leading the series.

===West Virginia===
Penn State and [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] have played each other 59 times. The first game was in 1904 when Penn state won that game 34-0. This series has been dominated by the Nittany Lions while leading the series 48-9-2. The two teams announced on September 19, 2013 that a home and home series has been scheduled for 2023 and 2024.

==Charity and awareness efforts==
The Penn State football team has worked in coordination with Uplifting Athletes, a non-profit organization, to raise awareness and funds for the Kidney Cancer Association. In 2003 the team turned their annual weight-lifting competition into a fund-raiser when a player's father was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer. The event that is now known as Lift for Life, has raised more than $225,000 since its inception.{{when|date=December 2015}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pennstate.upliftingathletes.org |title=Penn State Uplifting Athletes |publisher=Scott Shirley, Uplifting Athletes |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080821103116/http://www.pennstate.upliftingathletes.org/ |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=December 2015}}
