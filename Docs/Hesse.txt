'''Hesse''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|s}} or '''Hessia''' ('''{{lang-de|Hessen}}''' {{IPA-de|ˈhɛsn̩|}}, [[Hessian dialect]]: ''Hesse'' {{IPA-de|ˈhɛzə|}}) is a [[German states|federal state (''Land'')]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], with just over six million inhabitants. The state capital is [[Wiesbaden]]; the largest city is [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Until the formation of the [[German Reich]] in 1871, Hesse was an independent country ruled by a Grand Duke ([[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]). Due to divisions after World War II, the modern federal state does not cover the entire [[cultural region]] of Hesse which includes both the State of Hesse and the area known as [[Rhenish Hesse]] (Rheinhessen) in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].

The English name "Hesse" originates in the [[Hessian dialects]]. The variant "Hessia" comes from the medieval [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Hassia''. The German term ''Hessen'' is used by the European Commission because their policy is to leave regional names untranslated (paragraphs 1.31 & 1.35).<ref>European Commission English Style Guide, [http://ec.europa.eu/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf]</ref> The term "Hesse" ultimately derives from a Germanic tribe called the [[Chatti]], who settled in the region in the first century B.C. An inhabitant of Hesse is called a '''Hessian''' (German: ''Hesse'' (masculine) or ''Hessin'' (feminine)). The [[synthetic element]] [[hassium]], number 108 on the [[periodic table]], is named after the state of Hesse.

==History==
{{Main|History of Hesse}}

As early as the Danne's period, the Central Hessian region was inhabited. Due to the favorable climate of the location, people lived there about 50,000 years ago during the last glacial period, as burial sites show from this era. Finds of paleolitical tools in southern Hesse in Rüsselsheim suggest Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago.
The Züschen tomb (German: Steinkammergrab von Züschen, sometimes also Lohne-Züschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between Lohne and Züschen, near Fritzlar, Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (''hessisch-westfälische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important megalithic monuments in Central Europe. Dating to the late fourth millennium BC (and possibly remaining in use until the early third), it belongs to the Late Neolithic Wartberg culture.

An early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-fifth-century BC [[La Tène]] style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the first century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.

The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in de Jannis, and in the Jannis directly on the eastern outskirts of de Jannis was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year 9 AD. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in 69 AD.

In the early Middle Ages, a Frankish ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]'' comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]] and a Saxon one further north were known as [[Hessengau]]. In the 9th century, the Saxon Hessengau also came under the rule of the Franconians. In the 12th, century it was passed to [[Thursday]] (1247–64), Hesse gained its independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[France]].

The Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720–1785) ruled as a benevolent despot, 1760-1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760-1785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by renting out 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776-1783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were rented out elsewhere, as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.

===19th century===
The ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].
[[File:HessenD1844.jpg|thumb|130px|Arms of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]
[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gießen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.

===20th century===
The revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself "[[Volksstaat Hessen]]" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended WWI in 1919.

After [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Groß-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. On December 4, 1946 Groß-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |format= |work= }}</ref>

==Geography==
{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}
[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|230px|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]

Situated in west-central Germany, Hesse state borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

The principal cities of Hesse include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gießen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]] in the greater [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]], [[Fulda]] in the east, and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the north.

The most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rhön]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Knüll]] and the [[Spessart]].

Most of the population of Hesse is in the southern part in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one old arm – the so-called Alt-Rhein – runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.

Hesse is the greenest state in Germany.<ref name="HesseGeography">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> Forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name="HesseGeography"/>

==Administration of the State of Hesse==
Hesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the Hessian government in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspräsidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].

===Districts===
The state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gießen (region)|Gießen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area. The administrative regions have no legislature of their own, but are executive agencies of the state government.

===Rhenish Hesse===
The province of Rhenish Hesse ({{lang-de|Rheinhessen}}) refers to the part of the former Grand Duchy of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] located west of the [[Rhine]]. It has not been part of the State of Hessen since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].  It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the "land of the thousand hills". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.

==State symbols and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Hesse}}

Hessen has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, interrupted by a 12-year episode from 1933 until 1945 during the [[Nazi dictatorship]]. The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal cempetences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hessen is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SDP). However, due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.

===Head of State===
As Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the "Minister President" (German:'' Ministerpräsident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]]. In the framework of the German federation, the [[President of Germany]] is ''[[de facto]]' Hesse's head of state.

===Most recent state election===
Although the government under Minister-President Volker Bouffier (CDU) lost some votes in the 2014 state elections, he could form a government with the Green Party as the conservative CDU's coalition partner. Hesse is the first German state with a coalition government formed by the conservative CDU and the leftist Green party. In the current [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag'') the conservative CDU holds a 47 seats, the centre-left SPD 37 seats, the leftist Green party 14 seats and the liberal FDP as well as the socialist party "Die Linke" each six seats.
[[File:Hessischer Landtag 2014–2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament according to the 2014 elections]]

===Foreign affairs===
As a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hessen operates representation offices in foreign countries such as the USA, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.  [http://www.hessen-yaroslavl.de/dynasite.cfm?dsmid=15154] Retrieved June 30, 2014</ref>

===Flag and anthem===
The flag colors of Hesse are red and white; its coat of arms shows a standing lion. These symbols are in line with the state symbols of the former Grand Duchy of Hesse. The official anthem of Hesse is called "''[[Hessenlied]]''" ("Song of Hesse") and was written by Albrecht Brede (music) and Carl Preser (lyrics).

==Culture==
The southern parts of Hesse were deeply influenced by the fact that they belonged to the Grand Duchy of Hessen, an independent country until 1871, while the northern region of what is today the State of Hessen was strongly influenced by [[Prussia]]. Darmstadt which was the capital city of Hessen until 1945, the city from which the Grand Dukes of Hesse ruled the country, was influenced by British and Russian imperial architecture due to close family ties of the Grand Duke's family to the dynasties of [[London]] and [[Sankt Petersburg]].

===Language===
The Hessian people have always spoken a variety of German, a [[Rhine Franconian]] dialect, known as ''[[Hessian dialects|Hessisch]]''.

[[File:Fulda - Stadtpfarrkirche St. Blasius.jpg|thumb|200px|View of the Stadtpfarrkirche St. Blasius in [[Fulda]].]]
In 2013 [[Christianity]] was the most popular religion in the state (67%).<ref name="integrationskompass.de"/> 40% of the Hessians belonged to the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]] or [[Evangelical Church of Hesse Electorate-Waldeck]] (members of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]), 25% adhered to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], while other Christians constituted some 2%. The remaining one third of the Hessian population were [[Muslims]] or belonged to other faiths, or were unaffiliated. Acknowledged as a legal entity under public law in Hesse, the [[Ahmadiyya]] is the first Islamic community in all of Germany to be recognized as such.<ref name=welt>[http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article117076904/Der-Islam-gehoert-nun-offiziell-zu-Deutschland.html Der Islam gehört nun offiziell zu Deutschland] (Islam is a part of Germany now, quoting a famous speech of President [[Christian Wulff]], by Freia Peters, Die Welt 2013</ref> The continental [[Baha'i]] House of Worship for Europe is located in the village of Langenhain in the town of Hofheim near Frankfurt.

===Fine arts===
Hesse has always been a place where the fine arts could flourish{{CN|date=August 2015}}. The former state capital [[Darmstadt]] has been a centre of [[art nouveau]] and modern architecture since 1914, [[Frankfurt am Main]] is cultural centre of international magnitude and northern Hesse city of [[Kassel]] is home of the "dokumenta art exhibition". Hesse has four major opera houses, the most important being [[Oper Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main Opera House]]. Through its Cultural Investment Programme, Hesse supports the renovation and promotion of historical sites and it promotes the ''documenta'', a world-wide art exhibition held every five years in Kassel. The Hessian Ministry of the Arts supports numerous independent cultural initiatives, organisations, and associations as well as artists from all fields including music, literature, theatre and dance, cinema and the new media, graphic art, and exhibitions. International cultural projects aim to further relations with our European partners.<ref>State of Hessen Website - Art and Culture [https://wissenschaft.hessen.de//ueber-uns/welcome-our-website/art-and-culture] Retrieved July 21, 2015</ref>

==TV and radio stations==
The Hessian state broadcasting corporation is called HR ([[Hessischer Rundfunk]]). HR is a member of the federal [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] broadcasting association. HR provides a statewide TV programme as well as a range of regional radio stations (HR&nbsp;1, HR&nbsp;2, HR&nbsp;3, HR&nbsp;4, you&nbsp;fm and HR&nbsp;info). Besides the state run HR, privately run TV stations exist and are an important line of commerce. Among the commercial radio stations that are active in Hesse Hit Radio FFH, Planet Radio, Harmony FM, Radio BOB and Main FM are the most popular.

==Economy==
With Hesse's largest city [[Frankfurt am Main]] being home of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Bundesbank|German Bundesbank]] and the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], Hesse is home to the financial capital of mainland Europe. Furthermore, Hesse has always been one of the largest and healthiest economies in Germany. Its [[GDP]] in 2013 exceeded 236 billion Euros (about 316 bn US$).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|title=Bruttoinlandsprodukt | publisher = Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt | year=2012 |work=Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnungen |accessdate=27 March 2013|language=de}}</ref> This makes Hesse itself one of the largest economies in Europe and the 38th largest in the world.<ref>See the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)]].</ref> According to GDP-per-capita figures, Hesse is the wealthiest State (after the [[City-state]]s [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]) in Germany with approx. $52.500 US.

The [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]] has the second largest industrial density in Germany after the [[Ruhr area]]. The main economic fields of importance are the [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries with [[Sanofi]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], [[Heraeus]], [[Messer Griesheim]] and [[Degussa]]. In the mechanical and automotive engineering field [[Opel]] in Rüsselsheim is worth mentioning. Frankfurt is crucial as a [[financial center]], with both the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]'s headquarters located there. Numerous smaller banks and [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Commerzbank]], [[KfW|KfW Bank]], [[DZ Bank]]  are also headquartered in Frankfurt, with the offices of several international banks also being housed there. Frankfurt is also the location of the most important German stock exchange, the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. [[Insurance]] companies have settled mostly in [[Wiesbaden]]. The city's largest private employer is the [[R+V Versicherung]], with about 3,900 employees, other major employers are [[Winterthur Group|DBV-Winterthur]], the [[SV SparkassenVersicherung]] and the [[Delta Lloyd Group]]. The leather industry is predominantly settled in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]]. [[Frankfurt Airport]] is the largest employer in Germany with more than 70.000 employees. Companies with an international reputation are located outside the Rhine-Main region in [[Wetzlar]].. There the center of the optical, electrical and precision engineering industries [[Esselte Leitz GmbH & Co KG|Leitz]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Minox]], Hensoldt ([[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]]) and [[Buderus]] and [[Brita]] with several plants in central Hesse. In the east [[Fulda]] there is the rubber plant ([[Fulda Reifen]]). In northern Hesse, in [[Baunatal]], [[Volkswagen AG]] has a large factory that manufactures spare parts. [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] has a large plant that manufactures [[Locomotive]]s in [[Kassel]].

In August 2008 there were 199,573 people unemployed in Hesse. The unemployment rate is thus 6.4% (August 2007: 7.6%). With 3.8% the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] has the lowest rate, while the independent city of Kassel has the highest rate nationally with 12.1%.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Traffic and public transportation==
Hesse has one of the best transportation networks in Europe. Many trans-European and German motorways, high-speed train, and waterways lines cross Hesse. [[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

=== Road transport ===
Hesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to the airport of Frankfurt is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main. During the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]]. The effect is that the motorways have four lanes in each direction. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.

=== Railway transport ===
Hesse has access to many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[Köln–Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne–Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover–Würzburg high-speed railway|Hanover–Würzburg]]. Besides, other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The region around Frankfurt has the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]] with an extensive [[S-Bahn]]-network, which is complemented many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. In the northern part of Hesse exists since 2007 the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].

=== Air transport ===
[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year and among the world's ten largest. Not far from the Airport towards the south is the [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] which is frequented by [[general aviation]] planes. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. Situated in Northern Hesse [[Kassel Calden Airport]], whose expansion is planned, has however only regional importance. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], uses [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base. The airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbor state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].

==Death penalty==
The Hessian constitution was written in 1946, and Article 21 permitted the use of the death penalty.<ref>[http://lawww.de/hlv/Aktuell/hv_text.htm#21 Hessian constitution] (in German)</ref> But all uses of capital punishment in Germany are forbidden by the 1949 Federal ''[[Grundgesetz]]'' (basic law), which supersedes all state laws such as the Hessian constitution by the principle of ''"Bundesrecht bricht Landesrecht"'' ('Federal law breaks state law').<ref>[http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/rechtsgrundlagen/grundgesetz/gg_09.html Grundgesetz] (in German)</ref>

=== Public discussion in Hesse ===
There is still public discussion in Hesse about removing the now useless text concerning death penalty from the Hessian constitution: Some citizens think that Article 21 of the Hessian constitution should be removed as they see it unfit in a modern-time democracy. Removing the death penalty from the Hessian constitution, however, requires a referendum in Hesse. [[Bavaria]] held a referendum in 1998 and successfully removed the law concerning death penalty from its constitution, and the [[Saarland]] removed the passage concerning the death penalty upon reunion with Germany in 1956.
