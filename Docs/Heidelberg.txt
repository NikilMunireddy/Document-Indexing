'''Heidelberg''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaɪdəlbɛʁk|-|Heidelberg.ogg}}) is a city situated on the river [[Neckar]] in south-west [[Germany]]. The fifth-largest town in the [[States of Germany|State]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] after [[Stuttgart]], [[Karlsruhe]], [[Mannheim]] and [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], Heidelberg is part of the densely populated [[Rhine-Neckar|Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region]]. In 2011, over 149,000 people lived in the city.

A former residence of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heidelberg is the location of [[Heidelberg University]], contemporary Germany's oldest and among its most reputable universities. Heidelberg is a popular [[tourism|tourist destination]] due to its [[Romanticism|romantic]] and picturesque cityscape, including [[Heidelberg Castle]] and the [[baroque|baroque style]] Old Town.

==Geography==
[[File:Heidelberg-luftbild-aerial-photograph.jpg|thumb|right|Heidelberg with suburbs]]
Heidelberg is in the [[Rhine Rift Valley]], on the left bank of the lower part of the Neckar in a steep valley in the [[Odenwald]]. It is bordered by the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königsstuhl]] (568&nbsp;m) and the [[Gaisberg (Heidelberg)|Gaisberg]] (375&nbsp;m) mountains. The Neckar here flows in an east-west direction. On the right bank of the river, the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] mountain rises to a height of 445 meters. The Neckar flows into the [[Rhine]] approximately 22 kilometres north-west in [[Mannheim]]. Villages incorporated during the 20th century stretch from the Neckar Valley along the Bergstraße, a road running through the [[Odenwald]] hills.

Heidelberg is on [[European walking route E1]] ([[Sweden]]-[[Umbria]]).[[File:Heidelberg Stadtteile 2012.svg|thumb|right|The districts of Heidelberg]]
[[File:Altstadt Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Altstadt'' from the Castle]]
[[File:Heidelberg_from_the_K%C3%B6nigstuhl.jpg|thumb|Heidelberg seen from [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]].]]

===Flora and fauna===
Since Heidelberg is among the warmest regions of Germany, plants atypical of the [[Central Europe|central-European]] climate flourish there, including [[almond]] and [[Common fig|fig trees]]; there is also an [[olive tree]] in ''Gaisbergstraße''. Alongside the ''Philosophenweg'' (Philosophers' Walk) on the opposite side of the Old Town, [[winegrowing]] was restarted in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hilfe-hd.de/rohrbach/wein.htm |title=Heidelberg-Rohrbach: Wein, Reben und Winzer |publisher=Hilfe-hd.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>

There is a wild population of African [[rose-ringed parakeet]]s,<ref>Stefanie Wegener: ''Verbreitung und Arealnutzung der Halsbandsittiche (Psittacula krameri) in Heidelberg'', published by: Ornithologische Gesellschaft Baden-Württemberg e.&nbsp;V., [http://www.ogbw.de/doc/Abstract_WegenerSittiche.pdf Ornithol. Jh. Bad.-Württ. 23: 39–55 (2007)]</ref> and a wild population of [[Siberia]]n [[swan goose|swan geese]], which can be seen mainly on the islands in the [[Neckar]] near the district of Bergheim.

===Administrative structures===
Heidelberg is a [[Unitary authority#Germany|unitary authority]] within the Regierungsbezirk Karlsruhe. The [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]] rural district surrounds it and has its seat in the town, although the town is not a part of the district. Heidelberg is a part of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, often referred to as the [[Rhein-Neckar-Triangle|Rhein-Neckar Triangle]]. This region consists of the southern part of the [[States of Germany|State]] of [[Hessen]], the southern part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (''Vorderpfalz''), the administrative districts of [[Mannheim]] and Heidelberg, and the southern municipalities of the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]. The Rhein-Neckar Triangle became a European [[metropolitan area]] in 2005.

Heidelberg consists of 15 districts distributed in six sectors of the town. In the central area are Altstadt (the Old Town), [[Heidelberg-Bergheim|Bergheim]] and Weststadt; in the north, Neuenheim and Handschuhsheim; in the east, [[Heidelberg-Ziegelhausen|Ziegelhausen]] and Schlierbach; in the south, [[Heidelberg-Südstadt|Südstadt]], Rohrbach, Emmertsgrund, and Boxberg; in the southwest, [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]; in the west, Pfaffengrund, Wieblingen, and a new district, named ''Bahnstadt'', is built on land in Weststadt and Wieblingen. The new district will have approximately 5,000–6,000 residents and employment for 7,000.

===Neighbouring communes===
The following towns and [[commune]]s border the city of Heidelberg, beginning in the west and in a clockwise direction: [[Edingen-Neckarhausen]], [[Dossenheim]], [[Schriesheim]], [[Wilhelmsfeld]], [[Schönau (Odenwald)|Schönau]], [[Neckargemünd]], [[Bammental]], [[Gaiberg]], [[Leimen (Baden)|Leimen]], [[Sandhausen]], [[Oftersheim]], [[Plankstadt]], [[Eppelheim]] (all part of the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]) and [[Mannheim]].

===Climate===
Heidelberg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), defined by the protected valley between the Pfälzerwald and the Odenwald. Year-round, the mild temperatures are determined by maritime air masses coming from the west. In contrast to the nearby [[Upper Rhine Plain]], Heidelberg's position in the valley leads to more frequent easterly winds than average. The hillsides of the Odenwald favour clouding and precipitation. The warmest month is July, the coldest is January. Temperatures often rise beyond {{convert|30|°C|0}} in [[midsummer]]. According to the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|German Meteorological Service]], Heidelberg was the warmest place in Germany in 2009.<ref>Mechthild Henneke: ''Wetterextreme in Deutschland 2009''. In: ''[[Südkurier]]'', 28. April 2010</ref><ref>''Kreisbeschreibung Bd. 1'', S. 54ff</ref><ref>[http://www.klimadiagramme.de/Deutschland/heidelberg2.html www.klimadiagramme.de]</ref>

==History==
[[File:Heidelberg_nachts.jpg|thumb|Heidelberg on the Neckar at night.]]
[[File:Heidelberg Hauptstraße 207.jpg|thumb|Karlsplatz and Neckar with Old Bridge.]]

===Early history===
Between 600,000 and 200,000 years ago{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, "[[Homo heidelbergensis|Heidelberg Man]]" died at nearby [[Mauer (Baden)|Mauer]]. His jaw bone was discovered in 1907. Scientific dating determined his remains as the earliest evidence of human life in Europe. In the 5th century BC, a [[Celts|Celtic]] fortress of refuge and place of worship were built on the ''Heiligenberg'', or "Mountain of Saints". Both places can still be identified. In 40 AD, a fort was built and occupied by the 24th Roman cohort and the 2nd [[Cyrenaican]] cohort (CCG XXIIII and CCH II CYR). The Romans built and maintained ''[[castra]]'' (permanent camps) and a signal tower on the bank of the [[Neckar]]. They built a wooden bridge based on stone pillars across it. The camp protected the first civilian settlements that developed. The Romans remained until 260 AD, when the camp was conquered by [[Germanic people|Germanic tribes]].

===Middle Ages===
Modern Heidelberg can trace its beginnings to the fifth century. The village ''Bergheim'' ("Mountain Home") is first mentioned for that period in documents dated to 769 AD. ''Bergheim'' now lies in the middle of modern Heidelberg. The people gradually converted to Christianity. In 863 AD, the [[monastery]] of [[St. Michael]] was founded on the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] inside the double rampart of the Celtic fortress. Around 1130, the Neuberg Monastery was founded in the Neckar valley. At the same time, the bishopric of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] extended its influence into the valley, founding [[Schönau Abbey]] in 1142. Modern Heidelberg can trace its roots to this 12th-century monastery. The first reference to Heidelberg can be found in a document in [[Schönau Abbey]] dated to 1196. This is considered to be the town's founding date. In 1155, Heidelberg castle and its neighboring settlement were taken over by the house of [[Hohenstaufen]]. [[Conrad of Hohenstaufen]] became [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Pfalzgraf bei Rhein}}). In 1195, the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] passed to the [[House of Welf]] through marriage. [[File:Carl Blechen 003.jpg|left|thumb|[[Heidelberg Castle]], here shown in a painting by [[Carl Blechen]], was destroyed by the French during the war of succession of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]]][[File:Heidelberger_Schloss_-_Flickr_-_cspannagel_(2).jpg|left|thumb|View of castle from the Corn Market]] In 1225, [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria]] acquired the Palatinate, as a consequence of which the castle came under his control. By 1303, another castle had been constructed for defense. In 1356, the Counts Palatine were granted far-reaching rights in the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], in addition to becoming [[Prince-elector|Electors]]. In 1386, [[Heidelberg University]] was founded by [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine]].

===Modern history===
Heidelberg University played a leading part in the era of humanism and the Reformation, and the conflict between Lutheranism and Calvinism, in the 15th and 16th centuries. Heidelberg's library, founded in 1421, is the oldest existing public library in Germany. In April 1518, a few months after proclaiming his 95 Theses, [[Martin Luther]] was received in Heidelberg, to defend them. In 1537, the castle located higher up the mountain was destroyed by a gunpowder explosion. The duke's palace was built at the site of the lower castle. [[File:Belagerung Heidelbergs C-L 205.jpg|thumb|The siege of Heidelberg 1622]]
[[Elector Frederick III]], sovereign of the [[Electoral Palatinate]] from 1559 to 1576, commissioned the composition of a new Catechism for his territory. While the catechism's introduction credits the "entire theological faculty here" (at the [[University of Heidelberg]]) and "all the superintendents and prominent servants of the church" for the composition of the catechism, Zacharius Ursinus is commonly regarded as the catechism's principal author. [[Caspar Olevianus]] (1536–1587) was formerly asserted as a co-author of the document, though this theory has been largely discarded by modern scholarship. [[Johann Sylvan]], [[Adam Neuser]], Johannes Willing, [[Thomas Erastus]], Michael Diller, Johannes Brunner, Tilemann Mumius, Petrus Macheropoeus, Johannes Eisenmenger, [[Immanuel Tremellius]] and [[Pierre Boquin]] are all likely to have contributed to the Catechism in some way. Frederick himself wrote the preface to the Catechism and closely oversaw its composition and publication. Frederick, who was officially Lutheran but had strong Reformed leanings, wanted to even out the religious situation of his highly Lutheran territory within the primarily Catholic [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[Council of Trent]] had just concluded with its conclusions and decrees against the Protestant faiths, and the [[Peace of Augsburg]] had only granted toleration for [[Lutheranism]] within the empire where the ruler was Lutheran. One of the aims of the catechism was to counteract the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as Anabaptists and "strict" [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] like [[Tilemann Heshusius]] and [[Matthias Flacius]], who were resisting Frederick's Reformed influences, particularly on the matter of Eucharist ([[the Lord's Supper]]). The Catechism-based each of its statements on biblical proof-texts, and Frederick himself would defend it as biblical, not reformed, at the 1566 Diet of Augsburg when he was called to answer to charges of violating the Peace of Augsburg. This was the [[Heidelberg Catechism]], officially called the ″Catechism, or Christian Instruction, according to the Usages of the Churches and Schools of the Electoral Palatinate.″
[[File:2002-04-02_Hauptstra%C3%9Fe,_Heidelberg_IMG_0404.jpg|thumb|Main street Heidelberg.]]
In November 1619, the royal crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]]. (He was married to [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], eldest daughter of [[James VI and I]] of Scotland and England, respectively.) Frederick became known as the "Winter King", as he reigned for only one winter before the Imperial [[House of Habsburg]] regained the crown by force. His overthrow in 1621 marked the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1622, after a [[Siege of Heidelberg (1622)|siege of two months]], the armies of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], commanded by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], captured the town. Tilly gave the famous ''[[Bibliotheca Palatina]]'' from the [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] to the Pope as a present. The Catholic Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach gained control over the Palatinate and the title of Prince-Elector. In 1648, at the end of the war, Frederick V's son [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]], was able to recover his titles and lands.

Urbain de Maillé-Brézé fought in many battles and participated in the Siege of La Rochelle (1627–1628). In 1635, he conquered Heidelberg and Speyer, together with Jacques-Nompar de Caumont, duc de la Force, at the head of the Army of Germany.

To strengthen his dynasty, Charles I Louis arranged the marriage of his daughter [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Liselotte]] to [[Philip I, Duke of Orléans]], brother of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], king of France. In 1685, after the death of Charles Louis' son, Elector [[Charles II, Elector Palatine|Charles II]], Louis XIV laid claim to his sister-in-law's inheritance. The Germans rejected the claim, in part because of religious differences between local Protestants and the French Catholics, as the [[Protestant Reformation]] had divided the peoples of Europe. The [[War of the Grand Alliance]] ensued. In 1689, French troops took the town and castle, bringing nearly total destruction to the area in 1693. As a result of the destruction due to repeated French invasions related to the [[War of the Palatinate Succession]] coupled with severe winters, thousands of Protestant German Palatines emigrated from the lower Palatinate in the early 18th century. They fled to other European cities and especially to London (where the refugees were called "the poor Palatines"). In sympathy for the Protestants, in 1709–1710, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne's]] government arranged transport for nearly 6,000 Palatines to New York. Others were transported to [[Pennsylvania]], and to [[South Carolina]]. They worked their passage and later settled in the English colonies there.
[[File:Alte Bruecke Heidelberg von Konrad Linck 1788.jpg|thumb|Old Bridge, Konrad Linck, 1788.]]

In 1720, after assigning a major church for exclusively Catholic use, religious conflicts with the mostly Protestant inhabitants of Heidelberg caused the Roman Catholic Prince-Elector [[Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine|Charles III Philip]] to transfer his residence to nearby [[Mannheim]]. The court remained there until the Elector [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]] became [[Rulers of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] in 1777 and established his court in [[Munich]]. In 1742, Elector Charles Theodore began rebuilding the Palace. In 1764, a lightning bolt destroyed other palace buildings during reconstruction, causing the work to be discontinued.

===1803 to 1933===
Heidelberg fell to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] in 1803. [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden]], re-founded the university, named "Ruperto-Carola" after its two founders. Notable scholars soon earned it a reputation as a "royal residence of the intellect". In the 18th century, the town was rebuilt in the Baroque style on the old medieval layout.

In 1810, the [[French revolution]] refugee Count Charles Graimberg began to preserve the palace [[ruins]] and establish a historical collection. In 1815, the Emperor of [[Austria]], the Emperor of [[Russia]] and the King of [[Prussia]] formed the "[[Holy Alliance]]" in Heidelberg. In 1848, the German National Assembly was held there. In 1849, during the Palatinate-Baden rebellion of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolutions]], Heidelberg was the headquarters of a revolutionary army. It was defeated by a Prussian army near Waghaeusel. The city was occupied by Prussian troops until 1850. Between 1920 and 1933, Heidelberg University became a center of notable physicians Czerny, Erb, and Krehl; and humanists Rohde, Weber, and Gandolf.

===Nazism and the war period===
[[File:Heidelberg_Alte_Br%C3%BCcke_Tor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Bridge (Heidelberg)|Old Bridge Gate]].]]
During the Nazi period (1933–1945), Heidelberg was a stronghold of the [[NSDAP]], (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) the strongest party in the elections before 1933 (the NSDAP obtained 30% at the communal elections of 1930<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|pp=209–10}})</ref>). The NSDAP received 45.9% of the votes in the [[German federal election, March 1933|German federal election of March 1933]] (the national average was 43.9%).<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|p=229}})</ref> Non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]] university staff were discriminated against. By 1939, one-third of the university's teaching staff had been forced out for racial and political reasons. The non-Aryan professors were ejected in 1933, within one month of Hitler's rise to power. The lists of those to be deported were prepared beforehand.{{vague|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 1934 and 1935, the ''Reichsarbeitsdienst'' (State Labor Service) and Heidelberg University students built the huge ''Thingstätte'' amphitheatre on the ''Heiligenberg'' north of the town, for [[Nazi Party]] and [[SS]] events. A few months later, the inauguration of the huge Ehrenfriedhof memorial cemetery completed the second and last NSDAP project in Heidelberg. This cemetery is on the southern side of the old part of town, a little south of the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]] hilltop. During WWII and after, [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers were buried there.
[[File:Synagogue Memorial Stone, 1 Lauerstrasse, Heidelberg.JPG|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the synagogue in the Lauerstrasse]]
During the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' on November 9, 1938, Nazis burned down synagogues at two locations in the city. The next day, they started the systematic deportation of Jews, sending 150 to [[Dachau concentration camp]]. On October 22, 1940, during the "Wagner Buerckel event", the Nazis deported 6000 local Jews, including 281 from Heidelberg, to [[Camp Gurs]] concentration camp in France. Within a few months, as many as 1000 of them (201 from Heidelberg) died of hunger and disease.<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|pp=246–8}}</ref> Among the deportees from Heidelberg, the poet [[Alfred Mombert]] (1872–1942) left the camp in April 1941 thanks to the Swiss poet Hans Reinhart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/blb/blbhtml/besondere-bestaende/nachlaesse/mombert.php |title=Alfred Mombert |work=Badische Landesbibliothek |language=German}}</ref> From 1942, the deportees who had survived internment in Gurs were deported to Eastern Europe, where most of them were murdered.

On March 29, 1945, German troops left the city after destroying three arches of the old bridge, Heidelberg's treasured river crossing. They also destroyed the more modern bridge downstream. The U.S. Army (63rd Infantry, 7th Army) entered the town on March 30, 1945. The civilian population surrendered without resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kleine Heidelberger Stadtgeschichte|last=Fink|first=Oliver|year=2005|isbn=978-3-7917-1971-9|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

A popular belief is that Heidelberg escaped bombing in WWII because the U.S. Army wanted to use the city as a garrison after the war. As Heidelberg was neither an industrial center nor a transport hub, it did not present a target of opportunity. Other notable university towns, such as [[Tübingen]] and [[Göttingen]], were spared bombing as well. Allied air raids focused extensively on the nearby industrial cities of [[Mannheim]] and [[Ludwigshafen]].
[[File:The 289th Engineer Combat Battalion ferrying troops and vehicles over the Neckar River at Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|[[United States Army|US Army]]  [[289th Engineer Combat Battalion (United States)|289th Engineer Combat Battalion]] ferrying troops and vehicles over the [[Neckar]] at Heidelberg.]]The U.S. Army may have chosen Heidelberg as a garrison base because of its excellent infrastructure, including the Heidelberg-Mannheim [[Autobahn]] (motorway), which connected to the Mannheim-Darmstadt-Frankfurt Autobahn, and the U.S. Army installations in [[Mannheim]] and [[Frankfurt]]. The intact rail infrastructure was more important in the late 1940s and early 1950s when most heavy loads were still carried by train, not by lorry. Heidelberg had the untouched Wehrmacht barracks, the "Grossdeutschland Kaserne" which the US Army occupied soon after, renaming it the [[Campbell Barracks]].

===History after 1945===
In 1945, the university was reopened relatively quickly on the initiative of a small group of professors, among whom were the anti-Nazi economist [[Alfred Weber]] and the philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Remy|2002|page=240}}</ref> The surgeon Karl Heinrich Bauer was nominated rector.

On December 9, 1945, US Army General [[George S. Patton]] had a car accident in the adjacent city of Mannheim and died in the Heidelberg US Army hospital on December 21, 1945. The funeral ceremony was held at the Heidelberg-Weststadt ''Christuskirche'' (Christ Church), and he was buried in the 3rd Army cemetery in [[Luxembourg]].<ref>[[George S. Patton#Accident and death]]</ref>

During the post-war [[military occupation]], the [[U.S. Army]] used the ''[[Heidelberg Thingstätte|Thingsstätte]]'' for cultural and religious events. Civilian use started in the early to mid-1980s for occasional concerts and other cultural events. Today, the celebrations on ''Hexennacht'' ("Witches' Night"), also called [[Walpurgis Night]]), the night of April 30, are a regular "underground" fixture at the ''Thingstätte''. Thousands of mostly young people congregate there to drum, to breathe fire, and to juggle. The event has gained fame throughout the region, as well as a certain notoriety due to the amount of litter left behind.

==Population==
[[File:Heidelberg population.svg|thumb|Population growth]]

The population of the city of Heidelberg exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 1946. It is a city with an international population, including one of the largest American communities outside North America, but this is not analysed in the Heidelberg population statistics. At the end of December 2011, the city had 149,633 inhabitants with an official primary residence in Heidelberg (not including the soldiers and employees of the U.S. Army and their dependents, a total of about 20,000 people), a historic high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/SRDB/Tabelle.asp?01035050GE221000 |publisher=Statistical office of the state of Baden-Württemberg |title=Population of city of Heidelberg |accessdate=25 July 2012 |language=German}}</ref>

The following table shows the number of inhabitants within the boundaries of the city at the time. To 1833 they are mostly estimates, then census results or official updates of the statistical offices of the time or the city administration. The data refer from 1843 to the "local population", from 1925 to the resident population and since 1987 the "population at the site of their main dwelling." Prior to 1843 the population was determined by non-uniform collection procedures.

Since 2006, the ''Oberbürgermeister'' (lord mayor) of Heidelberg has been the independent Eckart Würzner. From 1990 to 2006, the mayor was Beate Weber (SPD).

The council consists of 40 volunteer members with the mayor as chairman. The council is directly elected for a term of five years. The task of the council is to decide with the mayor presiding all the affairs of the city. The council controls the city administration and oversees the enforcement of its decisions.

Heidelberg has always been a stronghold of the Greens. For the municipal elections in 2009, they split into the Green Alternative List and Alliance 90/The Greens and each ran their own lists. Together they gained 10 seats to become the strongest force for the first time.

After the election, the deputies of the Alliance 90/The Greens formed a coalition with generation.HD.
In September 2011 two members of the GAL Group joined the Alliance 90/The Greens, so now with generation.HD, they form the largest group in the council.

==Cityscape==

===The old town===
[[File:2002-04-02_Heidelberger_Rathaus_IMG_0388.jpg|thumb|right|The marketplace, with Town Hall on the right]][[File:Heidelberg_-_aus_dem_Schloss_1.jpg|thumb|right|Heidelberg's old city centre from the castle above]][[File:Deutschland Heidelberg Schloss.JPG|thumb|Heidelberg Castle with the Old Bridge in foreground, 2010.]][[File:Heidelberg winter.jpg|thumb|right|View from the castle during winter, 2014.]]

The "old town" ({{lang-de|link=no|Altstadt}}), on the south bank of the Neckar, is long and narrow. It is dominated by the ruins of [[Heidelberg Castle]], 80 metres above the Neckar on the steep wooded slopes of the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]] (''King's chair or throne'') hill.
*The Main Street (''Hauptstrasse''), a mile-long pedestrian street, running the length of the old town.
*The [[Old Bridge (Heidelberg)|old stone bridge]] was erected 1786–1788. A medieval bridge gate is on the side of the old town, and was originally part of the town wall. Baroque tower helmets were added as part of the erection of the stone bridge in 1788.
*The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] (''Heiliggeistkirche''), a [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] church in the marketplace of the old town.
*The Karls‘ gate (''Karlstor'') is a triumphal arch in honour of the Prince Elector Karl Theodor, located at Heidelberg's east side. It was built 1775–1781 and designed by Nicolas de Pigage.
*The house ''Zum Ritter Sankt Georg'' (Knight St. George) is one of the few buildings to survive the War of Succession. Standing across from the Church of the Holy Spirit, it was built in the style of the late [[Renaissance]]. It is named after the sculpture at the top.
*The ''Marstall'' (Stables), a 16th-century building on the Neckar that has served several purposes through its history. It is now a cafeteria for the university.

===Heidelberg Castle===
{{Main|Heidelberg Castle}}
[[File:Plan des Heidelberger Schlosses von Peter Friedrich von Walpergen um 1780.jpg|thumb|Historic map of [[Heidelberg Castle]]]]
[[File:Heidelberg_Schloss_Luftbild_2.JPG|thumb|right|Heidelberg Fortress.]]
The castle is a mix of styles from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]. Prince Elector Ruprecht III (1398–1410) erected the first building in the inner courtyard as a royal residence. The building was divided into a ground floor made of stone and framework upper levels. Another royal building is located opposite the Ruprecht Building: the Fountain Hall. Prince Elector Philipp (1476–1508) is said to have arranged the transfer of the hall's columns from a decayed palace of [[Charlemagne]] from [[Ingelheim]] to Heidelberg.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Prince Electors added two palace buildings and turned the fortress into a castle. The two dominant buildings at the eastern and northern side of the courtyard were erected during the rule of Ottheinrich (1556–1559) and Friedrich IV (1583–1610). Under Friedrich V (1613–1619), the main building of the west side was erected, the so-called "English Building".

The castle and its garden were destroyed several times during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the Palatine War of Succession. As Prince Elector Karl Theodor tried to restore the castle, lightning struck in 1764, and ended all attempts at rebuilding. Later on, the castle was misused as a quarry; stones from the castle were taken to build new houses in Heidelberg. This was stopped in 1800 by Count Charles de Graimberg, who then began the process of preserving the castle.

Although the interior is in Gothic style, the King's Hall was not built until 1934. Today, the hall is used for festivities, e.g. dinner banquets, balls and theatre performances. During the Heidelberg Castle Festival in the summer, the courtyard is the site of open air musicals, operas, theatre performances, and classical concerts performed by the Heidelberg Philharmonics.

The castle is surrounded by a park, where the famous poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann von Goethe]] once walked. The [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] [[funicular]] railway runs from Kornmakt to the summit of the Königstuhl via the castle.

===Philosophers' Walk===
On the northern side of the Neckar is located the Heiligenberg (''Saints' Mountain''), along the side of which runs the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), with scenic views of the old town and castle. Traditionally, Heidelberg's philosophers and university professors would walk and talk along the pathway. Farther up the mountain lie the ruined 11th-century [[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]], the smaller Monastery of St. Stephen, a Nazi-era amphitheater, the so-called Pagan's hole and the remains of an earthen [[Celts|Celtic]] [[hill fort]] from the 4th century BC.

({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}) towards the Old Town, with [[Heidelberg Castle]], [[Heidelberg Heiliggeist church|Heiliggeist Church]] and the Old Bridge.]]

===Heidelberg churches===
There are many historical churches in Heidelberg and its surroundings. The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] has been shared over the centuries since the [[Protestant Reformation]] by both Catholics and Protestants. It is one of the few buildings to survive the many wars during the past centuries. It was rebuilt after the French set fire to it in 1709 during the [[War of the Grand Alliance|War of the Palatinian Succession]]. The church has remains of the tombs and epitaphs of the past Palatinate electors. This Church stands in the ''Marktplatz'' next to the seat of local government. In 1720, Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine came into conflict with the town's Protestants as a result of giving the Church of the Holy Spirit exclusively to the Catholics for their use. It had previously been split by a partition and used by both congregations. Due to pressure by the mostly Protestant powers of Prussia, Holland, and Sweden, Prince Karl III Philip gave way and repartitioned the church for joint use. In 1936 the separating wall was removed. The church is now exclusively used by Protestants. Furthermore, there is the Catholic Church of the Jesuits. Its construction began in 1712. It was completed with the addition of a bell tower from 1866–1872. The church is also home to the Museum für sakrale Kunst und Liturgie (Museum of [[Ecclesiastical]] Arts). The oldest church in Heidelberg is the St. Peter's Church (now [[Lutheran]]). It was built some time during the 12th century.

===Universities and academia===
{{Main|Heidelberg University|List of University of Heidelberg people}}
[[File:Uni-Heidelberg Aula.jpg|thumb|left|Old university hall]]
[[File:Normal Uni-Bibliothek.jpg|thumb|The university library]]

Heidelberg is known for its institutions of higher education. The most famous of those is '''[[Heidelberg University]]'''. Founded in 1386, it is one of Europe's oldest institutions. In fact, Heidelberg is the oldest [[college town|university town]] of today's Germany. Among the prominent thinkers associated with the institution are [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Karl-Otto Apel]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. The campus is situated in two urban areas and several buildings. In numerous historical buildings in the old town there are the Faculties of the [[Humanities]], the [[Social Science]] and the Faculty of [[Jurisprudence|Law]]. The school of applied sciences is located in the ''Science Tower'' in Wieblingen. The Faculties of Medicine and [[Natural Science]] are settled on the Neuenheimer Feld Campus.

Since 1904 there has been a College of Educational Science, the ''Pädagogische Hochschule Heidelberg''; since 1979 there has been a college of Jewish Studies, the ''Hochschule für Jüdische Studien Heidelberg''. It comprises nine branches specializing on both religion and [[Judaism|Jewish culture]]. The [[Schiller International University]], a private American university is also represented with a campus in Heidelberg offering several undergraduate and graduate programs in the fields of International Business and International Relations and Diplomacy.

===Research===
[[File:EMBL_campus_Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings of [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] in Heidelberg, including the new Advanced Training Centre.]]

In addtition to the research centers and institutes of the university, there are numerous research institutions situated in the city of Heidelberg. Among them are the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL), [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO), the [[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ), [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research]], [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]], [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]], [[Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law]].

===Schools===
[[File:Fachhochschule_Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|SRH Hochschule Heidelberg is one of the oldest and largest private universities in Germany.]]
Heidelberg is home to 23 elementary schools. There are several institutions of secondary education, both public and private, representing all levels of the [[German school system]]. There are 14 [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s, with six of them private. With 52% of secondary students attending a Gymnasium, Heidelberg sits above the German average, perhaps because a large number of academics live in Heidelberg and its environs. They include the Kurfürst-Friedrich-Gymnasium ([[:de:Kurfürst-Friedrich-Gymnasium Heidelberg|German Wikipedia]]), Bunsen-Gymnasium ([[:de:Bunsen-Gymnasium Heidelberg|German Wikipedia]]), the Helmholtz-Gymnasium ([[:de:Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg|German Wikipedia]]), the Hölderlin-Gymnasium and the Elisabeth-von-Thadden-Schule. Then there are seven [[Realschule]], ten [[Hauptschule]] and nine [[vocational school]]s (the so-called ''[[Berufsschule]]''). In addition, there are several [[folk high schools]] with different specialisations.<ref>[http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html ] {{wayback|url=http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html |date=20110927044135 }}</ref> [[Heidelberg International School]] serves the local expatriate community.

==Economy==

===Tourism===
In 2004, 81.8% of people worked for service industries, including tourism. As a relic of the period of Romanticism, Heidelberg has been labeled a "Romantic town". This is used to attract more than 3.5 million visitors every year. Many events are organized to attract visitors.

===Industry===
Only 18% of employment is provided by industry. Printing and publishing are important enterprises;  nearby [[Walldorf]] is a center of the IT industry and [[SAP AG|SAP]] World Headquarters. Noted pen manufacturer [[Lamy]] has its headquarters and factory in Heidelberg-Wieblingen. [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]] has its headquarters here; its factory is located in Walldorf. Soft-drink company Wild-Werke, manufacturer of the [[Capri-Sonne]] ([[Capri-Sun]] in the U.S.) is located nearby in Eppelheim. Heidelberg is also home to the headquarters of HeidelbergCement, the world's second largest cement producer. The Company has its roots in the suburb of Leimen where one of its cement plants is still located. With its long Hauptstrasse, Heidelberg is a shopping destination for people from the surrounding smaller towns.
[[File:Heidelberger Druckmaschinen.jpg|thumb|right|Print Media Academy.]]

===Roads===
The [[Bundesautobahn 5|A 5 autobahn]] runs through the western outskirts of Heidelberg, connecting the region to [[Frankfurt am Main]] in the north and [[Karlsruhe]] to the south. The [[Bundesautobahn 656|A 656]] commences just west of the city, connecting Heidelberg with [[Mannheim]]. Both highways meet at Heidelberg autobahn intersection in the city of Heidelberg, and the A 656 connects to the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] at the Mannheim autobahn intersection, which connects to the east towards [[Stuttgart]].

Furthermore, the [[Bundesstraße 3|B 3]] (Frankfurt–Karlsruhe) runs north–south through the town, and the B 37 (Mannheim–[[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]]) runs east–west. Both meet in the city center at the Bismarckplatz. The [[Bundesstraße 535|B 535]] begin in the south of Heidelberg and runs to Schwetzingen.

====Tourist roads====
Heidelberg is located on four tourist roads: [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]], [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], [[Castle Road]], and Straße der Demokratie (Road of Democracy).

===Railways===
[[Heidelberg Central Station]] (Hauptbahnhof) is on the [[Rhine Valley Railway]] and is served by [[Intercity-Express]], [[EuroCity in Germany|Euro City]] trains. This station is served by the [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]].

===Public transport===
[[File:Stra%C3%9Fenbahnlinien_Heidelberg.png|thumb|Heidelberg tramway network.]]
[[File:Bergbahn Koenigstuhl Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terminus of the [[Heidelberger Bergbahn|funicular]] at [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]]]]

The main transport hub of Heidelberg is the Bismarckplatz. Several main thoroughfares of the city intersect here and one of the longest pedestrian streets in Europe, the Hauptstraße (main street) runs from here through the entire old town of Heidelberg. Heidelberg Central Station was nearby for many years, which was a combined terminal and through station. In 1955, it was moved about 1.5&nbsp;km further to the west, which removed the necessity for trains continuing to the south or from the south to the north to reverse. The new central station became the second major transport hub of Heidelberg.

Heidelberg has had a public transport service since 1883, when horse-drawn trams were established. Due to the rapidly rising patronage it was decided on 20 December 1901 to convert the [[Trams in Heidelberg|Heidelberg tramway network]] to electrical operation. On 16 March 1902, the first electric tram ran on Rohrbacher Straße, sharing use of the suburban tracks built by the ''Deutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'' in 1901 between Heidelberg and [[Wiesloch]]. Until the 1950s, the tram network was expanded a bit at a time. The rapidly growing popularity of car transport presented the operator of the trams with increasingly difficult problems and the tram network was gradually dismantled. It was not until 10 December 2006 that the network was extended again with the opening of a new tram line from [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]. Tram and bus services are now operated by [[Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr]] (RNV). Since 1989, all fares are set under a uniform scheme by the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar]] (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN). [[Carsharing]] increasingly provides a complement to public transport. More than 50 car-sharing stations are available to users in 12 of the 14 districts of Heidelberg offering a total of more than 100 cars.
[[File:Heidelberg Straßenbahn.jpg|thumb|Line 24 tram in Rohrbach]]

Since 14 December 2003, Heidelberg has been connected to the network of the [[Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn]], which opens up the entire Rhine-Neckar region, with lines connecting with the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], the [[Saarland]] and southern [[Hesse]].

The [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] (Heidelberg Mountain Railway) has run since 2005 with new cars on the lower part from Kornmarkt to Molkenkur and historic cars built in 1907 on the upper section of the [[funicular]] from Molkenkur to [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]]. It is one of the most popular means to reach [[Heidelberg Castle]]. The first plans for the funicular were drawn up in 1873. Due to a lack of funds was the first section of the funicular was not opened until 1890. In 2004, the upper section of the funicular was listed as part of the heritage of the state of Baden-Württemberg.

===United States military installations===
{{see also|United States Army Garrison Heidelberg}}
During World War II, Heidelberg was one of the few major cities in Germany not significantly damaged by Allied bombing. Situated in the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone]] of Germany, Heidelberg became the headquarters of the American forces in Europe. Several military installations remain, including [[Campbell Barracks]], the former Wehrmacht Grossdeutschland-Kaserne, where headquarters for several units are located. These include US Army, Europe ([[USAREUR]]) and [[NATO]]'s Component Command-Land Headquarters. (Until 2004, this was designated Joint Headquarters Centre, and before that, LANDCENT).
[[File:Behoerdenzentrum Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Behördenzentrum Heidelberg.]]
Campbell Barracks and [[Mark Twain Village]] are both in Südstadt; Patton Barracks is in nearby Kirchheim. Nachrichten Kaserne in Rohrbach is home to the former Heidelberg Army Hospital, now designated the Heidelberg Health Center. [[Patrick Henry Village]], the largest U.S. military housing area in the Heidelberg area, is west of Kirchheim. These installations, including Tompkins Barracks and Kilbourne Kaserne in nearby Schwetzingen, plus the Germersheim Depot, used to make up the U.S. Army Garrison Heidelberg. Tompkins Barracks is home to [http://www.imcom-europe.army.mil U.S. Army Installation Management Command Europe Region.] The Heidelberg U.S. Army Air Field (Heidelberg AAF) was converted to a<s>n</s> heliport (mostly Blackhawk Helicopters) after the NATO Kosovo campaign.

The children of [[United States Department of Defense]] employees based in Heidelberg tend to attend on-base schools operated by the DODDS-E (Department of Defense Dependents Schools&nbsp;– Europe). There are three schools of this kind: [[Heidelberg High School]] in Mark Twain Village (Mark Twain Elementary School closed at the completion of the 2010–2011 school year), and [[Heidelberg Middle School]] and Patrick Henry Elementary in Patrick Henry Village.<ref>[http://www.eu.dodea.edu/schools/index.php?dId=2 Our Districts and Schools] Dependents Schools Europe website, accessed: April 19, 2009</ref>

On October 19, 2009 the U.S. Army announced that it will be building new headquarters for USAREUR in [[Wiesbaden]]. The move from Heidelberg will take place in 2012 and 2013, and will be completed by 2014.<ref>[http://www.bw.eur.army.mil/news/HPpdf/2010/July_1_2010.pdf Heidelberg, Mannheim to close by 2015], HeraldPost Vol. 35 No. 38, accessed: October 22, 2011.</ref> By 2015 all United States forces will have moved out of Heidelberg. The barracks and the housing areas will be handed over to the German state for conversion to civilian use.

During the last weekend of April there is an annually organized half marathon. In the summertime there are the ''Frühlingsmesse'' on the Messeplatz (May) and Illumination of the castle and bridge with lights and fireworks take place. In September, on the last Saturday the ''Old Town Autumn Festival'' is held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heidelberg-aktuell.de/joomla/ |title=Veranstaltungen in Heidelberg: Heidelberg aktuell - Home |publisher=Heidelberg-aktuell.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}{{cite web|url=http://www.heidelberg-event.com/events/heidelberger-herbst/?lang=en}}</ref> It includes a Medieval Market, an arts and crafts market, a flea market, and music from Samba to Rock. During October or November there are the ''Heidelberger Theater Days'' and a [[jazz]] festival. Every year in November the [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg]] take place in the city, too. The festival presents arthouse films of international newcomer directors and is held jointly by both of the cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mannheim-filmfestival.com/ |title=Internationales FilmFestival Mannheim-Heidelberg &#124; |publisher=Mannheim-filmfestival.com |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> During Christmas there is a Christmas market throughout the oldest part of the city. A famous gift is the chocolate called Heidelberger ''Studentenkuss'' (student kiss).

===Cinemas===
The Karlstorkino offers an arthouse program, rare classics and feature films. Here, most films are shown in original version. The Harmonie Lux has had a rather mainstream Hollywood program before its closing in 2014, whilst the small independent cinemas Gloria & Gloriette as well as Kamera also show arthouse films, mostly in German versions. Plans for a new Luxor-Kino in the new district Bahnstadt, featuring both blockbusters and arthouse films, have been in the works since 2013 and the construction began in July, 2015.<ref>http://www.heidelberg24.de/heidelberg/heidelberg-bahnstadt-spatenstich-baubeginn-luxor-filmpalast-5295628.html</ref>

===Heidelberg Romanticism<!--movement names are capitalized (cf. 'German Romanticism'); 'Heidelberg Romanticism', 'Heidelberg romanticism', 'Heidelberg Romantics' and 'Heidelberg romantics' redirect here-->===
[[File:Carl Philipp Fohr 001.jpg|thumb|Romantic view of [[Heidelberg Castle]] ruins]]
Heidelberg was the centre of the epoch of ''Romantik'' ([[German Romanticism|Romanticism]]) in Germany. The phase after [[Jena Romanticism]] is often called '''Heidelberg Romanticism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (see also [[Berlin Romanticism]]). There was a famous circle of poets (the '''Heidelberg Romantics'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->), such as [[Joseph von Eichendorff]], [[Johann Joseph von Görres]], [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]], and [[Clemens Brentano]]. A relic of Romanticism is the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), a scenic walking path on the nearby Heiligenberg, overlooking Heidelberg.

The ''Romantik'' epoch of German philosophy and literature, was described as a movement against classical and realistic theories of literature, a contrast to the rationality of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It elevated medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be from the medieval period. It also emphasized folk art, nature and an epistemology based on nature, which included human activity conditioned by nature in the form of language, custom and usage.

===Old Heidelberg===
{{Further|Alt Heidelberg (play)}}

It was the basis for [[Sigmund Romberg]]'s 1924 operetta ''[[The Student Prince]]'' which was itself turned into a [[The Student Prince (film)|film of the same title]].

===I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg===
