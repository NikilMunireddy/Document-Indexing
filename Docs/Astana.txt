'''Astana''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|s|ˈ|t|ɑː|n|ə}},<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Definition of Astana in British and World English |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Astana |accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> {{IPAc-en|US|æ|s|ˈ|t|ɑː|n|ə}};<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Definition of Astana in US English |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Astana |accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> {{lang-kk|Астана}} {{IPA-kk|astaˈna||Kk-astana.ogg}}), is the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. It is located on the [[Ishim River]] in the north portion of Kazakhstan, within the [[Akmola Region]], though administrated separately from the region as a city with special status. The 2014 census reported a population of 835,153 within the city limits, making it the second largest city in Kazakhstan.<ref name="The population of Astana" />

Founded in 1830 as a settlement of ''Akmoly'' ({{lang-kk|Ақмолы}}) or ''Akmolinsky prikaz'' ({{lang-ru|Акмолинский приказ}}), it served as a defensive [[fortification]] for the [[Siberian Cossacks]]. In 1832 the settlement was granted a town status and renamed ''Akmolinsk'' ({{lang-ru|Акмолинск}}). On March 20, 1961 the city was renamed ''Tselinograd'' ({{lang-ru|Целиноград}}) to mark the city's evolution as a cultural and administrative center of the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]]. In 1992 it was renamed ''Akmola'' ({{lang-kk|Ақмола}}), the modified original name meaning "a white grave". On December 10, 1997 Akmola replaced [[Almaty]] as the capital of Kazakhstan. On May 6, 1998 it was renamed Astana, which means "the capital" in Kazakh.

Astana is a [[Planned community|planned city]], like [[Brasilia]] in Brazil, [[Canberra]] in Australia, and [[Washington, D.C.]] in the United States.<ref name="Astana">{{cite web|publisher=The Guardian |title=Astana, Kazakhstan: the space station in the steppes |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/08/astana-kazakhstan-space-station-steppes |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The master plan of Astana was designed by Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]].<ref name="Astana" /> As the seat of the [[Government of Kazakhstan]], Astana is the site of the [[Parliament of Kazakhstan|Parliament House]], the [[Supreme Court of Kazakhstan|Supreme Court]], the [[Ak Orda Presidential Palace]] and numerous government departments and agencies.

[[File:Akmolinsk Fortress Map.jpg|thumb|left|Akmolinsk Fortress map]]

The settlement of ''Akmoly'', also known as ''Akmolinsky prikaz'',{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} was established on the [[Ishim River]] in 1830 as the seat of an [[okrug]] by a unit of the [[Siberian Cossacks]] headed by [[Fyodor Shubin]].<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:"От центра окружного приказа до столицы Казахстана" (краткий исторический обзор истории столицы)|trans_title=From the centre of district order to the capital of Kazakhstan (short historical overview of the history of the capital) |url=http://www.uad.astana.kz/ru/node/41937 |publisher=Archive and Documentation Department of Astana |language=ru |accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref> The name was possibly given after a local landmark—''Akmola'' literally means "a white grave" in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]—although this theory is not universally accepted.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} In 1832, the settlement was granted town status and named ''Akmolinsk''.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} The fairly advantageous position of the town was clear as early as 1863 in an abstract from the Geographic and Statistical Dictionary of the [[Russian Empire]]. It describes how picket roads and lines connected this geographic centre to [[Kargaly]] in the East, [[Aktau|Aktau fort]] in the South and through [[Atbasar]] to [[Kokshetau|Kokchetav]] in the West. In 1838, at the height of the great national and liberation movement headed by [[Kenesary Khan]], Akmolinsk fortress was burned.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=Revolt of 1837—1847 under the leadership of khan Kenesary |url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/272|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> After the repression of the liberation movement, the fortress was rebuilt. On 16 July 1863, Akmolinsk was officially declared an [[uyezd|uyezd town]].<ref name="History of Astana">{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=History of Astana |url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/380|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> During the rapid development of the Russian capitalist market, the huge [[Saryarka — Steppe and Lakes of Northern Kazakhstan|Saryarka areas]] were actively exploited by the colonial administration. To draft Regulation governing the [[Kazakh steppe]] the Government of the [[Russian Empire]] formed Steppe Commission in 1865.<ref name="The social and economic relations in Kazakhstan in the second half of the XIX century">{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=The social and economic relations in Kazakhstan in the second half of the XIX century |url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/148|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> On 21 October 1868, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] signed a draft Regulation on governing [[Turgay Oblast (Russian Empire)|Turgay]], [[Ural Oblast (Russian Empire)|Ural]], [[Aqmola Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk]] and [[Semipalatinsk Oblast]]s.<ref name="The social and economic relations in Kazakhstan in the second half of the XIX century" /> In 1869, Akmolinsk external district and department were cancelled, and Akmolinsk became the centre of the newly established [[Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk Oblast]]. In 1879, Major General Dubelt proposed to build a railway between [[Tyumen]] and Akmolinsk to the Ministry of Communications of Russia. In the course of the first 30 years of its existence, the population of Akmola numbered a trifle more than 2,000 people. However, over the next 30 years the city's population increased by three times according to [[volost]]s and [[Human settlement|settlements]] of the Akmolinsk Oblast. In 1893, Akmolinsk was an [[uyezd]] with a 6,428 strong population, 3 [[church (building)|churches]], 5 [[school]]s and [[college]]s and 3 [[Factory|factories]].

During [[World War II]], Akmolinsk served as a route for the transport of engineering tools and equipment from evacuated [[plant]]s in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] located in the [[oblast]]s of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]]. Local industries were appointed to respond to war needs, assisting the country to provide the battle and home fronts with all materials needed. In the post-war years, Akmolinsk became a beacon of economic revival in the west of the [[Soviet Union]] ruined by the war. Additionally, many [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Russian-Germans]] were resettled here after being [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] under [[Joseph Stalin]] rule.<ref>{{Cite web|author=S. Kurmanova|title=Deportation of Volga Germans to Kazakhstan: Causes and Consequences|url=http://e-history.kz/media/upload/1488/2014/06/26/18cc9c944aa4adcf1f67b8f1f45826ca.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=e-history.kz|format=PDF}}</ref>

In the 1950s, Northern Kazakh SSR oblasts became a territory of the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]] led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], in order to turn the region into a second [[food grain|grain producer]] for the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Ian MacWilliam|title=In Virgin Lands, a Dream Ends|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1994/4/article/in-virgin-lands-a-dream-ends/213516.html|date=20 April 1994|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=The Moscow Times}}</ref> In December 1960, [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] made a resolution to create the Tselinniy Krai, which comprised five regions of the Northern Kazakh SSR oblasts.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=293}} [[Akmola Region|Akmolinsk Oblast]] was ceased to exist as a separate administrative entity.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=293}} Its districts were directly subordinated to the new [[krai]] administration, and Akmolinsk became the krai capital, as well as the administrative seat of the new Virgin Lands economic region.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=293}} On 14 March 1961, Khrushchev proposed to rename the city to name corresponding to its role in the Virgin Lands Campaign.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2010|p=739}} On 20 March 1961, the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR renamed Akmolinsk to ''Tselinograd''.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2010|p=739}} On 24 April 1961, the region was reconstituted as ''Tselinograd Oblast''.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=293}} In the 1960s, Tselinograd was completely transformed. In 1963, work on the first three new high-rise housing districts began.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=295}} In addition, the city received s number of new monumental public buildings, including the Virgin Lands Palace, a Palace of Youth, a House of Soviets, a new airport, and seceral sports venues.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=296}} In 1971, the Tselinniy Krai was abolished and Tselinograd became the centre of the oblast.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the consequent independence of Kazakhstan, the city's original form was restored in the modified form ''Akmola''.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} On 6 July 1994, the [[Mazhilis|Supreme Council of Kazakhstan]] accepted the decree "On the transfer of the capital of Kazakhstan".<ref name="Astana - the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan">{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=Astana – the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan |url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/378 |accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> After the capital of Kazakhstan was moved to Akmola on 10 December 1997, the city was consequently renamed Astana in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1298395.stm |title=Timeline: Kazakhstan |publisher=BBC News |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> On 10 June 1998, Astana presented as the capital internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akorda.kz/en/category/astana |title=Astana – the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan |publisher=Official site of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> On 16 July 1999, Astana was awarded the medal and title of the City of Peace by [[UNESCO]].<ref name="Astana - the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan" />

==Geography==

===Topography===

Astana is located in central Kazakhstan on the [[Ishim River]] in a very flat, semi-arid steppe region which covers most of the country's territory. It is at 51° 10′ north latitude and 71° 26′ east longitude, and the [[50th parallel north]] passes through the southern parts of the city. The city encompasses {{convert|722.0|sqkm|1}}. The elevation of Astana is {{convert|347|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Astana is in a spacious steppe landscape, in the transitional area between the north of Kazakhstan and the extremely thinly settled national centre, because of the Ishim River. The older boroughs lie north of the river, whilst the new boroughs are located south of the Ishim.

===Climate===
Astana is the second coldest capital city in the world after [[Ulan Bator|Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia]], a position formerly held by Canada's capital, [[Ottawa]], until Astana attained capital city status in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Mongolist|author=Brian White|title=Ulaanbaatar is the Coldest Capital |url=http://www.themongolist.com/blog/society/43-ulaanbaatar-is-the-coldest-capital.html|date=9 January 2013|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Canada.com |title=Still the third-coldest capital, despite balmy temperatures |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f23f6479-3274-493b-9f74-d8d8cb5418be|date=4 January 2007|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> Astana has an extreme continental climate with warm summers (featuring occasional brief rain showers) and long, very cold, dry winters. Summer temperatures occasionally reach {{convert|+35|C}} while {{convert|-30|to|-35|C}} is not unusual between mid-December and early March. The city also holds the record for the lowest air temperature ever recorded in Kazakhstan ({{convert|-51|C}}). Typically, the city's river is frozen over between the second week of November and the beginning of April. Astana has a well-deserved reputation among Kazakhs for its frequent high winds, the effects of which are felt particularly strongly on the fast-developing but relatively exposed Left Bank area of the city.

Overall, Astana has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''),<ref>[[commons:File:Asia Koppen Map.png|Updated Central, South, Southeast, and Eastern Asian and Siberian Map of the Köppen climate classification system.]]</ref> bordering on a semi-arid climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Cold semi-arid climate|BSk]]''). The average annual temperature in Astana is {{convert|+3.5|C}}. January is the coldest month with an average temperature of {{convert|-14.2|C}}. July is the hottest month with an average temperature of {{convert|+20.7|C}}.

===Situation with mosquitoes===
Astana is rich in water sources which results in number of breeding sites for mosquitoes. One of the examples is the Ishim river. There is also the flooding of basements due to the close to surface location of groundwater.<ref>Specialist for mosquitoes control can’t continue their work due to rains in capital. http://astana.gov.kz/en/modules/material/1976</ref> The heavy rainfall in August is also one of the sources of standing water. According to the report of epidemiologists, there are 4 types of mosquito in Astana.<ref>4 species of blood-sucking insects registered by entomologic control in the city. 
http://astana.gov.kz/en/modules/material/4920
</ref> There are 2 Anopheles (malaria), Aedes (Dengue fever and Zika virus) and Culex (West Nile virus) species. However, their subgenera is unknown; hence, it is difficult to predict whether these species can transmit vector-borne diseases. It was recorded that last case of malaria was about 40 years ago.<ref>Malaria mosquitoes spotted in Astana. https://en.tengrinews.kz/health/Malaria-mosquitoes-spotted-in-Astana-253417/</ref> The reasons for its eradication are unknown. Probably the living conditions were improved and also programm of mosquito control was started. 3 types of insecticides are used but the effect is short term. In addition, they cannot be sprayed during the rainfall . 
According to WHO since 2012 Kazakhstan was announced as malaria free zone.<ref>Kazakhstan. http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/vector-borne-and-parasitic-diseases/malaria/country-work/kazakhstan</ref> However, in 2014 there was found a mosquito of Anopheles claviger specie who can transmit malaria.<ref>Malaria mosquitoes spotted in Astana. https://en.tengrinews.kz/health/Malaria-mosquitoes-spotted-inAstana-253417//</ref> In Astana mostly Anopheles messeae are present.

==Demographics==
As of 4 September 2014, Astana has a population density of 958 people per km2 and a population of about 835,153,<ref name="The population of Astana" /> of which [[Kazakhs]], [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Tatars]] and [[Germans]] make up 65.2%, 23.8%, 2.9%, 1.7%, 1.5% respectively. Other ethnic groups make up 4.9% of Astana's population.

In 1999, Astana had a population of 281,000. The ethnic mix was about 30% [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] and 70% [[Russians|Russian]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Astana/Astana.html |title=Astana |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref>

By 2007, Astana's population has more than doubled since becoming the capital, to over 600,000, and it is estimated to top 1 million by 2030. Migrant workers&nbsp;– legal and illegal&nbsp;– have been attracted from across Kazakhstan and neighbouring states such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and Astana is a magnet for young professionals seeking to build a career. This has changed the city's demographics, bringing more ethnic Kazakhs to a city that formerly had a Slav majority. Astana's ethnic Kazakh population has risen to some 60%, up from 17% in 1989.<ref name="eurasianet.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav070907.shtml |title=Kazakhstan's Capital Holds a Lavish Anniversary Celebration |publisher=EurasiaNet.org |date=8 July 2007 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>

Many argue that a drive to attract ethnic Kazakhs northward was the key factor in shifting the capital, which was officially put down to lack of space for expansion in the former capital, Almaty, and its location in an earthquake zone.

According to preliminary figures, Astana had 700,000 inhabitants in late 2007. According to the 1999 Census, 40.5% of the population is Russian, 5.7% Ukrainian, 3.0% German, 2.6% Tatar, 1.8% [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] and 0.8% [[Poles|Polish]]. But at 41.8%, Kazakhs outnumbered Russians and were forming the largest ethnic group, while Ingush and Korean each accounted for 0.6%. Others, mostly Uzbeks, accounted for 3.8%.

==Economy==

Astana's economy is based on [[trade]], [[industrial production]], [[transport]], [[communication]] and [[construction]]. The city’s industrial production is mainly focused on producing [[List of building materials|building materials]], [[food]]stuff and [[mechanical engineering]].

Astana is the headquarters of [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned corporations]] such as  [[Samruk-Kazyna]], [[Kazakhstan Temir Zholy]], [[KazMunayGas]], [[KazTransOil]], [[Kazatomprom]], [[KEGOC]] and [[Kazakhtelecom]].

Astana is subdivided into three districts. [[Almaty District]] was created on 6 May 1998 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|21,054|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=off}} with a population of 375,938 people. The district has five villages. [[Yesil District]] was created on 5 August 2008 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|31,179|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=off}} with a population of 119,929 people. [[Saryarka District]] was created on 6 May 1998 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|19,202|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=off}} with a population of 339,286 people.

In April 1998, the [[Government of Kazakhstan]] asked architects and [[urban planner]]s of international renown to participate in a design competition for the new capital. On 6 October 1998, Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]] was awarded the First Prize.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}} Summary of Kurokawa's Proposal, since the 1960s, pleaded for the [[Paradigm shift]] from the age of the machine principle to the age of life principle.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}} His work is the embodiment of [[Metabolism (architecture)|Metabolism]] and Symbiosis, which are the two most important concepts of the age of life principle.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}} Kurokawa's proposal aimed to preserve and redevelop the existing city, and create a new city at the south and the east sides of the [[Ishim River]], enabling the Symbiosis of the History and the Future.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}}

North of the railway line, which crosses Astana in an east-west direction, are industrial and poorer residential areas. Between the railway line and the Ishim river is the city centre, where at present intense building activity is occurring. To the west and east are more elevated residential areas with parks and the new area of government administration to the south of the Ishim River. Here many large building projects are under way; for example, the construction of a diplomatic quarter, and a variety of different government buildings. By 2030, these quarters are to be completed. Astana's current chief planner, [[Vladimir Laptev]], wants to build a [[Berlin]] in a [[Eurasia]]n style. He has stated that a purely administrative capital such as [[Canberra]] is not one of his goals.
