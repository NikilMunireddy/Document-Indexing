'''Asturias''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ɑː|ˈ|s|t|ʊər|i|ə|s|,|_|ə|-|}}; {{IPA-es|asˈtuɾjas|lang}}; {{lang-ast|Asturies}} {{IPA-ast|asˈtuɾjes|}}), officially the '''Principality of Asturias''' ({{lang-es|Principado de Asturias}}<!-- {{IPA-es|pɾinθiˈpaðo ðe asˈtuɾjas|}} -->; {{lang-ast|Principáu d'Asturies}}<!-- {{IPA-ast|pɾinθiˈpaw ðasˈtuɾjes|}} -->), is an [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] in north-west [[Spain]]. It is coextensive with the [[provinces of Spain|province]] of Asturias, and contains some of the territory that was part of the larger [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. Divided into eight [[Comarcas of Asturias|''comarcas'']] (counties), the autonomous community of Asturias is bordered by [[Cantabria]] to the east, by [[Castile and León]] to the south, by [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to the west, and by the [[Bay of Biscay]] to the north.

The most important cities are the communal capital, [[Oviedo]] (''Uviéu'' or ''Uvieo''), the seaport and largest city [[Gijón]] (''Xixón''), and the industrial town of [[Avilés]]. Other [[List of municipalities in Asturias|municipalities in Asturias]] include [[Cangas de Onís]] (''Cangues d'Onís''), [[Cangas del Narcea]], [[Gozón]], [[Grado, Asturias|Grado]] (''Grau'' or ''Grao''), [[Langreo]] (''Llangréu''), [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]], [[Laviana]] (''Llaviana''), [[Lena, Asturias|Lena]] (''Ḷḷena''), [[Llanes]], [[Mieres, Asturias|Mieres]], [[Siero]], [[Valdés, Asturias|Valdés]], [[Vegadeo]] (''A Veiga'') and [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]] (''see also [[List of municipalities in Asturias|List of municipalities]] and [[Comarcas of Asturias|comarcas in Asturias]]'').

Asturias is also home to the [[Princess of Asturias Awards]].

==History==
[[File:Termes romanes de Gijón 03.JPG|180px|thumbnail|left|Roman thermaes in Gijón, Asturias]]
<!-- Note: parts of this section have been translated from the Spanish version of this page, at: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principado_de_Asturias -->
Asturias has been inhabited, first by ''[[Homo erectus]]'', then by [[Neanderthals]] and finally by modern humans,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} since the [[Lower Paleolithic]] era, and during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] was characterized by cave paintings in the eastern part of the area. In the [[Mesolithic]] period, a native culture developed, that of the ''Asturiense'', and later, with the introduction of the [[Bronze Age]], [[megalith]]s and [[tumulus|tumuli]] were constructed. In the [[Iron Age]], the territory came under the cultural influence of the [[Celts]]; the local Celtic peoples, known as the [[Astur]]es, were composed of tribes such as the ''Luggones'', the ''Pesicos'', and others, who populated the entire area with ''[[castro (village)|castros]]'' (fortified hill-towns). Today the [[Astur]] Celtic influence persists in [[toponym|place names]], such as those of rivers and mountains.
[[File:Iglesia de Santa María del Naranco.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Santa María del Naranco, ancient palace of Asturian Kings, 842 AD]]
With the conquest of Asturias by the [[Roman empire|Romans]] under [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] (29–19 BC), the region entered into the annals of [[history]]. After several centuries without foreign presence, the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] occupied the land from the 6th century AD to the beginning of the 8th century, ending with the [[Early Muslim conquests#Conquest of Hispania and Septimania: 711–721|Moorish invasion of Spain]]. However, as it had been for the Romans and Visigoths, the Moors did not find mountainous territory easy to conquer, and the lands along Spain's northern coast never fully became part of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. Rather, with the beginning of the Moorish conquest in the 8th century, this region became a refuge for [[Christian]] nobles, and in 722, a ''de facto'' independent kingdom was established, the ''[[Kingdom of Asturias|Regnum Asturorum]]'', which was to become the cradle of the incipient ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest).

In the 10th century, the Kingdom of Asturias gave way to the [[Kingdom of León]], and during the [[Middle Ages]] the geographic isolation of the territory made historical references scarce. Through the rebellion of [[Henry II of Castile]] in the 14th century, the Principality of Asturias was established. The most famous proponents of independence were Gonzalo Peláez and [[Queen Urraca]], who, while achieving significant victories, were ultimately defeated by [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] troops. After its integration into the [[Kingdom of Spain]], Asturias provided the Spanish court with high-ranking aristocrats and played an important role in the colonization of America. Since 1388, the heir to the Castilian (later Spanish) throne has been styled [[Prince of Asturias]]. In the 16th century, the population reached 100,000 for the first time, and within another century that number would double due to the arrival of [[Americas|American]] [[maize|corn]].

[[File:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]]
During the 18th century, Asturias was one of the centres of the [[Enlightenment Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]]. The renowned [[Galician people|Galician]] thinker [[Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro|Benito de Feijóo]] settled in the [[Benedictine]] [[Monastery]] of [[San Vicente de Oviedo]]. [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]], a [[polymath]] and prominent reformer and politician of the late 18th century, was born in the seaside town of [[Gijón]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] came to Asturias after 1830 with the discovery and systematic exploitation of coal mines and iron factories at the mining basins of [[Nalón (comarca)|Nalón]] and [[Caudal (Asturian comarca)|Caudal]], that turned Asturias into an industrial region. At the same time, there was significant migration to [[Americas|America]] (especially [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]] and [[Mexico]]); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as 'Indianos', for having visited and made their fortunes in the [[West Indies]] and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: many large 'modernista' villas are dotted across the region, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries.

[[File:NE 800ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Location of Asturias and its neighbors in 800 AD]]
Asturias played an important part in the events that led up to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In October 1934 the Asturian miners and other workers staged an armed uprising  (see [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|Revolution of Asturias]]) to oppose the coming to power of the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right|right-wing CEDA]] party, which had obtained three ministerial posts in the centralist government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. For a month, a Popular Front Committee exercised control in southern Asturias, while local workers committees sprang up elsewhere in the region. A war committee dominated by [[anarcho-syndicalist]] supporters took power in Oviedo . Troops under the command of a then unknown general named [[Francisco Franco|Francisco Franco Bahamonde]] were brought from [[Spanish Morocco]] to suppress the revolt. Franco applied tactics normally reserved for overseas colonies, using troops of the [[Spanish Legion]] and [[Regulares|Moroccan troops]]: ferocious oppression followed.

As a result, Asturias remained loyal to the republican government during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and was the scene of an extraordinary defence in extreme terrain, the [[Battle of El Mazuco]]. With Franco eventually gaining control of all Spain, Asturias — traditionally linked to the [[Spanish Crown]] — was known merely as the "Province of Oviedo" from 1939 until Franco's death in 1975. The province's name was restored fully after the return of democracy to Spain, in 1977. In the 50s and 60s the industrial progress of Asturias continued with the constitution of national enterprises like [[Ensidesa]] and Hunosa, but the 80s was the decade of a dramatic [[industrial restructuring]].

On December 30, 1981,<ref name=lavozdeasturias>{{cite news|first=|last=|title= Fallece Rafael Fernández |url=http://www.redasturias.com/asturias/Fallece-Rafael-Fernandez_0_392960711.html |work=[[La Voz de Asturias]] |publisher=|date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> Asturias became an autonomous community within the decentralized territorial structure established by the Constitution of 1978. [[Rafael Luis Fernández Álvarez]], who had previously served as the President of the Regional Council since 1978, became the first [[President of the Principality of Asturias]], upon the adoption of autonomy.<ref name=lavozdeasturias/> The [[Government of the Principality of Asturias|Asturian regional government]] holds comprehensive competencies in important areas such as health, education and protection of the environment. As of May 2011, the President of the Government of Asturias was [[Francisco Álvarez-Cascos]], of the [[Foro Asturias]] (FAC), succeeded by [[Javier Fernández Fernández|Javier Fernández]] in 2012.

==Administrative and territorial division==

[[File:Aviles - Plaza de Domingo Acebal 4.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|Typical buildings in Avilés]]
Asturias is organised territorially into [[Municipality|municipalitie]]s, further subdivided into [[Parroquia (Spain)|parishes]].

===Municipalities of Asturias===

===Parishes===
{{Main|Parroquia (Spain)}}

The parroquia or parish is the subdivision of the Asturian municipalities. Currently, there are 857 parishes integrating the 78 municipalities in the region, and they usually coincide with the ecclesiastic divisions.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Picos Europa.jpg|left|thumb|210px|Picos de Europa]]
The [[Cantabrian Mountains]] (''Cordillera Cantábrica'') form Asturias's natural border with the province of [[León (province)|León]] to the south. In the eastern range, the [[Picos de Europa]] National Park contains the highest and arguably most spectacular mountains, rising to {{Convert|2648|m|ft}} at the Torrecerredo peak. Other notable features of this predominantly limestone range are the [[Redes Natural Park|Parque Natural de Redes]] in the central east, the central Ubiñas south of [[Oviedo]], and the [[Somiedo Natural Park|Parque Natural de Somiedo]] in the west. The Cantabrian mountains offer opportunities for activities such as climbing, walking, skiing and caving, and extend some {{Convert|200|km|mi}} in total, as far as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] province to the west of Asturias and [[Cantabria]] province to the east.

The Asturian coastline is extensive, with hundreds of beaches, coves and natural sea caves. Notable examples include the Playa del Silencio (''Beach of Silence'') near the fishing village of Cudillero (west of [[Gijón]]), as well as the many beaches surrounding the summer resort of Llanes, such as the Barro, Ballota and Torimbia (the latter a predominantly [[nudist]] beach). Most of Asturias's beaches are sandy, clean, and bordered by steep cliffs, on top of which it is not unusual to see grazing livestock.

[[File:Playa de Torimbia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Torimbia beach,  [[Llanes]] ]]
The key features of Asturian geography are its rugged coastal cliffs and the mountainous interior.
The climate of Asturias, as with the rest of northwest Spain, is more varied than that of southern parts of the country. Summers are generally humid and warm with considerable sunshine but also some rain. Winters are cold with some very cold snaps. The cold is especially felt in the mountains, where snow is present from October till May. Both rain and snow are regular weather features of Asturian winters. In coastal or near-coastal areas, daytime high temperatures generally average around {{convert|12|C|F}} – {{convert|13|C|F}} during winter and {{convert|22|C|F}} – {{convert|23|C|F}} in summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1249I&k=ast|title=Standard climate values for Oviedo|publisher=[[Agencia Estatal de Meteorología]]|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref>

==Pollution==
The Gijón area was marked and singled out as one of the [[pollution]] hotspots in Western Europe in a 2015 report from the International Institute for Applied Science Systems, where predictions for 2030 conditions were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/02/23/map-these-will-be-europes-most-polluted-cities-by-2030/|title=Map: These will be the Europe's most polluted cities in 2030|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/1539/2015/acp-15-1539-2015.pdf|title=Modelling Street Level PM10 Concentrations Across Europe|publisher=International Institute for Applied Science Systems|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> The Gijón and Oviedo region was marked much higher than any other Spanish metro area, this in spite of the much larger population in [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]] for example. This was attributed to heavy industrial activities. Since outdoor air pollution is a major cause of premature death in Europe,<ref name="Air - Environment">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/index_en.htm|title=Air - Environment|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> the excessive pollution is a major concern for Asturias. The majority of Asturias population live within a {{convert|25|km|mi}} range from the port of Gijón, so pollution would be likely to heavily affect the population. A Spanish government study conducted in 2010 regarding life expectancy in relative communities Asturias was ranked lowest (tied with [[Andalucia]]) for male life expectancy with 76.7 years from 2007 readings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msssi.gob.es/estadEstudios/estadisticas/inforRecopilaciones/docs/ESPERANZAS_DE_VIDA_SALUDABLES_EN_ESPAN_INGLES-2010.pdf|title=Healthy life expectancies in Spain 1986-2007|publisher=Government of Spain: Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref> However, female life expectancy was 84 years and normal among autonomous communities. However, even the male life expectancy is only just below Western European standards, and exaggerated by the high Spanish life expectancy rate. Considering a vast majority of the Asturian population lives in proximity to the Gijón heavy industrial activities, these figures for especially female relative health still contributes to a position that Gijón is still a safe location to live. The numbers for "disability-free" life expectancy has risen significantly both for males and females in the area since 1986 according to the report.<ref name="Air - Environment"/>

An update: the coal fired electric generating plant Aboño just completed a Spanish government/EU demand to install equipment to drastically reduce its emssions. Also, the two other major polluters Arcelor Gijón and Arcelor Avilés have announced an investment of 100 million euros to do the same. These have been the major cause of the areas high airborne pollution.

==Demographics==
In 2008, Asturias had a [[total fertility rate]] of 1.07, the lowest in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tgs00100 |title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date=2015-03-02 |accessdate=2015-08-01}}</ref>

===Languages===
[[File:Asturian linguistic areas.PNG|thumb|300px|Language map of Asturias]]
The only official language in Asturias is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The [[Asturian language]], also known as Bable, is also spoken, and is protected by law (''Ley 1/1998, de 23 de marzo, de uso y promoción del bable/asturiano'' — "Law 1/1998, of March 23, of Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian"). It is sometimes used by the Asturian [[civil service]]. In the western part of Asturias, [[Eonavian]] is also spoken, and its promotion also falls under the responsibility of Law 1/1998. Whether Eonavian is a [[dialect continuum]] or a variety of [[Galician language]], however, is a subject of debate, and its use in the Asturian Administration is minor compared to the use of the Asturian language. Within Asturias, there is an ongoing process to establish [[place names]] in Asturian and Eonavian dialects.

==Politics==
The organization and political structure of Asturias is governed by the Statute of Autonomy of Asturias, in force since January 30 of 1982. According to the Statute, the institutional bodies of the Principality of Asturias are three: Government of the Principality of Asturias, the Council of the Principality of Asturias and [[President of the Principality of Asturias]]. The form of government of the Principality is [[Parliamentarism|Parliament]]: The [[General Junta of the Principality of Asturias|General Junta]] is the [[legislature]] to choose, on behalf of the Asturian town, the President of the Principality of Asturias. The President  is the Governing Council, the head of [[Executive power]], and politically answerable to the General Junta.

The functions of the General Junta are the approval of budgets, and the direction and control of the action of the Governing Council. It is composed of 45 deputies, elected for four years through theuniversal suffrage within a system proportional representation that the allocation of deputies is based on D'Hondt method.

The results of the elections to the General Junta are:

==Economy==

[[File:CentroNiemeyer70.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Centro Niemeyer]] designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] ]]

For centuries, the backbone of the Asturian economy was [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. [[Milk]] production and its derivatives was also traditional, but its big development was a byproduct of the economic expansion of the late 1960s. Nowadays, products from the dairy cooperative Central Lechera Asturiana are being commercialised all over Spain.

The main regional industry in modern times, however, was [[coal]] mining and [[steel]] production: in the times of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, it was the centre of Spain's steel industry. The then state-owned ENSIDESA steel company is now part of the privatised [[Aceralia]], now part of the [[ArcelorMittal]] Group. The industry created many jobs, which resulted in significant migration from other regions in Spain, mainly [[Extremadura]], [[Andalusia]] and [[Castile and León]].

The steel industry is now in decline when measured in terms of number of jobs provided, as is the mining. The reasons for the latter are mainly the high costs of production to extract the coal compared to other regions. Regional economic growth is below the broader Spanish rate, though in recent years growth in service industries has helped reduce Asturias's high rate of unemployment. Large out-of-town retail parks have opened near the region's largest cities (Gijón and Oviedo), whilst the ever-present Spanish construction industry appears to continue to thrive.

Asturias has benefited extensively since 1986 from [[European Union]] investment in roads and other essential [[infrastructure]], though there has also been some controversy regarding how these funds are spent, for example, on miners' pensions.

{{As of|2008}}, the GDP (PPP) per capita of Asturias stood at €22,640, or 90.2% of the European average of €25,100. This makes the region the 12th richest in Spain, a big decrease from the 1970s/1980s - the heyday of the Spanish mining industry, when Asturias was commonly regarded as one of the most prosperous regions in Southern Europe. Asturias has been growing below the Spanish national average since the decline of the mining industry, and grew just 0.82% in 2008, the lowest of all regions in Spain. On the plus side, unemployment in Asturias is below the average of Spain; at 8.43% it is also below the European average.

==Transportation==
[[File:Régional Embraer 190 F-HBLA OVD-LEAS.jpg|190px|thumbnail|right|Asturias International Airport]]

===Air===
Asturias is served by [[Asturias Airport|Asturias International Airport (OVD)]], {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off}} from Oviedo, near the northwest coast and the industrial town of Avilés.
*International carriers
**[[Air France]]
**A UK-based international carrier, [[EasyJet]], began daily flights to Asturias airport in March 2005, it operates to [[Stansted Airport]], which the airline uses as a major hub. During the winter period, EasyJet usually reduces flying frequency to four flights per week.
**A German-based carrier, [[Air Berlin]], began flights to Asturias airport in November 2006, it operates to [[Mallorca]] which the airline uses as a major hub.
* Several national carriers also link Asturias to [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]], [[Brussels]], [[Paris]], [[Seville]] and others.
**[[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]]
**[[Vueling]]

Eastern Asturias is also easily accessible from [[Santander Airport]]. Recent improvements introduced in the road network permit flying into [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and later driving into Asturias, which can be entered in less than an hour's drive. The Irish airline [[Ryanair]] operates flights to [[Santander Airport]] from Frankfurt Hahn, Liverpool, Dublin, Edinburgh, London Stansted and Rome Ciampino.

===Sea===
[[El Musel]] (the Port of Gijón) is able to receive cruise ships of any size. Companies as P&O, Swan Hellenic or Hapag Lloyd choose the Port of Gijón every year for their calls in the [[Atlantic Europe]]an Coast. The following areas are available for cruise vessels:

*Moliner quay: 313 m berthing with 14 m draught.
*7ª Alignment: 326 m with 12 m draught.
*Espigón II. South alignment. 360 m berth with 9 m draught.

These locations allow a high degree of access control, with security guaranteed for both vessels and passengers alike. The city centre is only 4&nbsp;km away and the Port Authority provides dedicated coach connection allowing passengers to take advantage of the cultural, [[gastronomy|gastronomic]] and commercial opportunities that Gijón has to offer.

Since 2010, the city of Gijón is connected by [[ferry]] with the French city of [[Nantes]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lne.es/gijon/2010/09/16/inaugurada-gijon-primera-autopista-mar-espanola/968763.html |title=Inaugurada en Gijón la primera autopista del mar española - La Nueva España - Diario Independiente de Asturias |publisher=Lne.es |date= |accessdate=2015-08-01}}</ref> This connection is also known as the "sea highway" and it has a frequency of two ferries per day in both directions.

===Train===
[[File:Estacion Norte Oviedo - Nacho Gonmi.jpg|190px|thumbnail|right|Oviedo Train Station]]
{{see also|Cercanías Asturias}}
Spain's national [[RENFE]] rail network also serves Asturias well; trains regularly depart to and from the Spanish interior. Major stops are the regional capital, [[Oviedo]], and the main coastal city, [[Gijón]]. Meanwhile, the [[FEVE]] rail company links the centre of the region with Eastern and Western Asturias. Under the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], the [[Pajares Base Tunnel]], is currently under construction, and will reduce the journey times from Madrid to Asturias from 5 hours to just 3 hours, paving the way for the arrival of [[AVE]] trains in the near future.

===Bus===
There is also a comprehensive bus service run by the [[ALSA (bus company)|ALSA]] company. It links [[Avilés]], [[Gijón]], [[Oviedo]] and [[Mieres, Asturias|Mieres]] with [[Madrid]] and other major towns, several times a day. These include services to [[Barcelona]], [[Salamanca]], [[León (Spain)|León]], [[Valladolid]], [[A Coruña]], [[Bilbao]], [[Seville]], [[San Sebastián]], [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and [[Nice]], to name just a few.

===Major attractions===
[[Oviedo]], the capital city of Asturias: a clean, picturesque city with a diverse architectural heritage. [[Santa María del Naranco]] and [[San Miguel de Lillo]], a [[pre-Romanesque]] church and a palace respectively, which were built by the first Asturian kings on Mount Naranco, to the north of the city ([[World Heritage Site]]). In modern architecture, the '''Palacio de Congresos de Oviedo''' (or '''Modoo'''), designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]].

[[Gijon]], the biggest city of Asturias, is a coastal city famous for cultural and sports events and there is a beach tourism centre in northern Spain. It also is famous for the traditional Asturian gastronomy and for being an important Asturian's cider production spot. There are many museums and places to visit in the city. It is also important to mention the '''[[Universidad Laboral de Gijón]]''', including a modern art museum, theatre, etc.

[[Avilés]], the third largest city in Asturias, is now becoming an essential touristic spot in the principality. "La villa del adelantado"(as locals usually call it, in reference of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]]) is a meeting point where present and past meet. This is most notably clear once we go through the streets in the old quarter of the city. "Saint Nicholas of Bari" or "Capilla de los Alas" in Romanesque and Romanesque-Gothic style, respectively; Palacio de Balsera, in Modernist style or St. Thomas of Canterbury church (dating from the 13th century) are just a few examples which clearly show the magnificent historical patrimony to be found in the city. On the other hand, the [[Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre|Centro Niemeyer]], designed by the Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]], is one of the examples of modern architecture in Asturias.

The [[Picos de Europa]] National Park, and other parts of the Asturian mountain range: The most famous mountain in the park is the Picu Urriellu (2519 m or 8262&nbsp;ft), also known as ''El Naranjo de Bulnes'', a molar-shaped peak which, reputedly, glows orange in the evening sun, hence its name. Weather permitting, it can be viewed clearly from Camarmeña village, near Poncebos, south of Arenas de Cabrales.

The shrine to the Virgin of [[Covadonga]] and the mountain lakes (''[[Lakes of Covadonga|Los Lagos]]''), near [[Cangas de Onís]]: Legend has it that in the 8th century, the [[Our Lady of Covadonga|Virgin]] blessed Asturian Christian forces with a well-timed signal to attack Spain's Moorish conquerors, thereby taking the invaders by surprise in the [[Battle of Covadonga]]. The ''[[Reconquista]]'' and eventual unification of all Spain is therefore said to have started in this very location.

The paleolithic art in many caves of Asturias is declared [[World Heritage Site]] with the [[Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain|Paleolithic Art of Northern Spain]]

Asturias has an excellent [[Industrial archaeology|industrial heritage]] as a consequence of its great industrial activities in the 19th and 20th centuries. It had metallurgical and chemical factories, mines, bridges and railways, specially in the towns of [[Langreo]], [[Mieres]] and [[Avilés]].

The Asturian coast: especially the beaches in and around the summer resort of [[Llanes]], the Playa del Silencio near [[Cudillero]] fishing village, or the "white" village of [[Luarca]] ([[Severo Ochoa]] hometown).

*Ceceda village: east of [[Oviedo]] along the N634 road. Of particular interest in this exemplary settlement are the traditional ''[[Hórreo|horreos]]'' (grain silos), raised on stilts so as to keep field mice from getting at the grain.
*The [[Dobra (Sella)|Dobra River]]: south of [[Cangas de Onís]], famous for its unusual colour and natural beauty.
*The ''senda costera'' (coastal way) between Pendueles and [[Llanes]]: This partly paved nature route takes in some of Asturias' most spectacular coastal scenery, such as the noisy ''bufones'' ([[blowhole (geology)|blowholes]]) and the Playa de [[Ballota (Cudillero)|Ballota]].

===Architecture===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Asturias has a rich artistic legacy that emphasizes [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] (''[[Asturias Arts]]'') indigenous architecture with monuments like [[Santa María del Naranco]], [[Santa Cristina de Lena]] and [[San Miguel de Lillo]]. These monuments have a Ramirense Romanesque style (due to [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]]) or [[San Julián de los Prados]], known as Santullano ([[Oviedo]]) of the Alfonsino pre-Romanesque style (due to [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]]), which are all in Oviedo. Other examples of architecture are Villaviciosa's church, [[San Salvador de Valdediós]] (commonly known by the Asturians as "Conventín"), and the church of San Salvador de Priesca. Another example is [[Cabranes|Cabranes']] [[San Julian de Viñón]].

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style is very present, since all Asturias is crossed by one of the [[Camino de Santiago]] routes, which highlights the [[Monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva]] (near [[Cangas de Onis]]), the churches of [[Church of San Esteban (Aramil)|San Esteban de Aramil]] ([[Siero]]), [[Church of San Juan (Amandi)|San Juan de Amandi]] ([[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]]) and Santa María de Junco ([[Ribadesella]]).

The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style is not as abundant, but there are good examples of this style, such as the [[Oviedo Cathedral|Cathedral of San Salvador]] in Oviedo.

The [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style is more present by means of palace architecture, with such notable examples as the Palace of Camposagrado and Velarde - the latter seat of [[Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias]]. The Baroque style stands out in public civil engineering and bridge tolls (Olloniego); the milestones, the chairs or seats present along the road to Madrid and the resort of Caldas de Priorio (Oviedo) building.

In 1985, the [[UNESCO]] declared the pre-Romanesque monuments and the [[Oviedo Cathedral|Cathedral of Oviedo]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.

In popular architecture, the traditional granaries in Asturias, called ''[[hórreo]]s'', are known for their demographic extension and their functional evolution, its basic characteristic being its mobility: it can be easily dismounted and transported to another location. The [[Panera]] is the evolution of the hórreo, with examples exceeding {{convert|100|m2|0|abbr=off}} of area covered. The purpose of the horreo is to store objects and crops. With the arrival of maize and the beans, they were endowed with exterior corridors and railings for drying the harvests.

Asturias is home to the only architectural work in Spain (as well as the largest in Europe) of the Brazilian architect and disciple of [[Le Corbusier]]; [[Oscar Niemeyer]]: the [[Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre]]. The architectural project was donated to the Principality by the architect, who was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Award|Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts]], in the XXV edition of these awards. Niemeyer's project combined several different elements, and projected an open space, a place for education, culture and peace.

In the capital of the Principality stands one of the most representative buildings of modern architecture, the [[Palace of Congresses of Oviedo]], by the Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], who also awarded the Prince of Asturias of Award for the Arts in 1999.

Special importance has been placed in recent years on the recovery of [[industrial heritage]] through various routes and industrial museums, especially in the central area of the region.

===Food and drink===
{{main|Asturian cuisine}}
[[File:Fabada y sidra.jpg|thumb|''Fabada asturiana'' and sidra (cider), a typical dish of Asturias]]
While Asturias is especially known for its [[seafood]], the most famous regional dish is ''[[Fabada Asturiana|fabada asturiana]]'', a rich stew typically made with large white [[broad bean|bean]]s (''fabes''), shoulder of [[pork]] (''lacón''), black sausage (''[[morcilla]]''), and spicy [[sausage]] (''[[chorizo]]'').

[[Apple]] groves foster the production of the region's traditional alcoholic drink, a natural [[cider]] (''sidra''). Since it is natural and bottled without gas, it produces a weak carbonation, and when Asturian cider is served, it is poured in a particular way, ''el escanciado'': the bottle is held above the head allowing for a long vertical pour, causing the cider to be aerated as it splashes into the glass below. After drinking most of the content, it is customary to splash a little out onto the ground, as a way to clean the glass of any [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] for the next serving. Traditionally, the same glass is refilled and passed around, with everyone drinking from it in turn.

Asturian [[cheese]]s, especially [[Cabrales cheese|Cabrales]], are also famous throughout Spain and beyond; Asturias is often called "the land of cheeses" (''el país de los quesos'').

===Sport===

Asturias has two main football teams: [[Real Sporting de Gijón|Sporting de Gijón]] and [[Real Oviedo]], which have played over 35 seasons in [[La Liga]]. Other current notable sports teams are [[Oviedo CB]] (basketball) and [[AB Gijón Jovellanos]] (handball).

Racecar driver [[Fernando Alonso]] is a two-time [[Formula One]] world champion, and races with Asturias' flag colours on his helmet. Also, cyclist [[Samuel Sánchez]] won a gold at the Olympic games. Football players from Asturias include World Cup winner [[David Villa]] as well as [[Quini]], [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]], [[Juan Manuel Mata]], and [[Santiago Cazorla]], among others.

[[File:Estación de Valgrande-Pajares.JPG|thumb|rught|190px|Valgrande-Pajares ski resort]]

The music of Asturias is varied. The most characteristic instrument in traditional music is the [[Gaita asturiana|Asturian bagpipe]], or gaita, which has a single drone, in common with the traditional bagpipes of other Celtic nations such as Wales & Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pibgyrn.com/index.php?title=d=31&m=07&y=07&category=7 |publisher=Pibgyrn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26| title=Practical guide to making pibgyrn by Gerard KilBride}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sergio y Pablo Arce |url=http://www.asturies.com/viesca/gaita/ |title=La Gaita Asturiana |publisher=Asturies.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420023231/http://www.asturies.com/viesca/gaita/| archivedate= 20 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The bagpipe is often accompanied by the hand drum, whistles and accordion. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional folk music, and several music ensembles have gained regional and international recognition for their ethnomusicological study and presentation of indigenous Asturian music.  Notable examples include traditional pipers such as Xuacu Amieva and Tejedor and fusionist José Ángel [[Hevia]] (whose music video<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUA3sdyZ_Pw |title=Hevia - Busindre Reel (High Quality) |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2015-08-01}}</ref> provides views of both the gaita and the Asturian landscape), and the groups [[Llan de Cubel]], [[Xera (band)|Xera]], Nuberu and Felpeyu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folkworld.de/2/llan.html |title=FolkWorld Article: Llan de Cubel |publisher=Folkworld.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=cranky crow |url=http://worldmusiccentral.org/article.php?story=20030906103905488 |title=Celtic music of Spain |publisher=World Music Central |date=2003-09-14 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityfolk.org/Enewsletter/0606.htm |title=CITYFOLK MONTHLY - June 2006 |publisher=Cityfolk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> Additionally, numerous rock, ska and heavy metal groups have also found relative success within Asturias, many of which incorporate elements of traditional Asturian music into their sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asturshop.com |title=Asturshop |publisher=Asturshop |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414132706/http://asturshop.com/?| archivedate= 14 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Anthem===
The Asturian anthem [[Asturias, patria querida]] (Asturias, beloved fatherland), which was a popular song adopted as the region's anthem and formalised by ''Ley 1/1984, de 27 de Abríl''.

===Orquesta Sinfónica del Principado de Asturias===
The [[Orquesta Sinfonica del Principado de Asturias]] is the premier orchestra in the Principality of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ospa.es |title=Inicio - Orquesta Sinfónica del Principado de Asturias |publisher=Ospa.es |date= |accessdate=2015-08-01}}</ref> It is based in the Auditorio Príncipe Felipe in Oviedo, but also performs in the main concert venues in Gijón and Avilés. [[Rossen Milanov]] is the Music Director.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elaine Schmidt |url=http://www.rossenmilanov.net |title=Rossen Milanov |publisher=Rossenmilanov.net |date= |accessdate=2015-08-01}}</ref>

===Other===
''[[Leyenda|Asturias]]'' is also the name of the fifth movement of the ''Suite Española, Op. 47'' by Spanish composer [[Isaac Albéniz]]. Nevertheless, the music has little in common with the region's own folklore. More authentic is Rimsky Korsakov's ''Spanish Capriccio'', which quotes liberally from Asturian musical heritage.
