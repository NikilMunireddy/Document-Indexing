==History==
''Dagbladet'' was founded in 1869 by [[Anthon Bang]]. [[Hagbard Emanuel Berner]] served as its first editor in chief and the first issue was published on January 2, 1869. From 1884 to 1977 the newspaper was affiliated to the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal party]] (''Venstre'').<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rolf Werenskjold|title=The Dailies in Revolt|journal=Scandinavian Journal of History|date=2008|volume=33|issue=4|doi=10.1080/03468750802423094|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03468750802423094|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> Since 1977, it has officially been politically neutral, though it has kept its position as a liberal newspaper, also incorporating some [[Cultural radicalism|cultural radical]] stands in issues like the language struggle, church policies, [[feminism]], [[intimate relationship]], criminal care etc. The newspaper was in 1972 against Norway joining the [[EU]], but had changed to pro in 1994.<ref>Store norske leksikon, [http://www.snl.no/Dagbladet ''Dagbladet'']</ref>

''Dagbladet'' has played an important role in development of new editorial products in Norway. In 1990, the newspaper was the first in Norway to publish a Sunday edition in more than 70 years, and in 1995 it became the first of the major Norwegian newspapers with an online edition. In 2007 it had a circulation of 204,850 copies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Media in Norway|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Brundtlands-3rd-Government/kd/Veiledninger-og-brosjyrer/1996/media-in-norway.html?id=419207|work=Regjeringen|accessdate=22 November 2014|format=Guideline|date=31 August 1996}}</ref> The actual first newspaper was a regional paper called 'Brønnøysunds Avis'. Over the past few years Dagbladet has had success with the Saturday supplement ''Magasinet'' which reaches 25.3% of the adult population of Norway.<ref>[http://www.tns-gallup.no/arch/img.asp?file_id=212417&ext=.pdf TNS-Gallup.no]</ref>

The paper received some international attention in July 2006 when it ran a story in support of the [[9/11 Truth Movement]]. The article, [[WTC7|"The Third Tower"]], came a few weeks after [[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'s Norway edition ran a similar front page story.<ref>[http://www.seabhcan.com/Dagbladet/index.html Seabhcan.com], ([http://web.archive.org/web/20080327040050/http://www.seabhcan.com/Dagbladet/index.html archived 27 March 2008])</ref>

Due to the declining of daily circulation the newspaper the last couple of years have reduced the number of workers with some hundreds. Because of this the newspaper focused more on "simpler news". But recent years the newspaper have chosen an editorial direction on hard news. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

''Dagbladet'' was previously owned by the privately held company Berner Gruppen. [[Jens P. Heyerdahl]] was the largest owner and had effective control through several different companies. DB Medialab AS also owned 50% of the Norwegian [[web portal]] and [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]] start.no and ran the online community [[Blink (community)|Blink]] from 2002 to 2011.<ref>[http://blink.dagbladet.no/index.htm Blink.dagbladet.no], Retrieved 21 June 2013</ref>

In June 2013, ''Dagbladet'' with online products was sold from Berner Gruppen to [[Aller Media]] for reportedly about 300 million [[Norwegian kroner]].<ref>Eric B. Utheim and Line Midtsjø (21 June 2013):  [http://e24.no/media/haaper-aa-faa-fortsette-paa-dagbladet-fronten/20384659 Håper å få fortsette på  Dagbladet-fronten] {{no icon}} [[E24 Næringsliv|E24]], Retrieved 21 June 2013</ref> As of 2016, 99% of the shares of Dagbladet AS are formally owned by Berner Media Holding AS, which in turn is 100% owned by Aller Media. The remaining 1% of Dagbladet AS is owned by the foundation Dagbladets Stiftelse.<ref>http://www.proff.no/roller/dagbladet-as/oslo/aviser-fagblader-og-tidsskrifter/Z0I3KVC2/</ref>

==Online edition==
The online edition of ''Dagbladet'' was launched on 8 March 1995<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Lars Bo Eriksen|author2=Carina Ihlström|title=Evolution of the Web News Genre - The Slow Move Beyond the Print Metaphor|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|date=2000|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:240060/FULLTEXT01.pdf|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> following [[Brønnøysunds Avis]], a local newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|title=Online Journalism Atlas: Norway|url=http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2008/01/25/online-journalism-atlas-norway/|accessdate=13 January 2015|work=Online Journalism|date=25 January 2008}}</ref> Dagbladet.no claims a readership of nearly 800,000 per day, 1,700,000 per week, which makes it amongst Europe's most successful web newspapers when measured against both population and readership of mother newspaper.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

==Criticism==
On 10 November 1989, the day after the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin wall]], ''Dagbladet'' made no reference to the fall at its frontpage and instead featured the headline "Let the children swear", a quote from child psychologist [[Magne Raundalen]]. This caused criticism and ridicule of the newspaper for being overly tabloid.<ref>Christian Thorkildsen (7 November 2009) [http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Berlinmurens-bannemann-5589650.html Berlinmurens bannemann] Aftenposten.</ref>

Former Minister of Health, [[Tore Tønne]], committed suicide allegedly following ''Dagbladet'''s investigations over alleged economic improprieties committed after the conclusion of his term in the Norwegian cabinet. ''Dagbladet'' was criticized by the Norwegian Press Association. The paper reprinted the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten's 12 [[Mohammed Drawings|Muhammad Cartoons]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.jus.no/index.gan?id=29935 Jus.no - Den Norske Advokatforening<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In May 2011 ''Dagbladet'' lost a [[libel]] case [[Oslo District Court]] against ambulance driver Erik Schjenken for printing factual errors about the [[Paramedics incident in Oslo 2007]] and was ordered to pay a compensation of 1 million [[Norwegian krone|Nkr]]. In 2013 Dagbladet lost the appeal case in [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]], but the legal ruling was slightly changed and the compensation reduced to 200,000 Nkr.<ref>Ingvild Bruaset (23 April 2013): [http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Dagbladet-vurderer-a-anke-Schjenken-dom-7182886.html#.UanZ0JyTmuA Dagbladet vurderer å anke Schjenken-dom] {{no icon}} [[Aftenposten]], Retrieved 1 June 2013</ref> In May, 2013, Dagbladet appealed the case to the [[Supreme Court of Norway]].<ref>Tommy H. Brakstad (24 May 2013): [http://www.na24.no/m/propaganda/?articleId=3628156 Dagbladet anker Schjenken-dommen] {{no icon}} NA24.no, Retrieved 1 June 2013</ref>

The newspaper encountered criticism over a cartoon published in November 2011 that equated the [[holocaust]] with the situation in the [[Gaza Strip]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 2013, Abraham Cooper of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], Jewish communities and human rights organizations claimed that a cartoon depicting the Jewish tradition of [[Male circumcision|circumcision]] as barbaric was [[anti-semitic]].<ref name=db>Editorial (3 June 2013): [http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/06/03/kultur/meninger/dbmener/leder1/27495428/ Dagbladet and antisemitism] Dagbladet, retrieved 12 June 2013</ref> Editor of the culture-and opinion sections in Dagbladet Geir Ramnefjell dismissed the criticism of the 2013 drawing, stating that it was an "innocent ridicule of religious practice and nothing more than that".<ref>John Solsvik (30 May 2013): [http://www.dagen.no/2013/05/30/israel/kritikken/troskyldig/geir_ramnefjell/135798 Dette er blodmerking av jøder] {{no icon}} [[Dagen (Norwegian newspaper)|Dagen]], Retrieved 1 June 2013</ref> Dagbladet also defended the caricature in an editorial 3 June 2013. The [[Norwegian Centre Against Racism]] and the Mosaic community in Norway filed a complaint about the caricature to the [[Norwegian Press Complaints Commission]] which did not find Dagbladet at fault.<ref>Lise Marit Kalstad and Kjell Kvamme (10 June 2013): [http://www.vl.no/samfunn/klager-antisemittisk-tegneseriestripe-inn-for-pfu/#cxrecs_s Klager «antisemittisk» tegneseriestripe inn for PFU] {{no icon}} [[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]], retrieved 12 June 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.dagen.no/Samfunn/Dagbladet-karikatur_frikjent_i_PFU-65610 Dagbladet-karikatur frikjent i PFU] Dagen. 24 September 2013</ref>
