'''Hard rock''' or '''heavy rock''' is a loosely defined [[Music genre|subgenre]] of [[rock music]] that began in the mid-1960s, with the [[Garage rock|garage]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[blues rock]] movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]]s, [[bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], and often accompanied with [[piano]]s and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]].

Hard rock developed into a major form of [[popular music]] in the 1970s, with bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Who]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Aerosmith]], [[AC/DC]] and [[Van Halen]]. During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards [[pop rock]],<ref name=AMQueen/><ref name=Bogdanov2002Queen>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T.

Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of [[grunge]] and later [[Britpop]] in the 1990s.

Despite this, many [[post-grunge]] bands adopted a hard rock sound and in the 2000s there came a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and [[post-punk revival]] scenes. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.

Hard rock is a form of loud, aggressive rock music. The electric guitar is often emphasised, used with [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo [[Lead guitar|lead]] instrument.<ref name=AllMusicHard/> Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a [[beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]] on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis.<ref name=Shuker2005>R. Shuker, ''Popular Music: the Key Concepts'', (Abingdon: Routledge, 2nd end., 2005), ISBN 0-415-34770-X, pp. 130–1.</ref> The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars.<ref name=Allmusicheavymetal/> Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even [[falsetto]] voice.<ref>E. Macan, ''Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), ISBN 0-19-509887-0, p. 39.</ref>

Hard rock has sometimes been labelled [[cock rock]] for its emphasis on overt masculinity and sexuality and because it has historically been predominantly performed and consumed by men: in the case of its audience, particularly white, working-class adolescents.<ref name=Shuker2005/>

In the late 1960s, the term [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity.<ref>P. Du Noyer, ed., ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music'' (Flame Tree, 2003), ISBN 1-904041-70-1, p. 96.</ref> While hard rock maintained a bluesy [[rock and roll]] identity, including some [[swing (music)|swing]] in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them.<ref name=AllMusicHard>{{Citation|title=Hard Rock|journal=Allmusic|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d217|pure_url=yes}}|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wS1b6c7H|archivedate=12 February 2011}}.</ref> Heavy metal took on "darker" characteristics after [[Black Sabbath]]'s breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s. In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres, often termed [[extreme metal]], some of which were influenced by [[hardcore punk]], and which further differentiated the two styles.<ref name=Allmusicheavymetal>V.

==History==
The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s, particularly [[electric blues]],<ref name=campbell201/><ref>Simon Frith, Will Straw, John Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5pxTb3YtB-gC&pg=PA119 page 19], [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref> which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar [[riff]]s, [[String bending|string-bending]] [[Blues scale|blues-scale]] [[guitar solo]]s, strong [[Beat (music)|beat]], thick riff-laden [[Texture (music)|texture]], and posturing performances.<ref name=campbell201>Michael Campbell & James Brody (2007), ''Rock and Roll: An Introduction'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTo8AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA201 page 201]</ref> Electric blues [[guitarist]]s began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms, distorted [[guitar solo]]s and [[power chord]]s in the 1950s, evident in the work of [[Memphis blues]] guitarists such as [[Joe Hill Louis]], [[Willie Johnson (guitarist)|Willie Johnson]], and particularly [[Pat Hare]],<ref name="rolling_memphis">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jim|title=The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll|year=1980|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|location=New York|isbn=0394513223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZEUAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 July 2012|quote=Black country bluesmen made raw, heavily amplified boogie records of their own, especially in Memphis, where guitarists like Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson (with the early Howlin' Wolf band) and Pat Hare (with Little Junior Parker) played driving rhythms and scorching, distorted solos that might be counted the distant ancestors of heavy metal.}}</ref><ref name="palmer"/> who captured a "grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound" on records such as [[James Cotton]]'s "[[:File:James Cotton - Cotton Crop Blues.ogg|Cotton Crop Blues]]" (1954).<ref name="palmer">[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], "Church of the Sonic Guitar", pp. 13–38 in Anthony DeCurtis, ''Present Tense'' (Durham NC: Duke University Press, 1992), ISBN 0-8223-1265-4, pp. 24–27.</ref> Other antecedents include [[Link Wray]]'s instrumental "[[Rumble (instrumental)|Rumble]]" in 1958,<ref>J.

===Origins (1960s)===
[[File:Cream Clapton Bruce Baker 1960s.jpg|thumb|[[Cream (band)|Cream]], whose blues rock improvisation was a major factor in the development of the genre.]]
In the 1960s, American and [[British blues]] and rock bands began to modify [[rock and roll]] by adding harder sounds, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic drumming, and louder vocals, from [[electric blues]].<ref name=campbell201/> Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of [[Chicago blues]] musicians [[Elmore James]], [[Muddy Waters]], and [[Howlin' Wolf]],<ref>Jane Beethoven, Carman Moore, ''Rock-It'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0ZcvzQhiK6sC&pg=PA37 page 37], [[Alfred Music]]</ref> [[The Kingsmen]]'s version of "[[Louie Louie]]" (1963) which made it a [[garage rock]] standard,<ref name="P.

[[Soft rock]] was often derived from [[folk rock]], using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies.<ref name=Curtis1987>J. M.

Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], and [[The Jeff Beck Group]].<ref name=AllMusicHard/> Cream, in songs like "[[I Feel Free]]" (1966) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of [[Eric Clapton]].<ref>R.

Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included [[Iron Butterfly]], [[MC5]], [[Blue Cheer]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].<ref name=Walser1993pp9-10>R. Walser, ''Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music'' (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1993), ISBN 0-8195-6260-2, pp. 9–10.</ref> San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of [[Eddie Cochran]]'s classic "[[Summertime Blues]]", from their 1968 debut album ''[[Vincebus Eruptum]]'', that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound.<ref name=Walser1993pp9-10/> The same month, [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] released its [[Steppenwolf (Steppenwolf album)|self-titled debut album]], including "[[Born to Be Wild]]", which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969).<ref name=Walser1993pp9-10/> Iron Butterfly's ''[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (album)|In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]'' (1968), with its 17-minute-long [[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida|title track]], using organs and with a lengthy drum solo, also prefigured later elements of the sound.<ref name=Walser1993pp9-10/>

By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like [[Led Zeppelin]], who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'' (1969) and ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' (1969), and [[Deep Purple]], who began as a [[progressive rock]] group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, ''[[In Rock (Deep Purple album)|In Rock]]'' (1970). Also significant was Black Sabbath's ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970), which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of [[Gothic rock|Gothic horror]].<ref name="Walser1993p10"/> All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music, with bands like [[Judas Priest]] following Sabbath's lead into territory that was often "darker and more menacing", hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant, good-time music.<ref name=AllMusicHard/>

In the early 1970s the Rolling Stones developed their hard rock sound with ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade, [[Alternative rock|alternative forms]] of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of [[grunge]] in the US and [[Britpop]] in the UK. This was particularly evident after the success of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991), which combined elements of [[hardcore punk]] and heavy metal into a "dirty" sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes than their "hair band" predecessors.<ref name=AllmusicGrunge>[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2679|pure_url=yes}} "Grunge"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 18 June 2010.</ref><ref name=AllmusicHairMetal/><ref name=Bogdanov2002Alternative/> Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock, several, including [[Pearl Jam]],<ref>S.
