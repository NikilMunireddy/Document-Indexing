Declaration and forfeiture

In the sport of [[cricket]], a '''declaration''' occurs when a captain declares his team's [[innings]] closed and a '''forfeiture''' occurs when a captain chooses to forfeit an innings. Declaration and forfeiture are covered in Law 14 of the [[laws of cricket]]. This concept applies only to matches in which each team is scheduled to bat in two innings; Law 14 specifically does not apply in any form of [[limited overs cricket]].

==Declaration==
The captain of the batting side may declare an innings closed, when the ball is [[Dead ball (cricket)|dead]], at any time during a match.<ref name="law14">{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-14-declaration-and-forfeiture/ |title=Law 14 of the Laws of Cricket |publisher=Lords.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref> Usually this is because the captain thinks his team has already scored enough runs to win the match, though tactical declarations are sometimes used in other circumstances.

A captain considering declaration must balance the risks of declaring too early (thus setting too low a target for the opposing team) against those of declaring too late or not at all (thus causing a draw by leaving insufficient time to complete the match).

The first captain to declare was [[Charles Wright (cricketer)|Charles Wright]] in [[1890 English cricket season|1890]]. In a game against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] at the Bat and Ball Ground in [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], Wright declared Nottinghamshire's second innings closed on 157 for 5 to set Kent a target of 231 to win. However, the tactic did not come off as the game was drawn with Kent on 98 for 9 and [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] requiring one more wicket to win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3565.html |title=Scorecard of the game in which Wright became the first captain to declare an innings closed |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>

Before declarations were made legal, batsmen of a team that wanted to get the other team to bat again would deliberately get themselves out, leading to some farcical situations, where the fielding side would make no attempt to dismiss a batsman who was trying to be dismissed.

==Forfeiture==

Under the current Laws, a captain may forfeit either of his side's innings.<ref name="law14" /> A forfeited innings shall be considered as a completed innings. Usually this happens in shorter competitive two-innings matches, where captains need to agree with each other how to set up the match so that there is a reasonable chance of a result. Winning a game gains a team considerably more points than drawing it, so captains are often willing to risk giving the opposition an opportunity to win that they otherwise would not have had as long as they are getting a similar opportunity in return.

===Test cricket===
{{main|English cricket team in South Africa in 1999–2000}}
Only one innings has been voluntarily forfeited in [[Test cricket]]. This was on 18 January 2000 at [[SuperSport Park|Centurion]], [[South Africa]], in the fifth and final Test between [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] and [[England cricket team|England]]. South Africa had already won the series, as they were 2–0 up after the first four matches. After South Africa scored 155 for 6 on the first day, rain washed out the next three days. With only one day remaining, the match was set for a certain draw.

That was until [[Hansie Cronje]], the South African captain, entered into a deal with his English counterpart, [[Nasser Hussain]], that South Africa would continue batting till they reached about 250 and then declare. England and then South Africa would then both forfeit an innings, leaving England approximately 250 to win (in the event the target was 249). At that time, the laws only permitted a side to forfeit its second innings,<ref>

It later emerged that Cronje had been approached by a [[bookmaker]], and asked to ensure the game would end with a positive result.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cronje admits $100,000 in bribes |first=Simon |last=Stone |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=16 June 2000 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/cronje-admits-100000-in-bribes-713286.html |accessdate = 22 March 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100901093157/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/cronje-admits-100000-in-bribes-713286.html|archivedate = 1 September 2003}}</ref> Nasser Hussain and the England team were not aware of this at the time, taking the South African request at face value.
