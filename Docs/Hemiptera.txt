The '''Hemiptera''' {{IPAc-en|h|ɛ|ˈ|m|ɪ|p|t|ər|ə}} or '''true bugs''' are an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[insect]]s comprising around 50,000–80,000 [[species]]<ref name="NHM">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/resources-rx/files/26feat_its_a_bugs_life-3013.pdf  |title=Hemiptera...It's a Bug's Life |publisher=Natural History Museum |author1=Jon Martin |author2=Mick Webb |accessdate=July 26, 2010}}</ref> of groups such as the [[cicada]]s, [[aphid]]s, [[planthopper]]s, [[leafhopper]]s, and [[shield bug]]s.

Most hemipterans feed on plants, using their sucking and piercing mouthparts to extract plant sap. Some are parasitic while others are predators that feed on other insects or small invertebrates. They live in a wide variety of habitats, generally terrestrial, though some species are adapted to life in or on the surface of fresh water. Hemipterans are hemimetabolous, with young nymphs that somewhat resemble adults. Many aphids are capable of parthenogenesis, producing young from unfertilised eggs; this helps them to reproduce extremely rapidly in favourable conditions.

Humans have interacted with the Hemiptera for millennia. Some species are important [[pest (organism)|agricultural pests]], damaging crops by the direct action of sucking sap, but also harming them indirectly by being the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of serious viral diseases. Other species have been used for [[biological control]] of insect pests. Hemipterans have been cultivated for the extraction of dyestuffs [[cochineal]] (also known as [[carmine]]) and for [[shellac]]. The [[bed bug]] is a persistent parasite of humans. [[Cicada]]s have been used as food, and have appeared in literature from the ''[[Iliad]]'' in [[Ancient Greece]].

==Diversity==
Hemiptera is the largest order of [[Holometabolism|hemimetabolous]] insects (not undergoing complete metamorphosis) containing over 75,000 named species; orders with more species all have a [[pupa]]l stage, [[Beetle|Coleoptera]] (370,000 described species), [[Lepidoptera]] (160,000), [[Fly|Diptera]] (100,000) and [[Hymenoptera]] (100,000).<ref name=AES>{{cite web |url=http://www.amentsoc.org/insects/fact-files/orders/ |title=Insect groups (Orders) |publisher=Amateur Entomologists' Society |accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> The group is very diverse. The majority of species are terrestrial, including a number of important agricultural pests, but some are found in freshwater habitats. These include the [[Corixidae|water boatmen]], [[Gerridae|pond skaters]], and [[Belostomatidae|giant water bugs]].<ref name=Coulson/>

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

The present members of the order Hemiptera (sometimes referred to as '''Rhynchota''') were historically placed into two orders, the so-called Homo<!--unlinked, group is paraphyletic-->ptera and Heteroptera/Hemiptera,<ref name=Song2012>{{cite journal|last1=Song |first1=Nan |last2=Liang |first2=Ai-Ping |last3=Bu |first3=Cui-Ping |title=A Molecular Phylogeny of Hemiptera Inferred from Mitochondrial Genome Sequences |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2012 |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=e48778 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0048778 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048778}}</ref><ref name=Forero>{{cite journal|title=The Systematics of Hemiptera |author=Forero, Dimitri |journal=Revista Colombiana de Entomologia |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=2008 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rcen/v34n1/v34n1a01.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113135356/http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rcen/v34n1/v34n1a01.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2015 }}</ref> based on differences in wing structure and the position of the rostrum. The order is now more often divided into four or more suborders, after the "Homoptera" were established as [[paraphyletic]]. [[Molecular phylogenetics]] analysis by Song et al. (2012) supports this cladogram:<ref name=Song2012/>

The [[Peloridiidae]] (Coleorrhyncha) were not included in Song's analysis.<ref name=Song2012/> The suggestion that the Auchenorrhyncha are paraphyletic has been debated, and in 2012, the phylogeny was described as "contentious"; a multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Auchenorrhyncha, like the Sternorrhyncha, Heteropterodea, Heteroptera, Fulgoroidea, Cicadomorpha, Membracoidea, Cercopoidea, and Cicadoidea, were all [[monophyletic]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cryan |first1=Jason C. |last2=Urban |first2=Julie M. |title=Higher-level phylogeny of the insect order Hemiptera: is Auchenorrhyncha really paraphyletic? |journal=Systematic Entomology |date=January 2012 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=7–21 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2011.00611.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3113.2011.00611.x}}</ref>

==Biology==

===Mouthparts===
[[File:HemipteraMouthparts.jpg|thumb|Hemipteran mouthparts are distinctive, with [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]] and [[Insect mouthparts|maxillae]] modified to form a piercing "stylet" sheathed within a modified [[Labium (insect)|labium]].]]

The defining feature of hemipterans is their "beak" in which the modified [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]] and [[Insect mouthparts|maxillae]] form a "stylet" which is sheathed within a modified [[Labium (insect)|labium]]. The stylet is capable of piercing [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and sucking liquids, while the labium supports it. The stylet contains a channel for the outward movement of [[saliva]] and another for the inward movement of liquid food. A salivary pump drives saliva into the prey; a [[cibarial pump]] extracts liquid from the prey. Both pumps are powered by substantial dilator muscles in the head. The beak is usually folded under the body when not in use. The diet is typically [[Sap|plant sap]], but some hemipterans such as [[Reduviidae|assassin bugs]] are blood-suckers, and a few are [[Predation|predators]].<ref name=Ruppert>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=728, 748 }}</ref><ref name=Gullan/>
Both herbivorous and predatory hemipterans inject [[enzyme]]s to begin digestion extraorally (before the food is taken into the body). These enzymes include [[amylase]] to hydrolyse [[starch]], [[polygalacturonase]] to weaken the tough [[cell wall]]s of plants, and [[proteinase]]s to break down proteins.<ref name="Wheeler2001">{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Alfred George|title=Biology of the Plant Bugs (Hemiptera: Miridae): Pests, Predators, Opportunists|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0szFXwGVlo4C&pg=PA105|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-3827-6|pages=105–135}}</ref> Although hemipterans vary widely in their overall form, their mouthparts (formed into a "rostrum") are quite distinctive; the only other insect orders with mouthparts modified in a similar manner are the [[Thysanoptera]] and some [[Phthiraptera]], and these are generally easy to recognize as non-hemipteran for other reasons. Aside from the mouthparts, various insects can be confused with hemipterans, including [[cockroach]]es and [[Psocoptera|psocids]], both of which have longer many-segmented antennae, and some [[beetle]]s, but these have fully hardened forewings which do not overlap.<ref name="Chinery">{{cite book |author=Chinery, Michael |title=Insects of Britain and Northern Europe |edition=3rd |publisher=Collins |year=1993 |isbn=0-00-219918-1}}</ref>

===Wing structure===

The [[insect wing|forewings]] of Hemiptera are either entirely membranous, as in the [[Sternorrhyncha]] and [[Auchenorrhyncha]], or partially hardened, as in most [[Heteroptera]]. The name "Hemiptera" is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ἡμι-|ἡμι-]]}} (''{{lang|el|[[:wikt:hemi-|hemi]]}}''; "half") and {{lang|el|[[:wikt:πτερόν|πτερόν]]}} (''{{lang|el|pteron}}''; "wing"), referring to the forewings of many heteropterans [[Insect wing#Adaptations|which are hardened]] near the base, but membranous at the ends. Wings modified in this manner are termed ''hemelytra'' (singular: ''hemelytron''), by analogy with the completely hardened [[elytron|elytra]] of [[beetle]]s, and occur only in the suborder [[Heteroptera]]. In all suborders, the hindwings – if present at all – are entirely membranous and usually shorter than the forewings.<ref name=Coulson>{{cite book|author1=Coulson, Robert N.|author2=Witter, John A.|title=Forest Entomology: Ecology and Management |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-QsVpIEsuLcC&pg=PA71 |year=1984 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-02573-3 |pages=71–72}}</ref>  The forewings may be held "roofwise" over the body (typical of [[Sternorrhyncha]] and [[Auchenorrhyncha]]),<ref name=Alford>{{cite book|author=Alford, David V.|title=Pests of Ornamental Trees, Shrubs and Flowers: A Color Handbook |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c9PwiScwmPIC&pg=PA12 |year=2012 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-398515-6 |page=12}}</ref> or held flat on the back, with the ends overlapping (typical of [[Heteroptera]]).<ref name=Coulson/> The [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] in Hemiptera typically consist of four or five segments, although they can still be quite long, and the tarsi of the [[arthropod leg|legs]] have two or three segments.<ref name=Discover>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Hemiptera |title=Hemiptera |publisher=Discover Life |accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

===Sound production===
{{further|Tymbal|Stridulation}}

Many hemipterans can produce sound for communication.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Virant-Doberlet|first1=Meta|last2=Cokl|first2=Andrej|title=Vibrational Communication in Insects|journal=Neotropical Entomology|date=April 2004|volume=33|issue=2|doi=10.1590/S1519-566X2004000200001|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1519-566X2004000200001|pages=121–134}}</ref> The "song" of male cicadas, the loudest of any insect, is produced by [[tymbal]] organs on the underside of the abdomen, and is used to attract mates. The tymbals are drumlike disks of cuticle, which are clicked in and out repeatedly, making a sound in the same way as popping the metal lid of a jam jar in and out.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simmons |first1=Peter |last2=Young |first2=David |title=The Tymbal Mechanism and Song Patterns of the Bladder Cicada, ''Cystosoma saundersii'' |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=1978 |volume=76 |pages=27–45 |url=http://download.naturkundemuseum-berlin.de/andreas.wessel/Cicada_morphology/simmons_young_1978_cystosoma_saundersii_tymbal_mechanism.pdf}}</ref>

[[Stridulation|Stridulatory]] sounds are produced among the aquatic [[Corixidae]] and [[Notonectidae]] (backswimmers) using tibial combs rubbed across rostral ridges.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wilcox |first1=R.

===Life cycle===
[[File:Ant-mimic predatory bug, Myrmecoris gracilis, on Yarrow.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An [[ant mimicry|ant-mimicking]] predatory bug ''[[Myrmecoris gracilis]]'']]

Hemipterans are [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]], meaning that they do not undergo [[metamorphosis]], the complete change of form between a [[larva]]l phase and an [[imago|adult phase]]. Instead, their young are called [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]], and resemble the adults to a greater or less degree. The nymphs moult several times as they grow, and each [[instar]] resembles the adult more than the previous one. Wing buds grow in later stage nymphs; the final transformation involves little more than the development of functional wings (if they are present at all) and functioning sexual organs, with no intervening [[pupa]]l stage as in [[Holometabolism|holometabolous]] insects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/metamorphosis-a-remarkable-change |title=Metamorphosis: a remarkable change |author=Britton, David |date=9 July 2009 |publisher=Australian Museum |accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

====Parthenogenesis and vivipary====
[[File:Aphid-giving-birth.jpg|thumb|Aphid giving birth to live female young]]
{{further|parthenogenesis|thelytoky|vivipary}}

Many [[aphid]]s are [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] during part of the life cycle, such that females can produce unfertilized eggs, which are [[Cloning|clones]] of their mother. All such young are female ([[thelytoky]]), so 100% of the population at these times can produce more offspring. Many species of aphid are also [[Vivipary|viviparous]]: the young are born live rather than laid as eggs. These adaptations enable aphids to reproduce extremely rapidly when conditions are suitable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-resources.com/aphid-01.html |title=Aphids, an Introduction |author=Mackean, D.G. |work=Biology Teaching Resources |accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

==Locomotion==
{{further|Animal locomotion}}
Hemipterans make use of a variety of modes of [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] including swimming, skating on a water surface and jumping, as well as walking and flying like other insects.

===Swimming and skating===
[[File:Wasserläufer bei der Paarung crop.jpg|thumb|[[Gerridae|Pondskater]]s are adapted to use [[surface tension]] to keep above a freshwater surface.]]

Several families of Heteroptera are ''water bugs'', adapted to an [[aquatic animal|aquatic lifestyle]], such as the [[Corixidae|water boatmen]] (Corixidae), [[Nepidae|water scorpions]] (Nepidae), and [[Notonectidae|backswimmers]] (Notonectidae). They are mostly predatory, and have legs adapted as [[paddle]]s to help the animal move through the water.<ref name="NHM"/> The [[Gerridae|pondskaters]] or water striders (Gerridae) are also associated with water, but use the [[surface tension]] of standing water to keep them above the surface;<ref name=Bush/> they include the sea skaters in the genus ''[[Halobates]]'', the only truly marine group of insects.<ref name="NHM"/>

===Marangoni propulsion===
[[File:MicroveliaIndia.jpg|thumb|Adult and nymph ''[[Microvelia]]'' water bugs using [[Marangoni effect|Marangoni propulsion]]]]

[[Marangoni effect]] propulsion exploits the change in [[surface tension]] when a soap-like [[surfactant]] is released on to a water surface, in the same way that a toy soap boat propels itself. Water bugs in the genus ''[[Microvelia]]'' ([[Veliidae]]) can travel at up to 17&nbsp;cm/s, twice as fast as they can walk, by this means.<ref name=Bush>{{cite journal | author1=Bush, John W.

===Flight===
Flight is well developed in the Hemiptera although mostly used for short distance movement and dispersal. Wing development is sometimes related to environmental conditions. In aphids, both winged and wingless forms occur with winged forms produced in greater numbers when food resources are depleted. Aphids and whiteflies can sometimes be transported very long distances by atmospheric updrafts and high altitude winds.<ref>{{cite journal|author1= Loxdale, H. D.| author2= Hardie, J.| author3= Halbert, S.| author4=Foottit, R.| author5=Kidd, N. A. C. |author6= Carter, C.

===Jumping===
{{further|Jumping}}

Many Auchenorrhyncha including representatives of the cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, and froghoppers are adapted for jumping (saltation). Treehoppers, for example, jump by rapidly depressing their hind legs. Before jumping, the hind legs are raised and the femora are pressed tightly into curved indentations in the coxae. Treehoppers can attain a take-off velocity of up to 2.7 metres per second and an acceleration of up to 250 g. The instantaneous power output is much greater than that of normal muscle, implying that energy is stored and released to [[catapult]] the insect into the air.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burrows |first1=M. |title=Jumping mechanisms of treehopper insects (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Membracidae) |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=March 2013 |volume=1 |issue=216 (part 5) |pages=788–799 |doi=10.1242/jeb.078741 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23155084 |pmid=23155084}}</ref> Cicadas, which are much larger, extend their hind legs for a jump in under a millisecond, again implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gorb |first1=S.

===Sedentary lifestyles===

In contrast, most Sternorrhyncha females are [[sedentary]] or completely sessile, attached to their host plants by their thin feeding stylets which cannot be taken out of the plant quickly.<ref name="GrimaldiEngel2005">{{cite book |last1=Grimaldi |first1=David|last2=Engel |first2=Michael S. |title=Evolution of the Insects |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ql6Jl6wKb88C&pg=PA289 |date=16 May 2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82149-0 |page=289}}</ref>

[[Phloem]] sap, which has a higher concentration of sugars and nitrogen, is under positive pressure unlike the more dilute [[xylem]] sap. Most of the Sternorrhyncha and a number of Auchenorrhynchan groups feed on phloem. Phloem feeding is common in the Fulgoromorpha, most Cicadellidae and in the Heteroptera. The Typhlocybine Cicadellids specialize in feeding on non-vascular [[mesophyll tissue]] of leaves, which is more nutritious than the leaf epidermis. Most Heteroptera also feed on mesophyll tissue where they are more likely to encounter defensive secondary plant metabolites which often leads to the evolution of host specificity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Current Topics in Vector Research | editor= Harris, Kerry F. |chapter= Feeding Strategies and the Guild Concept Among Vascular Feeding Insects and Microorganisms|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4712-8_6 |author1=Tonkyn, David W.|author2= Whitcomb, Robert F. |pages=179–199  |year=1987}}</ref> Obligate xylem feeding is a special habit that is found in the Auchenorrhyncha among Cicadoidea, Cercopoidea and in Cicadelline Cicadellids.

Some Sternorrhyncha including Psyllids and some aphids are gall formers. These sap-sucking hemipterans inject fluids containing plant hormones into the plant tissues inducing the production of tissue that covers to protects the insect and also act as sinks for nutrition that they feed on. The [[Pachypsylla|hackleberry gall psyllid]] for example, causes a woody gall on the leaf petioles of the [[Celtis occidentalis|hackleberry tree]] it infests,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/trees/hackberry_psyllid.htm |title=Hackberry petiole gall psyllid |author1=Hall, Donald W. |author2=Butler, Jerry F. |author3=Cromroy, Harvey L. |date=1 September 2014 |work=Featured Creatures |publisher=University of Florida/IFAS |accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref> and the nymph of another psyllid produces a protective [[Lerp (biology)|lerp]] out of hardened honeydew.<ref name=Gullan/>

====Predators====

Most other hemipterans are [[predation|predatory]], feeding on other insects, or even small vertebrates. This is true of many aquatic species which are predatory, either as nymphs or adults.<ref name=Discover/> The [[Cermatulus nasalis|predatory shield bug]] for example stabs caterpillars with its beak and sucks out the body fluids.<ref name=Brisbane>{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_stinkbugs/GlossyShieldBugs.htm |title=Glossy Shield Bug: ''Cermatulus nasalis'' |date=2010 |publisher=Brisbane Insects and Spiders |accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> The saliva of predatory heteropterans contains [[digestive enzyme]]s such as [[proteinase]] and [[phospholipase]], and in some species also [[amylase]]. The mouthparts of these insects are adapted for predation. There are toothed stylets on the mandibles able to cut into and abrade tissues of their prey. There are further stylets on the maxillae, adapted as tubular canals to inject saliva and to extract the pre-digested and liquified contents of the prey.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Allen C. |title=Feeding Adaptations of Some Predaceous  Hemiptera |url=http://insectdiets.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Cohen-47.pdf |publisher=USDA-ARS | journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America | volume=83 | issue=6 | pages=1215–1223 | date=1990 | doi=10.1093/aesa/83.6.1215}}</ref>

Some species attack pest insects and are used in biological control. One of these is the [[spined soldier bug]] (''Podisus maculiventris'') that sucks body fluids from larvae of the [[Colorado beetle]] and the [[Mexican bean beetle]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Predatory Heteroptera: their ecology and use in biological control |author=Coll, M.; Ruberson, J.R.

====Haematophagic "parasites"====
A few hemipterans are [[Hematophagy|haematophagic]] (often described as "[[parasite]]s"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goddard |first1=Jerome |title=Bed Bugs (Cimex lectularius) and Clinical Consequences of Their Bites |journal=JAMA |date=2009 |volume=301 |issue=13 |pages=1358–1366 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.405 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=183643 |pmid=19336711}}</ref>), feeding on the blood of larger animals.

[[File:Common jassid nymphs and ants02.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Leafhopper]]s protected by [[meat ant]]s]]

Some species of [[ant]] protect and farm aphids (Sternorrhyncha) and other sap-sucking hemipterans, gathering and eating the [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] that these hemipterans secrete. The relationship is [[mutualism (biology)|symbiotic]], as both ant and aphid benefit. Ants such as the yellow anthill ant, ''[[Lasius flavus]]'', breed aphids of at least four species, ''Geoica utricularia'', ''Tetraneura ulmi'', ''Forda marginata'' and ''Forda formicaria'', taking eggs with them when they found a new colony; in return, these aphids are obligately associated with the ant, breeding mainly or wholly asexually inside anthills.<ref name=Ivens>{{cite journal |last1=Ivens |first1=A.

Some leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) are similarly "milked" by ants. In the Corcovado rain forest of Costa Rica, wasps compete with ants to protect and milk leafhoppers; the leafhoppers preferentially gave more honeydew, more often, to the wasps, which were larger and may have offered better protection.<ref name="Choe2012">{{cite book |last=Choe |first=Jae |title=Secret Lives of Ants |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gACBQhye2wsC&pg=PT62|date=14 February 2012 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0521-6 |pages=62–64}}</ref>

===As food===
[[File:deepfried cicada.jpg|thumb|Deep-fried [[cicada]]s, ''Cryptotympana atrata'', in Chinese [[Shandong cuisine]]]]

Some larger hemipterans such as [[cicada]]s are used as food in Asian countries such as China,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Greenaway |first1=Twilight |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-best-way-to-handle-the-coming-cicada-invasion-heat-up-the-deep-fryer-19372006 |title=The Best Way to Handle the Coming Cicada Invasion?

===In art and literature===

Cicadas have featured in literature since the time of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', and as motifs in decorative art from the Chinese [[Shang dynasty]] (1766-1122 B.C.). They are described by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' and by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''; their mechanism of sound production is mentioned by [[Hesiod]] in his poem ''[[Works and Days]]'' "when the Skolymus flowers, and the tuneful ''Tettix'' sitting on his tree in the weary summer season pours forth from under his wings his shrill song".<ref>{{cite book | author=Myers, J. G. |title=Insect Singers | publisher=G. Routledge and Sons| date=1929 |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/buzz/c700lm29sec01.pdf}}</ref>

===In mythology and folklore===

Among the bugs, cicadas in particular have been used as money, in folk medicine, to forecast the weather, to provide song (in China), and in folklore and myths around the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cicada |url=http://www.britannica.com/animal/cicada |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>
