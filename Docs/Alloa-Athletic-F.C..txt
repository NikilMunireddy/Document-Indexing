'''Alloa Athletic Football Club''' is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[association football]] semi professional club based in the town of [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]]. Founded as Clackmannan County in 1878, the club changed its name to Alloa a year later and to Alloa Athletic in 1883. The club competes in the [[Scottish League One]] as a member of the [[Scottish Professional Football League]].<ref name="Alloa_SFL"/>

The club was elected to the [[Scottish Football League Division Two|second tier]] of the [[Scottish Football League]] in [[1921–22 in Scottish football|1921–22]], earning promotion to the top flight in its first season after [[List of winners of the Scottish First Division and predecessors|winning the Second Division]]. Below the top two tiers, Alloa Athletic has finished runners-up in the third tier a record eight times without ever winning, the most recent coming in [[2012–13 in Scottish football|2012–13]], gaining promotion to the First Division via the play-offs.

Alloa Athletic first entered in the [[Scottish Cup]] in [[1883–84 Scottish Cup|1883]], its best result reaching the quarter-finals on three occasions, the last in [[1988–89 Scottish Cup|1988]]. The club's best result in a national cup competition was reaching the final of the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] thrice; winning in [[1999 Scottish Challenge Cup Final|1999]] and finishing runners-up in [[2001 Scottish Challenge Cup Final|2001]] and [[2015 Scottish Challenge Cup Final|2015]].

The club's nickname is 'The Wasps', referring to its home colours of black and gold hoops. Alloa Athletic has been based at [[Recreation Park, Alloa|Recreation Park]] in Alloa since 1895.

==History==
[[Image:Scan168 Berwick Alloa 1997 brightened reduced.jpg|thumb|left|Alloa playing at [[Berwick Rangers F.C.|Berwick]] in their 1997–98 title-winning season]]
The club were formed in 1878 as '''Clackmannan County''', becoming '''Alloa''' a year later and finally adopting the present-day name ''Alloa Athletic'' in 1883.<ref name="names">{{cite web|url=http://www.alloaathletic.co.uk/history.aspx|title=Club History|accessdate =11 June 2013|publisher=Alloa Athletic FC}}</ref> Admitted to the [[Scottish Football Association]] in the same year, the club had to wait until 1921 to elected to the [[Scottish Football League]], although they had enjoyed success prior to this. In 1906–07, the club were [[Scottish Football Union]] champions and won the [[Central Football League]] six years later, with two runners-up finishes in-between.

Alloa won the [[Scottish Football League Division Two]] title in their first season but were immediately relegated from the top flight the following season. Promotion was achieved again in [[1938–39 in Scottish football|1938–39]] but the onset of the Second World War saw the new season curtailed after just five games. When the leagues were re-organised after the war, Alloa were placed back in Division Two.

[[Image:alloa v stirling IX MMVI.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] shooting against the Alloa goal and missing in August 2006]]
The 1950s and 60s were not overly successful for the Wasps although the club did provide the game with [[John White (footballer born 1937)|John White]] who went on to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (where he was part of their famous Double winning side of the 1960–61 season). Promotion was finally achieved again from the new Second Division in [[1976–77 in Scottish football|1976–77]] under the managership of [[Hugh Wilson (football manager)|Hugh Wilson]]. Relegation soon followed but the Wasps went back up [[1981–82 in Scottish football|1981–82]] under [[Alex Totten]] and managed an excellent 6th-place finish in the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] the following season. Unfortunately the team was relegated again a year later and a similar pattern followed after further promotions in [[1984–85 in Scottish football|1984–85]] and [[1988–89 in Scottish football|1988–89]].

Following further league reconstruction, Alloa found themselves as founder members of the new [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1995. Under Tom Hendrie, Alloa won this league in [[1997–98 in Scottish football|1997–98]], the club's first championship win since [[1921–22 in Scottish football|1921–22]]. The following season saw the team consolidate in the Second Division and also enjoy a famous 7–0 derby win over local rivals [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]].
Following the departure of Tom Hendrie to [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]], [[Terry Christie]] took over at Alloa and led the club to the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] in [[1999–2000 in Scottish football|1999]] followed by promotion to the First Division a few months later. The team was relegated at the first attempt but bounced back up in [[2001–02 in Scottish football|2001–02]]. Relegation followed once more, this time on goal difference.

Since 2003 Alloa have been playing in the Second Division. In the 2009–2010 season, Alloa looked certain to gain promotion to the Scottish First Division, but they lost out to Stirling by Goal Difference. In the 2010–2011 season, Alloa were relegated to the Third Division after finishing 9th in the Second Division league table, and failing to negotiate the end-of-season play-offs, losing 2–1 on aggregate to [[Annan Athletic F.C.|Annan]].

Days after, however, Alloa pulled off a massive coup, appointing former [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] midfielder [[Paul Hartley]] as player-manager.<ref name="Paul Hartley new manager"/>

On 7 April 2012, Alloa were confirmed as Scottish Third Division champions after beating Elgin City 8–1 in a home game at Recreation Park. Clyde defeated nearest rivals, Stranraer, 2–1 making it mathematically impossible for the South of Scotland side to surpass the Clackmannanshire side's points total with only 4 games remaining. Alloa secured back-to-back promotions the following season by finishing 2nd in the [[Scottish Second Division]], and defeating [[Dunfermline F.C.|Dunfermline]] in the play-off final, consigning The Pars to the third tier of Scottish football. As 2012–13 was the final season before [[Scottish Professional Football League|SPFL]] reconstruction, Alloa started season 2013–14 in the newly formed [[Scottish Championship]], the current name for the second tier of Scottish football. On 18 January 2014, Hartley resigned as manager following a 5–1 defeat to [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]], with the club sitting eighth in the Championship.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25796364 | title=Paul Hartley resigns as Alloa Athletic manager | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | work=bbc.co.uk/sport | date=18 January 2014 | accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>

On 7 March 2015, after slipping to a 1–0 defeat to Dumbarton left Alloa in the relegation play-off spot, manager Barry Smith immediately resigned. On 7 April 2015, [[Danny Lennon]] was appointed the new manager on a one-year deal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32197576 | title=Alloa Athletic appoint Danny Lennon as new manager | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | work=bbc.co.uk/sport | date=7 April 2015 | accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref> Lennon lasted just eight months with Alloa, resigning on 7 December 2015 after picking up just five points from 16 games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35034739 | title=Danny Lennon resigns as Alloa Athletic manager | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | work=bbc.co.uk/sport | date=7 December 2015 | accessdate=7 December 2015}}</ref> Lennon was replaced by [[Jack Ross]], who despite improved performances was unable to prevent them from being relegated to [[Scottish League One]] at the end of the season.

==Colours and crest==
Alloa's home colours have been black hoops with either orange or gold stripes for the majority of its existence. The club's first strip featured black and orange hoops in 1878 and rarely changed up until 1947 when gold was more commonly used with the black.<ref name="names"/> Occasionally the club has adopted an all-gold or all-orange strip to replace the hoops and only once have these colours not been used; in [[1897–98 in Scottish football|1897–98]] the home strip was blue and white vertical stripes for a solitary season which was reverted to the traditional style the following year.<ref name="Historical_Kits_Alloa">[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Alloa_Athletic/Alloa_Athletic.htm Alloa Athletic&nbsp;– Kit History], ''historicalkits.co.uk''.

The first company to supply kits for Alloa Athletic was Litesome in [[1977–78 in Scottish football|1977–78]].<ref name="Historical_Kits_Alloa" /> The supplier for the [[2012–13 in Scottish football|2012–13 season]] is Pendle, who have supplied the club's kits since [[1998–99 in Scottish football|1998–99]]. Past suppliers include [[Umbro]], Matchwinner and [[Patrick (shoe company)|Patrick]].<ref name="Historical_Kits_Alloa" /> The club carried a sponsor on its shirts for the first time in the [[1984–85 in Scottish football|1984–85 season]]; sponsored for two seasons by Maclays until 1987.<ref name="names" /> Sterling sponsored the shirts for a further two seasons followed by short spells displaying Sinclair Haulage and then Campbell Homes until 1995. From the [[1995–96 in Scottish football|1995–96 season]] to [[2003–04 in Scottish football|2003–04]] the sponsor was Alloa Advertiser which was replaced in 2004 by Machine Tool Engineers (MTE) who sponsored the most recent shirt in [[2012–13 Alloa Athletic F.C. season|2012–13]].<ref name="names" /><ref name="Historical_Kits_Alloa" />

In the same year the home shirts were sponsored in 1985, the club displayed a crest for the first time. The crest reflected the club's nickname "The Wasps", featuring a black wasp on a basic gold shield with the club's initials below.<ref name="Historical_Kits_Alloa" /> The design of the crest was edited slightly in 1994 with an almost identical wasp on a similar gold shield and the club's full name was displayed below on a gold scroll banner. The crest colour varied along with the shade of colour on the strip and featured until 2010 when it was again redesigned. The new design features a large cartoon Wasp and is referred to by fans of the club as 'the hornet'.<ref name="Historical_Kits_Alloa" />

Alloa Athletic has played its home games at several grounds over its history. When the club was founded in 1878 it was based at West End Park, a [[public park]] in the west of Alloa. The club moved to Gaberston Park in 1883 and to Bellevue Park in 1890. After five years at Bellevue Park, Alloa moved to [[Recreation Park, Alloa|Recreation Park]] in 1895, where the club has played its home games since.<ref name="names" />

Recreation Park was renamed Indodrill Stadium after a sponsorship deal with Indodrill EMEA Ltd was agreed to on Friday 12 September 2014.<ref>http://www.alloaathletic.co.uk/BlogView.aspx?pageid=2&ItemID=1116&mid=2</ref><ref>http://www.indodrill.com/news/indodrill-sponsors-alloa-athletic-football-ground</ref>  However, supporters of the club continue to call it Recreation Park or The Recs.

Most record books list Alloa's record attendance as 13,000 for a match against [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] on 22 February 1939 in a [[Scottish Cup]] third round replay.<ref name="names" /> However the recent book ''The Roar of the Crowd'' by David Ross shows the record attendance to actually be 15,467 for a Scottish Cup 5th round match against Celtic on 5 February 1955. Celtic won the game 4–2. In recent times, the record figure is a more modest 5,050 for a Second Division match against [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]] in May 1992.<ref name="names" /> With the current capacity just over 3,000, the figure looks unlikely to be beaten.
