The '''Derry County Board''' of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) ({{lang-ga|Cumann Lúthchleas Gael Coiste Chontae Dhoire}}) or '''Derry GAA''' is one of the 32 county boards of the GAA in [[Ireland]]. It is responsible for [[Gaelic games]] in [[County Londonderry]] in [[Northern Ireland]] (the GAA refers to the [[Counties of Ireland|county]] as Derry).<ref>See for example [http://derrygaa.ie/contact-us/ "Contact Us"] page on Derry GAA website</ref> The county board is also responsible for the Derry inter-county teams. 

[[Gaelic football]] is the most popular of the county board's Gaelic games. The [[List of Gaelic Games terminology#S|senior]] football team won an [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] in [[1993 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1993]], and has also won six [[National Football League (Ireland)|National League]] titles and seven [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championships]].

==Information==

===History===
Within a year of the GAA's foundation in 1884, GAA clubs were established around the county in [[Derry]], [[Desertmartin]] and [[Magherafelt]].<ref name="Corry">{{cite book
| last=Corry
| first=Eoghan
| title=Oakboys
| year=1993
| publisher=Torc Books Ltd.
| location=Dublin, Ireland
}}</ref> However, the administration of Gaelic sports in the county took some time to get properly organised. A Derry county board was established in 1888 and paid affiliation fees to the GAA Central Council. By the following year, although 14 clubs were active, the then GAA President [[Maurice Davin]] told the national Congress that the county lacked enough clubs to have its own board. South Derry and North Derry regional boards were established in the 1890s. In the early decades (up to the 1930s), the Derry GAA competitions took in a number of clubs from [[County Donegal]] and Tyrone. At various times clubs in South Derry played in the [[Antrim GAA]] or Tyrone leagues. The local [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Derry|Catholic Church]]'s opposition to playing games on Sundays hampered growth in the 1890s, but there was something of a revival in the 1900s, especially in hurling. The county also competed sporadically in the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Football Championship]] from 1904. After the disruption caused by political conflict in the 1910s and early '20s, the county board was re-established briefly in 1926, and definitively in 1929, since when it has remained in existence.<ref name = "Corry"/>

===General===
Derry home games are played at [[Celtic Park (Derry)|Celtic Park]] in [[Derry]], which is the county ground.<ref name="GL screen feb 09">{{cite news |first=Ronan |last=Scott |title='Screen to win back hearts of Derry fans |work=Gaelic Life |page=3 |date=13 February 2009 }}</ref> Home football games are also sometimes held in Watty Graham Park, [[Glen GAC|Glen]] or Dean McGlinchey Park, [[Ballinascreen GAC|Ballinascreen]], which are regarded as secondary stadia.<ref name="GL screen feb 09"/> Hurling games are also held at [[Lavey GAC|Lavey]] or Fr McNally Park, [[Banagher GAC|Banagher]]. The current senior football manager is [[Brian McIver]] of [[Ballinderry GAC|Balinderry]], while [[Ger Rogan]] has been appointed Derry senior hurling manager for the incoming season. Both managers also take charge of their respective Under 21 County teams. The Minor football manager is Barry Dillon, while Dee Doherty is in charge of the Minor hurlers.

===Structure===
The GAA in the county is administered by a County Committee (or County Board) with a representative from each GAA club in the County, a Management Committee and a variable number of sub-committees.<ref name="ulster gaa"/> The county administrative headquarters and centre of excellence are located at Owenbeg, [[Dungiven]].<ref name="ulster gaa"/>

==Inter-county football==
[[Image:Derry 1958 All-Ireland finalists.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The Derry starting 15 which finished lost to Dublin in the 1958 All-Ireland final]]
In 1947 Derry won the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]]. The group leaders were invited to play in the League semi-finals because heavy snow had disrupted the competition. Francie Niblock scored one of the finest goals in League history in [[Croke Park]] as Derry beat [[Clare GAA|Clare]]. In 1958, the county won its first ever [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] and caused a massive shock in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1958|that year's All-Ireland]] semi-final, beating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] thanks to a [[Sean O'Connell]] goal three minutes from the end. In the final, Derry scored a goal ten minutes into the second half through Owen Gribben, but [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] secured victory with Paddy Farnan and Johnny Joyce goals.

In 1965 the Derry [[List of Gaelic Games terminology#M|Minor]] team won the [[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship|All-Ireland Minor Championship]], and three years later at [[List of Gaelic Games terminology#U|Under 21]] the bulk of that team captured the [[All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship|All-Ireland Under 21 Championship]]. Derry won the Ulster Senior Championship three times in the 1970s (1970, 1975 and 1976), but failed to advance past the All-Ireland semi-final stage on each occasion. In 1973 [[Anthony McGurk]] became the first player from Derry to be awarded an [[GAA All Stars Awards|All Star Award]].

The 1980s saw the county win two further All-Ireland Minor Championships (1983 and 1989) and their fifth Ulster Senior Championship (1987).

The 1990s was the county's most successful decade ever. They won the county's second National League title in 1992, before winning the Ulster Championship and the county's first ever [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1993|All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 1993]]. Derry won back-to-back National Leagues in 1995 and 1996, and the Under 21s won the 1997 All-Ireland Under 21 Championship. In 1998 Derry won another Ulster Senior Championship. The Derry side of the 1990s has been rated as one of the best of the last 20 years and would have achieved more only a couple of shock defeats such as Down in 1994, Tyrone in 1995 and Cavan in 1997.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Rodgers |title=Experts say Tyrone rank among the best |work=Gaelic Life |pages=20–21 |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate= |url= }}</ref>

Derry won the 2000 National League and the county's Minors won their fourth All-Ireland Minor Championship in 2002. Derry won the [[National Football League (Ireland) 2008|2008 National League]]; their sixth in all. In recent years they have been overshadowed in the Ulster Senior Championship by the emergence of [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] and [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]], but having topped Division 2 of the NFL in 2013, Derry returns to the Division 1 for the 2014 season.

==Hurling==

[[Image:Mark Craig - Ulster U-21 Hurling Championship 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mark Craig lifting the trophy for the 2008 [[Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship]]]]
[[Derry]] was a hotbed of early hurling activity, with the city's St Patrick's club winning the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1902-03; county teams mainly drawn from the city won the 1906 championship by a walkover, and the contested 1909 final. However, soon afterwards Gaelic football become the dominant sport in the county, and hurling activity declined, especially in the city where soccer clubs were active.<ref>{{cite book | first=Eoghan | last=Corry |authorlink=Eoghan Corry | title=Oakboys: Derry’s Football Dream Come True | publisher=Torc Books Ltd. | location=Dublin, Ireland | year=1993 | pages=54–61 | isbn=1-898142-10-6 }}</ref>

It was the 1970s before Derry claimed any more major hurling honours. The county won two [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship|Ulster Junior Championship]]s in 1974 and 1975, as well as the 1975 [[All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland Junior Championship]]. The Minors also won the [[Ulster Minor Hurling Championship|Ulster Minor Championship]] twice during the decade in 1973/4? and 1979, before going on to win the next four at the start of the 1980s (1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983); giving the county five Ulster Minor titles in a row. Derry also won another Ulster Junior (1984) and All-Ireland Junior Championship (1982), with Rory Stevenson still holding a record of his own, as the youngest person ever to play in a Final in Croke Park, that year (1982), playing for Kevin Lynch's Hurling Club Under 14 All-Ireland Féile na nGael Winning team.

The 1990s started with Derry claiming back-to-back Ulster Minor titles in 1990 and 1991. The Under 21 side won two more Ulster Under 21 Championships in 1993 and 1997. Derry won the All-Ireland 'B' Senior Hurling Championship in 1996 and the [[Ulster Intermediate Hurling Championship|Ulster Intermediate Championship]] the following year.

Derry has 40 affiliated clubs; 32 football, 2 hurling and 6 dual.<ref name="ulster gaa">{{cite web |url=http://ulster.gaa.ie/county/derry/ |title=Derry profile |accessdate=2008-04-01 |format= |work=[[Ulster GAA|Ulster Council website]] }}</ref> Many, or even most Derry GAA followers taken a keener interest in the club scene than the inter-county scene,<ref>{{cite news |first=Ronan |last=Scott |title=Mind the gap... |work=Gaelic Life |page=12 |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate= |quote= |url= }}</ref> which can adversely affect attendances at Derry senior matches. The [[Derry Senior Football Championship]] is an annual club competition between the top Derry clubs. It is recognised as one of the hardest club championships to get out of successfully in Ireland, as there are so many teams like, [[Ballinderry Shamrocks|Ballinderry]], [[Bellaghy GAC|Bellaghy]], [[An Lúb CLG|An Lúb]], [[Slaughtneil GAC|Slaughtneil]], [[Dungiven GAC|Dungiven]] and [[Glenullin GAC|Glenullin]] who have a realistic chance of success each year.  Attendances at matches are particularly high, with many neutrals from [[County Tyrone]] also going to matches, as many view it as the highest standard of club football in Ulster. The winners of the Derry Championship qualify to represent their county in the [[Ulster Senior Club Football Championship]] and if they win, go on to the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]].{{outdated section|date=November 2013}} The [[2010 Derry Senior Football Championship|current]] (2010) Derry County Champions are Coleraine who defeated Ballinderry in the final. [[Bellaghy GAC|Bellaghy]], [[Lavey GAC|Lavey]] and [[Ballinderry GAC|Ballinderry]] have won the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship|All Ireland Club Championship]], St Columbs and St Pats Maghera won the [[Hogan Cup]], while St Pius have more recently won the MacLarnon and All Ireland B at senior level.

The [[Derry Senior Club Hurling Championship]] is the hurling equivalent, with [[Kevin Lynch's Hurling Club|Kevin Lynch's]] the defending champions (2008).

==Camogie==
'''Derry Camogie''' operates as a sister body of Derry GAA, but along with [[Ladies Gaelic football]], [[GAA Handball|handball]] and the GAA county board, the Derry camogie clubs are working towards greater integration among the [[Gaelic games]] units in the county.<ref>[http://derrycamogie.ie/2012/09/ag-munlu-ar-dtimpeallachta-shaping-our-environment/ Derry Camogie] website</ref>

===History===
As early as 1934, there were ten Derry camogie clubs.<ref name="oakboys_page92-93">{{cite book | first=Eoghan | last=Corry |authorlink=Eoghan Corry | title=Oakboys: Derry’s Football Dream Come True | publisher=Torc Books Ltd. | location=Dublin, Ireland | year=1993 | pages=92–93 | isbn=1-898142-10-6 }}</ref> Derry drew with [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in the Maguire Cup in 1954, and built on this progress to beat Antrim in that year's Ulster Senior Camogie Championship final by 5-02 to 2-02 - the county's first Ulster Senior Camogie Championship title.<ref name="oakboys_page92-93"/> They went on to defeat [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] and [[London GAA|London]] en route to the [[All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship]] final.<ref name="oakboys_page92-93"/> However they were beaten by an impressive [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] side, who had not lost a competitive match since 1947, on a scoreline of 10-04 to 4-02.<ref name="oakboys_page92-93"/> Theresa Halferty, Carrie Rankin, Patsy McCloskey and Pat O'Brien from this team were chosen on the [[Ulster GAA|Ulster]] team for the inaugural [[Gael Linn Cup]] inter-provincial series, but Derry's appearance in the 1954 All-Ireland decider did little to further the game in the county.<ref name="oakboys_page92-93"/> Derry won the Ulster championship and contested the [[All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship]] final in 1954. They had previously defeated Antrim in the first round of the 1948 championship, but then surprisingly lost to Down.

Derry reached the final of the [[All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship|All Ireland intermediate championship]] in 2001, and won the [[All-Ireland Junior Camogie Championship]] four times, in 1969, 1978, 2000 and 2007.
