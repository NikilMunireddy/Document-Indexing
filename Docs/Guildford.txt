==History==

===Etymology===
The root of the first part may be the word "gold" rather than ''[[wikt:@Special:Search/guild|Guild]]'', a society or meeting of tradesmen: the only known 10th century (Saxon) record uses Guldeford and in the 11th century Geldeford<ref name=malden/>{{refn|''Geldefort'', ''Geldesfort'', ''Gildeforda'', ''Gildeforde'' (12th century); ''Geldeford'', ''Guldeford'' (13th and 14th centuries); ''Gylford'' and ''Guldeford'' (15th and 16th centuries); ''Guildeford'', ''Gildford'', ''Gilford'', and ''Gillford'' (16th and 18th centuries).<ref name=malden/>|group= n}}; both meaning gold and ford. Local historians with an interest in [[toponym]]s cite the lack of gold in the region's sedimentary rocks and have suggested that the mention of "gold" may refer to golden flowers found by the ford itself,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Good Move Guide : Guildford History|url=http://www.thegoodmoveguide.com/Locations/Surrey/Boroughs/Guildford/leisure/guildfordhistory.htm|accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref> or the golden sand;<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Guildford|url=http://www.localhistories.org/guildford.html|accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref> several older sources such as [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Lewis's]] topological dictionary of 1848 prefer and give an unreferenced assertion there was a guild.<ref name=sl>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50993 |title=Groton – Gunnerton |author=Samuel Lewis (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1848 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of England |accessdate=29 October 2012 }}</ref> There is an old coaching inn on the Epsom Road previously called the "Sanford Arms", which may derive from "Sand Ford", adding weight to the suggestion that the first part of "Guildford" and its many historic predecessors may refer to the very distinctive golden sand showing on the banks of the River Wey where it cuts through the sandy outcrop just south of the town.<ref>{{cite web|title=Travel and Tourism Gossip : Guildford |url=http://www.travelandtourism-gossip.com/2011/10/guildford-hotels/ |accessdate=24 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120111161036/http://www.travelandtourism-gossip.com/2011/10/guildford-hotels/ |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}</ref>

===Early settlement===
In [[Sir Thomas Malory]]'s 1485 fictional series ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Guildford is identified with [[Astolat]] of [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] renown;<ref name=garc>Guildford- A Residential Centre. The official Guide of the Corporation of Guildford. 11th Ed. 1946</ref> however only rural Celtic [[Bronze Age]] pieces have been found in the town.<ref>[http://www.websqueak.co.uk/sas/ Catalogue of Surrey Archaeological Society]<br>early evidence is such as ''Bronze Age and Roman farming and settlement at Christ's College School, Guildford'' 40 pages, Spoilheap Publications, Woking ISBN 0955884667 radiocarbon dated finds.

Some of the tiles built into [[Guildford Castle]] may be Roman, and a Roman villa has been found on Broad Street Common<ref name=malden/> at the end of Roman Farm Road just west of Guildford's Park Barn neighbourhood.<ref>[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/mapsearch.aspx Ordnance Survey Map: Roman Villa at coordinates 51.2505,-0.613004]</ref>

===The Dark and Middle Ages===

It is proven by [[archaeology]] and contemporary accounts that Guildford was established as a small town by [[Saxons|Saxon]] settlers shortly after [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authority had been [[Roman Britain|removed from Britain]]{{refn|c. AD 410|group= n}}. The settlement was most likely expanded because of the [[Harrow Way]] (an [[ancient trackway]] connecting the ancient cities of [[Winchester]] and [[Canterbury]]) crosses the [[River Wey]] by a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] at this point.

[[Alfred the Great]], the first [[Anglo-Saxon]] king of unified [[England]], named the town in his will.<ref name=malden/> Guildford was the location of the [[Royal Mint]] from 978 until part-way through the reign of [[William the Conqueror]].<ref name=malden/><ref name=garc />

[[File:Guildford castle 1.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Guildford Castle]]]]
[[Guildford Castle]] is of [[Norman England|Norman]] design, although there are no documents about its earliest years.<ref name=gbc>{{cite web|title=Guildford Borough Council : History of Guildford Castle|url=http://www.guildford.gov.uk/article/7576/History-of-Guildford-Castle|accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref> Its situation overlooks the pass through the hills taken by the [[Pilgrims' Way]], and also once overlooked the ancient ford across the Wey, thus giving a key point of military control of this long distance way across the country.<ref name=malden/> {{refn|Other regional tall fortress castles include [[Windsor Castle]], on the Thames quite close to the [[A4 road (England)|Bath Road]], [[Farnham Castle]] one of the same axes, [[Arundel Castle]] surveying the Arun and the [[Tower of London]] surveying ships moving up the [[Thames]]|group= n}}.

Guildford appears in [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Geldeford'' and ''Gildeford'', a holding of [[William the Conqueror]]. The King officially held the 75 hagae (houses enclosed in fences or closes) in which lived 175 homagers (heads of household) and the town rendered £32.<ref>[http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SU9949/guildford/ Domesday Book entry of 1086.]</ref> Stoke, a suburb within today's Guildford, appears in the Book as ''Stoch'' and was also held by William. Its Domesday assets were: 1 church, 2 [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s worth 5[[shilling|s]], 16 [[ploughland]]s with two Lord's plough teams and 20 mens plough teams, {{convert|16|acre|m2}} of [[meadow]], and [[woodland]] worth 40 [[hog (swine)|hog]]s. Stoke was listed as being in the King's park, with a rendering of £15.<ref>[http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SU9950/stoke/ Domesday Book entry of 1086.]</ref><ref>[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book]</ref>

William the Conqueror had the castle built in the classic [[Norman architecture|Norman]] style; the castle keep still stands. A major purpose of Norman castle building was to overawe the conquered population. It had £26 spent on it in 1173 under the regency of the young Henry II.<ref>[[Pipe rolls|Pipe R.]] 20 [[Henry II of England|Hen. II]]</ref>  As the threat of invasion and insurrection declined, the castle's status was demoted to that of a royal hunting lodge: Guildford was, at that time, at the edge of [[Windsor Great Park]]. It was visited on several occasions by [[John I of England|King John]], [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].<ref name=garc /> In 1611 the castle was granted to Francis Carter<ref>[[Patent Rolls|Pat. Roll]] 9 [[James I of England|James I]] pt. iii, manuscript 5</ref> whose grandson's initials EC and the year 1699 were above the entrance way.<ref name=sl/> The surviving parts of the castle were restored in Victorian times and again in 2004; the rest of the grounds became a public garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guildford.gov.uk/castle| title=Guildford Borough Council Website: Castle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.castlexplorer.co.uk/england/guildford/guildford.php |

In 1995, a chamber was discovered in the High Street, which is considered to be the remains of the 12th century [[Guildford Synagogue]].<ref>[[Sharman Kadish]], Jewish Architectural Heritage in England, English Heritage, 2006, p. 69.</ref><ref name=synagogue>{{cite web|url=http://www.guildfordjewish.com/index_files/Page317.htm|title=History of Guildford Jews|publisher=Guildford Jewish Community|accessdate=24 December 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929212326/http://www.guildfordjewish.com/index_files/Page317.htm |archivedate = 29 September 2007}}</ref> While this remains a matter of contention, it is likely to be the oldest remaining synagogue in Western Europe.<ref name=synagogue />

Guildford elected two members of the [[Unreformed House of Commons]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Constituencies in the unreformed House|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/prereform.html|accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref> From the 14th century to the 18th century the [[borough corporation]] prospered with the wool trade.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guildford Borough Council : The Wool Trade|url=http://www.guildford.gov.uk/article/3495/The-wool-trade|accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref>

In the 14th century the [[Guildford Guildhall|Guildhall]] was constructed and still stands today as a noticeable landmark of Guildford. The north end was extended in 1589 and the Council Chamber was added in 1683. In 1683 a projecting clock was made for the front of the building: it can be seen throughout the High Street.

===Post Renaissance/Dissolution of the Monasteries===

In 1598, a court case referred to a sport called ''kreckett'' being played at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]]. The school was built in 1509 and became Royal gaining the patronage of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] in 1552.<ref name=sl/> The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] gives this as the first recorded instance of [[cricket]] in the English language.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Cricket|url=http://www.infobritain.co.uk/History_Of_Cricket.htm|accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Birley|first=Derek|title=A Social History of English Cricket|year=1999|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=1-85410-941-3|page=5}}</ref>
[[File:Guildford alms houses 1.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The Hospital of the Holy Trinity still has a charitable role in modern society]]

[[File:River Wey & Canal at Guildford.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The [[River Wey]] in Guildford is canalised into the [[Wey Navigation]]]]
One of the greatest boosts to Guildford's prosperity came in 1653 with the completion, after many wrangles, of the Wey Navigation. This allowed Guildford businesses to access the Thames at [[Weybridge]] by boat, and predated the major canal building program in Britain by more than a century. In 1764 the navigation was extended as far as [[Godalming]] and in 1816 to the sea near Arundel via the [[Wey and Arun Canal|Wey and Arun Junction Canal]] and the Arun Navigation. The [[Basingstoke Canal]] also was built to connect with the Wey navigation, putting Guildford in the centre of a network of waterways.

A six-mile (10&nbsp;km) branch of the [[South West Main Line|London and South-Western Railway]] from [[Woking]] to Guildford was opened in May 1845. In 1846, Acts were passed for making two railways from Guildford: one leading to Godalming, and the other to Farnham and Alton; and in the same year, an Act was obtained for a [[Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway|railway from Reading, via Guildford, to Dorking and Reigate]].<ref name=sl/>  All of these followed in the 19th century<ref name=malden/> and remain in use.<ref>[http://www.nationalrail.co.uk National Rail route search]</ref>

From 1820 to 1865 Guildford was the scene of severe outbursts of semi-organised lawlessness commonly known as the "Guy Riots". The Guys would mass on the edge of the town from daybreak on [[Guy Fawkes Night]], wearing masks or bizarre disguises and armed with clubs and lighted torches. At nightfall they would enter the town and avenge themselves on those who had crossed them in the preceding year by committing assaults and damaging property, often looting the belongings of victims from their houses and burning them on bonfires in the middle of the street. In later years attempts to suppress the Guys led to the deaths of two police officers. In 1866 and 1868 the Guys were dispersed by cavalry and this seems to have brought an end to the riots. Similar disorder surrounding the St Catherine's Hill Fair, held just outside the town on the Pilgrims' Way, was suppressed around the same time.<ref>{{Cite book| title=The Guildford Guy Riots| author=Gavin Morgan|year=1992|publisher= Northside Books |isbn=978-0-9520205-0-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/bonfire-night/features/the-guildford-guy-riots | title= icons.org.uk The Guildford Guy Riots}}</ref> In 1906 the Guildford Union Workhouse Casuals Ward ("The Spike") was built on the grounds of the Workhouse near the castle; today The Spike is a tourist attraction.<ref>[http://www.visitsurrey.com/things-to-do/guildford-union-workhouse-the-spike-p404781 Surrey Council Council's tourist pages – The Spike]</ref>

After the death of their father in 1882, brothers Charles Arthur and Leonard Gates took over the running of his shop, which held the local distribution franchise for [[Gilbey's]] wines and spirits, and also sold beer. However, in 1885, the brothers were persuaded to join the [[temperance movement in England|temperance movement]], and they poured their entire stock into the gutters of the High Street. Left with no livelihood, they converted their now empty shop into a dairy. Using a [[milk separator]], they bought milk from local farmers, and after extracting the cream and whey, sold the skim back to the farmers for pig feed. In 1888 three more of the Gates brothers and their sons joined the business, which led to the formal registration of the company under the name of the [[West Surrey Central Dairy Company]], which after development of its [[dried milk]] baby formula in 1906 became [[Cow & Gate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wincantonplc.com/wincanton/history.jsp?tn=1&sn=1|title=History & Business|publisher=Wincanton Plc|accessdate=26 April 2008}}</ref>

In May 1968 students at [[Guildford School of Art]] began a "sit-in" at the School in [[Stoke Park, Guildford|Stoke Park]] which lasted until mid-summer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On 5 October 1974, bombs planted by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] [[Guildford pub bombing|went off in two Guildford pubs]], killing four off-duty soldiers and a civilian. The pubs were targeted because soldiers from the barracks at [[Pirbright]] were known to frequent them.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk Study by the University of Ulster]</ref> The subsequently arrested suspects, who became known as the [[Guildford Four]], were convicted and sentenced to long prison sentences in October 1975. They claimed to have been [[torture]]d by the police and denied involvement in the bombing. In 1989 after a long legal battle, their convictions were overturned and they were released.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/19/newsid_2490000/2490039.stm | title=BBC News: 19&nbsp;October 1989 | accessdate=12 February 2007 | date=19 October 1989}}</ref>

=== County town ===

Guildford is sometimes described as the [[county town]] of Surrey, but it is not clear whether this is the case or not.  The issue is not made easier because sources disagree over the definition of a county town.  Most sources state that the county town is the administrative centre for the county, but local government undergoes frequent reorganisation and what was once the county town may no longer be the administrative centre.<ref>http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/maps/uktowns.htm "They were the administrative centre for local government, the market town, and the largest town in the county. However, local government has been reorganised more than once, and today the county towns are not necessarily the adminstrative (sic) centre of the county"</ref>  Surrey County Council has no administrative presence in Guildford but is located at [[Kingston upon Thames]], which became part of Greater London in the 1960s, though the above cite claims Guildford as the county town.  

There appears to be no requirement that a county town actually has to be within the borders of the county, and the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines 'county town' as, ''"The town that is the administrative capital of a county''",<ref>http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/county-town</ref>  a description which would disqualify Guildford. There are claims that [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] granted the status of county town when he made Guildford the custody of the standard measures.<ref>https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sbcuAAAAIAAJ&rdid=book-sbcuAAAAIAAJ&rdot=1A Collection of Statutes Connected with the General Administration of the Law: Arranged According to the Order of Subjects, with Notes, Volume 8 page 344 "''The Names of Towns limited for the safe Custody of Weights and Measures according to the King's Standard for the Shires following, as particularly appeareth ... Surr. The Town of Guilford"''</ref>  However, the statute does not explicitly state that this makes the settlement a county town.

Guildford's previous official historian claims that Guildford was granted the ''"ancient [[High Sheriff of Surrey|county court]] in Guildford by a grant of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1257, marking Guildford’s status as county town of Surrey",''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guildford.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=918&p=0 |publisher=Guildford Borough Council |title=Medieval Guildford—''"Henry III confirmed Guildford's status as the county town of Surrey in 1257"'' |accessdate=30 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131101054620/http://www.guildford.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=918&p=0 |archivedate=1 November 2013 }}</ref> but it has been argued that this status is an inaccurate interperatation by said historian, and that it is not backed up by the original documentation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} 

Whilst there are sources that claim Guildford as the county town there are many others such as Whitaker's almanack that assign this definition to Kingston upon Thames, with others stating that it is not clear. Neither [[Guildford Borough Council]] nor [[Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council|Kingston Council]] make any claim for their town being the county town.

==Education==

===State schools===
As for the rest of Surrey, Guildford's state schools operate a two/three age groups system. Primary schools in the town include Holy Trinity (which merged with Pewley Down in 1995), Burpham, St Thomas of Canterbury (Catholic) and Goldford Grove. Amongst the [[Junior school]]s are Bushy Hill, Northmead Junior and Queen Eleanor's C of E. Secondary schools include [[George Abbot School|George Abbot]], [[Guildford County School]], [[St. Peter's School, Guildford|St Peter's]], [[King's College, Guildford|King's College]] and [[Christ's College, Guildford|Christ's College]].

===Independent schools===

The best-known school in Guildford itself is the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Royal Grammar School]]. The 'old school' building, which was constructed over the turn of the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Elizabethan period|Elizabethan]] periods and houses a [[chained library]], lies towards the top of High Street. The school was established in 1509. Nearby is the prep school [[Lanesborough School]] which is the choir school for [[Guildford Cathedral]] and has had a long association with the Royal Grammar School. Other independent schools include [[Guildford High School]], [[Tormead School]] and [[Rydes Hill Preparatory School]].

===Higher education===
The campus of the [[University of Surrey]] is in Guildford. Battersea College of Technology (previously the Battersea Polytechnic Institute) moved to the town in 1966, gaining a [[Royal Charter]] in order to award its own degrees and changing its name to its current title.

The town is home to the inaugural campus of [[The University of Law]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-law.co.uk/about_us/about-1334.html|title=A Brief History 1960's|publisher=The College of Law|accessdate=20 March 2008}}</ref> and to the [[Guildford School of Acting]]. Other institutions in Guildford include [[Guildford College|Guildford College of Further and Higher Education]] (which also occupies the site of the former [[Guildford School of Art]]), [[Academy of Contemporary Music]] and the [[Italia Conti]] Arts Centre.

==Administration==
The town of Guildford forms part of the larger area administered by the [[Guildford (borough)|borough of Guildford]], which in turn forms part of the county of [[Surrey]]. Whilst the rest of the borough's area is split into [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es, the urban area of Guildford in unparished. Thus, within the town of Guildford, the Borough Council takes the role of both first and second tier local authority, whilst the County Council forms the third tier of local authority.

Though often referred to as a city Guildford is a town, but has applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] several times. Guildford's 2002 application to be granted the [[City status in the United Kingdom|status of a city]] was unsuccessful, losing out to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], the only English town that was formally recognised as a city as part of the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s Golden Jubilee celebrations. Traditionally, the establishment of a [[List of Church of England dioceses|diocesan cathedral]] in a town conferred city status. Guildford is a significant economic hub in Surrey, a county with no cities.

[[File:Guildford & Cathedral of Surrey.JPG|thumb|350px|left|Guildford Cathedral]]

Although Guildford was historically the county town for [[Surrey]], the council itself has its administrative base in [[Kingston upon Thames]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/County+Hall?opendocument | title= Surrey County Council Website: County Hall | accessdate=12 February 2007}}</ref> which, although formerly in Surrey, is now in [[Greater London]]. Public sector organisations of note that have headquarters in Guildford include [[Surrey Police]], the [[South East England Development Agency]] and the [[Government Office|Government Office for the South East]].

Politically, the [[Guildford (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Guildford]] is thought of as a traditional Conservative seat. However, for the first time in over ninety years, the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] returned a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Member of Parliament, [[Sue Doughty]]. The 2003 [[Guildford local elections|Borough Elections]] returned a majority council for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]], replacing the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]-controlled council. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] Guildford returned a Conservative Party [[Member of parliament|MP]], [[Anne Milton]] – by a narrow margin (0.7% of the voting electorate, or 347 votes) and despite a 0.5% rise in the Liberal Democrat vote. The Conservatives also held the council majority in the local elections of 2007.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/councils/html/43ud.stm | title= BBC News- Election 2007– Local Council Elections- Guildford Council| accessdate=4 May 2007 |date=4 May 2007}}</ref>

==Localities==

===Bellfields===
Bellfields is a suburb in the north of Guildford lying adjacent to Slyfield Industrial Estate and Stoughton. The area includes private estates as well as current and former social housing estates. Christ's College, Guildford's senior school and Pond Meadow special needs school are in Bellfields. The neighbourhood includes [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/stoke-hill-st-peter/ St Peter's Shared Church]. Guildford Children's Centre is here and has many pupils.<ref>[http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=summary&id=133731 Ofsted report of Guildford Children's Centre]</ref>

===Burpham===
This now very large village attached to Guildford has its own article, see [[Burpham, Surrey|Burpham]]

===Charlotteville===
Charlotteville is the area south-east of the town. It is loosely bound between Shalford Road and Sydenham Road, and encompasses the beauty spot of Pewley Down. A number of public footpaths lead from the town through Charlotteville to the downs and towards St Martha's Hill and Albury. It houses great many cottages and a few large, mostly privately owned properties and has the town's main cycling club founded in 1903. Guildford's mayor was its first president. The estate was funded by a wealthy doctor, Thomas Sells, laid out by the Guildford architect Henry Peak in 1862, and named after Sells's wife, Charlotte.

====Workhouse====
Uniquely the Union Workhouse Casual Ward has been converted into a remarkable community centre and is a hub of activity day and night, home to the Montessori School, the centre for all manner of activities; physical, artistic, musical and creative. The adjacent St Luke’s surgery and Boots the Chemist provides Medical care, thus all generations seemingly catered for.  
The Heritage Centre historically known as the Spike has been restored in part to retell the fate of the vagrant and indeed, the casuals, many of whom had a large part to play in the building of this Town.
A strong sense of belonging exists in Charlotteville and just 150 years after the village was founded it continues to flourish as a community.{{citation needed|reason=un-sourced assertions; unique,remarkable,hub of activity etc|date=September 2014}}

====Conservation Area====
The official designation of the heart of Charlotteville as a [[Conservation Area]] means that Peak’s work may survive. The development introduced institutions such as the Cork Club, a cycling club [[Charlotteville Cycling Club]] and the charity Charlotteville Jubilee Trust, formed at the time of the Golden Jubilee. Two modern schools have been established in the village. The last of the shops closed in 2006.

====Workhouse and Hospital====
1930 hailed the end of the Poor Laws and Guildford Union [[Workhouse]], next to Cooper Road (named after [[Samuel Cooper]] (surgeon)) was renamed Warren Road Hospital playing a vital role in the World War II war effort it received victims of the [[London Blitz|London air raids]] and specifically [[Dunkirk]] and [[D-Day]] victims. The Spike, a vagrants and casuals ward, continued as an overnight shelter for the homeless until 1963.

====St Luke's Hospital====
With the arrival of the [[Welfare State]] the hospital changed its name again, this time to St Luke's Hospital and was soon a leading Cancer and Nurses Teaching Hospital. Coyle Community Hall was built and shared with the Charlotteville community. 
The 1990s saw St Luke’s Hospital moving to the newly built Royal Surrey County Hospital leaving the site to Crest Homes and within days Charlotteville once again found itself without a community centre.

====The Spike====
Due to be demolished in 2003 and replaced by a new Community Centre the Spike Casual Ward was surprisingly, bestowed with Grade II listing and has been converted into a community and Heritage Centre open to the public.<ref>http://www.charlotteville.co.uk</ref> The Spike retains the only stone breaking cells that can be viewed by the public in the country.

===Guildford Park and Dennisville===
These small residential neighbourhoods are immediately south of and generally below ''Cathedral Hill'' also known as ''Stag Hill''. Both neighbourhoods are close to Guildford Train station to the southeast and become without division Onslow Village to the south. As the University occupies the top and north of Stag Hill, many residents here study at the [[University of Surrey]].

It has a small [[village]] centre, with a parade of shops and a village hall. Onslow has one infant school, Onslow Infant School, as well as Queen Eleanor's School, a primary school. Onslow also has its own church, All Saints.

Onslow Village also has its own football team called Onslow FC established in 1986.

The Village also has a [[Residents' association]], the Onslow Village Residents' Association (OVRA) which was set up in 1956 and whose object is to "safeguard the amenities of Onslow village and to promote the welfare, interests and well-being of the residents".<ref>[http://www.surreycommunity.info/ovra OVRA website]</ref> Onslow Village Society formed with the aim to tackle the acute shortage of decent working class housing following the [[First World War]].

Onslow Village Ltd acquired 646 acres (just over one square mile) of land from [[Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow]] in 1920 for approximately one quarter of its market value at the time. The aim was to create a "Garden City" to be modelled on the ideas of [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s [[Garden City Movement]]. It was their intention to build a self-contained community with smallholdings, public buildings, open spaces, recreation grounds, woodland and a railway station, as well as developing sites for churches, hotels and factories. On Saturday 1 May 1920, ten weeks after the formation of the Society, the foundations of the first two houses were laid and by March 1922 ninety-one houses had been built. Unfortunately due to a lack of funding the scheme never reached full completion, with about 600 houses actually being built. Original drawings however showed that there were further plans to develop the farmland at Manor Farm, north of the A3. By the mid-1970s, one third of the properties were still owned by Onslow Village Ltd. Then, in 1984, the company was wound up and many shareholders and tenants had the chance to buy their homes at extremely affordable prices.<ref name=ov>[http://www.onslowvillage.net history section of Onslow Village website]</ref>

Onslow Village never got its railway station, however it did eventually get its woodland: the Onslow arboretum, developed by Guildford Borough Council as a specialist collection of eighty tree species from around the world. The Onslow arboretum is positioned right next to the play area with its own park, a large field, several tennis courts, toilets and a scout hut.<ref name=ov/>

===Slyfield===
Is the small mixed land use area north of Guildford that is largely indeterminate from Bellfields, however to its east is Guildford's largest industrial and commercial park, Slyfield Industrial Estate. There was a cattle market held in the south of the industrial area until 2000 which moved to [[Maidstone, Kent]].<ref>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/business/s/82869_market_makes_a_successful_move_to_kent The Reading Chronicle story on cattle market.]</ref> Slyfield has a community hall and a school. To the north of Slyfield is Stoke Hill, on top of which is a park, Stringer's Common, across which is the [[Jacobs Well, Surrey|Jacobs Well]] neighbourhood which is part of Worplesdon civil parish.

===Stoke===
The central northern area of the town contains Stoke Park and the historic manor of Stoke at its centre, now the site of [[Guildford College]].

==Transport==

===Rail===
The town has two railway stations. The [[Guildford railway station, Surrey|main station]] is on the west side of the River Wey, across the river from the main shopping area and the bus station. It is on the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] between [[London Waterloo station|London Waterloo]] and [[Portsmouth]] Harbour. There are also direct lines to [[Aldershot]]; [[Reading railway station|Reading]]; [[Gatwick Airport]] via [[Dorking, Surrey|Dorking]] and [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]]; and alternative London routes via [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham and Stoke D'Abernon]] and [[Epsom]]. There is currently one daily long-distance service to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], via [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Oxford]], [[Birmingham]], [[Derby]], [[Sheffield]], [[Doncaster]] and [[York]].

Guildford's other station, [[London Road (Guildford) railway station|London Road]], is about half a mile (1&nbsp;km) north-east of the town centre, on the [[New Guildford Line]]. It is served by stopping services only between Guildford and [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]]: there are four trains an hour each way (two on Sunday), two via [[Cobham & Stoke d'Abernon railway station|Cobham]], and two Waterloo services via [[Epsom railway station|Epsom]]. These services are operated by [[South West Trains]].

A few peak hour trains from both stations, operated by [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]], go to [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] via [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and to [[London Victoria station|Victoria]] via [[Selhurst railway station|Selhurst]].

===Road===
Guildford lies at the eastern end of the [[A31 road (Great Britain)|A31]] and is bypassed by the [[A3 road|A3]], which links London and [[Portsmouth]]. The [[M25 motorway|M25]] is to the north-east of the town.

===Bus===
Bus services in Guildford are primarily operated by [[Arriva Guildford & West Surrey|Arriva]], with some additional services by [[Buses Excetera]], [[Safeguard Coaches|Safeguard]] and [[Stagecoach in Hants & Surrey|Stagecoach]]. Most routes are centred on the [[Guildford bus station|bus station]], next to the Friary shopping centre. Many local bus services are circular routes (starting and ending at the bus station) with different numbers for the clockwise and anticlockwise services. There are also buses to many surrounding towns and villages such as [[Woking]] and [[Aldershot]].

As the main railway station is across the river from the bus station, only a small proportion of bus services stop at the railway station.<ref name="shuttle"/> To address this issue, the [[Guildford Shuttle]] was introduced in 2000. This was a free circular bus service linking various areas of the town centre. But it was withdrawn in August 2008 when the borough council withdrew funding for it.<ref name="shuttle">[[Surrey Advertiser]]: [http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2035761_wheels_fall_off_alternatives_to_shuttle_bus Wheels fall off alternatives to shuttle bus]</ref> The operator of the service reintroduced it in January 2009 on a commercial basis, but withdrew it again in May 2010.

There is also a [[Arriva Guildford & West Surrey#Guildford park and ride|park and ride]] service, with three main sites at Artington, Merrow and the Spectrum.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Guildford+town+park+and+ride?opendocument | title=Surrey Country Council – Guildford town park and ride | accessdate=29 September 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803022832/http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Guildford+town+park+and+ride?opendocument| archivedate = 3 August 2008}}</ref> A fourth park and ride site, close to the Surrey Sports Park, was opened in late 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/local-news/fourth-park-and-ride-site-up-running-6366202 | title=Fourth park and ride service for Guildford | accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref>
