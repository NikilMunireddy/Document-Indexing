{{Politics of the Holy See}}

The '''Holy See''' ({{lang-lat|Sancta Sedes}}; {{IPA-la|ˈsaŋkta ˈsedes|church}}) is the [[Diocese|ecclesiastical jurisdiction]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in [[Rome]], the [[episcopal see]] of the [[Pope]], and an independent [[sovereign states|sovereign entity]]. It serves as the [[Headquarters|central point of reference]] for the Catholic church everywhere and the focal point of [[communion (Christian)|communion]] due to its position as the [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|pre-eminent]] episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the [[1st century]] during the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic era]], when [[Saint Peter]] arrived in Rome to [[Evangelism|evangelise]] and forming a significant [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the [[Ecclesiastical polity|governance]] of all Catholics, organised in their [[Particular Church]]es, [[Patriarchate]]s and [[religious institute]]s.

As an independent [[sovereign states|sovereign entity]], holding the [[Vatican City]] [[enclave]] in [[Rome]] as [[Westphalian sovereignty|sovereign territory]], it maintains [[diplomatic relations]] with other states. It is viewed as analogous to a state while administered by the [[Roman Curia]] (''Latin'' for ''Roman Court''), similar to a [[centralised government]] with the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] as its [[Head of government|chief administrator]], and various [[Dicastery|dicasteries]], comparable to [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] and executive departments.

Diplomatically, the Holy See acts and speaks for the whole church. It is also recognised by other subjects of international law as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] entity, headed by the Pope, with which [[diplomatic relations]] can be maintained.<ref>http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/europe/holy-see/</ref><ref>The Holy See's sovereignty has been recognized explicitly in many international agreements and is particularly emphasized in article 2 of the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 11 February 1929, in which "Italy recognizes the sovereignty of the Holy See in international matters as an inherent attribute in conformity with its traditions and the requirements of its mission to the world" ([http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/treaty.htm Lateran Treaty, English translation]).</ref> Often informally referred to as "the Vatican", the "Holy See" is not the same entity as the "Vatican City State", which came into existence only in 1929 because of the [[Lateran Treaty]]; the Holy See, the [[Diocese of Rome|episcopal see of Rome]], dates back to antiquity. Ambassadors are officially accredited not to the Vatican City State but to "the Holy See", and [[Nuncio|Papal representatives]] to states and international organizations are recognized as representing the Holy See, not the Vatican City State.  The creation of the Vatican City state was meant to ensure the diplomatic and spiritual independence of the Pope.

Though all [[episcopal see]]s may be considered holy, the expression "the Holy See" (without further specification) is normally used in international relations (and in the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law of the Catholic Church]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P19.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law: text - IntraText CT|publisher=}}</ref> to refer to the See of Rome viewed as the central government of the Catholic Church.

==Terminology==
[[File:Roma-san giovanni03.jpg|thumb|right|The [[papal throne]] ([[cathedra]]), in the apse of [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], symbolises the Holy See.]]
Every see is considered holy. In Greek, the adjective "holy" or "sacred" ({{lang|grc|ἱερά}} transliterated as ''hiera'') is constantly applied to all such sees as a matter of course. In the West, the adjective is not commonly added, but it does form part of an official title of two sees: as well as Rome, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Bishopric of Mainz]] (the former [[Archbishopric of Mainz]]), which was also of [[prince-elector|electoral]] and [[primate (bishop)|primatial]] rank, bears the title of "the Holy See of Mainz" (Latin: ''Sancta Sedes Moguntina'').

The word "see" comes from the Latin word "sedes", meaning "seat", which refers to the Episcopal throne ([[cathedra]]). The term "[[Apostolic See]]" can refer to any see founded by one of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], but, when used with the definite article, it is used in the Catholic Church to refer specifically to the see of the Bishop of Rome, whom that Church sees as successor of [[Saint Peter]], the Prince  of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles|publisher=}}</ref> While [[Saint Peter's basilica]] in Vatican City is perhaps the church most associated with the Papacy, the actual [[cathedral]] of the Holy See is the church of [[Saint John Lateran]] within the city of Rome.<ref group=note>Although Saint John Lateran is legally within Rome, Italy, it is one of the properties of the Holy See granted [[extraterritorial privileges]].</ref>

==Organization==
{{Roman Catholicism}}
{{main|Roman Curia}}

The Pope governs the Catholic Church through the [[Roman Curia]]. The Roman Curia consists of a complex of offices that administer church affairs at the highest level, including the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]], nine [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Congregations]], three [[Ecclesiastical court|Tribunals]], eleven Pontifical Councils, and seven Pontifical Commissions. The Secretariat of State, under the Cardinal Secretary of State, directs and coordinates the Curia. The incumbent, Archbishop [[Pietro Parolin]],<ref>http://attualita.vatican.va/sala-stampa/bollettino/2013/08/31/news/31610.html</ref> is the See's equivalent of a prime minister. Archbishop [[Dominique Mamberti]], Secretary of the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State, acts as the Holy See's [[minister of foreign affairs]]. Parolin was named in his role by Pope Francis On 31 August 2013. Mamberti was named in his role by Pope Benedict XVI in September 2006.

[[File:Vatican City map EN.png|left|thumb|[[Vatican City]], the Holy See's sovereign territory]]
The Secretariat of State is the only body of the Curia that is situated within Vatican City. The others are in buildings in different parts of Rome that have extraterritorial rights similar to those of embassies.

Among the most active of the major Curial institutions are the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], which oversees the Catholic Church's doctrine; the [[Congregation for Bishops]], which coordinates the appointment of bishops worldwide; the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]], which oversees all missionary activities; and the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]], which deals with international peace and social issues.

Three tribunals exercise judicial power. The [[Roman Rota]] handles normal judicial appeals, the most numerous being those that concern alleged nullity of marriage.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P5G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canons 1443–1444]. Vatican.va. Retrieved on 11 September 2011.</ref> The [[Apostolic Signatura]] is the supreme appellate and administrative court concerning decisions even of the Roman Rota and administrative decisions of ecclesiastical superiors (bishops and superiors of [[religious institute]]s), such as closing a parish or removing someone from office. It also oversees the work of other ecclesiastical tribunals at all levels.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P5G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1445]. Vatican.va. Retrieved on 11 September 2011.</ref> The [[Apostolic Penitentiary]] deals not with external judgments or decrees, but with matters of conscience, granting absolutions from [[censure#Canon law|censures]], dispensations, commutations, validations, condonations, and other favors; it also grants [[indulgences]].<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19880628_pastor-bonus-roman-curia_en.html '&#39;Pastor bonus'&#39;, articles 117–120]. The Vatican. (28 June 1988). Retrieved on 11 September 2011.</ref>

The [[Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See]] coordinates the finances of the Holy See departments and supervises the administration of all offices, whatever be their degree of autonomy, that manage these finances. The most important of these is the [[Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See]].

The [[Prefecture of the Papal Household]] is responsible for the organization of the papal household, audiences, and ceremonies (apart from the strictly [[liturgical]] part).

The Holy See does not dissolve upon a Pope's death or resignation. It instead operates under a different set of laws ''[[sede vacante]]''. During this [[interregnum]], the heads of the [[dicasteries]] of the Roman Curia (such as the prefects of congregations) cease immediately to hold office, the only exceptions being the [[Major Penitentiary]], who continues his important role regarding absolutions and dispensations, and the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]], who administers the [[temporalities]] (''i.e.'', properties and finances) of the See of St. Peter during this period. The government of the See, and therefore of the Catholic Church, then falls to the [[College of Cardinals]]. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] prohibits the College and the Camerlengo from introducing any innovations or novelties in the government of the Church during this period.

In 2001, the Holy See had a revenue of 422.098&nbsp;billion [[Italian lire]] (about 202&nbsp;million USD at the time), and a net income of 17.720&nbsp;billion Italian lire (about 8&nbsp;million USD).<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-1900?l=english "Economic Report of the Holy See for 2000"] Zenit 6 July 2001</ref> According to an article by David Leigh in the ''Guardian'' newspaper, a 2012 report from the Council of Europe identified the value of a section of the Vatican's property assets as an amount in excess of €680m (£570m); as of January 2013, Paolo Mennini, a papal official in Rome, manages this portion of the Holy See's assets—consisting of British investments, other European holdings and a currency trading arm. The ''Guardian'' newspaper described Mennini and his role in the following manner: "... Paolo Mennini, who is in effect the pope's [[merchant bank]]er. Mennini heads a special unit inside the Vatican called the extraordinary division of APSA – ''Amministrazione del Patrimonio della Sede Apostolica'' – which handles the "patrimony of the Holy See"."<ref>{{cite news|title=How the Vatican built a secret property empire using Mussolini's millions|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/21/vatican-secret-property-empire-mussolini|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 January 2013|author=David Leigh}}</ref>

==Status in international law==
{{Main|Legal status of the Holy See}}
The Holy See has been recognized, both in state practice and in the writing of modern legal scholars, as a subject of [[public international law]], with rights and duties analogous to those of [[Sovereign state|States]]. Although the Holy See, as distinct from the Vatican City State, does not fulfill the long-established criteria in international law of [[Sovereign state|statehood]]—having a permanent population, a defined territory, a stable government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states<ref>These criteria for statehood were first authoritatively enunciated at the [[Montevideo Convention]] on Rights and Duties of States, signed by American states on 26 December 1933.</ref>—its possession of full legal personality in [[international law]] is shown by the fact that it maintains diplomatic relations with 180<ref name=DipRel>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_20010123_holy-see-relations_en.html Website Holy See] and for the most recent establishment of diplomatic relations with [http://www.vis.va/vissolr/index.php?vi=all&dl=8f6b0a1c-1038-9a5d-d4e2-5127731d72bc&dl_t=text/xml&dl_a=y&ul=1&ev=1 South Sudan (situation since 22 February 2013)]</ref> states, that it is a ''member-state''<ref>e.g. [http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/MemberStates/ IAEA], [http://www.osce.org/who/83 OSCE], [http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/about-iom-1/members-and-observers/governments/member-states.html IOM] {{wayback|url=http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/MemberStates/ |date=20071212170611 |df=y }}</ref> in various intergovernmental international organizations, and that it is: "respected by the international community of sovereign States and treated as a subject of international law having the capacity to engage in diplomatic relations and to enter into binding agreements with one, several, or many states under international law that are largely geared to establish and preserving peace in the world."<ref>[[Robert Araujo (Jurist)|Robert Araujo]] and John Lucal, Papal Diplomacy and the Quest for Peace, the Vatican and International Organizations from the early years to the League of Nations, Sapienza Press (2004), ISBN 1-932589-01-5, p. 16.

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office speaks of Vatican City as the "capital" of the Holy See, although it compares the legal personality of the Holy See to that of [[the Crown]] in Christian monarchies and declares that the Holy See and the state of Vatican City are two international identities. It also distinguishes between the employees of the Holy See (2,750 working in the [[Roman Curia]] with another 333 working in the Holy See's diplomatic missions abroad) and the 1,909 employees of the state.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/europe/holy-see/ Foreign & Commonwealth Office: Travel & living abroad] Retrieved 8 January 2011 {{wayback|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/europe/holy-see/ |date=20101231084624 |df=y }}</ref> The British Ambassador to the Holy See uses more precise language, saying that the Holy See "is not the same as the Vatican City State. … (It) is the universal government of the Catholic Church and ''operates from'' the Vatican City State."<ref>[http://www.sces.uk.com/articles/ambassadors-address-on-uk-holy-see-relations.html Ambassador's Address on UK-Holy See Relations] (emphasis added)</ref> This agrees exactly with the expression used by the website of the United States Department of State, in giving information on both the Holy See and the Vatican City State: it too says that the Holy See "operates from the Vatican City State".<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3819.htm Background Note: Holy See].

The Holy See is a member of various [[International organizations]] and groups including the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), [[International Telecommunication Union]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] (OPCW) and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). The Holy See is also a permanent [[observer status|observer]] in various international organizations, including the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO).

===Relationship with the Vatican City and other territories===
{{Vatican city}}
The Holy See participates as an observer in [[African Union|AU]], [[Arab League]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], and in the [[United Nations]] and its agencies [[FAO]], [[ILO]], [[UNCTAD]], [[UNEP]], [[UNESCO]], [[UN-HABITAT]], [[UNHCR]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[World Tourism Organization|UNWTO]], [[WFP]], [[WHO]], [[WIPO]]. It participates as a guest in [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], and as a full member in [[IAEA]], [[OPCW]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]].

Although the Holy See is closely associated with the Vatican City, the independent territory over which the Holy See is [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], the two entities are separate and distinct. After the Italian takeover of the [[Papal States]] in 1870, the Holy See had no territorial sovereignty. In spite of some uncertainty among [[jurist]]s as to whether it could continue to act as an independent personality in international matters, the Holy See continued in fact to exercise the right to send and receive diplomatic representatives, maintaining relations with states that included the major powers of Russia, [[Prussia]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. Where, in accordance with the decision of the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the [[Nuncio]] was not only a member of the Diplomatic Corps but its Dean, this arrangement continued to be accepted by the other ambassadors. In the course of the 59 years during which the Holy See held no territorial sovereignty, the number of states that had diplomatic relations with it, which had been reduced to 16, actually increased to 29.<ref>[http://www.30giorni.it/it/articolo.asp?id=10264 Lecture by Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, 16 February 2006]. 30giorni.it. Retrieved on 11 September 2011.</ref>

The State of the Vatican City was created by the [[Lateran Treaty]] in 1929 to "ensure the absolute and visible independence of the Holy See" and "to guarantee to it an indisputable sovereignty in international affairs."  Archbishop [[Jean-Louis Tauran]], the Holy See's former Secretary for Relations with States, said that the Vatican City is a "minuscule support-state that guarantees the spiritual freedom of the Pope with the minimum territory".<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_doc_20020422_tauran_en.html Lecture by Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, 22 April 2002].

Under the terms of the Lateran Treaty, the Holy See has [[extraterritorial|extraterritorial authority]] over [[Properties of the Holy See|various sites in Rome and two Italian sites outside of Rome]], including the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo|Pontifical Palace at Castel Gandolfo]]. The same authority is extended under [[international law]] over the [[Apostolic Nunciature]] of the Holy See in a foreign country.

==Military==

Though, like various European powers, earlier Popes recruited Swiss mercenaries as part of an army, the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]] was founded by [[Pope Julius II]] on 22 January 1506 as the personal bodyguard of the Pope and continues to fulfil that function.<ref>[http://www.swissguard.va/index.php?id=258&L=3 Pontifical Swiss Guards, History] {{wayback|url=http://www.swissguard.va/index.php?id=258&L=3 |date=20120315044949 |df=y }}</ref> It is listed in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' under "Holy See", not under "State of Vatican City".<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013), p. 1269</ref> At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members.
