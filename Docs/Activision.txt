'''Activision Publishing, Inc.''' is an American [[video game publisher]]. It was founded on October 1, 1979<ref>[http://investor.activision.com/timeline.cfm Activision – Investor Relations: Historical Timeline] from Activision's official website</ref> and was the world's first independent developer and distributor of video games for [[video game console|gaming consoles]]. Its first products were cartridges for the [[Atari 2600]] video console system published from July 1980 for the US market and from August 1981 for the international market (UK).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimania.de/zoom_frame.php?TYPE_IMG=CAT&ID=142&NUM_IMAGE=0|title=Zoom|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2016}}</ref> Activision is now one of the largest [[wikt:third party|third party]] video game publishers in the world and was also the top publisher for 2007 in the United States.<ref name="gama">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14803|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=July 24, 2007|title=Activision Beats EA As Top Third Party Publisher In U.S.| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070811104344/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14803|last=Jenkins|first=David|date=July 24, 2007|archivedate= August 11, 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref><!--In this context, 'third party' means parties other than the consumer and the platform manufacturer.

Atari [[game programmer|programmers]] [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]], [[Larry Kaplan]], [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]], and [[Bob Whitehead]] met with Atari CEO [[Ray Kassar]] in May 1979 to demand that the company treat developers as [[record labels]] treated musicians, with royalties and their names on game boxes. Kaplan, who called the others "the best designers for the [2600] in the world", recalled that Kassar called the four men "towel designers" and that "anyone can do a cartridge." Crane, Miller, and Whitehead left Atari and founded Activision in October 1979<ref name="hubner19831128">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sy8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA158&dq=ray%20kassar%20insider%20trading&pg=PA151#v=onepage&f=false | title=What went wrong at Atari? | work=InfoWorld | date=November 28, 1983 | agency=Originally published in the San Jose Mercury News | accessdate=March 5, 2012 | last1=Hubner|first1=John|last2=Kistner Jr.|first2=William F.| page=151}}</ref> with former music industry executive [[Jim Levy]] and venture capitalist Richard Muchmore; Kaplan joined soon. David Crane has said the name "Activision" was based on Jim Levy's idea to combine 'active' and 'television'.  The original name proposed for the company was VSync, Inc.<ref name="video-game-ephemera.com">{{Cite news| url = http://www.video-game-ephemera.com/010.htm |title=DAVID CRANE INTERVIEW (1994)|publisher=Video Game Ephemera|accessdate = December 10, 2014}}</ref>

Unlike Atari, the company credited and promoted game creators along with the games themselves. The steps taken for this included devoting a page to the developer in their instruction manuals<ref>''Ice Hockey'' Instructions, page 4. Activision 1981</ref><ref>''Pitfall!'' Instructions, page 4. Activision 1982</ref><ref>''Chopper Command'' Instructions, page 4. Activision 1982</ref> and challenging players to send in a high score (usually as a photograph, but letters were acceptable) in order to receive an [[embroidered patch]].<ref>''Ice Hockey'' instructions, page 3. Activision 1981</ref><ref>''Pitfall!'' Instructions, page 3. Activision, 1982</ref><ref>''Chopper Command'' Instructions, page 3. Activision 1982</ref> These approaches helped the newly formed company attract experienced talent. In recognition of this step, Kaplan, Levy, Miller, and Whitehead received the [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice]] "First Penguin" award in 2003.

The departure of the four programmers, whose titles made up more than half of Atari's cartridge sales at the time,<ref name="video-game-ephemera.com"/> caused legal action between the two companies not settled until 1982. As the market for game consoles started to decline, Activision branched out, producing game titles for home computers and acquiring smaller publishers.

In 1982, Activision released ''[[Pitfall!]]'' on the Atari 2600. Designed and developed by David Crane, it was a huge success. Many clones of the game were introduced, including stand-up [[arcade game]]s. On June 13, 1986, Activision purchased struggling [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]] pioneer [[Infocom]]. Jim Levy was a big fan of Infocom's titles and wanted the company to remain solvent. About six months after the "InfoWedding", [[Bruce Davis (video game industry)|Bruce Davis]] took over as CEO of Activision. Davis was against the merger from the start and was heavy-handed in its management. Eventually in 1989, after several years of losses, Activision closed down the Infocom studios in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], extending to only 11 of the 26 employees an offer to relocate to Activision's [[Silicon Valley]] headquarters. Five of them accepted this offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/infocom/infocom-paper.pdf|title=Down From the Top of Its Game: The Story of Infocom, Inc.|date=December 15, 2000|accessdate=February 12, 2016|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]}}</ref>

In 1988, Activision began involvement in software besides video games, such as business applications. As a result, Activision changed its corporate name to '''Mediagenic''' to have a name that globally represented all its activities. Under the Mediagenic holding company, Activision continued to publish video games for various platforms, notably the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Sega Master System]], the [[Atari 7800]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amiga]].

=== New Activision ===
Following a multi-million judgment on damages in a [[patent infringement]] suit, wherein infringement had been determined many years prior during the Levy era, a financially weakened Mediagenic was taken over by an investor group led by [[Robert Kotick]]. After taking over the company, the new management filed for a [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] reorganization. In the reorganization, the company merged Mediagenic with The Disc Company. Mediagenic continued to develop games for [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]] and [[video game console]]s, and resumed making strategic acquisitions. After emerging from bankruptcy, Mediagenic officially changed its entity name back to Activision in December 1992 and became a [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware Corporation]] (it was previously a California Corporation). At that point, Activision moved its headquarters from [[Silicon Valley]] (originally in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] and later in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]) to [[Santa Monica]] in [[Southern California]] and from then on concentrated on video gaming.

In 1991, Activision packaged 20 of [[Infocom]]'s past games into a [[CD-ROM]] collection called ''[[The Lost Treasures of Infocom]]'', without the [[feelie]]s Infocom was famous for. The success of this compilation led to the 1992 release of 11 more Infocom titles in ''[[The Lost Treasures of Infocom#The Lost Treasures of Infocom II|The Lost Treasures of Infocom II]]''.

Activision published the first-person perspective ''[[MechWarrior (1989 video game)|MechWarrior]]'' in 1989, based on [[FASA]]'s pen-and-pencil game ''[[BattleTech]]''. A sequel, ''[[MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat|MechWarrior 2]]'', was released in 1995 after two years of delays and internal struggles, prompting FASA not to renew their licensing deal with Activision. To counter, Activision released several more games bearing the ''MechWarrior 2'' name, which did not violate their licensing agreement. These included ''NetMech'', ''[[MechWarrior 2: Ghost Bear's Legacy#Ghost Bear's Legacy (expansion pack)|MechWarrior 2: Ghost Bears Legacy]]'', and ''[[MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries]]''. The entire ''MechWarrior 2'' game series accounted for more than {{US$|70&nbsp;million}} in sales.<ref name="Mechwarrior History">{{cite web|url=http://www.localditch.com/mechwarrior/history.html|title=Mechwarrior - History|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2016}}{{unreliable?|date=February 2016}}</ref>

Activision procured the license to another pen-and-paper-based [[Wargaming|war game]], ''[[Heavy Gear]]'', in 1997. [[Heavy Gear (video game)|The video game version]] was well received by critics, with an 81.46% average rating on [[gamerankings.com|GameRankings]] and being considered the best game of the genre at the time by [[GameSpot]]. The ''Mechwarrior 2'' engine was also used in other Activision games, including 1997's ''[[Interstate '76]]'' and finally 1998's ''[[Battlezone (1998 video game)|Battlezone]]''.<ref name="Mechwarrior History" />

=== Merger with Vivendi ===
In December 2007, it was announced that Activision would merge with [[Vivendi Games]], which owned fellow games developer and publisher [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]], and the merger would close in July 2008. The new company was called '''[[Activision Blizzard]]''' and was headed by Activision's former CEO, [[Robert Kotick]]. [[Vivendi]] was the biggest shareholder in the new group.<ref name="merger">{{cite press release

On February 9, 2011, Activision announced that it was ending its once profitable ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' franchise, in the process doing a [[layoff]] of approximately 500 people. At the same time it announced that it was discontinuing development of ''[[True Crime: Hong Kong]]'', and that it was refocusing its efforts into a new online service named ''[[Call of Duty: Elite]]'' for its IP ''[[Call of Duty]]''. At the same meeting these announcements were made, Activision reported net losses of $233 million for fourth quarter 2010.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/02/activision-guitar-hero-layoffs-call-of-duty-beachhead.html |title=Activision pulls plug on Guitar Hero, laying off 500 workers |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>
