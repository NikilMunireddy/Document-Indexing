The '''Crown of Castile'''<ref name=term group=nb/> was a medieval state in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] that formed in 1230 as a result of the third and definitive union of the crowns and, some decades later, the parliaments of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|León]] upon the accession of the then Castilian king, [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]], to the vacant Leonese throne. It continued to exist as a separate entity after the [[personal union]] in 1469 of the crowns of Castile and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] with the marriage of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] up to the [[dynastic union]] occasioned by the succession of [[Charles I of Spain]], the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] heir to both crowns in 1516.

The Indies, Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea were also a part of the Crown of Castile when transformed from lordships to Kingdoms of the heirs of Castile in 1506, with the [[treaty of Villafáfila]], and upon the death of Ferdinand the Catholic.

The title of "King of Castile" remained in use by the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg rulers]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. Charles I was King of Aragon, Majorca, Valencia, and Sicily, and Count of Barcelona, Roussillon and Cerdagne, as well as King of Castile and León, 1516–1556.

In the early 18th century, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Bourbon]] won the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and imposed [[Nueva Planta decrees|unification policies]] over the [[Crown of Aragon]], supporters of their enemies. This  unified the Crown of Aragon and the Crown of Castile into the kingdom of Spain. 
Even though the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] did not formally abolish the Crown of Castile, the country of (Castile and Aragon) was called "Spain" by both contemporaries and historians.

"King of Castile" also remains part of the full title of [[Felipe VI of Spain]], the current [[king of Spain]] according to the [[Spanish constitution of 1978]], but in the same sense as the title "[[King of Jerusalem]]"— that is, as ''titles'' not as ''states''.

== History ==

=== Preceding events ===

====Two kingdoms: León and Castile ====
{{main|Kingdom of León|Kingdom of Castile}}
The Kingdom of León arose out of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. The Kingdom of Castile appeared initially as a county of the Kingdom of León. From the second half of the 10th century to the first half of the 11th century it changed hands between León and the Kingdom of Navarre. In the 11th century it became a kingdom in its own right.

The two kingdoms had been united twice previously: 
*From 1037 until 1065 under [[Ferdinand I of León]]. Upon his death his kingdoms passed to his sons, León to [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]], Castile to [[Sancho II of Castile|Sancho II]], and Galicia to [[García of Galicia and Portugal|García]].
*From 1072 until 1157 under Alfonso VI (died 1109), [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]] (died 1126), and [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]]. From 1111 until 1126 Galicia was separate from the union under Alfonso VII. In 1157 the kingdoms were divided between Alfonso's sons, with [[Ferdinand II of León|Ferdinand II]] receiving León and [[Sancho III of Castile|Sancho III]] Castile.

=== Crown of Castile from the rule of Ferdinand III until the ascension of Charles I ===

==== Union of the two kingdoms under Ferdinand III ====
[[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]] received the Kingdom of Castile from his mother, Queen [[Berengaria of Castile]] granddaughter of Sancho III in 1217, and the Kingdom of León from his father [[Alfonso IX of León]] son of Ferdinand II in 1230. From then on the two kingdoms were united under the name of the Kingdom of León and Castile, or simply as the Crown of Castile. Ferdinand III later conquered the Guadalquivir Valley, while his son Alfonso X conquered the Kingdom of Murcia from Al-Andalus, further extending the area of the Crown of Castile. Given this, the kings of the Crown of Castile traditionally styled themselves "King of Castile, León, Toledo, Galicia, Murcia, Jaén, Córdoba, Seville, and Lord of Biscay and Molina", among other possessions they later gained. The heir to the throne has been titled [[Prince of Asturias]] since the 14th century.

==== Union of the ''Cortes'' and the legal code ====
Almost immediately after the union of the two kingdoms under Ferdinand III, the parliaments of Castile and León were united. It was divided into three estates, which corresponded with the nobility, the church and the cities, and included representation from [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], [[New Castile (Spain)|Toledo]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque provinces]]. Initially the number of cities represented in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] varied over the next century, until [[John I of Castile|John I]] permanently set those that would be allowed to send representatives (''procuradores''): Burgos, Toledo, León, Sevilla, Córdoba, Murcia, Jaén, Zamora, Segovia, Ávila, Salamanca, Cuenca, Toro, Valladolid, Soria, Madrid and Guadalajara (with Granada added after its conquest in 1492).

Under [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], most sessions of the Cortes of both kingdoms were held jointly. The Cortes of 1258 in Valladolid comprised representatives of Castile, Extremadura and León ("''de Castiella e de Estremadura e de tierra de León''") and those of Seville in 1261 of Castile, León and all other kingdoms ("''de Castiella e de León e de todos los otros nuestros Regnos''"). Subsequent Cortes were celebrated separately, for example in 1301 that of Castile in Burgos and that of León in Zamora, but the representatives demanded that the parliaments be reunited from then on.

Although the individual kingdoms and cities initially retained their individual historical rights-including  the Old [[fueros|Fuero]] of Castile (Viejo Fuero de Castilla) and the different ''fueros'' of the municipal councils of Castile, León, Extremadura and Andalucía-a unified legal code for the entire new kingdom was created in the [[Siete Partidas]] (c. 1265), the [[Ordenamiento de Alcalá]] (1248) and the Leyes de Toro (1505). These laws continued to be in force until 1889, when a new Spanish civil code, the Código Civil Español, was enacted.

====Spanish languages and universities====
[[File:Medieval Spanish Universities.png|thumb|right|Map of Castilian and Aragonese Universities]]
In the 13th century there were many languages spoken in the Kingdoms of León and Castile among them [[Spanish language|Castilian]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Galician-Portuguese]]. But, as the century progressed, Castilian gained increasing prominence as the language of culture and communication- one example of this is the '[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'.

In the last years of the reign of [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]], Castilian began to be used for some important documents, such as the [[Visigothic Code]], the basis of the legal code for Christians living in Muslim  [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]], but it was during the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] that it became the official language. Henceforth all public documents were written in Castilian, likewise all translations of [[Arabic]] legal and government documents were made into Castilian instead of Latin.

Some scholars think that the substitution of Castilian for Latin was due to the strength of the new language, whereas others consider that it was due to the influence of Hebrew-speaking intellectuals who were hostile towards Latin, the language of the Christian Church.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In 1492, under the [[Catholic Monarchs]], the first edition of the ''[[Grammar of the Castilian Language]]'' by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] was published. Castilian was eventually carried to the [[Americas]] in the 16th century by the [[conquistador]]s. Because of Castilian's importance in the land ruled by the [[Spanish Crown]], the language is also known as Spanish.

Furthermore, in the 13th century many universities were founded where instruction was in Castilian, such as the Leonese [[University of Salamanca]] and the Castilian ''Estudio General'' of Palencia, which were among the first universities in Europe.

====Ascension of the Trastámara dynasty ====
[[File:Crown of Castile - Map.gif|thumb|Expansion of Castilian territory.]]
<!--The Hundred Years' War forward links to here-->
On the death of [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]] a dynastic conflict started between his sons, the ''Infantes'' [[Peter of Castile|Peter (Pedro)]] and [[Henry II of Castile|Henry]], Count of Trastámara, which became entangled in the [[Hundred Years' War]] (between England and France). Alfonso XI had married [[Maria of Portugal, Queen of Castile|Maria of Portugal]] with whom he had his heir, the ''Infante'' Peter. However, the King also had many illegitimate children with [[Eleanor of Guzman]], among them the above-mentioned Henry, who disputed Peter's right to the throne once the latter became king.

In the resulting struggle, in which both brothers claimed to be king, Pedro allied himself with [[Edward, the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]], "the Black Prince." In 1367, the Black Prince defeated Henry II's allies at the [[Battle of Nájera]], restoring Pedro's control of the kingdom. The Black Prince, seeing that the king would not reimburse his expenses, left Castile. Henry, who had fled to France, took advantage of the opportunity and recommenced the fight. Henry finally was victorious in 1369 in the [[Battle of Montiel]], in which he had Peter killed.

In 1371 the brother of the Black Prince, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], married [[Infanta Constance of Castile|Constance]], Peter's daughter. In 1386, he claimed the Crown of Castile in the name of his wife, the legitimate heir according to the Cortes de Seville of 1361. He arrived in [[A Coruña]] with an army and took the city. He then moved on to occupy [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Pontevedra]] and [[Vigo]]. He asked [[John I of Castile|John I]], Henry II's son, to give up the throne in favor of Constance.

John declined but proposed that his son, the ''Infante'' [[Henry III of Castile|Henry]], marry John of Gaunt's daughter [[Catherine of Lancaster|Catherine]]. The proposal was accepted, and the title [[Prince of Asturias]] was created for Henry and Catherine. This ended the dynastic conflict, strengthened the [[House of Trastámara]]'s position and created peace between [[England]] and Castile.

====Relations with the Crown of Aragon during the 14th century ====
[[File:Corona de Castilla 1400 en.svg|thumb|Castilian territory at the end of 14th century.]]
During the reign of [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]] royal power was restored, overshadowing the much powerful Castilian nobility. In his later years Henry delegated some of his power to his brother [[Ferdinand I of Aragon|Ferdinand I of Antequera]], who would be regent, along with his wife [[Catherine of Lancaster]], during the childhood of his son [[John II of Castile|John II]]. After the [[Compromise of Caspe]] in 1412, Ferdinand left Castile to become King of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]].

Upon the death of his mother, John II at the age of 14, took to the throne and married his cousin [[Maria of Aragon, Queen of Castile|Maria of Aragon]]. The young king entrusted his government to regent [[Álvaro de Luna]], the most influential person in court and allied with the lesser nobility, the cities, the clergy, and the Jews. This brought together the mutual dislikes of the king shared by the greater Castilian nobility and the Aragonese ''[[Infante]]s'', sons of Ferdinand I of Antequera, who sought to control the Castilian crown.  This eventually led to war in 1429 and 1430 between the two kingdoms. Álvaro de Luna won the war and expelled the Aragonese ''Infantes'' from Castile.

====Second Conflict of Succession ====
{{main|War of the Castilian Succession}}
[[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]] unsuccessfully tried to re-establish the peace with the nobility that his father, John II, had shattered. When his second wife, [[Joan of Portugal]], gave birth to [[Joanna La Beltraneja|Infanta Joanna]], it was claimed that she was the result of an affair of the Queen with [[Beltrán de la Cueva]], one of the King's chief ministers.

The King, besieged by riots and the demands of the nobles, had to sign a treaty in which he named as his successor his half-brother [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1453-1468)|Alfonso]], leaving Infanta Joanna out of the line of succession. After the death of Alfonso in an accident, Henry IV signed the [[Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando]] with his half-sister [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] in which he named her heiress in return for her marrying a prince chosen by him.

====The Catholic Monarchs: Union with the Crown of Aragon ====
[[File:La Rendición de Granada - Pradilla.jpg|thumb|right|The Recapture of Granada (F. Padilla)]]

In October 1469 [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]], heir to the throne of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], married in secret in the ''Palacio de los Vivero'' in Castilian [[Valladolid]]. The consequence was a dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the [[Crown of Aragon]] in 1479 when Ferdinand ascended to the Aragonese throne. This union however was not effective until the reign of his grandson [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V)]]. Ferdinand and Isabella were related and had married without papal approval. Although Isabella wanted to marry Ferdinand, she refused to proceed with the marriage until she received a [[Papal dispensation]]. Consequently, Ferdinand's father forged a papal dispensation for the two to marry. Isabella believed that the dispensation was authentic and the marriage went ahead. A genuine papal dispensation arrived afterwards. Later [[Pope Alexander VI]] bestowed upon them the title of ''[[Catholic Monarchs|'los Reyes Católicos']]'' ('the Catholic Monarchs').

[[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]], half brother of Isabella, considered the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella as breaking the treaty of ''Tratado de los Toros de Guisando'' under which Isabella would ascend to the Castilian throne on his death only if her suitor was approved by him. Henry wanted to ally Castile with Portugal or France rather than Aragon. He therefore decided to name his daughter [[Joanna La Beltraneja|Infanta Joanna]] as heiress to the throne rather than Isabella I. When he died in 1474 the [[War of the Castilian Succession]] broke out over who would ascend to the throne. It lasted until 1479 when Isabella and her supporters came out victorious.

[[File:Christopher Columbus9.jpg|thumb|right|Columbus and the Catholic Monarchs (The return of Columbus)]]
After Isabella's victory in the civil war and Ferdinand's ascension to the Aragonese throne the two crowns were united under the same monarchs. However, this was a personal union and both kingdoms remained administratively separate to some extent, each maintaining largely its own laws; both parliaments remained separate, the only common institution would be the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]]. Despite their titles of "Monarchs of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Sicily" Ferdinand and Isabella reigned over their respective territories, although they also took decisions together. Its central position, larger territorial area (three times greater than that of Aragon) and larger population (4.3 million as opposed to the 1 million in Aragon) led to Castile becoming the dominating partner in the union.

As a result of the ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest) the Castilian aristocracy had become very powerful. The monarchs needed to assert their authority over the nobility and the clergy. With this end in mind they founded a law enforcement body, the ''Consejo de la Hermandad'', more commonly known as the ''[[Hermandad|Santa Hermandad]]'' (the Holy Brotherhood), which was staffed and funded by the municipalities. They also took further measures against the nobility, destroying feudal castles, prohibiting private wars and reducing the power of the ''[[Adelantado]]s'' (a governor-like military office in regions recently conquered). The monarchy incorporated military orders under the ''Consejo de las Órdenes'' in 1495, reinforced royal judicial power over the feudal one and transformed the ''[[Audiencia Real|Audiencias]]'' into the supreme judicial bodies. The crown also sought to better control the cities, and so in 1480 in the Cortes of Toledo it created the ''corregidores'', representatives of the crown, which supervised the city councils. In religion, they reformed religious orders and sought unity of the various sections of the church. They pressured Jews to convert to Catholicism, in some cases persecuted by the Inquisition. Finally in 1492, the monarchs decided that those who would not convert would be expelled. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 70,000 people were expelled from Castile. From 1502 onwards, they began to convert the Muslim population.

Between 1478 and 1497 the monarchs' forces conquered the three [[Canary Islands]] of [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Palma]] and [[Tenerife]]. On 2 January 1492 the monarchs entered [[Granada]]'s [[Alhambra]] marking the completion and end of the ''Reconquista''. Also in 1492, the [[Christopher Columbus]] maritime expedition claimed the newly found lands in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas#Christopher Columbus|the Americas]] for the Crown of Castile and began the [[New World]] conquests. In 1497 Castile conquered [[Melilla]] on the north coast of North Africa. After Castile's conquest of the Kingdom of Granada, its politics turned towards the Mediterranean, and Castile militarily helped Aragon in its problems with France, culminating in the reconquest of [[Naples]] for the Crown of Aragon in 1504. Later that same year, Isabella died, on November 26.

==== Period of regency — Joanna I ====
Upon Isabella I's death 1504, the crown passed to her daughter [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]], who was married to [[Philip I of Castile|Philip of Austria]] (nicknamed 'Philip the Handsome'). But Isabella knew of her daughter's possible mental health incapacities (''and so nicknamed 'Juana la Loca' or 'Joanna the Mad' '') and named Ferdinand as [[regent]] in the case that Joanna "didn't want to or couldn't fulfil her duties". In the 'Salamanca Agreement' of 1505, it was decided that the government would be shared by Philip I, Ferdinand V and Joanna. However, poor relations between Phillip, who was supported by the Castilian nobility, and Ferdinand resulted in Ferdinand renouncing his regent's powers in Castile in order to avoid an armed conflict.

Through the ''Concordia de Villafáfila'' of 1506, Ferdinand returned to Aragon and Phillip was recognized as King of Castile, with Joanna a co-monarch. In the Treaty of Villafáfila in 1506 king Ferdinand the Catholic renounced not only the government of Castile in favour of his son-in-law Philip I of Castile but also the lordship of the Indies, withholding a half of the income of the kingdoms of the Indies. Joanna of Castile and Philip immediately added to their titles the kingdoms of Indies, Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea.  Phillip died and Ferdinand returned in 1507 once again to be regent for Joanna. Her isolated confinement-imprisonment in the Santa Clara Convent at [[Tordesillas]], to last over fifty years until death, began with her father's orders in 1510.

In 1512 a joint [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|Castilian-Aragonese force invaded Navarre]] and most of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] south of the Pyrenees was annexed to Castile.

===The Crown of Castile within Habsburg Spain===

====Charles I====
[[File:Los Comuneros de Castilla en el Patíbulo.jpg|thumb|right|"The ''Comuneros'' Padilla, Bravo and Maldonado in the ''Patíbulo''", by [[Antonio Gisbert]], 1860.]]
[[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] received the Crown of Castile, the Crown of Aragon and the empire through a combination of dynastic marriages and premature deaths:
*when his father [[Philip I of Castile|Philip I]] died in 1506, he became [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] of the [[Netherlands]];
*upon the death of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], his grandfather, in 1516 he gained the rule of Aragon and Castile (with the Americas), in co-regency title with his mother [[Joanna of Castile|Queen Joanna]]. He maintained her confinement-imprisonment, so she was Queen of Aragon and of Castile in title only.
*upon the death of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], his paternal grandfather, in 1519, Charles was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] as a consequence of which he is better-known as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]].

Charles I was not well received in Castile. This was partly because he was a foreign-born king (born in [[Ghent]]), and even before his arrival in Castile he had granted important positions to Flemish citizens and had used Castilian money to fund his court. The Castilian nobility and the cities were on the verge of an uprising to defend their rights. Many Castilians favoured the king's younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], who grew up in Castile, and in fact the [[Council of Castile]] opposed the idea of Charles as King of Castile.

In 1518 the Castilian parliament in [[Valladolid]] named the [[Wallonia]]n Jean de Sauvage as its president. This caused angry protests in the parliament, which rejected the presence of foreigners in its deliberations. Despite threats, the parliament led by Juan de Zumel representing [[Burgos]], resisted and forced the king to respect the laws of Castile, remove all foreigners from important governmental posts, and learn to speak [[Spanish language|Castilian]].  After taking his oath, Charles received a subsidy of 600,000 ducats.

Charles was conscious of the fact that he had options to become emperor and needed to impose his authority over Castile to gain access to its riches for his imperial goals. The riches from the [[Americas]] came through Castile which was one of the more dynamic, rich, and advanced territories in Europe in the 16th century. It started to realise that it could become immersed within an empire. This, added to the broken promise of Charles, only increased hostility towards the king. In 1520 in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] Parliament rejected a further subsidy for the king. Parliament in [[Santiago de Compostela]] reached the same decision. Finally, when Parliament was held in [[A Coruña]], many members were bribed and others denied entry, with the result that the subsidy was approved. Those members who voted in favour were attacked by the Castilian people and their houses were burned. Parliament was not the only opposition which Charles would come up against. When he left Castile in 1520, the [[Castilian War of the Communities]] broke out. ''Los comuneros'' were defeated one year later (1521). After their defeat, Parliament was reduced to a merely consultative body.

====Imperial policies of Philip II====
[[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] continued the politics of Charles I, but unlike his father he made Castile the core of the [[Spanish Empire]], centralising all administration in [[Madrid]]. The other Spanish regions maintained certain degree of autonomy, being governed by a [[Viceroy]].

In fact, since the reign of Charles I the financial burden of the empire had fallen mainly on Castile, but under Philip II the cost quadrupled. During his reign, as well as increasing existing taxes he created some new ones, among them the ''excusado'' in 1567. That same year Philip ordered the proclamation of the ''La Pragmática''; an act whereby all Moriscos had to abandon all Moorish traditions and become true Catholics. This edict limited religious, linguistic and cultural freedom of the Morisco population and provoked the [[Morisco Revolt]] (1568–1571), which was put down by [[John of Austria]].

Castile entered a phase of recession in 1575; Spain as a whole followed, which provoked the suspension of wages (the third of his reign). In 1590 the ''Cortes'' approved the ''millones''; a new tax on food. This exhausted Castilian cities and hindered the economy. In 1596, pay was once again suspended.

====Later Habsburgs====
[[File:Crown of-Castile 3.PNG|thumb|right|Worldwide Crown of Castile]]
In the previous kingdoms, positions in national institutions were filled by educated gentlemen. Philip II's administrators would normally come from either the [[University of Alcalá]] or the [[University of Salamanca]]. After [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] the nobility once again asserted their right to govern the country. In order to show that there was a new order ruling there was a cleansing of the blood of [[Spain]]. Religious persecution led Philip to declare the expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609.

Faced with the collapse of the Exchequer, in order to maintain the hegemony of Philip IV's Spanish Empire, the [[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke of Olivares]], the king's [[favourite]] (valido) from 1621 to 1643, tried to introduce a series of reforms. Among these was the ''Unión de Armas'', the creation of a new army of 140,000 reservists. Every territory within the kingdom contributed citizens proportionally in order to maintain the force. His aims of union did not work and the Spanish Crown continued as a confederation of kingdoms.

Luis Méndez de Haro took over from Olivares as favourite Philip IV between 1659 and 1665. This was in order to alleviate interior conflicts sparked off by his predecessor (revolts in [[Portugal]], [[Catalan Revolt|Catalonia]] and [[Andalusia]]) and achieve peace in Europe.

Upon the death of Philip IV in 1665, and with the incapacity of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] to govern, Spain suffered an economic slowdown and battles for power between the different 'favourites'. The death of Charles II in 1700 without descendants provoked the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].
