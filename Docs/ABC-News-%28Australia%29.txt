'''''ABC News''''' is a national news service in Australia produced by the [[ABC News and Current Affairs|News and Current Affairs]] division of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. The division is responsible for all news-gathering and production of news output for ABC television, radio and online services.

===Broadcast presentation history===

====1956====
The news theme used from 1956 to 1985 was "[[Majestic Fanfare]]", composed by [[Charles Williams (composer)|Charles Williams]]. From 1956 until the early '80s the version used was abridged version performed by the Queen's Hall Light Orchestra, from a recording made in 1943. Each bulletin opened with a clip from the top story of the day, with the title "ABC News" superimposed over the footage. Later, this onscreen approach was replaced by a generic graphic title sequence. In 1982, to celebrate the ABC's 50th anniversary, a new version of the theme was commissioned, which incorporated both orchestral and new electronic elements. With the exception of a period in the mid-'80s, during which a synthesised theme arranged by Sydney musician Tony Ansell was used for 12 months or so, this was used on radio until August 1988, and on television until early 1985. A reworking (up one tone)of "Majestic Fanfare" (essentially the original orchestration up one tone) was arranged by [[Richard Mills (composer)|Richard Mills]] and recorded in 1988 by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

The 1988 orchestration is still used exclusively for ABC's radio news bulletins across all stations, except [[Triple J]], which uses a 1991 remix of the original "Majestic Fanfare", and [[ABC NewsRadio|NewsRadio]], which has always used specially-composed themes since its inception. The original theme package was written by Peter Wall and Tony Ansell.

====1985====
The ABC refreshed its structure and look in 1985 when the 7 o'clock news and the following current affairs programme (at that time, Nationwide) were combined to form ABC National (usually known as "The National"). The news theme used was "Best Endeavours", written by [[Alan Hawkshaw]]. This piece of music was at that time, and is still, the theme for [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK.

====1985–1997====
After The National was deemed unsuccessful, that same year the news was refreshed again with a new set, graphics, and theme, composed by Tony Ansell & Peter Wall. This theme was used for almost 15 years, even after the refresh in 1997. In 2010, it was sampled and remixed by the group [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] and this revised work went on to be placed #11 on the Triple J Hottest 100 chart on Australia Day 2011.

====1998–2005====
In 1998, the set was updated, a new opener featuring a light blue globe and the ABC logo was introduced, and the theme remained the same but was tweaked. The graphics also changed to match the new look.

====2005–2010====
The theme for ABC News changed on [[Australia Day]] (26 January) 2005, and was written by [[Martin Armiger]] and John Gray and for a couple of years bore a resemblance to the original Peter Wall / Tony Ansell work in the opening signature notes. Wall challenged the ABC and was successful in reaching an agreement. The opening notes were removed and the work was re-arranged in 2010. The new look made use of an orange and blue globe motif. At the same time the set and graphics received a major overhaul to fit in with this look. This package was used until 21 July 2010, a day before the launch of [[ABC News 24]].

====2010–present====
With the launch of [[ABC News 24]] on 22 July, all 7pm bulletins across Australia had a graphics overhaul to match the look of [[ABC News 24]]. The opener replaces the blue/orange globe style with a series of sliding panels, featuring images specific to each state. The theme from the 2005-2010 era was remixed by Martin Armiger, its composer, giving it a more upbeat, synthesised feel. New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia and the ACT have new sets, built to match the [[ABC News 24]] set. The graphics have changed to match the "sliding panels" look and are more akin to the feel of [[ABC News 24]] in 2010.

===ABC News 24===
{{main|ABC News 24}}
In January 2010, the ABC announced that a dedicated 24-hour [[digital television]] news channel, named [[ABC News 24]] would be launched during the year.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/21/2797640.htm</ref>

The new channel commenced preliminary broadcasting with a promo loop in early July 2010, with the ABC re-numbering ABC HD channel 20 to logical channel number 24.

The [[ABC News 24]] channel was officially launched at 7.30PM Australian Eastern Standard Time on 22 July 2010 and simulcast its first hour of transmission with [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC1]].<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/abcnews24/</ref> The news channel utilises the ABC's existing resources including more than 1000 journalists in 60 newsrooms across Australia along with 12 foreign bureaux.
