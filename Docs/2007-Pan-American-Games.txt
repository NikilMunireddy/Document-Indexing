The '''2007 Pan American Games''', officially known as the '''XV Pan American Games''', were a major [[Americas|continental]] [[multi-sport event]] that took place in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], from July 13 to July 29, 2007. A total of 5,633 athletes from 42 [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) competed in 332 events in 34 sports and in 47 disciplines. During the Games, 95 new Pan American records were set; 2,196 medals were awarded; 1,262 doping control tests were performed and about 15,000 volunteers participated in the organization of the event, which was an Olympic qualification for 13 [[International Federation]]s (IFs). 

Rio de Janeiro was awarded the Games over [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], [[United States]], on August 24, 2002, having won an absolute majority of votes (30-21) from the 51 members of the [[Pan American Sports Organization]] (PASO) in the first round of voting during the XL PASO General Assembly held in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. This was the first Games held in Brazil since the [[1963 Pan American Games]] that took place in [[São Paulo]]. According to the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee, the Games called for the implementation of the country's largest organizational and logistic operation ever.

== Bidding process ==
{{Main|Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2007 Pan American Games}}

[[File:Carlos Arthur Nuzman 2007.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carlos Arthur Nuzman]], chairman of the Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2007 Pan American Games.]]

The official bid was submitted in August 2001 during the XXXIX [[Pan American Sports Organization]] (PASO) General Assembly held in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]]. In April 2002, following delivery of Federal, State and City Government and BOC letters confirming country, state, city and Brazilian sport compliance with the applicable Games regulations, PASO announced the approval of Rio de Janeiro’s bid. The Bidding Committee then submitted a detailed bid file for the Games. The document was prepared and developed with the assistance of [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]] (FGV), which had been commissioned by Rio de Janeiro's City Government. In the running to host the 2007 Pan American Games, Rio de Janeiro faced off with the city of [[San Antonio]], [[United States]]; which previously beat [[Houston]], [[Miami]], and [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] to become the American candidate.

According to PASO statute and regulations, the host city was selected by direct voting during the XL PASO General Assembly held in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], on August 24, 2002. The candidate city that received the simple majority of votes from representatives of the 42 member [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) would be awarded the right to host the competition. The
announcement was made by PASO President [[Mario Vázquez Raña]]. Rio de Janeiro received 30 votes against 21 from San Antonio. Marked by a professional strategy that included the showing of city and project videos, Rio de Janeiro's campaign convinced the majority of voters, accounting for a total 51 votes. The 39-member Brazilian delegation erupted into boisterous celebration celebrating the country's highest achievement in terms of sporting event organization.

== Mascot ==
[[Image:PAG2007 mascot.png|thumb|right|Cauê]]

The organization of the Rio 2007 Games has chosen the figure of the [[Sun]] to represent the event. And, in a decision never taken before, it has defined it as the single mascot of the Pan American and [[Parapan American Games]], reinforcing thus the principles against [[prejudice]] and that, like the sun, [[sport]] is for all.

The character reflects the characteristics of the host city and harmonizes with the graphic work developed for the logo and the visual identity of both Games. The name was chosen through popular voting by Internet, cellular phone messages and public ballot boxes placed around the [[List of largest cities in Brazil|main Brazilian cities]], causing great commotion. Over 1.2 million people participated in the election, and the name Cauê received almost half of the votes.

Traditionally used in large sport events, the mascot figure serves the purpose of cheering the event, enforcing the playful aspect of sports and captivating spectators and athletes. The mascot's main choice is to transmit messages of peace, respect to the environment, friendship and brotherhood, which are intrinsic values to the [[Olympic Movement]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Mascot of the Games | url=http://www.rio2007.org.br/data/pages/8A488A8F12D856280112D87712E66F93.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-29 | publisher=Rio 2007 Games official website | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811213917/http://www.rio2007.org.br/data/pages/8A488A8F12D856280112D87712E66F93.htm| archivedate= 11 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

{{main|2007 Pan American Games opening ceremony}}

The Opening Ceremony of the XV Pan American Games took place on July 13, 2007. Approximately 90,000 people packed [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Maracanã Stadium]] for the occasion. The ceremony included a cast of 7,000 and a multimillion-dollar budget, being produced by [[Scott Givens]]. Over 800 people were part of the creative and production teams working on the Opening Ceremony, Team Welcome Ceremonies, Sports Production, the presentation of 2,252 medals, Sports Production, the Closing Ceremony and ParaPan ceremonies.

The show began at 05:30 [[12-hour clock|pm]] (local time, [[UTC-3]]) and lasted for two and a half hours. The theme of the show was based on the theme of the Rio 2007 Games:  ''Viva Essa Energia'' (Share the Energy) and the oath of the athletes was performed by Brazilian [[Taekwondo]] athlete [[Natália Falavigna]].<ref name="2007panopeningceremony">{{cite web | title = Cerimônia de abertura para ficar na história | url=http://www.gazetaesportiva.net/ge_noticias/bin/noticia.php?chid=121&nwid=39695 | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | publisher=Gazeta Esportiva |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010925/http://www.gazetaesportiva.net/ge_noticias/bin/noticia.php?chid=121&nwid=39695 |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> Also, a very abbreviated version of the Olympic Anthem was played.

Contrary to plan, the games were not opened by Brazil's head of state, President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], but by the head of the [[Brazilian Olympic Committee]], Carlos Nuzman. Prior to the official opening, Lula had been constantly booed whenever the in-stadium camera showed his image or when his name was mentioned.<ref name="iht">{{cite web | title = Pan American Games open with extravaganza in Rio | url=http://thestaronline.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/7/14/apworld/20070714074954& | accessdate = 2009-11-25 | publisher=Star Publications }}</ref>
