'''Hainan''' ({{zh|c=海南 |p={{Audio|zh-Hainan.ogg|Hǎinán}} ''; [[Hainanese]]:'' Hái-nâm |j=Hoi<sup>2</sup> Naam<sup>4</sup> |l=South of the Sea <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Qiongzhou Strait]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}) is the smallest and southernmost [[Provinces of the People's Republic of China|province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). The name "Hainan" also refers to '''Hainan Island''' (海南岛, ''Hǎinán Dǎo''), the main island of the province. Hainan is located in the [[South China Sea]], separated from [[Guangdong]]'s [[Leizhou Peninsula]] to the north by the shallow and narrow [[Qiongzhou Strait]].

Hainan was part of Guangdong Province until 1988, when the island became part of the newly created '''Hainan Province''' (海南省, ''Hǎinán Shěng'').

The province has an area of {{convert|33920|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} and is China's southernmost province. Although it comprises some two hundred islands scattered among three archipelagos off the southern coast, {{Convert|32900|km2|mi2|-2}} (97%) of its land mass is Hainan Island, from which the province takes its name.  The PRC government claims territories of the province extend to the southern [[Spratly Islands]], [[Paracel Islands]], and other disputed marine territory.

Hainan Province is the largest [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|Special Economic Zone]] established by Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the late 1980s.

There are a total of ten major cities and ten [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]] in Hainan Province. [[Haikou]] on the northern coast of Hainan Island is the capital while [[Sanya]] is a well-known tourist destination on the southern coast. The other major cities are [[Wenchang]], [[Qionghai]], [[Wanning]], [[Wuzhishan City|Wuzhishan]], [[Dongfang, Hainan|Dongfang]] and [[Danzhou]].

==Etymology==
The name "Hainan" (海南) describes its location south of the [[Qiongzhou Strait]], while the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] is also called Haibei (海北) as it is located north of the strait.

Hainan Island was once called the Pearl Cliffs (珠崖, Zhūyá), Fine Jade Cliffs (琼崖/瓊崖, Qióngyá), and the Fine Jade Land (琼州/瓊州, Qióngzhōu). The latter two names gave rise to the province's [[abbreviation]], ''Qióng'' (琼/瓊), referring to the pearls that were once abundant on the north coast of the island.

==History==
Hainan Island first entered written [[history of China|history]] in 110 BC, when the [[Han dynasty]] established a military [[garrison]] there following the arrival of [[Lu Bode|General Lu Bode]] (路博德). In 46 BC the Han court decided that the conquest was too expensive and abandoned the island. Around that time, Han people together with military personnel and officials began to migrate to Hainan Island from the mainland. Among them were the offspring of those who were banished to Hainan for political reasons. Most of them arrived in Hainan Island from the southern provinces of [[Guangdong]], [[Fujian]] and [[Guangxi]].

[[Li people]] are the original inhabitants of Hainan. They are believed to be the descendants of the ancient tribes from the mainland, who settled on the island between 7 and 27 thousand years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/46|title=Tracing the legacy of the early Hainan Islanders – a perspective from mitochondrial DNA|publisher=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=15 February 2011|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>

The Li people mainly reside in the nine cities and counties in the middle and southern part of Hainan – the cities of Sanya, [[Wuzhishan City|Wuzhishan]] and Dongfang, the Li autonomous counties of [[Baisha Li Autonomous County|Baisha]], Lingshui, Ledong, [[Changjiang Li Autonomous County|Changjiang]], and the 'Li and Miao Autonomous Counties of [[Qiongzhong Li and Miao Autonomous County|Qiongzhong]] and [[Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County|Baoting]]'. Some others live elsewhere on Hainan with other ethnic groups in Danzhou, Wanning, Qionghai, Lingshui and Tunchang.

The area inhabited by the Li ethnic group totals {{convert|18700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, about 55 percent of the province's total.<ref name=sunnysanya>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnysanya.com/hainan_island/population_people_hainan_island.asp |title=Population and People of Hainan Island}}</ref>
[[File:Haikou skyline 2 - 2009 09 07.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haikou]], the capital of the province as seen looking south from [[Evergreen Park (Haikou)|Evergreen Park]], a large park located on the north shore of the city]]

During the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (184−280), Hainan was the Zhuya Commandery ({{lang|zh|珠崖郡}}) under the control of [[Eastern Wu]].

At the time of the [[Song dynasty]] (980−1279), Hainan became part of [[Guangxi]], and for the first time large numbers of [[Han Chinese]] arrived, settling mostly in the north. Under the [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol Empire]] (1206–1368) the island became an independent province then in 1370 was placed under the administration of [[Guangdong]] by the ruling [[Ming dynasty]]. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, large numbers of Han people from Fujian and Guangdong began migrating to Hainan, pushing the Li into the highlands in the southern half of the island. In the eighteenth century, the Li rebelled against the [[Qing dynasty|Ta-Tsing Empire (Qing Empire)]], which responded by bringing in [[mercenaries]] from the [[Miao people|Miao]] regions of [[Guizhou]]. Many of the Miao settled on the island and their descendants live in the western highlands to this day.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, explorers referred to the island as "Aynam",<ref>{{cite web

In 1906, the revolutionary leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] proposed that Hainan should become a separate province although this did not happen until 1988.

Hainan was historically part of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces and as such was the Ch'iung-yai or Qiongya [[Circuit (political division)|Circuit]] ({{lang|zh-hant|瓊崖道}}) under the 1912 establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. In 1921, it was planned to become a [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]] ({{lang|zh-hant|瓊崖特別行政區}}); in 1944, it became Hainan Special Administrative Region with 16 [[County (People's Republic of China)#History|counties]] containing the [[South China Sea Islands]].
[[File:Hainan people 02.JPG|thumb|right|Hainanese residents in the countryside]]
During the 1920s and 30s, Hainan was a hotbed of [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] activity, especially after a bloody crackdown in [[Shanghai]], the Republic of China in 1927 drove many [[Communists]] into hiding. The Communists and the Li natives fought a vigorous [[guerrilla]] campaign against the [[Hainan Island Operation|Japanese occupation of Hainan]] (1939–45), but in retaliation over one third of the male population were killed by the Japanese. [[Feng Baiju]] led the [[Hainan Independent Column]] of fighters throughout the 1930s and 1940s.  After the Japanese surrender in 1945 the [[Guomindang|Nationalist Party (KMT)]] re-established control. Hainan was one of the last areas of China controlled by the Republic of China. From March to May 1950, the [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island]] captured the island for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]].  Hainan had been left to the command of [[Xue Yue]] after Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan.  [[Feng Baiju]] and his column of guerrilla fighters played an essential role in scouting for the landing operation and coordinated their own offensive from their jungle bases on the island.  This allowed the Hainan takeover to be successful where the [[Battle of Kuningtou|Jinmen]] and [[Battle of Dengbu Island|Dengbu]] assaults had failed in the previous fall.  The takeover was made possible by the presence of a local guerrilla force that was lacking also on [[Taiwan Island|Taiwan]].  Hence, while many observers of the Chinese civil war thought that the fall of Hainan Island to the Communists would be followed shortly by the fall of Taiwan Island, the lack of any communist guerrilla force on Taiwan Island and its sheer distance from the mainland made this impossible, as did the arrival of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US 7th fleet]] in the [[Taiwan Strait]] after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June.
[[File:Haikou skyline 6 - 2009 09 07.jpg|thumb|right|The capital city of [[Haikou]], although highly populated relative to many other international cities, is geographically quite small, with almost no [[urban sprawl]]. Much of the city limits end abruptly with forest or farm land.]]
On 1 May 1950, under the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]], the Special Administrative Region became an Administrative Region Office ({{lang|zh-hans|海南行政区公署}}), a branch of the Guangdong provincial government.

The Communists resumed development of the island along the lines established by the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]], but the results were limited by the island's isolation, its humid and [[typhoon]]-prone climate, and its continuing reputation as a place of danger and exile by mainland Chinese. With China's shift in economic policy at the end of the 1970s, Hainan became a focus of attention.

During the mid-1980s, when Hainan Island was still part of [[Guangdong]] Province, a fourteen-month episode of marketing zeal by Hainan Special District Administrator Lei Yu<ref>Subsequently Vice Mayor of Shenzhen SEZ (May 1985 to January 1988), Executive Vice Mayor of Guangzhou (January 1988 to April 1992) and Vice Chairman of Guangxi AR (April 1992 to January 1996).</ref> put Hainan's pursuit of provincial status under a cloud. It involved the duty-free imports from [[Hong Kong]] of 90,000 Japanese-made cars and trucks at a cost of [[Renminbi|¥]]&nbsp;4.5 billion (US$1.5 billion), and exporting them – with the help of local naval units – to the mainland, making 150% profits. By comparison, only 10,000 vehicles were imported into Hainan since 1950. In addition, it involved further consignments of 2.9 million TV sets, 252,000 videocassette recorders & 122,000 motorcycles. The money was taken from the 1983 central government funds destined for the construction of the island's transportation infrastructure (roads, railways, airports, harbours) over the next ten years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On October 1, 1984, it became the Hainan Administrative Region ({{lang|zh-hans|海南行政区}}), with a People's Government, and finally as province separate from [[Guangdong]] four years later. In 1988, when the island was made a separate province, it was designated a [[Special Economic Zone]] in an effort to increase investment.

The central government funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities for the construction of the island's other infrastructures (water works, power stations, telecommunications, etc.) and had taken a very liberal interpretation of the economic and trade regulations for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the re-selling of second-hand goods. Some of the proceeds, from unsold units, were later retrieved by the central government to re-finance the special district.

==Geography==
[[File:Hainan 1820-1875.jpg|thumb|250px|Ancient map of '''Hainan Island''']]
[[File:Hainan topographical map - cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Topographical map]]
Hainan, separated by the [[Qiongzhou Strait]] from the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] of [[Guangdong]], is the largest island administered by the [[People's Republic of China]]. The area of Hainan Island ({{Convert|32900|km2|mi2|-2|abbr=on}}, 97% of the province) is similar to that of [[Belgium]]. To the west of Hainan Island is the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. [[Wuzhi Mountain]] (1,840&nbsp;m) is the highest mountain on the island.

Hainan Island measures {{convert|155|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|169|km|abbr=on}} wide.

===Rivers and lakes===
Most of the rivers in Hainan originate in the central area of the island and flow radially in different directions. The [[Wanning River]] in the southern part of the island is the largest river surrounding Hainan. It is {{convert|350|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. The [[Nandu River]] in the northern part of the island is {{convert|314|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and its [[tributary]], the [[Xinwu River]], is {{convert|109|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.  The [[Changhua River]] in the west is {{convert|230|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and the [[Wanquan River]] in the east is {{convert|162|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. Evaporation during the dry season around the coastal areas greatly reduces the flow of the rivers.

There are very few natural lakes in Hainan. There is a well-known artificial [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]], the [[Songtao Reservoir]], in the central-north area.

===Islands===
{{Further|Islands of Hainan}}

====Nearby islands====
Several small islands exist around the coast of Hainan Island:
*[[Dazhou Island]] is located about {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} off the coast of [[Wanning]]
*[[Haidian Island]], on the north coast, is part of Haikou City
*[[Nanwan Monkey Island]], in actuality a peninsula
*[[Phoenix Island]] is an artificial resort island currently under construction in [[Sanya Bay]].
*[[Wuzhizhou Island]] is located within [[Haitang Bay]]
*[[Xinbu Island]] is located directly to the east of [[Haidian Island]]

Due to their close proximity to the main island, the flora, fauna, and climate conditions are very similar.

====Disputed islands====
{{See also|South China Sea Islands}}
[[File:South China Sea claims map.jpg|thumb|250px|Maritime claims of [[South China Sea]]]]
A number of small islands, which are located hundreds of kilometers to the south, are claimed and administrated by [[Sansha]] as part of Hainan Province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hainan.gov.cn/code/V3/map |title=电子地图 – 海南省人民政府网站 [Online Map - Hainan People's Government Website] |publisher=Hainan.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref> Sovereignty of these islands is however disputed. These islands include:

*[[Paracel Islands]] Xisha Islands – "The West-sands" – claimed by [[Vietnam]], the PRC and the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan, ROC)]]
**[[Money Island, Paracel Islands]]
**[[Rocky Island, South China Sea]]
**[[Tree Island, South China Sea]]
**[[Triton Island]]
**[[Woody Island, South China Sea]]
*[[Zhongsha Islands]] – "The Middle-sands"
*[[Spratly Islands]] – Nansha Islands – "The South-sands" are subject to claims by Vietnam, the PRC, ROC, [[Malaysia]], [[The Philippines]], and [[Brunei]].

===Environment===
Compared to most of mainland China, the air quality of Hainan is far higher. Throughout 2012, Hainan had the highest air quality in the country for 351 days.<ref name="chinadaily.com.cn">[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2013-06/25/content_16654150.htm Hainan Special: Report: Hainan grew greener in 2012 |IP Special |chinadaily.com.cn<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The provincial government's environmental protection campaign has taken action against a number of industrial plants. During 2012, several outdated manufacturing facilities had their business licenses revoked, and 175 cases related to illegal sewage discharge were handled.<ref name="chinadaily.com.cn"/>

Total sulfur dioxide emissions for the province were 34,000 tons in 2012, a 3 percent year-on-year reduction. In 2011, smog emissions were reduced 6.3 percent to 15,000 tons.<ref name="chinadaily.com.cn"/>

====Clean up of towns====

During 2015, a widespread program to clean up the towns and villages was undertaken. Government workers removed litter from villages and many roadsides. They removed numerous [[Illegal dumping|small, illegal dumps]], and placed plastic dumpsters in villages and countryside road intersections.

===Climate===
The climate of Hainan varies from subtropical to fully tropical. Northern Hainan, including the island's capital [[Haikou]], has a [[humid subtropical climate]], while most of the rest of the island has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] with warmer annual temperatures the further south a location is. The coldest months are January and February when temperatures drop to {{convert|16|to|21|°C|°F}}; the hottest months are July and August, and the temperatures are {{convert|25|to|29|°C|°F}}. Except for the mountainous regions in the central part of the island, the daily average temperature in Hainan in all months is well above {{convert|10|°C|°F}}, {{citation needed span|and the total number of [[growing degree-day]]s reaches eight thousand to nine thousand degrees Celsius.|date=July 2014}} The summer in the north is hot and, {{citation needed span|for more than 20 days in a year, the temperature can be higher than {{convert|35|°C|°F}}|date=July 2014}}<!--too much maritime moderation to be true-->. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|1500|to|2000|mm|in}} and can be as high as {{convert|2400|mm}} in central and eastern areas, and as low as {{convert|900|mm}} in the coastal areas of the southwest. Parts of Hainan lie in the path of [[typhoon]]s, and 70% of the annual precipitation is derived from typhoons and the summer rainy season. Major flooding occurs due to typhoons, which can cause many problems for local residents.

====Annual fog====
From January to February, the island of Hainan is affected by thick fog, particularly in coastal areas and the northern part of the island. This is caused by cold winter air from the north coming into contact with the warmer sea, causing the moisture that evaporates from the sea to be condensed into fog. The fog remains from day to night, and is evenly distributed. Visibility may be reduced to 50 metres for days at a time. During this period, residents normally keep windows shut. The moisture in the air is so extreme that the walls in homes weep, and floors often accumulate a layer of water several millimetres deep. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Near Xinlong, Hainan - 01.JPG|thumb|right|This view in [[Wanning]] near the southeast coast is typical of the inland countryside.]]
Hainan has over {{convert|1,500|km2|abbr=on}} of tropical forest, in which live 4,600 kinds of plants and more than 570 species of animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, due to an invasion of exotic species, human impact from tourism, deforestation, and the release of pollutants, many species are under threat. A report from the Department of Land, Environment and Resources of Hainan Province states that 200 species are near extinction, with 6 species, such as ''[[Maytenus hainanensis]]'' and ''[[Sciaphila tenella]]'' already extinct.<ref name="english.cri.cn">{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/6909/2012/05/02/2724s696818.htm |title=200 Species on Verge of Extinction in Hainan |publisher=English.cri.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>

===Flora===
The majority of Hainan's land mass is forest with 61.5 percent coverage (210,000 hectares) reported at the end of 2012. This is an increase of 34,133 hectares since 2011. A further 1,187 hectares grass and trees were planted along the province's highways.<ref name="chinadaily.com.cn"/>

There are 53 genera in 29 families of wild and cultivated fruit growing on Hainan Island.<ref>Gwinnell, Philip; Han, Bin (2010), ''China's Emerging Jewel, Hainan, The Definitive Guide'', ISBN 978-7-5501-0016-9., p.23-26</ref> There are few large trees on the island; coconut palms are very common along with other smaller trees. Most of Hainan Island is however covered by forest.
* [[Hainan yellow lantern chili]] is a pepper similar to the [[Scotch bonnet (pepper)|scotch bonnet]].
* [[Hainan white pine]], a species of tree.
* ''[[Cephalotaxus hainanensis]]'' is a species of plum-yew.

===Fauna===
There are numerous protected areas and wildlife preserves on the island. Animals that are ubiquitous throughout the island include frogs, toads, geckos, skinks, and butterflies. Present, but less commonly observed, are snakes ([[Asian palm pit viper]]s and [[red bamboo snake]]), [[Siberian chipmunk]]s, squirrels, and the [[masked palm civet]]. Almost no large animals remain in the wild. The lakes are largely populated with carp and catfish.

There are 362 known bird species.<ref name="english.cri.cn"/> Seabirds such as gulls are not generally seen. Egrets are common in agricultural areas. Similar to many subtropical areas, insect species are diverse, and mosquitoes are very common.

* [[Hainan gymnure]] (''Neohylomys hainanensis'' or Hainan moonrat) is a small mammal.
* [[Hainan partridge]] (''Arborophila ardens'') is a species of bird endemic to Hainan Island.
* [[Hainan peacock-pheasant]] (''Polyplectron katsumatae'') is an endangered species belonging to the [[Phasianidae]] family.
* [[Hainan black crested gibbon]] (''Nomascus hainanus'') is one of the world's most endangered primates.

* [[Hainan hare]] (''Lepus hainanus'') is a species of hare endemic to Hainan.
* A subspecies of the [[leopard cat]] (''Prionailurus bengalensis alleni'') is endemic to Hainan.
* [[Hainan leaf-warbler]] (''Phylloscopus hainanus'') is an Old World warbler in the [[Phylloscopidae]] family.

In the ocean, [[sea turtle]]s and [[whale shark]]s are known to migrate in these waters.

Many whales such as [[North Pacific right whale]]s, western [[gray whale]]s, [[humpback whale]]s, and [[blue whale]]s (all of these are almost extinct in Chinese waters)<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Sanya Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering at The Chinese Academy Of Sciences|title=Identification Guide for Marine Mammals In the South China Sea|url=http://124.16.218.4/index.php|accessdate=2015-01-19}}</ref> were historically seen in the winter and spring to mate and calve. These gentle giants of the sea had been hunted heavily and were wiped out by Japanese whalers (established whaling stations on various sites on Chinese and Korean coasts including Hainan and [[Daya Bay]]).

==Demographics==
[[File:Hainan ethnolinguistic 1967.png|right|thumb|Historical ethnolinguistic groups on Hainan, 1967 map<br/>{{smaller|([[:File:China ethnolinguistic 1967.jpg|Link to entire map]] including key)}}.]]
The population density of Hainan is low compared to most Chinese coastal provinces.

In 2000, the ethnic groups of Hainan included the [[Han Chinese]], known as the [[Hainan people|Hainanese]], who are the majority (84% of the population); the [[Li people|Li (Hlai)]] (14.7% of the population); the [[Miao people|Miao]] (0.7%) and the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] (0.6%).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Li are the largest indigenous group on the island in terms of population. Also found on the island are the [[Utsul]]s, descendants of [[Cham people (Asia)|Cham]] refugees, who are classified as [[Hui people|Hui]] by the Chinese government. There is a [[Tanka people|Tanka community]] that live at Sanya Bay.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/2011-02/24/content_12068512.htm 'Water gypsies' fear lifestyle sea change -]</ref>

Although they are indigenous to the island and do not speak a Chinese language, the [[Ong-Be language|Limgao (Ong-Be)]] people near the capital (8% of the population) are counted as Han Chinese.

===Religion===
[[File:East Mosque in Sanya, China.jpg|thumb|The East Mosque in [[Sanya]], a [[Islam in China|Chinese-Islamic architecture]].]]
Most of the Hainanese population practices [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]]. The [[Li people|Li]] population has a [[Theravada]] Buddhist minority. Most of the [[Utsul]]s of the island, a branch of [[Cham people]] living near [[Sanya]], are [[Muslim]]s. Because Hainan was a point in the travel route of missionaries, there are some [[Christian]]s. According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.48% of the province's population.<ref name="Wang2015">China General Social Survey (CGSS) 2009. Report by: [https://baylor-ir.tdl.org/baylor-ir/bitstream/handle/2104/9326/WANG-THESIS-2015.pdf?sequence=1 Xiuhua Wang (2015, p. 15)]</ref>

[[Nanshan Park]] is the centre of Buddhism on Hainan Island. Encompassing more than {{convert|50|km2|abbr=on}} of rainforest, the site includes countless grand temples, statues and spiritual gardens the likes of Saviour Garden and Longevity Valley, with intricately trimmed hedges and abundant in lotus flowers, a venerated symbol in Buddhism meaning virtue or purity.

At the heart of the valley is the grand [[Nanshan Temple (Sanya)|Nanshan Temple]], its gates flanked by stone figures of Buddha in front of the Tang Dynasty-style entrance. The interior displays images of the Four Heavenly Kings amid statues of other deities enshrined in renderings of stone, gold and jade.

Perhaps the most popular site within the [[Nanshan Buddhist Cultural Zone]] is the awe-inspiring stone rendering of the bodhisattva Guan Yin, emerging out of the South China Sea to stand at 108 metres, taller than the statue of liberty.

The Nanshan Buddhist Cultural Zone is visited by thousands of tourists and pilgrims each year who come pay homage to the site that plays a significant role in the religion in China and to sample some of the finest Buddhist vegan cuisine on the island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wenewsit.com/2011/06/spirituality-by-the-sea-in-hainan/ |title=wenewsit.com |publisher=wenewsit.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

===Languages===
{{cleanup|section|date=February 2011}}
The Han Chinese of Hainan speak a variant of the [[Min Nan]] Chinese language, known as [[Hainanese]]. In addition, the national standard ''[[Putonghua]]'' is understood and spoken by most people, and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] is understood by some local Hainanese.
The [[Li people|Li]], the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] and the [[Ong-Be language|Limgao (Ong-Be)]] speak [[Tai–Kadai languages]].
The [[Miao people|Miao]] speak [[Hmong–Mien]] languages. These groups would usually speak ''Putonghua'' as a second language.

4,500 people in the villages of [[Yanglan]] ({{lang|zh-hans|羊栏}}) and [[Huixin]] ({{lang|zh|回新}}), two villages on the outskirts of Sanya, speak the [[Tsat language]], a member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] [[Chamic languages]].

Adults who are members of a minority also have quite high literacy skills in Chinese. Most adults speak several Chinese dialects, and some also speak Li. In old Yacheng City and its vicinity as well as for several dozen miles west of Huihui and Huixin, the so-called military speech (the official language of the southwest among the northern Chinese dialects) is spoken. In Yanglan Village to the northeast, two Min dialects, both closely related to Cantonese, are spoken: the [[Mai dialect]] and the [[Danzhou dialect]], spoken in Haipo Village in the south, which is the same dialect as the dialect spoken in Danzhou in Dan Country in the northern part of the island. From the east to the west along the seashore, the Hainanese dialect is used. In Sanya City itself one sometimes finds speakers of Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese.

The general public can also use [[Standard Chinese]] to communicate with mainlanders. When Chams interact with the Hainanese dialect speakers from within Hainan Province, they use the Hainanese dialect, though youngsters generally use Mandarin. Not many can communicate in Li when interacting with the Li, so the Hainanese dialect or Mandarin is often used. In the market place and within the Sanya Municipality, the Cham speakers use Cham among themselves, and when they interact with speakers of other languages, they mostly use the Hainanese dialect. However, in the market places near the government seat of Yanglan Township, the Chams either use the Hainanese dialect or the Mai dialect.<ref name = "Thurgood 2006">Thurgood, Graham.

==Government==
Even while Hainan Island was a part of [[Guangdong]] it had a considerable amount of local autonomy; the southern half of the island was an [[autonomous prefecture]]. Hainan's elevation to provincial level in 1988 increased its [[accountability]] to the [[Central People's Government]], but by designating the new province a [[special economic zone]] the central government expressed its intent to allow Hainan maximum flexibility in devising programs to facilitate [[foreign investment]] and [[economic growth]]. Administratively, the province has been divided into five economic major districts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Hainan|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The politics of Hainan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The [[Governor of Hainan]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Hainan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hainan [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary or [[CPC Party Chief]].

===Intelligence===
Per the research conducted by [[Information Warfare Monitor]], Hainan is the physical location of [[GhostNet]].  The Chinese government has officially denied the existence of a cyber war and intelligence apparatus.

===Administrative===
In the official [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] territorial claim, Hainan Province includes not just one island, but also some two hundred [[South China Sea Islands]]. Whilst the containment of the South China Sea Islands means that Hainan Province has a very large water body, it has a disproportionally small land area. [[James Shoal]] ({{lang|zh-hans|曾母暗沙}} Zengmu Ansha), which is presently marked by the PRC, signifies the country's southernmost border. But [[Malaysia]] also claims that it is on their continental shelf.

===Subdivisions===
{{main|List of administrative divisions of Hainan|List of township-level divisions of Hainan}}
Hainan Province uses a slightly different administrative system than the other [[provinces of China]]. Most other provinces are divided entirely into [[Prefectures of the People's Republic of China|prefecture]]-level divisions, each of which is then divided entirely into [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|county]]-level divisions. County-level divisions generally do not come directly under the province. In Hainan, nearly all county-level divisions (the eight districts excepted) come directly under the province. This method of division is due to Hainan's relatively sparse population of around 8 million people.

===Military===
{{Main|People's Liberation Army Navy}}
Hainan Island is home to the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] [[Hainan Submarine Base]] and strategic [[nuclear submarine]] naval harbor at {{Coord|18.221|N|109.686|E|}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,353961,00.html|title=China Builds Secret Nuclear Submarine Base in South China Sea|date=2008-05-02|publisher=[[FoxNews.com]]|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> The naval harbor is estimated to be {{convert|60|ft|m}} high, built into hillsides around a military base. The caverns are capable of hiding up to 20 nuclear submarines from [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]]s. The harbor houses nuclear ballistic missile submarines and is large enough to accommodate [[aircraft carrier]]s. The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] has estimated that China will have five [[type 094 submarine]]s operational by 2010 with each capable of carrying 12 [[JL-2|JL-2 ballistic missiles]]. Two {{convert|950|m|ft|sing=on}} piers and three smaller ones would be enough to accommodate two [[carrier strike group]]s or [[amphibious assault ship]]s.

==Economy==
:''Further information: [[Hainan#Tourism|Tourism]]''
Hainan's economy is predominantly agricultural, and more than a half of the island's exports are agricultural products. Hainan's elevation to province-level status (1988), however, was accompanied by its designation as China's largest "[[special economic zone]]", the intent being to hasten the development of the island's plentiful resources.

Prior to this, the province had a reputation for being a "[[Wild West]]" area, largely untouched by [[industrialisation]]; even today there are relatively few [[factories]] in the province. [[Tourism]] plays an important part of Hainan's economy, thanks largely to its tropical beaches and lush forests.

The central government has encouraged foreign investment in Hainan and has allowed the island to rely to a large extent on market forces.

Hainan's industrial development largely has been limited to the processing of its mineral and agricultural products, particularly [[rubber]] and [[iron ore]]. Since the 1950s, machinery, farm equipment, and [[textiles]] have been manufactured in the [[Haikou]] area for local consumption. A major constraint on industrial expansion has been an inadequate supply of [[electricity]]. Much of the island's generating capacity is [[hydroelectric]], and it is subject to seasonal fluctuations in stream and river flows.

Its [[nominal GDP]] for 2011 was 251.5 billion yuan (US$39.9 billion), making it the 4th smallest in all of the PRC and contributes just 0.53% to the entire country's economy. At that time, its [[GDP per capita]] was 19,166 yuan (US$2,805).

By the first quarter of 2010, Hainan had the highest increase in GDP of any province in China, with a year-on-year increase of 25.1%. The GDP of Hainan's Qionghai city grew 58.7%.

In December 2009, the government of China announced that it plans to establish Hainan as an "international tourist destination" by 2020.<ref name="thechinaperspective1">{{cite web|url=http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/hainan-province/ |title=Hainan Province: Economic News and Statistics for Hainan's Economy |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> This announcement contributed to a surge in the province's economy, with a year-on-year increase in investment of 136.9% in the first three months of 2010. Hainan's real estate sector accounted for more than one third of the province's economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-05/10/content_9829683.htm |title=Hainan officials rule out bubble burst |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref>

===Duty-free program===
On April 20, 2011, a pilot [[duty-free]] program commenced with the aim of increasing [[Luxury goods of China|luxury goods]] purchases. It permits domestic Chinese visitors to claim tax refunds on imported luxury items purchased within the province. The maximum value is set at 5,000 yuan (US$762), with lowered tax rates on purchases over 5,000 yuan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jingdaily.com/hainan-island-set-to-launch-duty-free-luxury-shopping-program-in-sanya/8889/ |title=The Business of Luxury and Culture in China |publisher=Jing Daily |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> In October 2012, duty limits were raised to 8,000 yuan ($1,273), and became available to both domestic and international tourists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jingdaily.com/hainan-island-raises-duty-free-limits-to-spur-luxury-consumption/21280/ |title=The Business of Luxury and Culture in China |publisher=Jing Daily |date=2012-10-02 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>

===Natural resources===
Hainan has commercially exploitable reserves of more than 30 [[minerals]]. [[Iron]], first mined by the Japanese during their occupation of the island in [[World War II]], is the most important. Also important are [[titanium]], [[manganese]], [[tungsten]], [[bauxite]], [[molybdenum]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[gold]], and [[silver]]. There are large deposits of [[lignite]] and [[oil shale]] on the island, and significant offshore finds of [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] have been discovered. Virgin forests in the interior mountains contain more than 20 commercially valuable species, including [[teak]] and [[sandalwood]].

===Agriculture===
[[File:Near Xinlong, Hainan - 02.JPG |thumb|right|One of the many rice fields in Hainan]]
Owing to Hainan's tropical climate, [[paddy rice]] is cultivated extensively in the northeastern lowlands and in the southern mountain valleys.<ref name="thechinaperspective1"/> Leading crops other than rice include [[coconuts]], [[palm oil]], [[sisal]], [[tropical fruit]]s (including [[pineapple]]s, of which Hainan is China's leading producer), [[black pepper]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[cashews]], and [[sugarcane]]. In the early 20th century [[overseas Chinese|Chinese emigrants]] returning from then [[British Malaya]], introduced [[rubber tree]]s to the island; after 1950, state farms were developed, and Hainan now produces a substantial amount of China's rubber. The hot [[Hainan yellow lantern chili]], a variety unique to the island, is grown in the southeast and southwest.

Domesticated farm animals comprise mainly goats, cows, water buffalo, chickens, geese and ducks.

===Fisheries===
[[File:Fish farms in Chengmai - 01.jpg|thumbnail|[[Fish farm]]s in [[Chengmai]]]]
Grouper, Spanish mackerel, and tuna{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} constitute the bulk of the catch from offshore fishing grounds. Scallops and pearls are raised in shallow bays and basins for local use and export.

Shrimp production is estimated to have been {{convert|120000|to|150000|MT|ST}} in 2007, more than 50% of which was exported. Hainan has over 400 [[shrimp farm|hatcheries]], most being located between Wenchang and Qionghai.

Tilapia production in 2008 was {{convert|300000|MT|ST}}. The island has an estimated 100,000 local, commercial fish farming families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euchinawto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=314&Itemid=36 |title=Sustainable Aquaculture in South China – Shrimp and Tilapia Farming in Hainan and Guangdong Provinces |publisher=Euchinawto.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

In 1990, Hainan province was the site of the largest property bust in modern Chinese history<ref name="thechinaperspective1"/> With 2009 and the announcement of the Chinese Government's plan to develop the province into a major international tourist location, property sales rose by 73%, creating the possibility of another bubble in Hainan's property market.<ref name="thechinaperspective1"/>

Since March 2010, commercial and residential property values in some parts of Hainan have slowed down since the market peaked in February.
In March, average month-on-month transaction prices dropped 12.82% to 12,280 RMB per square meter, with a reduction in volume to {{convert|627000|m2|sqft|}}, a 19.05% decline. Later in April, prices declined 2.84% to 11,932 yuan per square metre, with a 57.59% decline in volume to {{convert|567200|m2|sqft|sp=us}}. Then in May prices declined a further 29.74% from the previous month to 8,483 yuan per square metre, with a 57.95% decline in volume to {{convert|229000|m2|sqft|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalvue.com/home/CE-news/inset/@10063/post/1197863 |title=CapitalVue News: Hainan Property Market Collapses |publisher=Capitalvue.com |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref> However, property prices in the tourist resort of Sanya remain strong as of January 2011, with prime developments selling at prices of up to 80,000 RMB per square metre.

===Golf industry===

===Automotive industry===
Domestic Chinese manufacturer, [[Haima Automobile]] has its global headquarters in [[Haikou]].

==Transportation==

===Road===
[[File:Hainan Island topographical.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing main highways]]
Before 1950 there were practically no transportation links with the interior of the island. The first roads were built in the early 20th century, but no major road construction was undertaken in the mountains until the 1950s. Parallel north–south roads along the east and west coasts and through the interior of the island constitute most of Hainan's road network.

===Air===
Hainan Province has two international airports, both on Hainan Island: the [[Haikou Meilan International Airport]] and [[Sanya Phoenix International Airport]]. [[Danzhou Airport]] is under construction.

===Rail===
Today's Hainan is ringed by standard-gauge railways. Since 2004, a [[rail ferry]] connects the island's railroad network to the mainland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200301/07/eng20030107_109686.shtml|title=Railway Ferry Service Across Qiongzhou Straits Begins|date=2003-01-08|publisher=[[People's Daily]] Online|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref> In 2005, [[Ministry of Communications of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Communications]] allocated 20 million yuan (US$2.4 million) to set up a committee to research and study the possibility of a bridge or tunnel link connecting the island to the mainland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/119799.htm|title=Hainan Mulls Bridge/ Tunnel Link to Mainland|author=Xinhua News Agency|date=2005-02-03|publisher=China.org.cn|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>

From the ferry terminal, located near [[Haikou Railway Station]] (west of Haikou), freight and passenger trains arriving from the mainland can proceed on the [[Hainan Western Ring Railway]] along the island's west coast, via [[Dongfang, Hainan|Dongfang]] to Sanya. This railway line has been developed over several decades, starting with a few short {{RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} [[narrow gauge]] lines constructed during the Japanese occupation in the early 1940s.

The [[Hainan Eastern Ring High-Speed Railway]] links [[Haikou]] and [[Sanya]] along the island's east coast. There are 15 stations in between, either in operation or still under construction. Trains are designed to travel at {{convert|250|km/h|abbr=on}}. Travel time from Haikou to Sanya is approximately 1 hour and 22 minutes.

The total length of [[Hainan Eastern Ring High-Speed Railway]] is {{convert|308.11|km|abbr=on}}. The in-between railway stations include [[Haikou East Railway Station|Haikou East]], [[Changliu Railway Station|Changliu]], [[Xiuying Railway Station|Xiuying]], [[Meilan Airport Railway Station|Meilan Airport]], [[Wenchang Railway Station|Wenchang]], [[Qionghai Railway Station|Qionghai]], [[Bo'ao Railway Station|Bo'ao]], [[Wanning Railway Station|Wanning]], [[Shenzhou Railway Station|Shenzhou]], [[Sun and Moon Bay Railway Station|Sun and Moon Bay]], [[Lingshui Railway Station|Lingshui]] and [[Tiandu Railway Station|Tiandu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unn.people.com.cn/GB/13627264.html |title=Hainan Steps into an Era of High Speed Railways (海南吉林迈入"高铁时代") |language=Chinese |publisher=[[People's Daily Online]] |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111001102416/http://unn.people.com.cn/GB/13627264.html |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}</ref>

The first train run started on 30 December 2010 at the price of 114 [[RMB]] for first-class seat and 95 [[RMB]] for a second-class seat for a full journey between [[Haikou]] and [[Sanya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.wenweipo.com/2010/12/28/NN1012280012.htm|title=Hainan's Eastern Ring Railway/Ticket Price|publisher=news.wenweipo.com|date=December 28, 2010|accessdate=January 10, 2012}}</ref>

The [[Hainan Western Ring High-Speed Railway]] is on the west coast of Hainan, roughly paralleling the existing Hainan Western Ring Railway. It links up with the Hainan Eastern Ring Railway at both ends, thus forming a high-speed railway ring around the island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.ifeng.com/usecar/traffic/20110104/504683.shtml|title=Hainan International Tourism Island Steps into the Age of High Speed Rail Age (海南吉林迈入高铁时代 高铁激活国际旅游岛)|language=Chinese|date=January 4, 2011|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Hainan Museum 01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]
Hainan has always been on the fringe of the Chinese cultural sphere. Traditionally, the island was a place of [[exile]] for criminals and disgraced officials. As a frontier region celebrated by such exiled poets as [[Su Dongpo]], Hainan acquired an air of mystery and romance. The influx of large numbers of mainlanders after 1950 – particularly in the 1970s, when young Chinese from southern Guangdong were assigned to state farms to help develop Hainan, and in the 1980s, when thousands more came to take advantage of the economic opportunities offered – has perpetuated the frontier atmosphere on the island.

==Media==
As well as programming from [[Central China Television]] (CCTV), Hainan has a number of local TV stations including [[Hainan Television|Hainan TV]] and [[Haikou Television|Haikou TV]]. The Chinese language ''[[Nanguo Metropolis Daily]]'', ''[[Haikou Evening News]]'', and ''[[Hainan Daily]]'' newspapers are published in Haikou.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Typical Hainan lunch - 01.jpg|thumb|right|Common dishes served in Hainan]]
{{Main|Hainan cuisine}}
Hainan cuisine is said to be "lighter, with mild seasonings." A lot of local taste is mixed with the Han Chinese taste. Seafood predominates the menu, as shrimp, crab, fish and other sea life are widely available.

[[Wenchang chicken]] is a dish known throughout the province of Hainan. Although there are many varieties of this dish, the name is usually used to define a type of small, free-range chicken from [[Wenchang]], located on the east coast of the province. As opposed to [[Battery cage|battery]] chickens, its meat has more texture and is somewhat drier.

[[Hainanese chicken rice|Hainan chicken rice]] is a famous dish in Southeast Asia bearing the region's name. However, whilst many restaurants use  chicken fat to quickly add flavour to the dish, the proper local method is to 'marinate' the rice with chicken soup to add a more full flavour.

==Tourism==
[[File:HainanSanya4.jpg|thumb|right|Located in Sanya, this beach is typical of those along the entire eastern coast of Hainan]]
During 2011, more than 30 million tourists visited Hainan, mostly from mainland China. Of the 814,600 overseas tourists, 227,600 of them came from Russia, a 53.3 percent a rise year-on-year.<ref name="news.xinhuanet.com">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-05/01/c_131562175.htm |title=Sanya big draw for tourists - Xinhua &#124; English.news.cn |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2012-05-01 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref> Total revenue during that year was 32 billion RMB ($4.3 billion US), up 25 percent from 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ttgasia.com/article.php?article_id=3572 |title=Leader in Hotel, Airlines, Tourism and Travel Trade News - Hainan unveils plans to boost infrastructure, flight connectivity |publisher=TTG Asia |date=2012-05-03 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>

In the first quarter of 2012, the Hainan Provincial Tourism Development Commission reports that Hainan received 208,300 overnight visitors, 25 percent of whom came from Russia.<ref name="news.xinhuanet.com"/>

In 2000, the province initiated a visa-upon-arrival policy for foreign tourist groups. It is available to citizens of twenty-six different countries, and was established in order to attract visitors.

To encourage tourism to Hainan, visitors are allowed to claim a maximum 8,000 yuan tax refund on luxury items purchased within the province.

Hainan Island is often divided into eight regions for tourism purposes: Haikou and area (Haikou, [[Qiongshan]], [[Ding'an County|Ding'an]]); the Northeast ([[Wenchang]]); the Central East Coast (Qionghai, Ding'an); the South East Coast; the South (Sanya); the West Coast also called the [[Chinese Riviera]] (Ledong, Dongfang, Xianghsui, Changjiang); the North West ([[Danzhou]], Lingao, Chengmai); and the Central Highlands (Baisha, Qiongzhong, and Wuzhishan/Tongzha).

===Yachting===
To encourage the international yachting community, new regulations now allow foreign yachts to stay for a total of 183 days each year, with a maximum single stay duration of 30 days. 13 additional ports will be built around the island to accommodate this market.<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/china-opening-up-hainan-island-to-the-world-2257987.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=China opening up Hainan Island to the world | date=2011-03-31}}</ref>

===Historical sites===
{{main|Major national historical and cultural sites (Hainan)}}
Haikou is the province's capital and contains interesting historic sites. Also known as Coconut City, Haikou is a major port.  The [[Five Officials Temple]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|五|公|祠}}|p={{linktext|Wŭ|gōng| cí}}}}, {{Coord|20|0|35.79|N|110|21|17.34|E|region:CN-46_type:landmark|display=inline}}) consists of five traditional temples and halls that were built in honour of five officials of the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties. These officials were banished to Hainan for periods ranging from 11 days to 11 years for speaking out against what they felt were wrong practices by the emperors. (It is perhaps significant that the establishment of the Five Officials Temple in the late 19th century coincides with a time when China's territorial integrity was under threat, and that several of the officials honoured here were exiled for espousing aggressive policies on the recapture of the north of China from the [[Jurchens]] during the Southern [[Song dynasty]].)

[[Xiuying Fort Barbette]] was built in 1891 to defend the southeastern corner of China during the [[Sino-French War]]. The Xiuying Fort Barbette covers about a third of an acre.  Its five large cannons are still intact and viewable at the site.

[[File:Hai Rui tomb 01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Tomb of [[Hai Rui]]]]
The Tomb of [[Hai Rui]] ({{Coord|20|0|29.66|N|110|17|30.18|E|region:CN-46_type:landmark|display=inline}}) is a key national cultural protection site. [[Hai Rui]] was a compassionate and popular official of Hainanese origins who lived during the Ming Dynasty.  He was famous for his lifelong honesty and his willingness to speak out on behalf of local people.  In later life, Hai Rui was persecuted and fell out of favour with the emperor.  His admirers built the Hai Rui Tomb after his death to commemorate his great works.  Construction of the tomb began in 1589.

The [[Yangpu Ancient Salt Field]] is a heritage site in Yantian village on [[Yangpu Peninsula]]. The area comprises more than 1,000 stones, cut flat on top, used to dry seawater to produce salt.

===Space centre===
:''Main article [[Wenchang Satellite Launch Center]]''
China announced in October 2007 that it would build its fourth space launch centre, just a week after it fired off its first lunar orbiter.  The new launch centre, to be built on the eastern island province of Hainan, is scheduled to start operating between 2014 and 2015.  The location of the launch centre in Hainan, a low-latitude coastal region advantageous for orbital launches, will displace more than 6,000 residents that will be relocated to make way for the space centre, which will occupy {{convert|1200|ha|acre}}.
The site will be mainly used for launching various kinds of satellites and large space stations. The plan has been approved by the government.  A {{convert|407|ha|acre|adj=on}} space themed park will also be constructed near the new launch centre.

==Notable residents==
The poet [[Su Shi]] (1036–1101) popularized Hainan's isolation and exoticism when he was exiled there under the [[Song dynasty]]. The [[Dongpo Academy]] was built on the site of the residence where he lived in exile.

[[Hai Rui]] (1514–1587) was a famous Chinese official of the [[Ming dynasty]]. His name has come down in history as a model of honesty and integrity in office.

[[Chih-Ping Chen]] (1906-1983) was a distinguished diplomat and statesman for the Republic of China, who served to build the Yunnan-Burma Road, and a diplomatic career that spanned four decades.

The most well-known native of Hainan is Chinese-American [[Methodist]] minister turned businessman, [[Charlie Soong]], father of the [[Shanghai]]-born [[Soong sisters]]: [[Soong Ai-ling]], wife of [[H.
