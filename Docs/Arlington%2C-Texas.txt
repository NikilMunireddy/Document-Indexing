==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Arlington, Texas}}
European settlement in the Arlington area dates back at least to the 1840s. After the May 24, 1841 battle between Texas General Edward H. Tarrant (Tarrant County is named after him) and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the Village Creek settlement, a trading post was established at [http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMTMK_Marrow_Bone_Spring Marrow Bone Spring] in present-day Arlington (historical marker at {{coord|32|42.136|N|97|6.772|W|type:landmark}}). The rich soil of the area attracted farmers, and several [[agriculture]]-related businesses were well established by the late nineteenth century.

Arlington was founded in 1876 along the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]].<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=hja13|name=Arlington, Texas}}</ref>  The city was named after [[Robert E. Lee|General Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. Arlington grew as a cotton-ginning and farming center, and incorporated in 1884. The city could boast of water, electricity, natural gas, and telephone services by 1910, along with a public school system. By 1925 the population was estimated at 3,031, and it grew to over 4,000 before World War II.

Large-scale [[industrialization]] began in 1954 with the arrival of a [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] [[Arlington Assembly|assembly plant]]. [[Automotive]] and [[aerospace]] development gave the city one of the nation's greatest population growth rates between 1950 and 1990. Arlington became one of the "[[boomburb]]s", the extremely fast-growing [[suburbs]] of the post-World War II era. [[U.S. Census Bureau]] population figures for the city tell the story: 7,692 (1950), 90,229 (1970), 261,721 (1990), 365,438 (2010)<ref>{{cite web|title=DP-1 'Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010' with '2010 Demographic Profile Data'|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1|publisher=U. S. Census Bureau|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref> and almost 374,000 by 2011.<ref name="State & County QuickFacts"/> [[Tom Vandergriff]] served as mayor from 1951 to 1977 during this period of explosive development. Six Flags Over Texas opened in Arlington in 1961. In 1972 the [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] baseball team relocated to Arlington and began play as the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and in 2009 the [[Dallas Cowboys]] also began to play at the newly constructed Cowboys Stadium, now [[AT&T Stadium]].

===Professional sports===
Arlington has long been the home of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball team, who made [[Arlington Stadium]] their first home upon moving to Dallas/Fort Worth from Washington, D.C. in 1972. In 1994, the Rangers built a new stadium, [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]. The Rangers made trips to both the [[2010 World Series]] and [[2011 World Series]] both of which they lost, the first to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in 5 games, and the second to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 7 games.

The [[Dallas Cowboys]] football team moved from [[Texas Stadium]] in Irving, Texas to the new ostensibly City-of-Arlington-owned [[Cowboys Stadium]] (renamed "[[AT&T Stadium]]" in July, 2013), which is within walking distance of the Rangers Ballpark.  Completed in 2009, it has attracted high-profile sporting events to Arlington, including the [[2010 NBA All-Star Game]], [[Super Bowl XLV]] in 2011, the 2013 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball South Regional Championships, and the 2014 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Final Four; the stadium was also the site of the first [[College Football Championship Game]] in January 2015 (covering the 2014 season). The Dallas Cowboys rent AT&T Stadium from the City of Arlington for $167,500 per month over a thirty-year period, a sum far less than market value; in the exchange the Cowboys have complete control over the facility's calendar and the revenues collected therefrom, including naming rights, billboard advertising, concession sales and most of the surrounding parking.

The [[Dallas Wings]] became the first [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA) franchise in North Texas in 2015. They were known as the Tulsa Shocks while based in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], but reinvented their brand after relocating to North Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/wnbas-dallas-wings-introduced-in-dfw-metroplex/|title=WNBA's Dallas Wings Introduced in DFW Metroplex|publisher=WNBA|date=|accessdate=2015-11-23}}</ref> The Wings play home games at the [[College Park Center]] in Arlington.

===College sports===
The [[UT Arlington Mavericks]] are the athletic teams representing The [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. The Mavericks compete in the NCAA [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Sun Belt Conference]] in 14 varsity sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utamavs.com/ |title=UT Arlington Official Athletic Site – The University of Texas at Arlington |publisher=Utamavs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-23}}</ref>

UTA was a founding member of the Southland Conference in 1963 and participated in the league until the end of the 2011-12 athletic year. They joined the Western Athletic Conference for one year before moving to the Sun Belt Conference.

A new arena called the [[College Park Center]] is now the host facility for basketball and volleyball home games as well as other university activities. The arena opened February 1, 2012 and seats approximately 7,000 people.  Baseball home games are held at the [[Clay Gould Ballpark]] and softball home games are at the [[Allan Saxe Field]]; both facilities completed $5.5 million in upgrade cost in early 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utamavs.com/sports/m-basebl/archive/clubhouse.html |title=UT Arlington Official Athletic Site – Baseball |publisher=Utamavs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-23}}</ref>

The Mavericks' team name selection was made in 1971, predating the National Basketball Association's expansion franchise Dallas Mavericks' starting choice in 1980.<ref>[[Texas–Arlington Mavericks]]</ref>

For the third year (2016) in a row the UTA Maverick Cheerleaders are [http://nca.varsity.com/ NCA] Collegiate National Champions.<ref>{{cite web|title=College Nationals Wall of Fame|url=http://nca.varsity.com/College/Wall-Of-Fame-College-Nationals|website=Varsity|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2015 NCA & NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championship|url=http://www.varsity.com/uploads/events/eventid_1931/files/2015_Final_Small_Coed_I-RANKINGS.pdf|website=Varsity|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref>

[[Arlington Baptist College]] also competes in a number of sports. They are known as the Patriots and is an active member in the [[National Christian College Athletic Association]], Southwest Region, Division II, and is a member of the [[Association of Christian College Athletics]]. The sports Arlington Baptist competes in range from: basketball (men and women's), golf (men and women's), cross country (men and women's), Track & Field (men), volleyball (women), softball (women), and baseball (men).

===High School sports===
[[Arlington High School (Arlington, Texas)|Arlington High School]], and The Oakridge School owns the city's only state football championship, having won it in 1951 under head coach [[Mayfield Workman]], and in 2011 under head coach Phillip Farhat. Lamar High School nearly pulled off the same feat in 1990, but had to settle for a state runner-up title. In recent years, [[Bowie High School (Arlington, Texas)|Bowie High School]], [[Martin High School (Arlington, Texas)|Martin High School]] and [[Mansfield Summit High School]] (a [[Mansfield Independent School District|Mansfield ISD]] school located within Arlington) have enjoyed some success.

Arlington High and Bowie High School play football home games at UT Arlington's [[Maverick Stadium]].  Cravens Field, on the campus of Lamar but funded by Martin High School, and Wilemon Field, on the campus of Sam Houston, are home to the other four teams in the city.

Bowie High School's girls basketball 2005 5A state title is the city's most recent basketball state title victory.<ref>http://www.uiltexas.org/basketball/archives-girls/P48</ref>

There are a wide variety of sport programs active at each high school in Arlington, some consistently rank among the state's best.  For instance, Martin High School's varsity football and baseball programs have a long tradition of producing winning seasons and decorated players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://martinbaseball.com/tradition |title=tradition « Warriors Baseball |publisher=Martinbaseball.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-23}}</ref> And in 2015, Arlington High School Lady Colts varsity volleyball team won a berth to the state playoffs for the 29th consecutive year.<ref>http://www.aisd.net/AISD/Athletics/Volleyball/tabid/10948/Default.aspx</ref>

Not all city of Arlington residents are in the AISD, and not all AISD students are residents of Arlington. There are currently ten AISD high schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=School Directory|url=http://www.aisd.net/information/School_Directory.aspx|website=Arlington Independent School District|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
On July 2, 1902 the first Dallas/Fort-Worth "Interurban" electric trolley came to Arlington; this popular service ran between those three cities and points in between until Christmas Eve, 1934, providing easy transportation for both business and pleasure.  The track ran through Arlington along what is now Abram Street.

[[File:RonaldReaganMemorialHwy ArlingtonTX.jpg|260px|right|thumb|On February 16, 2006, [[Interstate 20 (Texas)|I-20]] in Arlington was dedicated as Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway (signs are visible at [[mile marker]]s 447 and 452).]]

[[Arlington Municipal Airport (Texas)|Arlington Municipal Airport]] '''(GKY)''' is located entirely within Arlington and is a public use airport owned by the City of Arlington. It serves as a reliever airport for [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] and [[Dallas Love Field]] (though it lacks scheduled airline service) and is currently used for [[general aviation]] purposes. Several companies operate aircraft services on the airport property, including the [[Bell Helicopter]] division of [[Textron]].

For many years, Arlington had the somewhat notorious distinction of being the largest city in the United States that was not served by a public transportation system.<ref name="wired.com">http://www.wired.com/2013/08/arlington-texas-bus/</ref> Between 1980 and 2013, voters rejected three separate ballot proposals to bring public transportation to the city, though certain political and economic realities particular to North Texas made successful passage of those measures arguably more difficult in Arlington than in other parts of the state or country.<ref name="wired.com"/><ref>http://www.texastribune.org/2014/04/07/arlington-monitors-success-first-ever-commuter-bus/</ref>
On August 19, 2013, following unanimous approval by the Arlington city council, the [http://www.ridethemax.com/ Metro Arlington Express (MAX)] bus route began a two-year pilot program providing a two-stop weekday bus route between College Park Center (near [[University of Texas, Arlington]]) and the [[Trinity Railway Express]] (TRE) CentrePort Station near [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]]; from this station riders may take the TRE to Fort Worth, Dallas and points in between, all of which are served by comprehensive public transit systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arlington Gets Public Transportation Service|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/08/19/arlington-gets-public-transportation-service|publisher=CBS DFW|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}</ref>  The MAX program was funded primarily by the City of Arlington and the University of Texas at Arlington, with cooperation and contributions from other regional transportation entities and municipalities, along with contributions from local businesses.<ref>http://www.star-telegram.com/news/traffic/your-commute/article3869864.html</ref> In July 2015, the Arlington city council voted to extend the MAX program for an additional year.<ref>http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Arlington-MAX-Bus-Service-to-Continue-for-Another-Year-312695691.html</ref>  Under existing state finance laws, the voters of Arlington would have to approve any permanent funding for the MAX program.

Arlington does have four transit services targeting individual demographic groups: "Handitran" serves senior citizens and the disabled; Arlington hotels pay for a tourist-oriented shuttle-bus system for their guests; the University of Texas at Arlington runs a limited shuttle service for college students; and lastly Mission Arlington, an Arlington-run charity serving the severely indigent, has a bus service that circulates people needing social services or transportation to employment.

The city is served by two Interstate Highways, [[File:I-20.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 20 in Texas|I-20]], also known as [[Ronald Reagan]] Memorial Highway, and [[File:I-30.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 30 in Texas|I-30]], also named [[Tom Landry]] Memorial Highway. Other limited-access freeways include [[File:Texas 360.svg|20px]] [[Texas State Highway 360|State Highway 360]], which is named for the founder of [[Six Flags Over Texas]], [[Angus G. Wynne]], running along the eastern border, and [[File:US 287.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 287 in Texas|U.S. Highway 287]], which traverses the southwestern portion of the city.  In most cases, the memorial names are not used in reference to these roadways.

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] now owns and operates the original Texas and Pacific (later [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri Pacific]]) transcontinental right-of-way and rail route though Arlington (parallel to which the Interurban originally ran); it offers no passenger stops in Arlington, its Arlington freight service is primarily to the local General Motors assembly plant, and most of its lengthy and numerous freight trains are merely passing through town to and from points far away.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=eqt08|name=Texas and Pacific Railway}}</ref><ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=eqm06|name=Missouri Pacific System}}</ref>
