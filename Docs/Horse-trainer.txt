Horse trainer

A '''Horse trainer''' is a person who [[horse training|trains horses]] for racing, riding, show or work.  This involves exercising, feeding, and grooming them, to get them used to human contact.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://occupationalinfo.org/41/419224010.html |title=419.224-010: HORSE TRAINER (agriculture; amuse. & rec.) |work=Dictionary Of Occupational Titles |accessdate=2013-01-20}}</ref>  

In [[horse racing]], a trainer prepares a horse for races, with responsibility for exercising it, getting it race-ready and determining which races it should enter. Leading horse trainers can earn a great deal of money from a percentage of the winnings that they charge the owner for training the horse.

Outside horse racing, most trainers specialize in a certain [[equestrianism]] discipline, such as [[show jumping]], [[reining]], [[rodeo]], [[sport horse]] disciplines, training of a specific [[horse breed]], starting young horses,  or working with problem horses. There are a wide variety of [[horse training]] methods used to teach the horse to do the things humans want them to do. Some fields can be very lucrative,  usually depending on the value of the horses once trained or prize money available in competition.  However, as a rule, most horse trainers earn, at best, a modest income which often requires supplementation from a second job or additional horse-related business, such as horse boarding or riding lessons.

Horse trainers are typically deemed to have the status of agents for the horse owners. As such, they have legal obligations to their owners, as well as authority to represent and even bind their owners to certain transactions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Frank T|title=Equine Law|date=2013|isbn=978-0-615-90347-7|page=83}}</ref>
