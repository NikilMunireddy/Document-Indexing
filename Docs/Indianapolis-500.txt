The '''Indianapolis 500''' is an [[Auto racing|automobile race]] held annually at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in [[Speedway, Indiana]], an [[enclave]] [[suburb]] of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. The event is held over [[Memorial Day]] (originally [[Decoration Day]]) weekend, which is typically the last weekend in May. It is contested as part of the [[IndyCar Series|Verizon IndyCar Series]], the top level of [[American Championship Car Racing|American Championship Car]] racing, an [[open wheel car|open-wheel]] [[formula racing|formula]] colloquially known as "Indy Car Racing". The name of the race is often shortened to '''Indy 500'''.

The event, billed as ''The Greatest Spectacle in Racing'', is considered part of the [[Triple Crown of Motorsport]], which comprises three of the most prestigious motorsports events in the world. The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent [[seating capacity]] is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/stadium_list/100000.shtml|title=World Stadiums - Stadium List :: 100 000+ Stadiums|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref>

The inaugural running was won by [[Ray Harroun]] in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]]. The race celebrated its 100th anniversary in [[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]], and the 100th running was held in [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]]. [[Alexander Rossi (racing driver)|Alexander Rossi]] is the defending champion. The most successful drivers are [[A. J. Foyt]], [[Al Unser]], and [[Rick Mears]], each of whom have [[List of Indianapolis 500 winners|won the race]] four times. The active driver with the most victories is [[Hélio Castroneves]], with three. [[Rick Mears]] holds the record for most career [[List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters|pole positions]] with six. The most successful car owner is [[Roger Penske]], owner of [[Team Penske]], which has 16 total wins and 17 poles.

==Race specifics==
[[File:Ims aerial.jpg|thumb|The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]
The Indianapolis 500 is held annually at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], a 2.5 mile [[Oval track racing|oval circuit]]. Drivers race 200 laps, counterclockwise around the circuit, for a distance of 500 miles. Since its inception in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]], the race has always been scheduled on or around [[Memorial Day]]. Since 1974, the race has been scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. Practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race.

[[Indianapolis 500 traditions|Traditionally]], the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. The event is contested by [[American Championship car racing|"Indy cars"]], a [[Formula racing|formula]] of [[Professional sports|professional]]-level, single-seat, open [[cockpit]], [[Open-wheel car|open-wheel]], purpose-built race cars. As of [[2015 IndyCar Series season|2015]], all entrants utilize 2.2&nbsp;[[Litre|L]] [[V6 engine|V6]], twin-[[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] engines, tuned to produce a range of {{convert|550|-|700|hp}}. [[Chevrolet]] and [[Honda]] are the current engine manufacturers involved in the sport. [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], which has a deep history in the sport, dating back to the first 500, is the exclusive tire provider.

The race is the most prestigious event of the [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] calendar, and one of the oldest and [[Triple Crown of Motorsport|most important]] automobile races. It has been avouched to be the largest single-day sporting event in the entire world. Likewise, the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] itself is regarded as the world's [[List of sports venues by capacity|largest sporting facility]] in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]13 million in [[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]], with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports.

Due to safety issues, the race is not held in wet conditions. In the event of a [[Rainout (sports)|rain delay]], the race will be postponed until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race, officials can end the race and declare the results official if more than half of the scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed.

===The early years===
[[File:1912 Indianapolis 500, Joe Dawson winning.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Dawson (racing driver)|Joe Dawson]] winning the [[1912 Indianapolis 500]]]]

The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] complex was built in 1909 as a gravel-and-tar track and hosted a smattering of small events, including ones for [[motorcycle]]s.<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. "Indianapolis:  The Richest Race in the World", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 9, p.1012.</ref> The first long distance event, in "fearful conditions",<ref>The track was potholing even in practise.</ref> was the 100-lap [[Prest-O-Lite]] Trophy in 1909, won by [[Bob Burman]] in a [[Buick]].<ref>He averaged {{convert|53.77|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} Kettlewell, p.1013.</ref> Breakup of the [[asphalt]] led to two fatal accidents in the first two long-distance events (a {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}}, which was shortened to {{convert|235|mi|km|abbr=on}} after two severe wrecks).<ref>[[Wilfred Bourque]] (Kettlewell, p.1013, mistakenly identifies him as William) and his [[riding mechanic]] were killed after hitting a pothole in the 250, and [[Charley Merz]]'s riding mechanic, Claude Kellum, as well as two spectators, were killed in the 300; following Merz's crash, there was another serious crash, also.

}}</ref> he also added a {{convert|2|ft|9|in|m|2|abbr=on}} concrete wall around the track's circumference.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1013" /> During the 1910 [[Decoration Day]] weekend, the first events on the newly paved circuit drew 60,000 spectators; [[Ray Harroun]] won the {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} Wheeler-Schebler Trophy in a [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]].<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1013" />

The crowds grew progressively smaller for the rest of the season, however, so the track owners chose to focus on a single race. They considered a 24-hour contest, in the fashion of [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], or a {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1013" /> They instead chose a {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}} contest, and offered a spectacular [[prize money|purse]] of $US25,000, [[Gold Standard Act|equivalent]] to {{convert|37.615|kg|abbrev=on}} of pure gold.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1013" /> The combination allowed the track to rapidly acquire a privileged status for automobile races.

The [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first "500"]] was held at the Speedway on Decoration Day (as Memorial Day was known from its inception in 1868 to 1967 when Federal Law made Memorial Day the official name), May 30, 1911,<ref name="INDY3">{{cite web

In 1912, the purse was raised to US$50,000.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1014" /> The field was limited to 33 (where it remains) and a riding mechanic was made mandatory.<ref>Kettlewell, p.1014</ref> This second event was won by [[Joe Dawson (racecar driver)|Joe Dawson]] in a [[National Motor Vehicle Company|National]],<ref>The company was owned by Speedway investor [[Arthur Newby|Arthur C.

The 1913 event saw a change to a {{convert|450|cid|cc|abbr=on}} maximum engine size.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1014" />

After [[World War I]], the native drivers and manufacturers regained their dominance of the race. Engineer [[Harry Arminius Miller|Harry Miller]] set himself up as the most competitive of the post-war builders.<ref name="INDY5">{{cite web

}}</ref> His technical developments allowed him to be indirectly connected to a history of success that would last into the mid-1970s.

For musical entertainment prior to the start of the race, the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band]] began performing on the track near the finish-line in 1927 and has been the host band of the race ever since. In 1946 American [[opera]]tic tenor and car enthusiast [[James Melton]] started the tradition of singing "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]" with the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band|Purdue Band]] before the race when asked to do so on the spur of the moment by Speedway president [[Tony Hulman]]. This tradition has continued through the years, notably by actor and singer [[Jim Nabors]] from 1972 until 2014.<ref>{{cite web

===Miller and Offenhauser===
[[File:Mercedes w154 indianapolis.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mercedes-Benz W154]] entered by Don Lee at the [[1947 Indianapolis 500]] with [[Duke Nalon]] as driver]]

Following the European trends, engine sizes were limited to {{convert|183|cid|cc|abbr=on}} during 1920–1922, {{convert|122|cid|cc|abbr=on}} for 1923–1925, and {{convert|91|cid|cc|abbr=on}} in 1926–1929.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1014" /> The 1920 race was won by [[Gaston Chevrolet]] in a [[Frontenac Motor Corporation|Frontenac]], prepared by his brothers, powered by the first eight-cylinder engine to win the 500.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1014" /> For 1923, riding mechanics were no longer required.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1015">Kettlewell, p.1015.</ref> A [[Supercharging|supercharged]] car, ID, first won the race in 1924.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1015" /> In 1925, [[Pete DePaolo]] was the first to win at an average over {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with a speed of {{convert|101.13|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1014" />

In the early 1920s, Miller built his own 3.0 litre (183 in³) engine, inspired by the [[Peugeot]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] engine which had been serviced in his shop by [[Fred Offenhauser]] in 1914, installing it in [[James Anthony Murphy|Jimmy Murphy]]'s [[Duesenberg]] and allowing him to win the 1922 edition of the race.<ref name="INDY5" /> Miller then created his own automobiles, which shared the 'Miller' designation, which, in turn, were powered by supercharged versions of his 2.0 and 1.5 liter (122 and 91 in³) engine single-seaters, winning four more races for the engine up to 1929 (two of them, 1926 and 1928, in Miller chassis).<ref name="INDY6">{{cite web

|title=1926 Miller 91 FWD
}}</ref> The engines powered another seven winners until 1938 (two of them, 1930 and 1932, in Miller chassis), then ran at first with stock-type motors before later being adjusted to the international 3.0 liter formula.

After purchasing the Speedway in 1927, [[Eddie Rickenbacker]] prohibited supercharging and increased the displacement limit to {{convert|366|cid|cc|abbr=on}}, while also re-introducing the riding mechanic.<ref name="Kettlewell, p.1015" />

In 1935, Miller's former employees, Fred Offenhauser and Leo Goosen, had already achieved their first win with the soon-to-become famous 4-cylinder [[Offenhauser]] or "Offy" engine. This motor was forever connected with the Brickyard's history with a to-date record total of 27 wins, in both naturally aspirated and supercharged form, and winning a likewise record-holding 18 consecutive years between 1947 and 1964.<ref name="INDY7">{{cite web

===European incursions===
Meanwhile, European manufacturers, gone from the Indianapolis 500 for nearly two decades, made a brief return just before [[World War II]], with the competitive [[Maserati]] 8CTF allowing [[Wilbur Shaw]] to become the first driver to win consecutively at Indianapolis in 1939–1940.<ref name="INDY12">{{cite web

===World Series===
[[File:Fittipaldi indy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emerson Fittipaldi]] driving the [[Penske PC-23]] at the [[1994 Indianapolis 500|1994]] event]]

After foreign cars became the norm, foreign drivers began competing in the Indianapolis 500 on a regular basis, choosing the United States as their primary base for their motor racing activities. [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Teo Fabi]] and [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[Roberto Guerrero]], were able to obtain good outings in the '80s, as was [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] [[Arie Luyendyk]]. However, it was not until 1993 that [[1992 Formula One season|reigning]] [[Formula One]] World Champion [[Nigel Mansell]] shocked the racing world by moving to the United States, winning the [[Champ Car|CART]] [[PPG Industries|PPG]] [[Champ Car|IndyCar World Series]] [[1993 IndyCar season|Championship]] and only losing [[1993 Indianapolis 500|the 500]] in his rookie year because of inexperience with green-flag restarts.<ref name="INDY23">{{cite web

}}</ref> Foreign-born drivers became a regular fixture of Indianapolis in the years to follow. Despite the increase in foreign drivers commonly being associated with the [[Champ Car|CART]] era, it should be noted that four of the first six [[List of Indianapolis 500 winners|Indianapolis 500 winners]] were non-American drivers.

===Race name===
The race was originally advertised as the "International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race"<ref name="INDY3" /> from 1911 to 1916. However, from its inception, the race has been widely known as the Indianapolis 500 or, more simply as "the 500". In 1919, the race was referred to as the "Liberty Sweepstakes" following [[World War I|WWI]].<ref name="INDY8">{{cite news|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9403EEDF1338EE32A25755C0A9639C946896D6CF|title=Limit Auto Race Entries: Only Thirty-Three Drivers to Start in Indianapolis Sweepstakes| date=May 6, 1919|accessdate=2015-05-28}}</ref> From 1920 to 1980, the race officially reverted to the "International Sweepstakes" moniker, as printed on the tickets and other paraphernalia, with slight variations over the years.

Following [[World War II|WWII]], the race was commonly recognized as "The 500", "The 500-Mile Race", "Indianapolis 500-Mile Race", "Indianapolis 500", or the simple form "Indy 500". Usually the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] (e.g. "50th") preceded it. Often the race was also advertised on the radio as the "Annual Memorial Day race," or similar variations.

For the [[1981 Indianapolis 500|1981 race]], the name "65th Indianapolis 500-Mile Race" was officially adopted, with all references as the "International Sweepstakes" dropped. Since 1981, the race has been formally advertised in this fashion, complete with a unique annual logo with the ordinal almost always included. Around that same time, in the wake of the [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979]] entry controversy, and the formation of [[Champ Car|CART]], the race changed to an invitational event, rather than an [[Open (sport)|Open]], rendering the "[[sweepstakes]]" description inappropriate.

Since its inception, the race has eschewed any sort of [[naming rights]] or [[Sponsor (commercial)|title sponsor]], a move, though uncommon in the modern sports world, has been well received by fans. While the facility has numerous sponsor billboards around the grounds, including some mildly controversial ads on the retaining walls and infield grass, the Speedway has preferred to feature a contingent of several prominent official race sponsors rather than one primary title sponsor. In the 21st century on television, the race broadcast has been advertised with a title sponsor. Currently on ABC-TV, the race is referred to as the ''Indianapolis 500 Telecast Presented by Firestone'', but this appears only on the U.S. telecasts, and mention of the sponsor is not visible for patrons at the track.

The [[Borg-Warner Trophy]], introduced in 1936,<ref name="INDY9">{{cite web|publisher=IndySpeedway.com|url=http://www.indymotorspeedway.com/borg.htm|title=The Borg-Warner Trophy}}</ref> proclaims the event as the "Indianapolis 500-Mile Race", with no reference at all to the name "International Sweepstakes".

===Centennial Era===
In 2009, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway began a three-year-long "Centennial Era" to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the track (1909), and the 100th anniversary of the [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first Indy 500]] (1911).<ref name="INDY11">{{cite web|publisher=Indiana Office of Tourism Development|url=http://www.in.gov/visitindiana/homepageed2.aspx|title=Indianapolis Motor Speedway Centennial Era, 2009–2011}}</ref> As a gesture to the nostalgic ''Centennial Era'' celebration (2009–2011), tickets for the [[2009 Indianapolis 500|2009 race]] donned the moniker "93rd 500 Mile International Sweepstakes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indy500.com/news/13296/Dixon_Unveils_Ticket_For_93rd_Indianapolis_500_In_Indiana_Statehouse|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> It is the first time since 1980 that the "Sweepstakes" title has been used. During the month of May 2009, the ordinal (93rd) was used very sparingly, and for the first time since 1981, was not identified on the annual logo. Instead, in most instances in print, television, and radio, the race was referred to as the "2009 Indianapolis 500". Since the race was not held during the United States' participation in the two World Wars (1917–18, 1942–45), the advertised Centennial Era occurred during the 93rd to 95th runnings. To avoid confusion between the 100th anniversary, and the actual number of times the race has been run, references to the ordinal during the ''Centennial Era'' were curtailed. 

Five years later, in [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]], the race celebrated its 100th running with about 350,000 in attendance. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/05/25/what-you-need-know-before-you-head-indy-500/84900670/|title=Indy 500: What you need to know|publisher=IndyStar |accessdate=29  May 2016}}</ref>

===Female drivers===
{{main|List of female Indianapolis 500 drivers}}
[[File:Danica-r.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Danica Patrick]] on Pole Day at Indy, 2007]]

Female participation of any sort at Indianapolis was discouraged and essentially banned throughout the first several decades of competition. As such, female reporters were not even allowed in the pit area until 1971.<ref name="INDY10">{{cite web|publisher=Zimbio|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Dan+Wheldon/articles2/Women+in+Racing+Indy+500+Style|title=Women in Racing- Indy 500 Style!}}</ref> There have been nine female drivers to qualify, starting with [[Janet Guthrie]] in [[1977 Indianapolis 500|1977]].

[[Sarah Fisher]] has competed nine times, the most of any woman. [[Danica Patrick]] led 19 laps in the 2005 race and 10 laps in the 2011 race, the only times a woman has led laps during the race. Her third-place finish in 2009 is the best finish for a woman.

==Race sanctioning==

===AAA and USAC===
[[File:The Spoils.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Borg-Warner Trophy]], presented to the Indy 500 winners in victory lane, and kept the rest of the year on permanent display at the Hall of Fame Museum.]]

From 1911 to 1955, the race was organized under the auspices of the [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] [[AAA Contest Board|Contest Board]]. Following the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]], AAA dissolved the Contest Board to concentrate on its membership program aimed at the general motoring public. Speedway owner [[Tony Hulman]] founded [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] in 1956, which took over sanctioning of the race and the sport of [[American Championship Car Racing|Championship racing]].<ref name="INDY24">{{cite web

|title=USAC National Sprint Car Series
}}</ref>

From 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 also counted toward the [[FIA]]'s [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Championship of Drivers]] (now synonymous with [[Formula One]]), although few drivers participated in the other races of that series. Italian driver [[Alberto Ascari]] was the only European-based driver to actually race in the 500 during its World Championship years. His appearance in [[1952 Indianapolis 500|1952]] in a [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] was also the only time a Ferrari has ever appeared in the race. [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] practiced at the track in [[1958 Indianapolis 500|1958]], but declined an offer to race.

Control issues of monetary prizes and squabbles over technical regulations caused conflict in the 1970s. Soon after the death of Tony Hulman in 1977, and the loss of several key USAC officials in a 1978 [[plane crash]], several key team owners banded together and formed [[Champ Car|CART]] in late 1978<ref name="INDY25">{{cite web

}}</ref> to sanction the sport of [[American Championship Car Racing|Indy car racing]].

The Indianapolis 500 itself, however, remained under the sanctioning control of USAC. It became the lone top-level race the body still sanctioned, as it ultimately dropped all other Indy car races (as well as their [[USAC Stock Car|stock car division]]) to concentrate on [[Sprint car racing|sprints]] and [[Midget car racing|midgets]]. For the next three years, the race was not officially recognized on the CART calendar, but the CART teams and drivers comprised the field. By 1983, an agreement was made for the USAC-sanctioned Indy 500 to be recognized on the [[Champ Car|CART]] calendar, and the race awarded points towards the CART championship.

Despite the CART/USAC divide, from 1983 to 1995 the race was run in relative harmony. CART and USAC occasionally quarreled over relatively minor technical regulations, but utilized the same machines and the CART-based teams and driver comprised the bulk of the Indy 500 entries each year.

===IndyCar Series===

}}</ref> The Indy 500 would serve as its centerpiece. Opinions varied on his motivations, with his supporters sharing his disapproval of the race's lack of status within CART, the increasing number of foreign drivers (as American drivers were gravitating towards [[NASCAR]]), and the decreasing number of [[oval track racing|ovals]] in the season series. Detractors accused George of throwing his weight around and using the race as leverage to gain complete control of the sport of [[American Championship Car Racing|open wheel racing]] in the United States.

In 1995 and in response to a change in schedule by the CART series that put several races in direct conflict with Indy Racing League events, George announced that 25 of the 33 starting positions at the [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996 Indy 500]] would be reserved for the top 25 cars in IRL points standings (similar in practice to [[NASCAR rules and regulations#Qualifying procedure|NASCAR's Top 35 rule]] introduced years later). The move effectively left only eight starting positions open to the CART-regulars that chose not to participate in the IRL races. CART's reaction was to refuse to compromise on the schedule conflicts, skip the IRL races required to accumulate the qualifying points, [[boycott]] the race,<ref name="INDY27">{{cite news

CART would run at [[Gateway Motorsports Park|Gateway International Raceway]] a 300-mile race in ensuing years (1997–99) instead.

[[File:HCastronevesIndy.jpg|thumb|[[Helio Castroneves]], winner in 2001, 2002 and 2009]]

For 1997, new rules for less expensive cars and "production based" engines were put into place. The move made it such that the IRL utilized different and incompatible equipment; no CART-based teams would enter the Indy 500 for the next three years.

In 2000, [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Target Chip Ganassi Racing]], still a CART-mainstay, made the decision to cross lines and compete at Indianapolis with drivers [[Jimmy Vasser]] and [[Juan Pablo Montoya]].

==NASCAR and the 500==
In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Indy 500 and the [[Coca-Cola 600|World 600]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] were held on different days of the week. A handful of [[NASCAR]] regulars participated in both events in the same year, including [[Bobby Allison]], [[Donnie Allison]], [[Cale Yarborough]], and [[Lee Roy Yarbrough]]. From 1974–1992, the two events were scheduled for the same day and same starting time, making participation in both impossible. A few stock car drivers during that time, namely [[Neil Bonnett]] in 1979, nevertheless still attempted to qualify at Indy, even if that meant skipping Charlotte altogether.

==="Double Duty"===

From 1994 to 2004, several [[NASCAR]] drivers were able to compete in both the Indy 500 and the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] in the same day. Since 1993, the Coca-Cola 600 has been scheduled in the evening the same day as the Indy 500. The effort has been known as [[Double Duty (auto racing)|"Double Duty"]].
At the conclusion of the Indy 500, drivers would catch a helicopter directly from the Speedway to the [[Indianapolis International Airport]]. From there they would fly to [[Concord Regional Airport]], and ride a helicopter to the NASCAR race. [[John Andretti]], [[Tony Stewart]], and [[Robby Gordon]], attempted the feat, with Kurt Busch being the latest in 2014. In 2001, [[Tony Stewart]] became the first driver to complete the full race distance (1100 miles) in both races on the same day.<ref name="INDY30">{{cite web

}}</ref>

For 2005, the start of Indianapolis was pushed back to 1 p.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] to improve television ratings. This significantly closed the window for a driver to be able to race both events in the same day. (The race's original starting time had been set at 11 a.m. EST – 12 noon EDT – because in 1911, race promoters estimated it would take six hours to complete the event, and they did not want the race to finish too close to suppertime. Nowadays the race is routinely completed in under three and one-half hours.)

Two drivers, [[Mario Andretti]] and [[A. J. Foyt]], have won the Indianapolis 500 and the [[Daytona 500]]. Foyt also won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and [[12 Hours of Sebring]], America's premier endurance races, as well as the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], while Andretti won the {{f1|1978}} Formula One World Championship and is a three time Sebring winner (he also won the 6 Hour version of Daytona). Indianapolis 500 winner [[Johnny Rutherford]] once won one of the [[Gatorade Duel|Daytona 500 qualifying races]]. In 2010 [[Chip Ganassi]] became the first car owner to win the Daytona and Indianapolis 500s in the same year, with [[Jamie McMurray]] winning the Daytona 500 and [[Dario Franchitti]] winning the Indianapolis 500.

In 2010, [[Bruton Smith]] (owner of [[Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]]), offered $20,000,000 to any driver, IndyCar or NASCAR, who can win both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day starting in 2011 – a feat that has never been done before. For 2011, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved the start time of the Indy 500 back to 12:15 PM EDT (prior to 2005, the engines started at 10:52 AM EST;  under the modern schedule, engines start around 12:05 PM for a start around 12:15 PM), which re-opened the window for travel. [[Brad Keselowski]]  suggested that he would consider answering the challenge in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Autoweek|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130524/nascar01/130529855|title=Gunning for first NASCAR Sprint Cup win of the year in the Coca-Cola 600: Brad Keselowski's Autoweek blog}}</ref> It was announced on March 4, 2014 that [[Kurt Busch]] would attempt to qualify for the [[2014 Indianapolis 500]], driving a fifth car for the [[Andretti Autosport]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/03/04/kurt-busch-indianapolis-500-coca-cola-600-double/6008475/|title=Kurt Busch to attempt Indianapolis 500, Coke 600 'double'|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|date=March 4, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2014-03-04|location=McLean, VA}}</ref>  Busch completed all 500 miles at Indy to finish sixth, but dropped out of the 600 with a blown engine just past the 400-mile mark.

==Technical regulations==
[[File:PenskePC23.jpg|thumb|[[Penske PC-23]] [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[1994 Indianapolis 500]] winning car]]

Technical specifications for the Indianapolis 500 are currently written by [[IndyCar]]. Rules are generally the same as every other IndyCar race. In the past, particularly during the era in which USAC sanctioned the Indy 500 (but CART sanctioned the other Indy car races), rules at Indy slightly differed at times. The result, for example, would be a particular chassis or engine configuration being legal at Indy, but not so at the CART-sanctioned events. This was rather commonplace in the 1980s and early 1990s, when "stock-block" engines (namely the V-6 Buick) was allotted an increased level of turbocharger boost by USAC at Indy, compared to the purpose-built V-8 quad-cam engines. While the "stock block" engines were technically legal in CART competition, they were not given the increased boost advantage, which effectively rendered them uncompetitive, and precluded their use by teams. The most famous manifestation of the USAC rules disparity was the [[Ilmor]]-built [[Ilmor#Racing in the USA|Mercedes-Benz 500I]] engine fielded by [[Roger Penske]] in [[1994 Indianapolis 500|1994]].<ref name="INDY31">{{cite news|publisher=forix.autosport.com|url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/penske-mercedes-pc23.html|title=The Penske-Mercedes PC23-500I}}</ref>

Teams may enter up to two machines under a given car number – the "primary" car and a "backup" car. The backup car is identified by the letter "T". For example, the two cars for the #2 team would be numbered #2 and #2T. Both cars may be practiced during the month, but due to engine lease rules, they must share the same engine. It is not uncommon for teams to prefer their backup car, if it is deemed faster, or for other strategic reasons. Additionally, as the month wears on, a "T car" may be split off into its own entry, and reassigned a new number, or be sold to another team.

All cars must pass a rigorous technical inspection before receiving a sticker signifying that the car is eligible to practice. Various criteria includes minimum weight, dimensions, and approved parts, particularly safety equipment. Prior to and following qualification attempts, cars must pass another inspection. The pre-qualifying inspection is focused on safety aspects, and is done on the pit lane qualifying queue. It is relatively brief, due to the time constraints of the qualifying procedure. The post-qualifying inspection is much more stringent and lengthy, and takes place in the garage area. It is to detect deviations from the performance guidelines set forth by the league, and cars can and have been fined or outright disqualified if they fail inspection.

===Qualifying procedure===
{{Details|List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters}}
[[File:Dixon Pole 20080510.jpg|thumb|[[Scott Dixon]] makes his pole-winning qualification run for the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]].]]

Throughout the years, the race has used a number of different qualifying procedures. The current four-lap (ten-mile) qualifying distance was first introduced in 1920, and has been used every year since 1939.<ref name="Evolved">Mittman, Dick. [http://www.indy500.com/news/story.php?story_id=3569 Indianapolis 500 Qualifying Has Evolved Over The Years], Indy500.com, September 22, 2004</ref>

In 2014, the qualifying procedure was refined, such that the pole position winner, and the starting grid would be determined over two days. On the weekend before the race (Saturday and Sunday), all cars are entered into a blind draw for the qualifying order.

*Saturday: All entries can make up to three attempts to qualify. The top 33 cars at the end of the day are locked into the grid. The top nine cars will advance to a special "shootout" session to determine the pole position. Making a second (or third) attempt automatically forfeits the previous attempt.
*Sunday: The drivers that qualified 10-33 on Saturday have their original times erased, and go out to make a new run. This run determines the grid lineup for positions 10-33. The drivers who qualified 1-9 on Saturday advance to the "Shootout". Those cars also have their original time erased. Each car makes a new attempt, and determine the lineup for positions 1-9, including the highly coveted pole positions.

For each attempt, cars are allowed two warm-up laps. At that time, a member of the team is stationed at the north end of the mainstretch. He/she must wave a green flag, signaling an attempt, or else the car will be waved off. The attempt can be waved off during any of the four laps by the team, driver, or race officials. (The series will wave off the run if it is obvious the run will not be fast enough to qualify and it is getting late in the day.) If an attempt is waved off after the run starts, the attempt counts towards the three-attempt limit and the previous time is still forfeited, unless race officials waved off the attempt because of weather.

===Memorabilia===
Many people promote and share information about the Indianapolis 500 and its memorabilia collecting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ni500cc.com|title=National Indy 500 Collector Club|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> The National Indy 500 Collectors Club is an independent active organization that has been dedicated to support such activities.

The longest-running Indy racing memorabilia show is the National Auto Racing Memorabilia Show.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Entertainment===
{{main|Indianapolis 500 in film and media}}
The Indianapolis 500 has been the subject of several films, and has experienced countless references in television, movies, and other media.

''[[Indianapolis 500 Legends]]'', a [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS|DS]] game based on the race was released on December 18, 2007.<ref>[http://wii.gamezone.com/news/12_18_07_12_32PM.htm "Indianapolis 500 Legends" for Wii and Nintendo DS Now Racing to Store Shelves from Destineer], GameZone, December 18, 2007</ref>

===Milk===
[[Louis Meyer]] requested a glass of [[buttermilk]] after winning his second Indy 500 race in 1933. After winning his third title in 1936, he requested another glass but instead received a bottle. He was captured by a photographer in the act of swigging from the bottle while holding up three fingers to signify the third win.  A local dairy company executive recognized the marketing opportunity in the image and, being unaware Meyer was drinking buttermilk, offered a bottle of milk to the winners of future races.  Milk has been presented each year since then apart from 1947 to 1955. Modern drivers are offered a choice of whole, 2%, and skim.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/blog/from_the_marbles/post/Indy-mystery-Why-do-Indianapolis-500-winners-dr?urn=nascar,165450], Yahoo, May 22, 2009</ref>

At the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]], winner [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], who owned and operated an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview. He eventually relented and also drank from the milk bottle later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, but the public relations damage had been done.<ref>[http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/history/50951/] Profile of Emerson Fittipaldi at indianapolismotorspeedway.com, 12 June 2012</ref> The snub led to him being booed at the next ChampCar race in [[Milwaukee Mile|Milwaukee]], Wisconsin the heart of dairy country, and by some, as late as the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]] in which he drove the pace car. In 2016, as a promotion the track gave out commemorative bottles of milk to 100,000 of those in attendance  to toast the winner with milk after the race.<ref>{{cite web|author1=IMS|title=World's Largest Milk Toast Planned for 100th Running of the Indy 500|url=https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500/news-multimedia/news/2016/03/16/worlds-largets-milk-toast-planned-for-100th-indy-500-2016|publisher=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|accessdate=May 31, 2016|date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>

==Broadcasting==
Radio coverage of the race dates back to 1922. The race has been broadcast live on the radio in its entirety by the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]] since 1953.

The Hulmans were somewhat resistant to allow live television coverage of the 500, largely to maximize gate attendance. The race was briefly televised live in 1949 and 1950 on [[WRTV|WFBM-TV]], after which the practice was discontinued. From 1964 to 1970, the race was broadcast live on [[closed-circuit television]] in theaters around the country. From 1965 through 1970, a highlighted version of the race was shown on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC's]] ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''. From 1971 through 1985, an edited same-day, [[tape delay (broadcasting)|tape delay]] broadcast of the race was shown in prime time. The race broadcast was edited down to either two or three hours in duration (including commercials).

Since 1986, ABC has televised the race live in its entirety. However, at the request of the Speedway, Indianapolis affiliate [[WRTV]] is required to [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] the live broadcast and carry it on tape delay in prime time to encourage local race attendance. In [[2007 Indianapolis 500|2007]] (the first year in which the race was carried under the [[ESPN on ABC]] branding), the race was first aired in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].<ref name="INDY34">{{cite web|publisher=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|url=http://indy500ontv.com/|title=91st Indianapolis 500 To Be Televised On ABC In Sony HD Technology}}</ref>

In 2016, the IMS declared a sell-out of race tickets for the 100th running of the event, and announced at the same time that WRTV would be allowed to air the race live for the first time since 1950.<ref>http://www.theindychannel.com/sports/indycar/road-to-100/blackout-lifted-rtv6-to-show-indianapolis-500-live-on-race-day</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WRTV to air Indy 500 live|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/wrtv-to-air-indy-500-live-after-blackout-lifted/171126|website=TVSpy|accessdate=25 May 2016}}</ref>

Coverage of time trials on ABC dates back to 1961. ABC covered time trials in various live and in tape-delayed formats from 1961-2008 and from 2014-present. [[ESPN]] (and later along with [[ESPN 2]]) carried various portions of time trials from 1987-2008. Versus (now [[NBCSN]]) covered time trials from 2009-2013.

Practice sessions have been streamed live online dating back to at least 2001.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/news/article/BW-IndyCar-and-WhiteBlox-Cross-the-Finish-Line-1877121.php IndyCar and WhiteBlox Cross the Finish Line; Tens of Thousands of Viewers Surf to Live Online Indy 500 Video Coverage] – Houston Chronicle, 1 June 2006</ref>

In 2015, ABC celebrated its 50th anniversary of covering the Indianapolis 500.
