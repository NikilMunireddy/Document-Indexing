'''House music''' is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] that originated in [[Chicago]] in the early 1980s. It was initially popularized in Chicago, circa 1984. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark – all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia.<ref name=unesco_4>{{cite journal | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf | title=The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon | publisher=UNESCO | date=July–August 2000 | last=Fikentscher | first=Kai | journal=UNESCO Courier | page=47 | quote=Around 1986/7, after the initial explosion of house music in [[Chicago]], it became clear that the major recording companies and media institutions were reluctant to market this genre of music, associated with gay African Americans, on a mainstream level. House artists turned to Europe, chiefly London but also cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin,  Manchester, Milan, Zurich, and Tel Aviv.&nbsp;... A third axis leads to Japan where, since the late 1980s, New York club DJs have had the opportunity to play guest-spots.}}</ref> Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as "[[Pump Up the Volume (song)|Pump Up The Volume]]" by [[MARRS]] (1987), "House Nation" by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987), "[[Theme from S'Express]]" by [[S'Express]] (1988) and "[[Doctorin' the House]]" by [[Coldcut]] (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream [[Pop music|pop]] and [[dance music]] worldwide.

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive [[Four on the floor (music)|4/4]] beats, rhythms mainly provided by [[drum machine]]s,<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/house-ma0000002651 |title=House : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref> off-beat [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to [[disco]] music, it was more electronic and minimalistic,<ref name="allmusic"/> and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent [[kick drum]] on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric [[deep house]] to the more minimalistic [[microhouse]]. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres,<ref name="allmusic"/> such as [[Eurodance|euro house]], [[tech house]], [[electro house]] and [[Jump House (music genre)|jump house]].

In the late 1980s, many local Chicago house music artists suddenly found themselves presented with major label deals. House music proved to be a commercially successful genre and a more mainstream [[popular music|pop-based]] variation grew increasingly popular. Artists and groups such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]],<ref name="allmusic"/> [[Janet Jackson]],<ref>{{cite journal |date=2008-02-17 |title=Janet Jackson: janet. &#124; Music Review |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/janet-jackson-janet/1275 |journal=Slant Magazine |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> [[Paula Abdul]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bananarama]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Steps (band)|Steps]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Bjork]], and [[C+C Music Factory]]<ref name="allmusic"/>have all incorporated the genre into some of their work. After enjoying significant success in the early to mid-90s, house music grew even larger during the second wave of [[progressive house]] (1999–2001). The genre has remained popular and fused into other popular subgenres, for example, [[G-house (music)|G-house]], [[Deep House|deep house]], [[tech house (music)|tech house]] and [[bass house (music)|bass house]]. As of 2016, house music remains extremely popular in both clubs and in the mainstream pop scene while retaining a foothold on underground scenes across the globe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Influences and precursors==
Various [[disco]] songs incorporated sounds produced with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s, and some compositions were entirely electronic; examples include [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s late 1970s productions such as [[Donna Summer]]'s hit single "[[I Feel Love]]" from 1977, [[Cerrone]]'s "[[Supernature (Cerrone III)|Supernature]]" (1977),<ref>{{cite web |title=Cerrone Bio |url=http://www.beatport.com/artist/cerrone/42443 |website=Beatport |accessdate=2012-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604234035/http://www.beatport.com/artist/cerrone/42443 |archivedate=2012-06-04}}</ref> [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s synth-disco-pop productions from ''[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'' (1978), ''[[Solid State Survivor]]'' (1979),<ref name="allmusic_ymo_album">{{Allmusic|album|r632985|Yellow Magic Orchestra}}</ref><ref>{{Allmusic|album|r181170|Solid State Survivor}}</ref> and several early 1980s disco-pop productions by the [[Hi-NRG]] group [[Lime (band)|Lime]].

Soul and disco influenced house music, plus mixing and editing techniques earlier explored by disco, [[garage music (North America)|garage music]] and [[post-disco]] [[DJ]]s, producers, and audio engineers such as [[Walter Gibbons]], [[Tom Moulton]], [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Larry Levan]], Ron Hardy, [[Morales and Munzibai|M & M]], and others who produced longer, more repetitive, and percussive arrangements of existing disco recordings. Early house producers such as [[Frankie Knuckles]] created similar compositions from scratch, using [[sampling (music)|samplers]], synthesizers, [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s, and drum machines.

The electronic instrumentation and minimal arrangement of [[Charanjit Singh (musician)|Charanjit Singh]]'s ''[[Charanjit Singh (musician)#Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat|Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat]]'' (1982), an album of Indian [[raga]]s performed in a disco style, anticipated the sounds of [[acid house]] music, but it is not known to have had any influence on the genre prior to the album's rediscovery in the 21st century.<ref name="guardian_2010">{{cite news |last=Pattison |first=Louis |date=2010-04-10 |title=Charanjit Singh, acid house pioneer |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/apr/10/charanjit-singh-acid-house |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref name="guardian_2011">{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Aitken |date=2011-05-10 |title=Charanjit Singh on how he invented acid house&nbsp;... by mistake |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/10/charanjit-singh-acid-house-ten-ragas |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref name="ra_raga">{{cite web|title=Charanjit Singh – Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat|publisher=[[Resident Advisor]]|author=William Rauscher|date=2010-05-12|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=7445|accessdate=2011-06-03}}</ref>

Rachel Cain, co-founder of an influential [[Trax Records]], was previously involved in the burgeoning [[punk rock|punk]] scene and cites [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[post-punk]] record store [[Wax Trax! Records]] as an important connection between the ever-changing underground sounds of [[Chicago]]. As most proto-house DJs were primarily stuck to playing their conventional ensemble of dance records, Frankie Knuckles and [[Ron Hardy]], two influential pioneers of house music, were known for their out-of-bounds behavior. The former, credited as "the Godfather of House," worked primarily with early disco music with a hint of new and different music (whether it was post-punk or post-disco)<ref>RBMA (2011).

Starting in 1984, some of these DJs, inspired by Jesse Saunders' success with "On and On", tried their hand at producing and releasing original compositions. These compositions used newly affordable electronic instruments to emulate not just Saunders' song, but the edited, enhanced styles of disco and other dance music they already favored. These homegrown productions were played on Chicago-area radio and in local [[discothèque]]s catering mainly to [[African-American]] and [[gay]] audiences.<ref name="brittanica">{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/273088/house | title=house | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | accessdate = 2012-06-05 }}</ref><ref name="unesco_1">{{cite journal | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf | title=Youth's sonic forces: The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | date=July–August 2000 | last=Fikentscher | first=Kai | journal=[[UNESCO Courier]] | page=28 | quote=House music, in particular, is often held up as a kind of banner of cultural diversity owing to its origins in black and Latino discos, where it ﬁrst found its audience.

Deep house's origins can be traced to Chicago producer [[Larry Heard|Mr Fingers]]'s relatively jazzy, soulful recordings "Mystery of Love" (1985) and "[[Can You Feel It?

Acid house arose from Chicago artists' experiments with the squelchy Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, and the style's origins on vinyl is generally cited as [[Phuture]]'s "[[Acid Tracks]]" (1987). Phuture, a group founded by Nathan "[[DJ Pierre]]" Jones, Earl "Spanky" Smith Jr., and Herbert "Herb J" Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in the house music context.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shapiro |first =Peter |title =Modulations: A History of Electronic Music |publisher =Caipirinha Productions Inc. |date=2000 |page =32 | isbn= 0-8195-6498-2 }}</ref> The group's 12-minute "Acid Tracks" was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably.<ref name=cheeseman>Cheeseman, Phil. "[http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_house.html The History Of House]".</ref> The track also utilized a [[Roland TR-707]] drum machine.

Club play from pioneering Chicago DJs such as Hardy and [[Lil Louis]], local dance music record shops such as Importes, State Street Records, Loop Records, Gramaphone Records and the popular [[Hot Mix 5]] shows on radio station WBMX-FM helped popularize house music in Chicago. Later, visiting DJs & producers from Detroit fell into the genre. [[Trax Records]] and [[DJ International Records]], Chicago labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music inside and outside of Chicago. One 1986 house tune called "Move Your Body" by [[Marshall Jefferson]], taken from the appropriately titled "The House Music Anthem" EP, became a big hit in Chicago and eventually worldwide. By 1986, UK labels were releasing house music by Chicago acts, and by 1987 house tracks by Chicago DJs and producers were appearing on and topping the UK music chart. By this time, house music released by Chicago-based labels was considered a must-play in clubs.

===Origins of the term===
The term "house music" is said to have originated from a Chicago club called ''[[Warehouse (nightclub)|The Warehouse]]'', which existed from 1977 to 1983.<ref name="Snoman">Snoman, Rick (2009).

Patrons later asked for new music for the bins, which Chip E. implies was a demand the shop tried to meet by stocking newer local club hits.<ref>{{cite av media |people=Chip E.

In a 1986 interview, Rocky Jones, the former club DJ who ran the D.J. International record label, doesn't mention Importes Etc., Frankie Knuckles, or the Warehouse by name, but agrees that "house" was a regional catch-all term for dance music, and that it was once synonymous with older disco music.<ref name=Billboard_19860621_2>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA27 | title=House Music: Will It Join Rap And Go-Go? | date=1986-06-21 | accessdate=2011-04-14 | last=George | first=Nelson | journal=Billboard | volume=99 | issue=25 | page=27 | quote=The term 'house music' has become a generic phrase for modern dance-oriented music," says Jones.

[[Larry Heard]], a.k.a. "Mr. Fingers", claims that the term "house" became popular due to many of the early DJs creating music in their own homes using synthesizers and drum machines such as the [[Roland TR-808]], [[Roland TR-909|TR-909]], and the [[Roland TB-303|TB 303]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} These synthesizers were used to create a house subgenre called [[acid house]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Cowen | coauthors= | title= Sounds Amazing!; Music Live Andrew Cowen previews the giant show at the NEC which offers great new ideas for musicians of all styles and all levels. | date=1999-10-30 | publisher= | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60489757.html | newspaper = The Birmingham Post (UK) | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref>

[[Juan Atkins]], an originator of Detroit [[techno]] music, claims the term "house" reflected the exclusive association of particular tracks with particular clubs and DJs; those records helped differentiate the clubs and DJs, and thus were considered to be their "house" records.<ref name=atkins>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.mobeus.org/archives/juanatkins/|title=Future Shock (Juan Atkins Interview)|publisher=Music Technology Magazine|last=Trask|first=Simon|date=December 1988|accessdate=2008-04-05|quote="The word 'house' comes from a record that you only hear in a certain club.

"But you couldn't really be guaranteed an exclusive on an import, 'cos even if there were only 10 or 15 copies in the country, another DJ would track one down. So the DJs came up with the concept of making their own house records.

House also had an influence of relaying political messages to people who were considered to be outcasts of society. The music appealed to those who didn't fit into mainstream American society and was especially celebrated by many black males. Frankie Knuckles once said that the Warehouse club in Chicago was like "church for people who have fallen from grace" The house producer Marshall Jefferson compared it to "old-time religion in the way that people just get happy and screamin'".<ref name="Reynolds2013">{{cite book|author=Simon Reynolds|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAvy3S242wQC&pg=PA30|date=2013-06-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78317-3|pages=30–}}</ref> Deep house was similar to many of the messages of freedom for the black community.

==Regional scenes (1980s–1990s)==

===Detroit sound: 1986–1989===
{{main|Detroit techno|Techno}}
Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music. It was developed starting in the late 80s, one of the earliest hits being "[[Big Fun (song)|Big Fun]]" by [[Inner City (band)|Inner City]]. Detroit techno developed as the legendary disc jockey [[The Electrifying Mojo]] conducted his own radio program at this time, influencing the fusion of eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese [[synthpop]] ([[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]), early [[B-boy]] [[hip-hop music|Hip-Hop]] ([[Man Parrish]], Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by [[Juan Atkins]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], and [[Kevin Saunderson]], the "godfathers" of Detroit Techno.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Derrick May a.k.a. "MAYDAY" and Thomas Barnett released "Nude Photo" in 1987 on May's label "Transmat Records", which helped kickstart the Detroit techno music scene and was put in heavy rotation on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in many Chicago clubs.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} A year later, Transmat released what was to become one of techno and house music's classic anthems – the seminal track "Strings of Life". Transmat Records went on to have many more successful releases{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} such as 1988's "Wiggin". As well, Derrick May had successful{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} releases on [[Network Records|Kool Kat Records]] and many remixes for a host of underground and mainstream recording artist.

Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno. These tracks were well received in Chicago and played on Chicago radio and in clubs.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Blake Baxter's 1986 recording, "When we Used to Play / Work your Body", 1987's "Bounce Your Body to the Box" and "Force Field", "The Sound / How to Play our Music" and "the Groove that Won't Stop" and a remix of "Grooving Without a Doubt". In 1988, as house music became more popular among general audiences, Kevin Saunderson's group Inner City with Paris Gray released the 1988 hits "Big Fun" and "[[Good Life (Inner City song)|Good Life]]", which eventually were picked up by Virgin Records. Each EP / 12&nbsp;inch single sported remixes by [[Mike "Hitman" Wilson]] and Steve "Silk" Hurley of Chicago and Derrick "Mayday" May and Juan Atkins of Detroit. In 1989, KMS had another hit release of "Rock to the Beat" which was a theme in Chicago dance clubs.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===UK: 1986–early 1990s===
{{see also|Second Summer of Love|Rave|Rave music}}

With house music already massive on the '80s dance-scene it was only a matter of time before it would penetrate the UK pop charts.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The record generally credited as the first house hit in the UK was Farley "Jackmaster" Funk's "Love Can't Turn Around" which reached #10 in the UK singles chart in September 1986.

In January 1987, Chicago artist Steve "Silk" Hurley's "[[Jack Your Body]]" reached number one in the UK, showing it was possible for house music to cross over. The same month also saw [[Raze (house music group)|Raze]] enter the top 20 with "Jack the Groove", and several further house hits reached the top ten that year. [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]'s productions for [[Mel and Kim]], including the number-one hit "Respectable", added elements of house to their previous [[Europop]] sound, and session group [[Mirage (medley group)|Mirage]] scored top-ten hits with "Jack Mix II" and "Jack Mix IV", medleys of previous [[Electro music|electro]] and Europop hits rearranged in a house style. Key labels in the rise of house music in the UK included:
* Jack Trax, which specialised in licensing US club-hits for the British market (and released an influential series of [[compilation album]]s)
* [[Rhythm King]], which was set up as a [[hip hop]] label but also issued house records
* [[Jive Records]]' Club Records imprint
The tour in March 1987{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} of Knuckles, Jefferson, Fingers Inc. (Heard) and Adonis as the DJ International Tour boosted house in the UK. Following the number-one success of [[MARRS]]' "[[Pump Up the Volume (song)|Pump Up The Volume]]" in October, the years 1987 to 1989 also saw UK acts such as The Beatmasters, [[Krush]], [[Coldcut]], [[Yazz]], [[Bomb The Bass]], [[S-Express]], and Italy's [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]] opening the doors to a house music onslaught on the UK charts. Early British house music quickly set itself apart from the original Chicago house sound;{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} many of the early hits were based on [[sampling (music)|sample]] montage, [[rap]] was often used for vocals (far more than in the US),{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} and [[humor]] was frequently an important element.

One of the early anthemic tunes, "Promised Land" by Joe Smooth, was covered and charted within a week by [[the Style Council]]. Europeans embraced house, and began booking legendary American house DJs to play at the big clubs, such as [[Ministry of Sound]], whose resident, [[Justin Berkmann]] brought in [[Larry Levan]].

The house scene in cities such as [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], [[Sheffield]] and London were also provided with many underground [[Pirate Radio]] stations and DJs alike which helped bolster an already contagious, but otherwise ignored by the mainstream, music genre. The earliest and influential UK house and techno record labels such as [[Warp Records]] and [[Network Records]] (otherwise known as Kool Kat records) helped introduce American and later Italian dance music to Britain as well as promoting select UK dance music acts.

But house was also being developed on [[Ibiza]],{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} although no house artists or labels were coming from this tiny island at the time. By the mid-1980s a distinct [[Balearic Beat|Balearic]] mix of house was discernible.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Several clubs such as  Amnesia with DJ Alfredo were playing a mix of rock, pop, disco and house. These clubs, fueled by their distinctive sound and [[ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]], began to have an influence on the British scene. By late 1987, DJs such as [[Trevor Fung]], [[Paul Oakenfold]] and [[Danny Rampling]] were bringing the Ibiza sound to UK clubs such as [[the Haçienda]] in Manchester, and in London clubs such as Shoom in Southwark, [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]], Future and Spectrum.

In the U.S., the music was being developed to create a more sophisticated sound,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} moving beyond just drum loops and short samples. In Chicago, Marshall Jefferson had formed the house group [[Ten City]] [[Byron Burke]], [[Byron Stingily]] & Herb Lawson(from "intensity"). New York–based performers such as [[Mateo & Matos]] and [[Blaze (band)|Blaze]] had slickly produced disco house tracks.  In [[Detroit]] a proto-[[techno music]] sound began to emerge with the recordings of Juan Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson.

Atkins, a former member of [[Cybotron (American band)|Cybotron]], released Model 500 "No UFOs" in 1985, which became a regional hit, followed by dozens of tracks on Transmat, Metroplex and Fragile. One of the most unusual was "Strings of Life" by Derrick May, a darker, more intellectual strain of house. "Techno-Scratch" was released by the [[Knights Of The Turntable]] in 1984 which had a similar techno sound to Cybotron. The manager of the [[The Factory (music venue)|Factory nightclub]] and co-owner of the Haçienda, [[Tony Wilson]], also promoted acid house culture on his weekly TV show. The Midlands also embraced the late 1980s house scene with illegal parties and more legal dance clubs such as The Hummingbird.

===US: late 1980s–early 1990s===
[[File:Paradise garage.jpg|thumb|right|Building in New York City where the [[Paradise Garage]] nightclub was located]]
Back in America the scene had still not progressed beyond a small number of clubs in Chicago, Detroit, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[New York City]]. However, many independent Chicago-based record labels were making appearances on the Dance Chart with their releases. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a must play at many clubs playing house music. [[Paradise Garage]] in New York City was still a top club. The emergence of [[Todd Terry]], a pioneer of the genre, was important in America. His cover of Class Action's Larry Levan mixed "Weekend" demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco to a new house sound with hip-hop influences evident in the quicker sampling and the more rugged bass-line.

In the late 1980s, [[Nu Groove Records]] prolonged, if not launched the careers of [[Rheji Burrell]] & [[Rhano Burrell]], collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via [[Timmy Regisford]] and [[Frank Mendez]]), along with basically every relevant DJ and Producer in the NY underground scene. The Burrell's are responsible for the "New York Underground" sound and are the undisputed champions of this style of house. Their 30+ releases on this label alone seems to support that fact. In today's market Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult-like following and mint vinyl can fetch $100 U.S. or more in the open market.

By the late 80s, House had moved West, particularly to San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego and Seattle. Los Angeles saw a huge explosion of underground raves and DJs, notably DJs Marques Wyatt and Billy Long, who spun at [[Jewel's Catch One]], the oldest dance club in America. In 1989, the L.A. based, former [[EBN-OZN]] singer/rapper [[Robert Ozn]] started indie house label One Voice Records, releasing the Mike "Hitman" Wilson remix of [[Dada Nada]]'s "Haunted House," which garnered instant club and mix show radio play in Chicago, Detroit and New York as well as in the U.K. and France. The record shot up to Number Five on the Billboard Club Chart, marking it as the first House record by a white artist to chart in the U.S.  Dada Nada, the moniker for Ozn's solo act, released in 1990, what has become a classic example of jazz-based Deep House, the [[Frankie Knuckles]] and [[David Morales]] remix of Dada Nada's "Deep Love" (One Voice Records/US, Polydor/UK), featuring Ozn's lush, crooning vocals and muted trumpet improvisational solos, underscoring Deep House's progression into a genre that integrated jazz and pop songwriting structures – a feature which continued to set it apart from Acid House and Techno.

The early 1990s additionally saw the rise in mainstream US popularity for house music. Pop recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1990 single "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" became an international hit single and topped the US charts.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/house-relation-to-soul-t2156 |title=Rockin' Robin – Bobby Day : Listen, Appearances, Song Review Secret (Some Bizarre Single Mix)Remix – Bizarre Inc released the house single 1994 |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> The single is credited as helping to bring house music to the US mainstream.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Influential [[gospel music|gospel]]/[[R&B]]-influenced Aly-us released "Time Passes On" in 1993 ([[Strictly Rhythm]]), then later, "Follow Me" which received radio airplay as well as being played in clubs.  Another U.S. hit which received radio play was the single "Time for the Perculator" by [[Cajmere]], which became the prototype of [[ghetto house]] subgenre.  Cajmere started the Cajual and Relief labels (amongst others). By the early 1990s artists such as Cajmere himself (under that name as well as [[Green Velvet]] and as producer for [[Dajae]]), [[DJ Sneak]], Glenn Underground and others did many recordings. The 1990s saw new Chicago house artists emerge such as [[DJ Funk]], who operates a Chicago house record label called [[Dance Mania (record label)|Dance Mania]]. Ghetto house and [[acid house]] were other house music styles that were also started in Chicago.

In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and [[rave]] clubs such as Lakota and [[Cream (nightclub)|Cream]] emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with [[ambient house]] albums such as [[The KLF]]'s ''[[Chill Out]]'' and ''[[Analogue Bubblebath Vol I|Analogue Bubblebath]]'' by [[Aphex Twin]]. The [[Godskitchen]] superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in [[Cambridge]] and [[Northampton]], the associated events scaled up in [[Milton Keynes]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Leeds]]. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as [[Deee-Lite]] furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were [[the Orb]]'s "[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]" (with a distinctive vocal sample from [[Rickie Lee Jones]]) and the [[Happy Mondays]]' "Wrote for Luck" ("WFL") which was transformed into a dance hit by [[Vince Clarke]].

In England, one of the few licensed venues [[The Eclipse (venue)|The Eclipse]] attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with "repetitive beats". There were a number of abortive "Kill the Bill" demonstrations. The [[Spiral Tribe]] at Castle Morten was probably the nail in the coffin for illegal raves, and forced through the bill, which became law, in November 1994. The music continued to grow and change, as typified by [[Leftfield]] with "[[Release the Pressure]]", which introduced dub and [[reggae]] into the house sound, although Leftfield had prior releases, such as "Not Forgotten" released in 1990 on Sheffield's Outer Rhythm records.

A new generation of clubs such as [[Liverpool]]'s [[Cream (nightclub)|Cream]]  and the [[Ministry of Sound]] were opened to provide a venue for more commercial sounds. Major record companies began to open "[[superclub]]s" promoting their own acts. These superclubs entered into sponsorship deals initially with fast food, soft drinks, and clothing companies. Flyers in clubs in [[Ibiza]] often sported many corporate logos. A new subgenre, Chicago hard house, was developed by DJs such as [[Bad Boy Bill]], [[DJ Lynnwood]], [[DJ Irene]], [[Richard "Humpty" Vission]] and [[DJ Enrie]], mixing elements of Chicago house, funky house and hard house together. Additionally, Producers such as George Centeno, Darren Ramirez, and Martin O. Cairo would develop the Los Angeles Hard House sound. Similar to [[gabber]] or [[hardcore techno]] from the Netherlands, this sound was often associated with the "rebel" culture of the time. These 3 producers are often considered "ahead of their time" since many of the sounds they engineered during the late 20th century became more prominent during the 21st century.

Towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, producers such as [[Daft Punk]], [[Stardust (band)|Stardust]], [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]], [[St. Germain (musician)|St. Germain]] and [[DJ Falcon]] began producing a new sound out of Paris's house scene. Together, they laid the groundwork for what would be known as the [[French house]] movement. By combining the harder-edged-yet-soulful philosophy of Chicago house with the melodies of obscure funk, state-of-the-art production techniques and the sound of analog synthesizers, they began to create the standards that would shape all house music.

Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] proclaimed August 10, 2005 to be "House Unity Day" in Chicago, in celebration of the "21st anniversary of house music" (actually the 21st anniversary of the founding of [[Trax Records]], an independent Chicago-based house label). The proclamation recognized Chicago as the original home of house music and that the music's original creators "were inspired by the love of their city, with the dream that someday their music would spread a message of peace and unity throughout the world". DJs such as [[Frankie Knuckles]], [[Marshall Jefferson]], [[Paul Johnson (DJ)|Paul Johnson]] and [[Mickey Oliver]] celebrated the proclamation at the Summer Dance Series, an event organized by Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs.<ref>{{cite journal |date=2005-08-03 |title=Chicago Mayor Declares 'House Unity Day' |url=http://remixmag.com/transmissions/chicago-house-080405/ |journal=Remix |publisher=Penton Media, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917031408/http://remixmag.com/transmissions/chicago-house-080405/ |archivedate=2009-09-17}}</ref>

It was during this decade that vocal house became firmly established, both in the underground and as part of the pop market, and labels such as [[Defected Records]], Roule and Om were at the forefront of championing the emerging sound. In the mid-2000s, fusion genres such as [[electro house]] and [[fidget house]] emerged.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This fusion is apparent in the crossover of musical styles by artists such as [[Dennis Ferrer]] and [[Booka Shade]], with the former's production style having evolved from the New York soulful house scene and the latter's roots in [[techno]].

Numerous live performance events dedicated to house music were founded during the course of the decade, including [[Shambhala Music Festival]] and major industry sponsored events like Miami's [[Winter Music Conference]]. The genre even gained popularity in the [[Middle East]] in cities such as [[Dubai]] & [[Abu Dhabi]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and at events like [[Creamfields]].

In the late 2000s, house witnessed renewed chart success thanks to acts such as [[Daft Punk]], [[Deadmau5]], [[Fedde Le Grand]], [[David Guetta]], [[Calvin Harris]].

[[File:Swedish House Mafia and Benny Benassi.jpg|thumb|[[Swedish House Mafia]] performing in 2011.]]

2010s saw multiple new sounds in house music developed by numerous DJs. Sweden knew a prominence of snare-less "Swedish [[progressive house]]" with the emergence of [[Sebastian Ingrosso]], [[Axwell]], [[Steve Angello]] (These three formed a trio called [[Swedish House Mafia]]), [[Avicii]], [[Alesso]], etc. Netherlands brought together a concept of "Dirty Dutch", [[electro house]] subgenre characterized by very abrasive leads and darker arpeggios, with prominent DJs [[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]], [[Hardwell]], [[Laidback Luke]], [[Afrojack]], [[R3hab]], [[Bingo Players]], [[Quintino]], [[Alvaro (DJ)|Alvaro]], [[Cedric Gervais]], 2G, etc. Elsewhere, fusion genres derivative of 2000s progressive house returned to prominence, especially with the help of DJs [[Calvin Harris]], [[Eric Prydz]], [[Mat Zo]], [[Above & Beyond (band)|Above & Beyond]] and [[Fonzerelli]] in Europe, [[Deadmau5]], [[Kaskade]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Porter Robinson]] and [[Wolfgang Gartner]] in the US and Canada. The growing popularity of such artists led to the emergence of electro house and progressive house blended sounds in popular music, such as singles [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Marry the Night]]", [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' "[[The Best One Yet (The Boy)]]" and the [[will.i.am]] and [[Britney Spears]] "[[Scream & Shout]]". Big room house found increasing popularity since 2010, particularly through international dance music festivals such as [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland]], [[Ultra Music Festival]], and [[Electric Daisy Carnival]].

In addition to these popular examples of house, there has also been a reunification of contemporary house and its roots. Many hip hop and R&B artists also turn to house music to add a mass appeal to the music they produce.

[[Deep House]] surged onto the UK Top 40 in 2014 with artists such as [[Duke Dumont]], [[Secondcity]] and [[Robin Schulz]].
