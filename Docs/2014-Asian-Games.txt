Two cities bid for the Games. Both New Delhi (India) and Incheon (South Korea) submitted their formal bid on December 2, 2006 in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite news|title=India makes formal bid for 2014 Asiad|url=http://news.oneindia.in/in-focus/asian-games/doha-2006/0212india-bid-for-2014games.html|accessdate=2010-07-04|newspaper=oneindia|date=2006-02-12}}</ref>

The vote was held on April 17, 2007 at the [[Marriott International|Marriott Hotel]] in [[Kuwait City]], [[Kuwait]], during the OCA's general assembly. During the final presentation prior to voting, Incheon made a new offer, raising [[United States dollar|USD$]]20 million funds to support the countries that are yet to win a medal in the Games. It also offered free flight tickets and accommodation to all the participants, while India did not make any changes to its offer.<ref name=win>{{cite news|title=Money could decide 2014 Asian Games bid|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report_money-could-decide-2014-asian-games-bid_1091337|accessdate=2010-07-04|newspaper=DNA India|date=2007-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=S Korea's Incheon wins bid to host 2014 Asian Games|url=http://www.cctv.com/program/sportsscene/20070418/101018.shtml|accessdate=2010-07-04|newspaper=CCTV International|date=2007-04-18}}</ref> All 45 members voted, with voting held in secret ballot.

It was widely felt that Delhi's lack of enthusiasm to host the event was the primary reason for its loss. Then Union Sports Minister of India, [[Mani Shankar Aiyar]], spoke strongly against Delhi hosting the games and argued that it was better if the money allocated by India's government for organizing the sporting event was spent on building facilities for the poor.<ref>{{cite news|title=India vs. China as a Global Sporting Events Host|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/sep2008/gb20080919_727533.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_global+business|accessdate=2010-07-04|newspaper=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|date=2008-09-19}}</ref> The [[Indian Olympic Association]] (IOA) president revealed that India's Sports Minister remarks against hosting the Games was the main reason for New Delhi's loss.<ref>{{cite news|title=Delhi loses bid to host 2014 Asian Games|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?466021|accessdate=2010-07-04|newspaper=Outlook India|date=2007-04-17}}</ref> The IOA delegation also added that the bids evaluation committee was concerned about pollution and traffic in Delhi.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pollution, traffic could have cost Delhi the Asian Games|url=http://www.zeenews.com/news366535.html|accessdate=2010-04-07|newspaper=Zee News|date=2007-04-18}}</ref> Delhi offering US$200,000 to each team for games support against Incheon's offer of US$20 million to all 45 nations participating in the event could also have contributed to the defeat.<ref name=win/>

===Slogan===
Unveiled on September 16, 2010, "''Diversity Shines Here''" is the official English slogan of the Games. It represents and highlights the significance of Asia’s wonderful diversity in history, cultures, and religions.<ref>{{cite news|title=2014 Incheon Asian Games announces official slogan|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Society/view?articleId=83440|accessdate=2010-10-24|newspaper=Korea.net|date=2010-10-14}}</ref> The official slogan in Korean: "평화의 숨결, 아시아의 미래" (Hepburn: pyeonghwaui sumgyeol, asiaui milae) literally means "Breath of Peace, Future of Asia".

The changes in the non-Olympic sports featured at the Asian Games were influenced by discussions with organizers, who had suggested the removal of cricket from the program because they felt too few countries played it and because they lacked the infrastructure to host it. However, the OCA disputed the proposed removal of cricket, citing its popularity and viewer interest.<ref>{{cite news|last=K Samyal|first=Sanjjeev|title=India may face a gold drought at Incheon Asian Games 2014|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report_india-may-face-a-gold-drought-at-incheon-asian-games-2014_1467839|accessdate=2010-11-25|newspaper=Daily News & Analysis|date=2010-11-17}}</ref>

In addition, the OCA and [[FIBA]] failed to compromise on a couple of policies, causing one team to boycott the event and forcing three teams to find replacement players. The Qatari women's basketball team withdrew from the Games when FIBA reaffirmed its ban on [[hijab]], citing safety concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games: Qatar women's team pull out over hijab ban|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/basketball/29342986|accessdate=25 September 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 September 2014}}</ref> Basketball became the only sport to enforce a hijab ban in the Games. On the other hand, OCA policy on naturalized players contradicted the eligibility rules set by FIBA. The OCA disqualified [[United States|US]]-born players [[Quincy Davis (basketball)|Quincy Davis]], [[Andray Blatche]], and Aaron Haynes from the Chinese Taipei, Filipino, and South Korean teams.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Badua|first1=Shelley|title=US-born player no longer eligible for Asian Games|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/09/05/2003599061|accessdate=7 September 2014|publisher=Taipei Times|date=5 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Flojo|first1=Enzo|title=Previewing the Asian Games basketball qualifiers|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/69601-previewing-the-asian-games-basketball?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rappler+(Rappler)|accessdate=20 September 2014|publisher=Rappler|date=19 September 2014}}</ref>

During the Games there were several controversies, mostly revolving around poor officiating. The vast majority of poor judging allegations occurred in boxing, highlighted by the controversial semifinal loss of Indian lightweight boxer [[Laishram Sarita Devi]] against eventual silver medalist Park Jina of South Korea.<ref>{{cite news|author=PTI|title=Mary Kom in final, Sarita Devi robbed of win at Asian Games|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-09-30/news/54475143_1_asian-games-l-sarita-devi-incheon|accessdate=1 October 2014|publisher=The Economic Times|date=30 September 2014}}</ref> The judging of the match, Sarita Devi's refusal to accept the bronze medal, and her questionable behavior at the medal ceremony received widespread international attention and sparked numerous debates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games: Some in Indian team not happy with Sarita Devi's emotional outburst|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tournaments/asian-games-2014/india-at-incheon/Asian-Games-Some-in-Indian-team-not-happy-with-Sarita-Devis-emotional-outburst/articleshow/44017525.cms|accessdate=1 October 2014|agency=PTI|publisher=The Times of India|date=1 October 2014}}</ref> The high volume of controversial boxing decisions led to accusations against the judges for widespread incompetence and host favoritism. Criticisms of the new scoring system have also been brought up.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games: Boxer Vikas Krishnan slams new scoring system|url=http://zeenews.india.com/sports/2014-asian-games/india/asian-games-boxer-vikas-krishnan-slams-new-scoring-system_1477633.html|accessdate=4 October 2014|publisher=Zee News|date=29 September 2014}}</ref> Shooting,<ref>{{cite news|title=Judoka Jeong defends Asiad title|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/sports/2014/09/207_165023.html|accessdate=23 September 2014|publisher=The Korea Times|date=22 September 2014}}</ref> and wrestling saw initial rulings by officials being overturned following appeals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games: Controversy taints home team victories|url=http://www.koreatimesus.com/asian-games-controversy-taints-home-team-victories/|accessdate=3 October 2014|publisher=The Korea Times|date=1 October 2014}}</ref>

Some 1,920 samples from 1,600 athletes were tested during the Games. Six athletes tested positive for banned substances and were sent home from the Games, including two gold medalists that were stripped of their medals.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rutherford|first1=Peter|last2=Chakraborty|first2=Amlan|title=Games-China's hammer champion Zhang tests positive|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-2779263/Games-Chinese-hammer-gold-medallist-Zhang-tests-positive.html|accessdate=3 October 2014|agency=Reuters|publisher=Mail Online|date=3 October 2014}}</ref>
