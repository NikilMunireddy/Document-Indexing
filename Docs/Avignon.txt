'''Avignon''' ({{IPA-fr|a.vi.ɲɔ̃}}; {{lang-la|Avenio}}; {{lang-prv|Avignoun}}, {{lang-oc|Avinhon}} {{IPA-oc|aviˈɲun|pron}}),  is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in south-eastern [[France]] in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Vaucluse]] on the left bank of the [[Rhône]] river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city ({{As of|2011|lc=y}}), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.

Between 1309 and 1377 during the [[Avignon Papacy]], seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 [[Pope Clement VI]] bought the town from [[Joanna I of Naples]]. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the [[French Revolution]], it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.

The historic centre, which includes the [[Palais des Papes]], [[Avignon Cathedral|the cathedral]], and the [[Pont Saint-Bénézet|Pont d'Avignon]], became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual [[Festival d'Avignon]] have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.

The commune has been awarded one flower by the ''National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom'' in the ''Competition of cities and villages in Bloom''.<ref>[http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_villes_et_village_fleuris-47.html Avignon in the Competition for Towns and Villages in Bloom] {{Fr icon}}</ref>

==Toponymy==
The earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks:{{sfn|Rostaing|1994|p=30}}

*Аὐενιὼν = ''Auenion'' (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11)
*Άουεννίων = ''Aouennion'' (Ptolemy II, x).

The Roman name ''Avennĭo Cavarum'' (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. "Avignon of Cavares" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of ''Cavares'', along with ''Cavaillon'' and ''Orange''.

The current name dates to a pre-Indo-European{{sfn|Rostaing|1994|p=30}} or pre-Latin{{sfn|Dauzat|Rostaing|1963|p=1689}} theme ''ab-ên'' with the suffix ''-i-ōn(e)''{{sfn|Rostaing|1994|p=30}}{{sfn|Dauzat|Rostaing|1963|p=1689}} This theme would be a [[hydronym]] - i.e. a name linked to the river (Rhône), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the ''Rocher des Doms'').

The ''Auenion'' of the 1st century BC was Latinized to ''Avennĭo'' (or ''Avēnĭo''), ''-ōnis'' in the 1st century and was written ''Avinhon'' in classic [[Occitan]] spelling<ref>Robert Bourret, ''French-Occitan Dictionary'', Éd. Lacour, Nîmes, 1999, p. 59. {{Fr icon}}</ref> or ''Avignoun'' [aviɲũ] in Mistralian spelling{{sfn|Xavier de Fourvière|Rupert|1902|p=[https://archive.org/stream/loupichottresord00xaviuoft#page/n88/mode/1up 62]}} The inhabitants of the commune are called ''avinhonencs'' or ''avignounen'' in both Occitan and [[Provençal dialect]].

==History==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Stèle Rocher des Doms.jpg|thumb|A small anthropomorphic stele discovered during an archaeological excavation on the Rocher des Doms]]

The site of Avignon has been occupied since the Neolithic period as shown by excavations at ''Rocher des Doms'' and the ''Balance'' district.<ref name="culture">[http://www.vpah.culture.fr/vpah/paca/avignon-si.htm ''Tell me about Avignon''], Towens and Country of Art and history, Ministry of Culture, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

In 1960 and 1961 excavations in the northern part of the ''Rocher des Doms'' directed by Sylvain Gagnière uncovered a small anthropomorphic stele (height: 20&nbsp;cm), which was found in an area of land being reworked.{{sfn|Gagnière|Granier|1976}} Carved in [[Burdigalian]] sandstone, it has the shape of a "tombstone" with its face engraved with a highly stylized human figure with no mouth and whose eyes are marked by small cavities. On the bottom, shifted slightly to the right is a deep indentation with eight radiating lines forming a [[solar representation]] - a unique discovery for this type of stele.

Compared to other similar solar figures{{efn|Identical solar representations exist existent in rocks and cave sites along the Provençal coast at Mont-Bego, in the [[Iberia]]n peninsula, and in the [[Moroccan Sahara]].}} this stele representing the "first Avignonnais" and comes from the time period between the [[Copper Age]] and the [[Early Bronze Age]] which is called the ''southern Chalcolithic''.{{efn|In Provence, these anthropomorphic stèles (at Lauris, Orgon, Senas, Trets, Goult, Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, and Avignon), date from 3000BC to 2800BC and were from the "civilisation of [[Lagoza]]". They were witnesses to an agriculture that became predominant in the lower valleys of the [[Rhône]] and the [[Durance]].}}

This was confirmed by other findings made in this excavation near the large water reservoir on top of the rock where two polished greenstone axes were discovered, a lithic industry characteristic of "shepherds of the plateaux". There were also some Chalcolithic objects for adornment and an abundance of [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] pottery shards which could have been native or imported ([[Ionia]]n or [[Phocaea]]n).

===Antiquity===
[[File:Steletriumfiliarum.jpg|thumb|left|Greek stele from Avignon, at the Lapidary Museum.]]
[[File:Ruines Romaines.JPG|thumb|left|Roman remains from the 1st century, behind the ''[[Palais des papes]]'']]

The name of the city dates back to around the 6th century BC. The first citation of Avignon (''Aouen(n)ion'') was made by [[Artemidorus of Ephesus]]. Although his book, ''The Journey'', is lost it is known from the abstract by [[Marcian of Heraclea]] and ''The Ethnics'', a dictionary of names of cities by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] based on that book. He said: "The City of Massalia (Marseille), near the Rhone, the ethnic name (name from the inhabitants) is Avenionsios (Avenionensis) according to the local name (in Latin) and Auenionitès according to the Greek expression".<ref>Étienne de Byzance, ''The Ethnics in summary'', Aug. Meineke, Berlin, 1849 {{Fr icon}}</ref> This name has two interpretations: "city of violent wind" or, more likely, "lord of the river".{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}{{Contradiction-inline|reason=Contradicts toponymy section.|date=November 2015}} Other sources trace its origin to the [[Gaulish language|Gallic]] ''mignon'' ("marshes") and the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] definitive article.<ref name="typonimie">[http://www.mairie-avignon.fr/fr/culture/histoire/nom.php History of the origin of the name], Avignon official website, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>{{Contradiction-inline|reason=Contradicts topoymy section.|date=November 2015}}

[[File:Vestiges romains du Forum d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|Remains of the [[Roman forum]] of Avignon, currently the ''Place de l'Horloge'']]

Avignon was a simple Greek [[Emporium (antiquity)|Emporium]] founded by [[Phocaea]]ns from Marseille around 539 BC. It was in the 4th  century BC that the [[Massaliotes]] (people from Marseilles) began to sign treaties of alliance with some cities in the Rhone valley including Avignon and Cavaillon. A century later Avignon was part of the "region of Massaliotes"{{efn|An expression used by the ''Pseudo-Aristotle'' in ''Marvellous Stories''}} or "country of Massalia".{{efn|The name used by Dionysius of Périocète in ''Description of the inhabited world''.}}

Fortified on its rock, the city later became and long remained the capital of the [[Cavares]].<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Naturalis Historia'' and [[Pomponius Mela]] in his ''Of Choregraphia'' depicted Avignon as the capital of Cavares.</ref> With the arrival of the Roman legions in 120 BC. the Cavares, allies with the Massaliotes, became Roman. Under the domination of the [[Roman Empire]], ''Aouenion'' became ''Avennio'' and was now part of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] (118 BC.), the first Transalpine province of the [[Roman Empire]]. Very little from this period remains (a few fragments of the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] near Rue Molière). It later became part of the ''2nd Viennoise''. Avignon remained a "federated city" with Marseille until the conquest of Marseille by [[Trebonius]] and [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], Caesar's lieutenants. It became a city of [[Roman law]] in 49 BC.<ref name="horizon-provence">[http://www.horizon-provence.com/histoire-avignon/03_avignon-gallo-romaine.htm ''The Origins of Avignon''], horizon-provence website, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref> It acquired the status of [[Roman colony]] in 43 BC. [[Pomponius Mela]] placed it among the most flourishing cities of the province.<ref>Pomponius Mela, ''Description of the World'', Book II, V.</ref>

Over the years 121 and 122 the [[Emperor Hadrian]] stayed in the [[Roman province|Province]] where he visited [[Vaison-la-Romaine|Vaison]], [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]], [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]], and Avignon. He gave Avignon the status of a Roman colony: "Colonia Julia Hadriana Avenniensis" and its citizens were enrolled in the ''tribu''.<ref>[[:fr:Tribu (Rome antique)|French article on the Tribu]] {{Fr icon}}</ref>

Following the passage of [[Maximian]], who was fighting the [[Bagaudes]], the Gallic peasants revolted. The first wooden bridge was built over the Rhone linking Avignon to the right bank. It has been dated by [[dendrochronology]] to the year 290. In the 3rd century there was a small Christian community outside the walls around what was to become the Abbey of Saint-Ruf.

===Early Middle Ages===
[[File:Carte avignon intramuros.png|thumb|The historical town centre bounded by its ramparts]]
Although the date of the Christianization of the city is not known with certainty, it is known that the first evangelizers and prelates were within the [[hagiographic]] tradition which is attested by the participation of ''Nectarius'', the first historical [[Bishop of Avignon]]{{efn|He is sometimes listed as Julius.}} on 29 November 439, in the regional council in the [[Ancient Diocese of Riez|Cathedral of Riez]] assisted by the 13 bishops of the three provinces of [[Kingdom of Arles|Arles]].

The memory of [[St. Eucherius]] still clings to three vast caves near the village of Beaumont whither, it is said, the people of [[Lyon]] had to go in search of him in 434 when they sought him to make him their [[archbishop]].

In November 441 Nectarius of Avignon, accompanied by his deacon Fontidius, participated in the Council of Orange convened and chaired by [[Hilary of Arles]] where the Council Fathers defined the right of asylum. In the following year, together with his assistants Fonteius and Saturninus, he was at the first [[Council of Vaison]] with 17 bishops representing the Seven Provinces. He died in 455.{{efn|Nectarius, first historical Bishop of Avignon, went to Rome during his episcopate to arbitrate differences between [[Hilary of Arles]] and [[Pope Leo I]].}}

[[File:CLOVISRoydeFrance.JPG|thumb|[[Clovis I|Clovis]], King of the [[Franks]], laid siege to Avignon in 500.]]

Invasions began and during the inroads of the [[Goths#Within the Roman Empire|Goths]] it was badly damaged. In 472 Avignon was sacked by the [[Burgundians]] and replenished by the Patiens, from the city of [[Lyon]], who sent them Wheat.{{efn|This aid is mentioned in the canons of the Council of the Seven Provinces in Béziers which was held in 472 under the presidency of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], Bishop of Clermont. The prelate of Lyon also revitalised [[Arles]], [[Riez]], [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]], [[Ancient Diocese of Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux|Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux]], [[Alba]], and [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] - cities starving from the pillage of the Burgundians.}}

In 500 [[Clovis I]], King of the [[Franks]], attacked [[Gundobad]], King of the [[Burgundians]] who was accused of the murder of the father of his wife [[Clotilde]]. Beaten, Gondebaud left Lyon and took refuge in Avignon with Clovis besieging it. [[Gregory of Tours]] reported that the Frankish king devastated the fields, cut down the vines and olive trees, and destroyed the orchards. The Burgundian was saved by the intervention of the Roman General Aredius. He had called him to his aid against the "Frankish barbarians" who ruined the countryside.

In 536 Avignon, following the fate of Provence, was ceded to the [[Merovingians]] by [[Vitiges]], the new king of the [[Ostrogoths]]. [[Chlothar I]] annexed Avignon, Orange, Carpentras, and Gap; [[Childebert I]] took Arles and Marseilles; [[Theudebert I]] took [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]], Apt, [[Digne]], and [[Ancient Diocese of Glandèves|Glandevès]]. The Emperor [[Justinian I]] at [[Constantinople]] approved the division.

Despite all the invasions, intellectual life continued to flourish on the banks of the Rhône.{{efn|Historians have given the name ''austraso-provençal'' to the literary circle.}} [[Gregory of Tours]] noted that after the death of Bishop Antoninus in 561 the Parisian Father Dommole refused the bishopric of Avignon after [[Chlothar I]] convinced him that it would be ridiculous "in the middle of tired senators, sophists, and philosophical judges"

[[Saint Magnus of Avignon|St. Magnus]] was a [[Gallo-Roman]] [[senator]] who became a [[monk]] and then bishop of the city. His son, [[St. Agricol]] (Agricolus), bishop between 650 and 700, is the [[patron saint]] of Avignon.

The 7th and 8th centuries were the darkest period in the history of Avignon. The city became the prey of the [[Franks]] under [[Thierry II]] (Theodoric), King of [[Austrasia]] in 612. The Council of [[Chalon-sur-Saône]] in 650 was the last to indicate the Episcopal participation of the Provence dioceses. In Avignon there would be no bishop for 205 years with the last known holder being [[Agricola of Avignon|Agricola]].{{efn|Riez did not have a bishop for 229 years, Vence for 218 years, Saint-Paul-les-Trois-Châteaux and Orange for 189 years (the two dioceses having been united), and both Carpentras and Digne for 138 years.}}

In 736 it fell into the hands of the [[Saracens]] and was destroyed in 737 by the [[Franks]] under [[Charles Martel]] for having sided with the Saracens against him.

A centralized government was put in place and, in 879, the bishop of Avignon, Ratfred, with other Provençal colleagues{{sfn|Février|1989|p=485}}{{efn|Of the 23 Provençal seats, only 11 bishops were present.{{sfn|Février|1989|p=485}}}} went to the [[Synod of Mantaille]] in Viennois where [[Boso of Provence|Boso]] was elected King of Provence after the death of [[Louis the Stammerer]].{{efn|Boson was apparently was a [[Carolingian]] through Ermangarde, sister of [[Charles le Chauve]].}}

The [[Rhône]] could again be crossed since in 890 part of the ancient bridge of Avignon was restored at the pier No. 14 near Villeneuve. In that same year [[Louis the Blind|Louis]], the son of Boson, succeeded his father. His election took place in the Synod of Varennes near [[Ancient Diocese of Mâcon|Macon]]. Thibert, who was his most effective supporter became Count of Apt. In 896 Thibert acted as plenipotentiary of the king at Avignon, Arles, and Marseille with the title of "Governor-General of all the counties of Arles and Provence". Two years later, at his request, King Louis donated [[Bédarrides]] to the priest Rigmond d'Avignon.

On 19 October 907 King [[Louis the Blind]] became emperor{{efn|Louis the Blind, son of Boson I, was King of Provence from 890 to 928. He became King of Italy in 900 then was crowned Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in February 901 in Rome by Pope [[Benedict IV]]. His rival, the Italian ''Béranger de Frioul'' made him put out his eyes in 905 for perjury.}} and restored an island in the Rhone to Remigius, Bishop of Avignon. This Charter is the first mention of a cathedral dedicated to Mary.{{efn|''Ecclesia suae in honore Sancte Marie Dei genitris dicatae'' noted the [[cartulary]] of Notre-Dame of Doms.}}

After the capture and the execution of his cousin, Louis III, who had been exiled to Italy in 905, [[Hugh of Arles]] became regent and personal advisor to King Louis. He exercised most of the powers of the king of Provence{{sfn|Baratier|1969|p=106}} and in 911, when Louis III gave him the titles of Duke of Provence and Marquis of the Viennois,{{sfn|Baratier|1969|p=106}}<ref>Mc Kitterick, 267.</ref> he left [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] and moved to [[Kingdom of Arles|Arles]] which was the original seat of his family and which now was the new capital of Provence.

On 2 May 916 Louis the Blind restored the churches of Saint-Ruf and Saint-Géniès to the [[diocese of Avignon]]. On the same day Bishop Fulcherius attested in favour of his canons and for the two churches of Notre-Dame and Saint-Étienne to form a cathedral.{{efn|These were noted in the Cartulary of Notre-Dame of Doms: ''genetrici ejus regine celorum et terre interemate Marie virgini protomartyri etiam beatissimo Stephano''. On 18 August 918 Louis the Blind, in a diploma of new restitution in favour of Fulcherius, mentioned the cathedral complex of Avignon with two churches and a baptistry: "Matris ecclesie Sancte Marie et Sancti Stephami ac Sancti Johannis Baptiste".}}

A political event of importance took place in 932 with the reunion of the kingdom of Provence with Upper Burgundy. This union formed the Kingdom of Arles in which Avignon was one of the largest cities.

At the end of the 9th century, Muslim Spain installed a military base in [[Fraxinet]]{{efn|Fraxinetum has been identified as Garde-Freinet.}} since they had led the plundering expeditions in the Alps throughout the 10th century.

During the night of 21 to 22 July 972 the Muslims took dom Mayeul,{{efn|Maïeul was the younger son of Foucher de Valensole, one of the richest lords in Provincia, and Raymonde, daughter of Count Maïeul I of Narbonne, who were married at Avignon.}} the Abbot of Cluny who was returning from Rome, prisoner. They asked for one [[French livre|livre]] for each of them which came to 1,000 livres, a huge sum, which was paid to them quickly. Maïeul was released in mid-August and returned to [[Cluny]] in September.

[[File:Map of kingdom of Arles.jpg|thumb|Map of the Kingdom of Arles, which was attached to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1003.]]

In September 973 [[William I of Provence]] and his brother [[Rotbold II, Count of Provence|Rotbold]], sons of the Count of Avignon, Boso II, mobilized all the nobles of Provence on behalf of dom Maïeul.  With the help of Ardouin, Marquis of [[Turin]], and after two weeks of siege, Provençal troops chased the [[Saracens]] from their hideouts in Fraxinet and [[Ramatuelle]] as well as those at Peirimpi near Noyers in the Jabron valley. William and Roubaud earned their title of Counts of Provence. William had his seat at Avignon and Roubaud at Arles.

In 976 while Bermond, brother-in-law of Eyric{{efn|Eyric was the eldest son of Foucher de Valensole and of Raymonde de Narbonne and it was his son ''Humbert de Caseneuve'' that the noble house of Agoult-Simiane came.}} was appointed Viscount of Avignon by King [[Conrad the Peaceful]] on 1 April, the Cartulary of Notre-Dame des Doms in Avignon says that Bishop Landry restored rights that had been unjustly appropriated to the canons of Saint-Étienne. He gave them a mill and two houses he built for them on the site of the current Trouillas Tower at the papal palace. In 980 these canons were constituted in a canonical chapter by Bishop Garnier.

In 994 Dom Maïeul arrived in Avignon where his friend William the Liberator was dying. He assisted in his last moments on the island facing the city (the Île de la Barthelasse) on the Rhone. The Count had as successor the son he had by his second wife Alix. He would reign jointly with his uncle Rotbold under the name [[William II of Provence|William II]]. In the face of County and episcopal power, the town of Avignon organized itself. Towards the year 1000 there was already a proconsul Béranger with his wife Gilberte who are known to have founded an abbey at "Castrum Caneto".{{efn|''Castrum Caneto'' corresponds to Cannet-des-Maures.}}

In 1032 when [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] inherited the [[Kingdom of Arles]], Avignon was attached to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Rhone was now a border that could only be crossed on the old bridge at Avignon. Some Avignon people still use the term "Empire Land" to describe the Avignon side, and "Kingdom Land" to designate the Villeneuve side to the west which was in the possession of the King of France.

===Late Middle Ages===
[[File:Louis VIII le Lion (Jean-Fouquet).jpg|thumb|The Siege of Avignon in 1226 (on the left), the death of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]] the Lion and crowning of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (on the right).]]

After the division of the empire of [[Charlemagne]], Avignon came within the Kingdom of Arles or Kingdom of the Two Burgundies, and was owned jointly by the [[Count of Provence]] and the [[Count of Toulouse]]. From 1060, the [[County of Forcalquier|Count of Forcalquier]] also had nominal overlordship, until these rights were resigned to the local Bishops and Consuls in 1135.

With the German rulers at a distance, Avignon set up an autonomous administration with the creation of a [[consulat]] in 1129, two years before its neighbour Arles.

In 1209 the [[Council of Avignon]] ordered a second excommunication for [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]].<ref name="cathares">[http://www.cathares.org/chronologie.html Chronology of the cathars] {{Fr icon}}</ref>

At the end of the twelfth century, Avignon declared itself an independent republic, and sided with [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]] during the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. In 1225, the citizens refused to open the gates of Avignon to King [[Louis VIII of France]] and the papal legate. They  besieged the city for three months (10 June-9 September).<ref name="cathares" /> Avignon was captured and forced to pull down its ramparts and fill up its moat.

At the end of September, a few days after the surrender of the city to the troops of King Louis VIII, Avignon experienced flooding.

In 1249 the city again declared itself a republic on the death of Raymond VII, his heirs being on a [[crusade]].

On 7 May 1251, however, the city was forced to submit to two younger brothers of King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers|Alphonse of Poitiers]] and Charles of Anjou ([[Charles I of Naples]]). They were heirs through the female line of the Marquis and [[Count of Provence]], and thus co-lords of the city. After the death of Alphonse in 1271, [[Philip III of France]] inherited his share of Avignon and passed it to his son [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] in 1285. It passed in turn in 1290 to [[Charles II of Naples]], who thereafter remained the sole lord of the entire city.

The [[University of Avignon]] was founded by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in 1303 and was famed as a seat of legal studies, flourishing until the [[French Revolution]].

===Avignon papacy===
{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}
[[File:Morières Limite État d'Avignon.jpg|left|thumb|Milestone delineating the limit of the Papal State and the [[Comtat Venaissin]]]]
[[File:Palais XV° 0001.jpg|thumb|[[Palais des papes]] and the city of Avignon, by the [[Boucicaut Master]] at the beginning of the 15th century.]]

In 1309 the city, still part of the [[Kingdom of Arles]], was chosen by [[Pope Clement V]] as his residence at the time of the [[Council of Vienne]] and, from 9 March 1309 until 13 January 1377, Avignon rather than Rome was the seat of the Papacy. At the time the city and its surroundings (the [[Comtat Venaissin]]) were ruled by the kings of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]]. The French King [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who had inherited from his father all the rights of Alphonse de Poitiers (the last [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]]), made them over to Charles II, [[List of monarchs of Naples|King of Naples]] and Count of Provence (1290). Nonetheless, Philip was a shrewd ruler. Inasmuch as the eastern banks of the Rhone marked the edge of his kingdom, when the river flooded up into the city of Avignon, Philip taxed the city since during periods of flood, the city technically lay within his domain.

Avignon became the Pontifical residence under Pope [[Clement V]] in 1309.{{sfn|Favier|2006|p=70}} His successor, [[John XXII]], a former bishop of the diocese, made it the capital of Christianity and transformed his former episcopal palace into the primary Palace of the Popes.{{sfn|Favier|2006|p=123}} It was [[Benedict XII]] who built the ''[[Palais des papes|Old Palace]]''{{sfn|Favier|2006|p=131}} and his successor [[Clement VI]] the ''[[Palais des papes|New Palace]]''.{{sfn|Favier|2006|p=138}} He bought the town on 9 June 1348 from [[Joanna I of Naples]], the Queen of Naples and Countess of Provence for 80,000 florins. [[Innocent VI]] endowed the ramparts.{{sfn|Favier|2006|p=145}}

Under their rule, the Court seethed and attracted many merchants, painters, sculptors and musicians. Their palace, the most remarkable building in the [[International Gothic]] style was the result, in its construction and ornamentation, of the joint work of the best French architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean du Louvres (called Loubières){{sfn|Renouard|2004|pp=99-105}} and the larger [[fresco]]es from the School of [[Siena]]: [[Simone Martini]] and [[Matteo Giovanetti]].{{sfn|Renouard|2004|p=100}}

The papal library in Avignon was the largest in Europe in the 14th century with 2,000 volumes{{sfn|Renouard|2004|p=101}} Around the library were a group of passionate clerics of letters who were pupils of [[Petrarch]], the founder of [[Humanism]].{{sfn|Guillemain|1998|p=112}} At the same time the Clementine Chapel, called the ''Grande Chapelle'', attracted composers, singers, and musicians<ref>Raymond Dugrand and Robert Ferras, ''The Great Encyclopedia'', Larousse, Paris, 1972, Vol. III, p. 1355, ISBN 2-03-000903-2 {{Fr icon}}</ref> including [[Philippe de Vitry]], inventor of the [[Ars Nova]], and [[Johannes Ciconia]].{{sfn|Guillemain|1998|p=112}}

As [[Bishop of Cavaillon]], Cardinal [[Philippe de Cabassoles]], Lord of Vaucluse, was the great protector of the Renaissance poet [[Petrarch]].

[[Urban V]] took the first decision to return to Rome, to the delight of [[Petrarch]], but the chaotic situation there with different conflicts prevented him from staying there. He died shortly after his return to Avignon.{{sfn|Favier|2006|pp=150-153}}

His successor, [[Gregory XI]], also decided to return to Rome and this ended the first period of the Avignon Papacy. When Gregory XI brought the seat of the papacy to Rome in 1377, the city of Avignon was administered by a legate.{{sfn|Favier|2006|pp=150-153}}

The early death of Gregory XI, however, caused the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]. [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] reigned again in Avignon{{sfn|Renouard|2004|p=59}} Overall therefore it was nine popes who succeeded in the papal palace and enriched themselves during their pontificate.{{sfn|Renouard|2004|pp=99-105}}

From then on until the [[French Revolution]], Avignon and the Comtat were papal possessions:{{sfn|Stephens|1897|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/revolutionaryeu02stepgoog#page/n96/mode/2up 76-77]}} first under the schismatic popes of the Great Schism, then under the popes of Rome ruling via legates until 1542, and then by vice-legates. The [[Black Death]] appeared at Avignon in 1348 killing almost two-thirds of the city's population.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Cohn | first=Samuel K Jr | year=2008 | title=Epidemiology of the Black Death and Successive Waves of Plague | journal=Medical history.

In all seven popes and two anti-popes resided in Avignon:
*[[Pope Clement V|Clement V]]: 1305–1314 (curia moved to Avignon March 9, 1309)
*[[Pope John XXII|John XXII]]: 1316–1334
*[[Pope Benedict XII|Benedict XII]]: 1334–1342
*[[Pope Clement VI|Clement VI]]: 1342–1352
*[[Pope Innocent VI|Innocent VI]]: 1352–1362
*[[Pope Urban V|Urban V]]: 1362–1370 (in Rome 1367-1370; returned to Avignon 1370)
*[[Pope Gregory XI|Gregory XI]]: 1370–1378 (left Avignon to return to Rome on September 13, 1376)

;Anti-Popes
*[[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1378-1394)
*[[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1394-1403)

The walls that were built by the popes in the years immediately following the acquisition of Avignon as papal territory are well preserved. As they were not particularly strong fortifications, the Popes relied instead on the immensely strong fortifications of their palace, the "[[Palais des Papes]]". This immense [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building, with walls 17–18 feet thick, was built 1335–1364 on a natural spur of rock, rendering it all but impregnable to attack. After its capture following the [[French Revolution]], it was used as a barracks and prison for many years but it is now a museum.

Avignon, which at the beginning of the 14th century was a town of no great importance, underwent extensive development during the time the seven Avignon popes and two anti-popes, Clement V to Benedict XIII, resided there. To the north and south of the rock of the Doms, partly on the site of the Bishop's Palace that had been enlarged by [[John XXII]], was built the Palace of the Popes in the form of an imposing fortress consisting of towers linked to each other and named as follows: La Campane, Trouillas, La Glacière, Saint-Jean, Saints-Anges (Benedict XII), La Gâche, La Garde-Robe (Clement VI), Saint-Laurent (Innocent VI). The Palace of the Popes belongs, by virtue of its severe architecture, to the [[Gothic art]] of the South of France. Other noble examples can be seen in the churches of Saint-Didier, Saint-Pierre, and Saint Agricol as well as in the Clock Tower and in the fortifications built between 1349 and 1368 for a distance of some three miles (5&nbsp;km) flanked by thirty-nine towers, all of which were erected or restored by the Roman Catholic Church.

{{Main|Avignon Exchange}}
The popes were followed to Avignon by agents (or [[factor (agent)|factors]]) of the great Italian banking-houses who settled in the city as money-changers and as intermediaries between the [[Apostolic Camera]] and its debtors. They lived in the most prosperous quarter of the city which was known as ''the Exchange''. A crowd of traders of all kinds brought to market the produce necessary for maintaining the numerous courts and for the visitors who flocked to it: grain and wine from Provence, the south of France, [[Roussillon]], and the country around Lyon. Fish was brought from places as distant as [[Brittany]]; rich cloth and tapestries came from [[Bruges]] and [[Tournai]]. The account-books of the Apostolic Camera, which are still kept in the Vatican archives, give an idea of the trade of which Avignon became the centre. The university founded by [[Boniface VIII]] in 1303 had many students under the French popes. They were drawn there by the generosity of the sovereign pontiffs who rewarded them with books or [[benefice]]s.

===Early modern period===

After the restoration of the [[Papacy]] in Rome the spiritual and temporal government of Avignon was entrusted to a gubernatorial Legate, notably the [[Cardinal-nephew]], who was replaced in his absence by a vice-legate (contrary to the legate he was usually a commoner and not a cardinal). Pope [[Innocent XII]] abolished [[nepotism]] and the office of Legate in Avignon on 7 February 1693, handing over its temporal government in 1692 to the Congregation of Avignon (i.e. a department of the [[papal Curia]] which resided in Rome), with the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] as presiding prefect, who exercised their jurisdiction through the vice-legate. This congregation, to which appeals were made from the decisions of the vice-legate, was linked to the [[Congregation of Loreto]] within the Roman Curia. In 1774 the vice-legate was made president thus depriving him of almost all authority. The office was done away with under [[Pius VI]] on 12 June 1790.

The Public Council, composed of forty-eight councillors chosen by the people, four members of the clergy, and four doctors from the university, met under the presidency of the chief magistrate of the city: the ''viquier'' (Occitan) or representative of the papal Legate or Vice-legate who annually nominated a man for the post. The councillors' duty was to watch over the material and financial interests of the city but their resolutions had to be submitted to the vice-legate for approval before being put in force. Three consuls, chosen annually by the Council, had charge of the administration of the streets.

Avignon's survival as a papal enclave was, however, somewhat precarious, as the French crown maintained a large standing garrison at [[Villeneuve-lès-Avignon]] just across the river.

On the death of the [[Archbishop of Arles]], [[Philippe de Lévis]] in 1475, Pope [[Sixtus IV]] in Rome reduced the size of the [[diocese of Arles]]: he detached the [[diocese of Avignon]] in the province of Arles and raised it to the rank of an [[archbishopric]] in favour of his nephew [[Giuliano della Rovere]], who later became Pope Julius II. The [[Archdiocese]] of Avignon had canonic jurisdiction over the department of [[Vaucluse]] and was an archdiocese under the bishoprics of Comtadins Carpentras, Cavaillon, and Vaison-la-Romaine.<ref name="catholique">[http://diocese-avignon.fr/spip/Note-historique-sur-l-archidiocese ''Catholic Church in Avignon - Historical Notice''], Diocese of Avignon, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

From the fifteenth century onward it became the policy of the [[List of French monarchs|Kings of France]] to rule Avignon as part of their kingdom. In 1476 [[Louis XI]], upset that Charles of Bourbon was made [[Papal legate|legate]], sent troops to occupy the city until his demands that [[Giuliano della Rovere]] be made legate. Once [[Giuliano della Rovere]] was made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] he withdrew his troops from the city.

In the 15th century Avignon suffered a major flood of the Rhone. King [[Louis XI]] repaired a bridge in October 1479 by [[letters patent]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=j3kUAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA502 Letters patent of Louis XI], Plessis-du-Parc-lèz-Tours, 10 October 1479 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

In 1536 king [[Francis I of France]] invaded the papal territory, in order to overthrow [[Emperor Charles V]], who was emperor of the territory. When he entered the city the people received him very well, and in return for the reception the people were all granted to them the same privileges that French subjects enjoyed, such as being able to hold state offices.

In 1562 the city was besieged by the [[François de Beaumont, baron des Adrets]], who wanted to avenge the massacre of Orange.{{sfn|Miquel|1980|p=233}}

[[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] passed through the city during his [[Charles IX's grand tour of France|royal tour of France]] (1564-1566) together with his court and nobles of the kingdom: his brother the [[Duke of Anjou]], [[Henry of Navarre]], the [[Charles de Bourbon (cardinal)|cardinals of Bourbon]] and [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Lorraine]]{{sfn|Miquel|1980|p=254}} The court stayed for three weeks.

In 1583 King [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] attempted to offer an exchange of the [[Marquisate of Saluzzo]] for Avignon, however his offer was refused by [[Pope Gregory XIII]].

In 1618 [[Cardinal Richelieu]] was exiled in Avignon.<ref>[http://www.agrippadaubigne.org/chronologie.htm Chronology of the years around Agrippa of Aubigné], agrippadaubigne website, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

The city was visited by [[Vincent de Paul]] in 1607 and also by [[Francis de Sales]] in 1622.<ref name="catholique" />

In 1663 in retaliation for the attack led by the [[Corsican Guard]] on the attendants of the [[Duc de Créqui]], the ambassador of [[Louis XIV]] in Rome, the King of France attacked and seized Avignon, which at the time was considered an important and integral part of the French Kingdom by the provincial Parliament of Provence.

In 1688 yet another attempt was made to occupy Avignon, however the attempt failed, and from 1688 to 1768 Avignon was at peace with no occupations or wars during that time.

At the beginning of the 18th century the streets of Avignon were narrow and winding but buildings changed and houses gradually replaced the old buildings. Around the city there were mulberry plantations, orchards, and grasslands.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XhMPAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA206&dq=Avignon&lr=&as_brr=1#PRA1-PA236,M1 Description of Avignon, 1829] {{Fr icon}}</ref>

On 2 January 1733 François Morénas founded a newspaper, the [[Courrier d'Avignon]], whose name changed over time and through prohibitions. As it was published in the papal enclave outside the kingdom of France and Monaco, the newspaper escaped the control system of the press in France (privilege with permission) while undergoing control from papal authorities. The ''Courrier d'Avignon'' appeared from 1733 to 1793 with two interruptions: one between July 1768 and August 1769 due to the annexation of Avignon to France and the other between 30 November 1790 and 24 May 1791.<ref name="Eugène Hatin">Eugène Hatin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-EOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Eug%C3%A8ne+Hatin,+%27%27Bibliographie+historique+et+critique+de+la+presse+p%C3%A9riodique+fran%C3%A7aise&hl=fr&ei=UhScTtbAL-_44QSOkJCZBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Historical Bibliography and critique of the French periodical press''], Firmin Didot Frères, Paris, 1866, p. 306, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

King [[Louis XV]] occupied the [[Comtat Venaissin]] from 1768 to 1774 and substituted French institutions for those in force with the approval of the people of Avignon; a French party grew up.

===From the French Revolution to the end of the 19th century===

Main article: [[Massacres of La Glacière]] and [[Guillaume Brune]].

On 12 September 1791 the [[National Constituent Assembly]] voted for the annexation of Avignon and the reunion of [[Comtat Venaissin]] with the kingdom of France following a referendum submitted to the inhabitants of the Comtat.

On the night of 16 to 17 October 1791, after the lynching by a mob of the secretary-clerk of the commune who was wrongly suspected of wanting to seize church property, the event called the [[Massacres of La Glacière]] took place, when 60 people were summarily executed and thrown into the dungeon of the tower on the [[Palais des Papes]].

On 7 July 1793 federalist insurgents under General Rousselet entered Avignon.{{sfn|Ceccarelli|1989|p=60}} During their passage along the Durance to retake the city by troops from Marseilles one person was killed: [[Joseph Agricol Viala]].{{sfn|Fantin-Desodoards|1807|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dJsFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA77 77]}} On 25 July General [[Jean François Carteaux|Carteaux]] appeared before the city and it was abandoned the next day by the troops of General Rousselet{{sfn|Fantin-Desodoards|1807|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dJsFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA64 64]}} as a result of a misinterpretation of orders from Marseille.{{sfn|Fantin-Desodoards|1807|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dJsFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA79 79]}}

On 25 June 1793 Avignon and Comtat-Venaissin were integrated along with the former [[principality of Orange]] to form the present departement of Vaucluse with Avignon as its capital. This was confirmed on 19 February 1797 by the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] in which Article 5 definitively sanctioned the annexation stating that:

"The Pope renounces, purely and simply, all the rights to which he might lay claim over the city and territory of Avignon, and the Comtat Venaissin and its dependencies, and transfers and makes over the said rights to the French Republic."

On 1 October 1795 ''Alexandre Mottard de Lestang'', a Knight, captured the town for the royalists with a troop of 10,000 men.{{sfn|Fantin-Desodoards|1807|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dJsFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA89 89]}} The mission representative Boursault retook the city and had Lestang shot.

Before the [[French Revolution]] Avignon had as [[suffragan see]]s [[Carpentras]], [[Vaison]] and [[Cavaillon]], which were united by the Napoleonic [[Concordat of 1801]] to Avignon, together with the [[Diocese of Apt]], a suffragan of [[Aix-en-Provence]]. However, at that same time Avignon was reduced to the rank of a [[Diocese|bishopric]] and was made a suffragan see of [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]].

On 30 May 1814 the French annexation of Avignon was recognized by the Pope. [[Ercole Consalvi]] made an ineffectual protest at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 but Avignon was never restored to the [[Holy See]]. In 1815, Bonapartist Marshal [[Guillaume Marie Anne Brune]] was assassinated  by adherents of the [[Ultra-royalist|royalist party]] during the [[Second White Terror|White Terror]]. Murder took place in the former Hotel du Palais Royal that was located Place Crillon in front of today's [[Hotel d'Europe]].

In the years 1820-1830 Villeneuve was forced to yield part of its territory to Avignon: the part called the Île de la Barthelasse.

The [[Archdiocese]] of Avignon was re-established in 1822, receiving as suffragan sees the [[Diocese of Viviers]], [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]]: (formerly under Lyon), [[Nîmes]], and [[Montpellier]] (formerly under Toulouse).

On 18 October 1847 the Avignon - Marseille railway line was opened by the ''Compagnie du chemin de fer de Marseille à Avignon'' (Marseille to Avignon Railway Company). In 1860 the current [[Avignon Centre railway station]] was built. In November 1898 the tramway network of the ''Compagnie des Tramways Électriques d'Avignon'' (Electric Tramways Company of Avignon) was opened to replace the old company of horse-drawn transport.

During the coup of 2 December 1851 the people of Avignon, with Alphonse Gent, tried to oppose it.<ref>[http://www.1851.fr/lieux/vaucluse_1.htm "There are 120 years, the people of Vaucluse rise up against the coup d'État of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte"], articles published in the daily ''Le Provençal'', Vaucluse edition, 2–7 December 1971, Association 1851 pour la mémoire des Résistances républicaines, André Mercier, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

[[File:Avignon Arrivée de Poincaré le 14 octobre 1913.jpg|thumb|Arrival at Avignon of [[Raymond Poincaré]], President of the Republic, on 14 October 1913.]]

The newly elected President of the Republic at the beginning of the year 1913, [[Raymond Poincaré]], visited [[Provence]] in mid-October. He wrote in his book ''In the Service of France: Europe under arms: 1913'', a description of his successive visits. The primary purpose of the visit was to verify ''in situ'' the state of mind of the [[Félibrige]] in the likely event of a conflict with Germany. He met, at [[Maillane]] and at [[Sérignan-du-Comtat]], the two most illustrious people [[Frédéric Mistral]] and [[Jean-Henri Fabre]]. Between these two appointments he paused at Avignon where he was received triumphantly at the Town Hall. Already the reception he had received at the ''Mas du Juge'' from the poet and the communal meal they had taken in the presidential train at Graveson had reassured him of the patriotism of Provence. It was, therefore in these terms that he spoke on the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]:

"Dear and illustrious master, you who have pointed out imperishable monuments in honour of French land; you who have raised the prestige of a language and a literature that has a place in our national history to be proud of; you who, in glorifying Provence, have braided a crown of olive green; to you, august master, I bring the testimony of the recognition of the Republic and the great motherland".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A1OAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT196&lpg=PT196&dq=poincar%C3%A9+avignon+1913&source=bl&ots=mC180pDjaH&sig=mRJug1g-F2lg5Y6CV9prj5-g8kY&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=2g1zU8PuCamO0AWX0YFY&ved=0CGYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=poincar%C3%A9%20avignon%201913&f=false Raymond Poincaré, ''In the service of France: Europe under arms: 1913''] {{Fr icon}}</ref><ref>[http://www.conservatoire-documentaire-culturel-frederic-mistral.fr/59+1913-2013-il-y-a-100-ans-les-derniers-triomphes.html Conservatory of documents and culture, ''Frédéric Mistral: 1913-2013: There are 100 years, the last triumphant''] {{Fr icon}}</ref>

The 20th century saw significant development of urbanization, mainly outside the city walls, and several major projects have emerged. Between 1920 and 1975 the population has almost doubled despite the cession of [[Le Pontet, Vaucluse|Le Pontet]] in 1925 and the [[Second World War]].

On the transport side 1937 saw the creation of the [[Avignon - Caumont Airport]] which became an airport in the early 1980s and became prominent with the opening of international routes, a new control tower, extension of the runway, etc.<ref>[http://www.avignon.aeroport.fr/fr/ Avignon - Caumont Airport], Avignon - Caumont Airport official website, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

In September 1947 the first edition of the future [[Avignon Festival]] was held.

After the Second World War on 11 November 1948 Avignon received a citation of the order of the division. This distinction involved the awarding of the [[Croix de Guerre]] with Silver Star.<ref>[http://www.mairie-avignon.fr/fr/culture/histoire/blason.php ''History, the arms of the city''], Avignon official website, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref> The city rose, expanded its festival, dusted off its monuments, and developed its tourism and trade.

In 1977 the city was awarded the ''Europe Prize'', awarded by the [[Council of Europe]].<ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/Committee/ENA/EuropaPrize/50thAnniversary/EuropePrizeMap.asp Winners of the Europe Prize 1955-2011], Council of Europe website, consulted on 17 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

In 1996 the [[LGV Méditerranée]] railway project was started. Its path passes through the commune and over the Rhone. From 1998 to 2001 the Avignon TGV station was built.<ref>[http://structurae.net/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0002632&_ga=1.160891645.1340078553.1405942786 Avignon TGV Station]</ref>

In 2002, as part of the reshuffling of the ecclesiastic [[provinces of France]], the Archdiocese of Avignon ceased to be a metropolitan and became, instead a [[suffragan diocese]] of the new province of [[Archdiocese of Marseilles|Marseilles]], while keeping its rank of [[archdiocese]].

==Geography==
Avignon is situated on the left bank of the [[Rhône]] river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the [[Durance]], about {{convert|580|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east of Paris, {{convert|229|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Lyon]] and {{convert|85|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north-north-west of [[Marseille]]. On the west it shares a border with the department of [[Gard]] and the communes of [[Villeneuve-lès-Avignon]] and [[Les Angles, Gard|Les Angles]] and to the south it borders the department of [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] and the communes of [[Barbentane]], [[Rognonas]], [[Châteaurenard]], and [[Noves]].

The city is located in the vicinity of [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]] (north), [[Nîmes]], [[Montpellier]] (south-west), [[Arles]] (to the south), [[Salon-de-Provence]], and [[Marseille]] (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of [[Caumont-sur-Durance]], [[Morières-lès-Avignon]], [[Le Pontet, Vaucluse|Le Pontet]], and [[Sorgues]].

===Communication and transport===

===Geology and terrain===

The region around Avignon is very rich in [[limestone]] which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called ''mollasse burdigalienne''.<ref name="geologie">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070927220632/http://www.cjrosier.com/Agence-immobiliere/Relief-et-geologie-des-sols-autour-d-Avignon-Vaucluse.htm Relief and Geology of the Avignon sector], Agence Rosier website (archived) {{Fr icon}}</ref>

Enclosed by the ramparts, the ''Rocher des Doms'' is a limestone elevation of ''urgonian'' type, 35 metres high<ref>[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/avignon Avignon Encyclopedia] Universalis website {{Fr icon}}</ref> (and therefore safe from flooding that of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the ''Massif des Angles'', ''Villeneuve-lès-Avignon'', ''Alpilles''...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Provençal basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.<ref name="geologie" />

The other significant elevation in the commune is the [[Montfavet]] Hill - a wooded hill in the east of the commune.<ref name="geologie"/>

The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the ''Île de la Barthelasse'', were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.<ref name="geologie"/>

In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.<ref name="geologie" />

[[File:Pont d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Pont Saint-Bénézet|Pont d'Avignon]]'' on the ''Petit Rhône''. In the background is [[Mont Ventoux]].]]

The Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the ''Petit Rhône'', or "dead arm", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the ''Grand Rhône'', or "live arm", for the western channel which passes [[Villeneuve-lès-Avignon]] in the [[Gard]] department. The two branches are separated by an island, the Île de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the Île de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'Île de Piot.<ref>{{ cite web | title=Cassini map circa 1750: Avignon | url=http://rumsey.geogarage.com/maps/cassinige.html?lat=43.9493&lon=4.8059&zoom=13 | publisher=David Rumsey Historical Map Collection | accessdate=31 July 2014 }}</ref>

====General====
The banks of the Rhone and the Île de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication ''Floods in France since the 6th century until today - research and documentation''{{sfn|Champion|1862}} by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943-1944<ref>[http://www.ina.fr/video/AFE86002249/la-crue-de-l-allier-video.html ''Floods in Avignon''], [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]] video document, consulted on 19 July 2014 {{Fr icon}}</ref> and again on 23 January 1955<ref>[http://www.ina.fr/video/CAF94017398/inondations-a-paris-et-a-avignon-video.html ''Floods in Paris and Avignon''], 23 January 1955, [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]] video document JT 20h, [[ORTF]], consulted on 19 July 2014 {{Fr icon}}</ref> and remain important today - such as the floods of 2 December 2003.<ref>[http://www.ina.fr/video/2454650001002/voyage-helico-vaucluse-video.html ''Floods on 2 December 2003''], [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]] video document {{Fr icon}}</ref> As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.

The [[Durance]] flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with [[Bouches-du-Rhône]].<ref>[http://sandre.eaufrance.fr/app/chainage/courdo/htm/X31-0400.php?cg=X31-0400 Watercourses: The Èze River (X31-0400)], [[Sandre]] database {{Fr icon}}</ref> It is a river that is considered "capricious" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the "3rd scourge of Provence"{{efn|Provençal tradition says that the first two were the [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] and the [[Parliament of Aix-en-Provence|Parliament of Aix]]}} as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.

There are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.

====Artificial diversions====
[[File:Moulin Parc chico mendes 6.jpg|thumb|A mill on the Vaucluse Canal in the ''Pont des 2 eaux'' district]]

There have been many diversions<ref>[http://www.avignon-et-provence.com/avignon-tourism/monuments/rue-des-teinturiers.htm#.U8oly5SSzUc The Street of Dyers - Avignon], avignon-et-provence.com website, consulted on 19 July 2014</ref> throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.

In the 10th century part of the waters from the ''Sorgue d'Entraigues'' were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See [[Sorgue]]). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the ''Sorgue'' or ''Sorguette''. It is visible in the city in the famous ''Rue des teinturiers'' (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the ''Durançole''. The ''Durançole'' fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.

The Hospital Canal (joining the Durançole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Vedène. They were divided into numerous "fioles" or "filioles" (in [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] ''filhòlas'' or ''fiolo''). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.

All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.

===Seismicity===
[[File:Clocher de l'église des Augustins (Place des Carmes) Avignon, by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|The leaning bell tower of the Church of the [[Augustinians]].]]

Under the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.

"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.".<ref>''Regulatory Seismic Zoning of France, classed by cantons (as at the end of 1989) in the PACA rehion'', p. 48. {{Fr icon}}</ref>

The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909.{{efn|The épicentre was at Lambesc - a village in Bouches-du-Rhône.}} It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient [[campanile]] of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.

===Climate===
Avignon has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with semi mild winters and very warm summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 C.  The driest month is July when the average monthly rainfall is 35 millimetres, which is a little too wet for the climate to be classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] (Köppen ''Csa'').<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Peel | first1=M.C. | last2=Finlayson | first2=B.L. | last3=McMahon | first3=T.A. | year=2007 | title= Updated world map of the Köppen&ndash;Geiger climate classification | journal=Hydrol.

A medieval Latin proverb is somewhat exaggerated: ''Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa'' (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).{{sfn|Mistral|1979|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k74854/f203.image 196]}}

==Demography==
In 2010 the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.<!--{{efn|At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by [http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100%26fastPos=1%26fastReqId=2036940488%26categorieLien=cid%26oldAction=rechTexte&title=loi%20no%C2%A02002-276%20du%2027%20f%C3%A9vrier%202002 Law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002], the so-called "law of local democracy" and in particular Title V "census operations" allows, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts.

Avignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers.<ref name=mariecarte>{{ cite web | title=Contexte économique: Carte d'identité d'Avignon | url=http://www.mairie-avignon.fr/fr/ecodev/environ/ci.php | publisher=Le Marie, Avignon | language=French }}</ref> The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m<sup>2</sup> per thousand population against 270 on average in France.<ref>[http://www.leravi.org/spip.php?article742 A wall of commercial areas], journal ''le Ravi'', November 2008 {{Fr icon}}</ref> The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.<ref>[http://www.leravi.org/spip.php?article1140 It is the zone], article in the Provençal magazine ''le Ravi'', September 2011</ref>

The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of [[Carpentras]]). In the 1980s and 1990s the development of trade between the North and South of Europe has strengthened the position of Avignon as a logistics hub and promoted the creation of transport and storage businesses for clothing and food.

A [[Sensitive urban zone]] was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues.<ref>[http://www.mairie-avignon.fr/fr/ecodev/eco/zfu1.php The exemptions in the Sensitive urban zone of Avignon] {{Fr icon}}</ref> It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.<ref>[http://www.avignonvaucluse.cci.fr/1-9685-ZFU-d-Avignon.php Maps and plans of the Sensitive urban zone of Avignon], Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse, consulted on 19 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

===Areas of economic activity===
There are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.<ref name="ZAE">[http://www.avignonvaucluse.cci.fr/dynamiques/doc/LISTE-ZAE-MIS-EN-PAGE1.pdf Principal areas of activity in the department],  Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse, consulted on 19 October 2011 {{Fr icon}}</ref>

The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs.<ref name="ZAE" /> The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.

Then comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.<ref name="ZAE" />

The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area{{efn|This area has had the INRA Centre which carries out scientific research in engineering environmental management for cultivated land and forests since 1953.}} (or "Technopole Agroparc"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.<ref name="ZAE" />

Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs - i.e. 100 more than Cristole.<ref name="ZAE" />

===Tourism===
Four million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival.<ref name=mariecarte/> In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors.<ref name=otstats/> The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.<ref name=otstats/>

River tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotelsbuildings, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. Attendance during the 2000s was increased with nearly 50,000 tourists coming mostly from Northern Europe and North America. In addition a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the Île de la Barthelasse and, since 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Fruits et légumes aux Halles.jpg|thumb|Fruit and Vegetables at the Markets of Avignon]]

==Culture==

===Avignon Festival===
A famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the [[Avignon Festival]] comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival.<ref>{{cite web|title=Festival 2014|url=http://www.festival-avignon.com/en/|accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref> There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal "Festival In", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian "Festival Off", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.

===The International Congress Centre===
The Centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palais-des-papes.com/anglais/cicaccueil.html |title=Popes' Palace |publisher=Palais-des-papes.com |accessdate=17 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100107001542/http://www.palais-des-papes.com/anglais/cicaccueil.html| archivedate= 7 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Sport===
[[Sporting Olympique Avignon]] is the local [[rugby league football]] team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.

[[AC Arles-Avignon]] is a professional French football team. They compete in [[Ligue 2]], having gained promotion from Ligue 3 in June 2009. After a season 2010-2011 competing in Ligue 1, the Arles-Avignon team came back in Ligue 2. They play at the [[Parc des Sports (Avignon)|Parc des Sports]], which has a capacity of just over 17,000.

==Nuclear pollution==
On 8 July 2008 waste containing unenriched uranium leaked into two rivers from a nuclear plant in southern France. Some 30,000 litres (7,925 gallons) of solution containing 12g of uranium per litre spilled from an overflowing reservoir at the facility – which handles liquids contaminated by uranium – into the ground and into the Gaffiere and Lauzon rivers. The authorities kept this a secret from the public for 12 hours then issued a statement prohibiting swimming and fishing in the Gaffiere and Lauzon rivers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7496998.stm |title=Europe , Warning over French uranium leak |publisher=BBC News  |date=9 July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}</ref>

==''Sur le Pont d'Avignon''==
{{Wide image|Avignon Panorama.jpg|900px|View over the Rhône looking northeast, with the [[Pont Saint-Bénézet]] or "Pont d'Avignon" at left}}
Avignon is commemorated by the French song, "''[[Sur le Pont d'Avignon]]''" ("On the bridge of Avignon"), which describes [[folk dance|folk dancing]]. The song dates from the mid-19th century when [[Adolphe Adam]] included it in the [[Opéra comique]] ''Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine'' which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by [[Pierre Jean Baptiste Choudard Desforges|Desforges]].<ref>{{citation | last=Anonymous | title=Théatre Impérial de l'Opéra-Comique, Le Sourd ou l'Auberge pleine: Comédie en trois actes de Desforges, mélée de musique par Ad. Adam | journal=Revue et gazette musicale de Paris: journal des artistes, des amateurs et des théâtres | volume=20 | issue=6 | date=6 February 1853| page=42 | place=Paris | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZdfc-w51y8C&pg=PA42 | language=French }}.</ref>

The bridge of the song is the [[Pont Saint-Bénézet|Saint-Bénézet bridge]] over the [[Rhône]] of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900&nbsp;m (2950&nbsp;ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by [[Louis VIII of France]] in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.{{sfn|Rouquette|1974|pp=219-229}}

==Education==
The schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Académie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (''Écoles maternelles'') for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (''Écoles élémentaires'') up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.<ref>{{cite web | title=Liste des écoles maternelles et primaires | url=http://www.mairie-avignon.fr/fr/pratique/etudier/liste.php | publisher=Le Marie d'Avignon | accessdate=2 August 2014 }}</ref>

===University of Avignon===
{{See also|Medieval university|List of medieval universities}}
[[File:UniversiteAvignon-Entree.jpg|right|thumb|Entrance to the main university building. This 18th century portico was once the entrance to the Hôpital Sainte-Marthe.]]

====University before the Revolution====
The medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by [[Boniface VIII]] in a [[Papal Bull]]. Boniface VIII and [[Charles II of Naples|King Charles II]] of Naples  were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.<ref name=ceuni>{{CathEncy|wstitle=University of Avignon|noicon=x}}</ref>

In 1413 [[Antipope John XXIII]] founded the University's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The [[Bishop of Avignon]] was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an Archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).<ref name=ceuni/>

The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two [[Doctor of Medicine|Doctors of Medicine]] added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and [[tax exemption|tax exempt status]]. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the [[French Revolution]] the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.<ref name=ceuni/>

====Modern university====
A university annex of the ''Faculté des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille'' was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the ''Université d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse'' was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university.<ref>{{cite web | title=Présentation: Histoire | publisher=Université d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse | url=http://www.univ-avignon.fr/fr/presentation/reperes/histoire.html | accessdate=5 April 2014 }}</ref> The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the ''Hôpital Sainte-Marthe''. The main building has an elegant façade with a central [[portico]]. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son François in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997.{{sfn|Vingtain|Aujard-Catot|2001|pp=123-124}}{{sfn|Girard|1958|pp=306-307}} In 2009-2010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.<ref>{{cite web | title=Présentation: Chiffres clés | publisher=Université d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse | url=http://www.univ-avignon.fr/fr/presentation/reperes/chiffres-cles.html | accessdate=5 April 2014 }}</ref>
