The '''Council on Foreign Relations''' ('''CFR'''), founded in 1921, is a [[United States]] 4900-member [[organization]], [[nonprofit]], [[publisher]], and [[think tank]] specializing in U.S. [[foreign policy]] and [[International relations|international affairs]]. It is headquartered in [[New York City]], with an additional office in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Its membership has included senior politicians, more than a dozen [[United States Secretary of State|secretaries of state]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] directors, bankers, lawyers, professors, and senior [[mass media|media]] figures. The CFR promotes [[globalization]], [[free trade]], reducing financial regulations on [[transnational corporations]], and economic consolidation into regional blocs such as [[NAFTA]] or the [[European Union]], and develops policy recommendations that reflect these goals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The CFR meetings convene government officials, global business leaders and prominent members of the intelligence and foreign-policy community to discuss international issues. CFR publishes the bi-monthly journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', and runs the ''David Rockefeller Studies Program'', which influences foreign policy by making recommendations to the presidential administration and diplomatic community, testifying before Congress, interacting with the media, and publishing on foreign policy issues.

==History==
===Origins, 1918 to 1945===
[[File:Elihu Root, bw photo portrait, 1902.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elihu Root]], a powerful corporate lawyer who served as Secretary of State, Secretary of War, and U.S. Senator, headed the first Council on Foreign Relations with a small group of New York financiers and lawyers]]

Towards the end of [[World War I]], a working fellowship of about 150 scholars called "[[The Inquiry]]" was tasked to brief President [[Woodrow Wilson]] about options for the postwar world when Germany was defeated. This academic band, including Wilson's closest adviser and long-time friend "Colonel" [[Edward M. House]], as well as [[Walter Lippmann]], met to assemble the strategy for the postwar world.<ref name=Shoup>{{cite book|authors=Shoup, Lawrence H. & Minter, William|title=Imperial Brain Trust: The Council on Foreign Relations and United States Foreign Policy|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=1977|isbn=0-85345-393-4}}</ref>{{rp|13–14}} The team produced more than 2,000 documents detailing and analyzing the political, economic, and social facts globally that would be helpful for Wilson in the peace talks. Their reports formed the basis for the [[Fourteen Points]], which outlined Wilson's strategy for peace after war's end. These scholars then traveled to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] and participated in the discussions there.<ref name=Grose>{{cite book|author=Grose, Peter|title=Continuing the Inquiry: The Council on Foreign Relations from 1921 to 1996|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations Press|year=2006|isbn=0876091923|url=http://www.cfr.org/history-and-theory-of-international-relations/continuing-inquiry/p108}}</ref>{{rp|1–5}}

As a result of discussions at the Peace Conference, a small group of British and American diplomats and scholars met on May 30, 1919 at the [[The Peninsula Paris|Hotel Majestic]] in Paris and decided to create an Anglo-American organization called "The Institute of International Affairs", which would have offices in London and New York.<ref name=Shoup/>{{rp|12}}<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|5}} Due to the [[isolationist]] views prevalent in American society at the time, the scholars had difficulty gaining traction with their plan, and turned their focus instead to a set of discreet meetings that had been taking place since June 1918 in New York City, under the name Council on Foreign Relations. The meetings were headed by the corporate lawyer [[Elihu Root]], who had served as [[Secretary of State]] under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and attended by 108 “high-ranking officers of banking, manufacturing, trading and finance companies, together with many lawyers.” The members were proponents of Wilson's internationalism, but were particularly concerned about "the effect that the war and the treaty of peace might have on postwar business."<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|6–7}} The scholars from the inquiry saw an opportunity here to create an organization that brought diplomats, high-level government officials and academics together with lawyers, bankers, and industrialists to engineer government policy. On July 29, 1921 they filed a certification of [[incorporation (association)|incorporation]], officially forming the Council on Foreign Relations.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|8–9}} In 1922 [[Edwin F. Gay]], former dean of the [[Harvard Business School]] and director of the [[Shipping Board]] during the war, spearheaded the Council's efforts to begin publication of a magazine that would be the "authoritative" source on foreign policy. He gathered $125,000 from the wealthy members on the council, and via sending letters soliciting funds to "the thousand richest Americans". Using these funds, the first issue of ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' was published in September 1922, and within a few years had a gained a reputation as the "most authoritative American review dealing with international relations".<ref name=Shoup/>{{rp|17–18}}

In the late 1930s, the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]] began contributing large amounts of money to the Council.<ref>{{Cite book|author=O'Brien, Thomas F.|title=The Century of U.S. Capitalism in Latin America|publisher=UNM Press|year=1999|isbn=9780826319968|pages=105–106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMVF8jtZy0oC&pg=PA105}}</ref> In 1938 they created various Committees on Foreign Relations, which later became governed by the American Committees on Foreign Relations in [[Washington, D.C.]], throughout the country, funded by a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]]. Influential men were to be chosen in a number of cities, and would then be brought together for discussions in their own communities as well as participating in an annual conference in New York. These local committees served to influence local leaders and shape public opinion to build support for the Council's policies, while also acting as "useful listening posts" through which the Council and U.S. government could "sense the mood of the country".<ref name=Shoup/>{{rp|30–31}}

Beginning in 1939 and lasting for five years, the Council achieved much greater prominence within the government and the [[State Department]], when it established the strictly confidential ''[[War and Peace Studies]]'', funded entirely by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|23}}  The secrecy surrounding this group was such, that the Council members who were not involved in its deliberations were completely unaware of the study group's existence.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|26}} It was divided into four functional topic groups: economic and financial, security and [[armament]]s, territorial, and political. The security and armaments group was headed by [[Allen Welsh Dulles]] who later became a pivotal figure in the [[CIA]]'s predecessor, the [[Office of Strategic Services]]. The CFR ultimately produced 682 memoranda for the State Department, marked [[classified information|classified]] and circulated among the appropriate government departments.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|23–26}}

===Cold War era, 1945 to 1979 ===
A critical study found that of 502 government officials surveyed from 1945 to 1972, more than half were members of the Council.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|48}} During the [[Eisenhower administration]] 40% of the top U.S. foreign policy officials were CFR members (Eisenhower himself had been a council member); under [[Truman Administration|Truman]], 42% of the top posts were filled by council members. During the [[Kennedy administration]], this number rose to 51%, and peaked at 57% under the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson administration]].<ref name=Shoup/>{{rp|62–64}}

In an anonymous piece called "The Sources of Soviet Conduct" that appeared in ''Foreign Affairs'' in 1947, CFR study group member [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]] coined the term "[[containment]]".  The essay would prove to be highly influential in US foreign policy for seven upcoming presidential administrations. Forty years later, Kennan explained that he had never suspected the Russians of any desire to launch an attack on America; he thought that it was obvious enough and he did not need to explain it in his essay. [[William Bundy]] credited the CFR's study groups with helping to lay the framework of thinking that led to the [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Due to new interest in the group, membership grew towards 1,000.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|35–39}}

[[File:Harold Pratt House 004.JPG|thumb|left|CFR Headquarters, located in the former [[Harold Pratt House]] in [[New York City]]]]
[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] chaired a CFR study group while he served as President of [[Columbia University]]. One member later said, "whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings."<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|35–44}} The CFR study group devised an expanded study group called "Americans for Eisenhower" to increase his chances for the presidency. Eisenhower would later draw many Cabinet members from CFR ranks and become a CFR member himself. His primary CFR appointment was Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]].  Dulles gave a public address at the [[Harold Pratt House]] in New York City in which he announced a new direction for Eisenhower's foreign policy: "There is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty land power of the communist world. Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power." After this speech, the council convened a session on "Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy" and chose [[Henry Kissinger]] to head it. Kissinger spent the following academic year working on the project at Council headquarters. The book of the same name that he published from his research in 1957 gave him national recognition, topping the national bestseller lists.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|39–41}}

On November 24, 1953, a study group heard a report from political scientist William Henderson regarding the ongoing conflict between [[France]] and Vietnamese Communist leader [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Viet Minh]] forces, a struggle that would later become known as the [[First Indochina War]]. Henderson argued that Ho's cause was primarily [[nationalism|nationalist]] in nature and that Marxism had "little to do with the current revolution." Further, the report said, the United States could work with Ho to guide his movement away from Communism. State Department officials, however, expressed skepticism about direct American intervention in Vietnam and the idea was tabled. Over the next twenty years, the United States would find itself allied with anti-Communist [[South Vietnam]] and against Ho and his supporters in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|40, 49–67}}

The Council served as a "breeding ground" for important American policies such as [[mutual deterrence]], [[arms control]], and [[nuclear non-proliferation]].<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|40–42}}

In 1962 the group began a program of bringing select Air Force officers to the Harold Pratt House to study alongside its scholars. The Army, Navy and Marine Corps requested they start similar programs for their own officers.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|46}}

A four-year-long study of [[Sino-American Relations|relations between America and China]] was conducted by the Council between 1964 and 1968. One study published in 1966 concluded that American citizens were more open to talks with China than their elected leaders. [[Henry Kissinger]] had continued to publish in ''Foreign Affairs'' and was appointed by [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] to serve as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]] in 1969. In 1971, he embarked on a secret trip to Beijing to broach talks with Chinese leaders. [[Richard Nixon]] went to China in 1972, and diplomatic relations were completely normalized by [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]]'s Secretary of State, another Council member, [[Cyrus Vance]].<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|42–44}}

Vietnam created a rift within the organization. When [[Hamilton Fish Armstrong]] announced in 1970 that he would be leaving the helm of ''Foreign Affairs'' after 45 years, new chairman [[David Rockefeller]] approached a family friend, [[William Bundy]], to take over the position. Anti-war advocates within the Council rose in protest against this appointment, claiming that Bundy's hawkish record in the State and Defense Departments and the CIA precluded him from taking over an independent journal. Some considered Bundy a [[war criminal]] for his prior actions.<ref name=Grose/>{{rp|50–51}}

In November 1979, while chairman of the CFR, David Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger, along with [[John J. McCloy]] and Rockefeller aides, persuaded President Jimmy Carter through the State Department to admit the Shah of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], into the US for hospital treatment for [[lymphoma]]. This action directly precipitated what is known as the [[Iran hostage crisis]] and placed Rockefeller under intense media scrutiny (particularly from ''[[The New York Times]]'') for the first time in his public life.<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]], [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch27.html Why the War? The Kuwait Connection] (May 1991)</ref><ref>Scrutiny by NYT over the Shah of Iran – David Rockefeller, ''Memoirs'' (pp. 356–75)</ref> In his book ''[[White House Diary]]'', Carter wrote of the affair, "April 9 [1979] David Rockefeller came in, apparently to induce me to let the shah come to the United States. Rockefeller, Kissinger, and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski|Brzezinski]] seem to be adopting this as a joint project..."

It convenes meetings at which government officials, global leaders and prominent members of the foreign policy community discuss major international issues. Its think tank, the David Rockefeller Studies Program, is composed of about fifty adjunct and full-time scholars, as well as ten in-residence recipients of year-long fellowships, who cover the major regions and significant issues shaping today's international agenda. These scholars contribute to the foreign policy debate by making recommendations to the presidential administration, testifying before Congress, serving as a resource to the diplomatic community, interacting with the media, authoring books, reports, articles, and op-eds on foreign policy issues.

The CFR started a program in 2008 to last for 5 years and funded by a grant from the Robina Foundation called "International Institutions and Global Governance" which aims to identify the institutional requirements for effective multilateral cooperation in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/thinktank/iigg/mission.html |title=International Institutions and Global Governance |accessdate=2010-06-01 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations}}</ref>

The CFR's Maurice C. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies, directed by scholar and author [[Sebastian Mallaby]], works to promote a better understanding among policymakers, academic specialists, and the interested public of how economic and political forces interact to influence world affairs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/thinktank/cgs/mission.html |title=Maurice C. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies |accessdate=2010-06-01 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations}}</ref>

The CFR's Center for Preventive Action (CPA) seeks to help prevent, defuse, or resolve deadly conflicts around the world and to expand the body of knowledge on conflict prevention. It does so by creating a forum in which representatives of governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, corporations, and civil society can gather to develop operational and timely strategies for promoting peace in specific conflict situations.

===''Foreign Affairs''===
The council publishes ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', "the preeminent journal of international affairs and U.S. foreign policy". It also establishes independent task forces, which bring together experts with diverse backgrounds and expertise to work together to produce reports offering both findings and policy prescriptions on important foreign policy topics. The CFR has sponsored more than fifty reports, including the [[Independent Task Force on the Future of North America]] that published report No, 53, titled ''Building a North American Community'', in May 2005.<ref name=Prespage>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/about/ |title=President's Welcome |accessdate=2007-02-24 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations}}</ref>

==Media opinions==
In 2005, Inter Press Service News Agency described CFR as "the nation's most influential foreign-policy think tank".<ref>{{Cite news|quote=The nation's most influential foreign-policy think tank|url=http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=29966|title=Realists Rule?|publisher=Inter Press Service|first=Jim|last=Lobe|date=August 19, 2005}}</ref>

The council received a four star rating (out of a possible four stars) from [[Charity Navigator]] in fiscal year 2013, as measured by their analysis of the council's financial data and "accountability and transparency".<ref name=CharityNav>{{cite web|author1=Charity Navigator|title=Council on Foreign Relations - A nonpartisan resource for information and analysis|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3580#.VWAShUaGOT8|publisher=[[Charity Navigator]]|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref>

==Controversy==
The council has been the subject of debates over sovereignty as well as the subject of numerous [[conspiracy theories]]. This is primarily due to the number of high-ranking government officials (along with world business leaders and prominent media figures) in its membership and the large number of aspects of American foreign policy that its members have been involved with. Echoing the most common accusation, the [[paleoconservative]] [[John Birch Society]] claims that the CFR is "Guilty of conspiring with others to build a one world government...".<ref>[http://www.jbs.org/jbs-news-feed/5121-letting-the-cfr-cat-out-of-the-bag Letting the CFR Cat Out of the Bag]</ref><ref>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1V53t6RIjaMJ:www.jbs.org/jbs-news-feed/letting-the-cfr-cat-out-of-the-bag+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us Letting the CFR Cat Out of the Bag - The John Birch Society].
