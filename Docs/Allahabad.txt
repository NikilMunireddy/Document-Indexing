'''Allahabad''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Allahabad.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|h|ə|b|ɑː|d}}), also known as '''Prayag प्रयाग''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|ə|ˈ|y|ɑː|g}}) and '''Ilahabad''', is a city in the [[India]]n state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and the administrative headquarters of [[Allahabad District]], the most-populous district in the state.

The city's original name&nbsp;– ''Prayaga प्रयाग'', or "place of offerings"&nbsp;– comes from its position at the ''[[Triveni Sangam|Sangam]]'' (confluence) of the [[Ganga]], [[Yamuna]] and mythical [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]] rivers.  It is the second-oldest city in India, and plays a central role in [[Hindu scriptures]].  Allahabad was originally called Kaushambi (now a [[Kaushambi District|separate district]]) by the Kuru rulers of [[Hastinapur]], who developed it as their capital. Since then, Allahabad has been a political, cultural and administrative centre of the [[Doab]] region.  [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] renamed it Ilahabad, which the British changed to Allahabad.  In 1833 it became the seat of the [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]] region before its capital was moved to [[Agra]] in 1835.<ref name="MHBI">{{cite book|author=H.S.

The city is home to colleges, research institutions and [[Central government|central]] and [[Government of Uttar Pradesh|state government]] offices. Allahabad has hosted cultural and sporting events, including [[Allahabad Kumbh Mela|Kumbh Mela]] and the [[Indira Marathon]]. Although the city's economy was built on tourism, most of its income now derives from real estate and financial services.

Allahabad is known as the "city of prime ministers" because seven out of 15 prime ministers of India since independence have connections to Allahabad ([[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Rajiv Gandhi]], [[Gulzarilal Nanda]], [[Vishwanath Pratap Singh]] and [[Chandra Shekhar]]).
