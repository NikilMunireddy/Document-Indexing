'''Ayrton Senna da Silva''' ({{IPA-pt|aˈiʁtõ ˈsẽnɐ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ|br|ayrton senna da silva.ogg}}; 21 March 1960&nbsp;– 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian [[racing driver]] who won three [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|world championships]] for [[McLaren]] in [[1988 Formula One season|1988]], [[1990 Formula One season|1990]] and [[1991 Formula One season|1991]] and is regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/89217406|title=Alonso, Massa, Schumacher say Senna is "greatest" on Top Gear}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/20324109|title=Murray Walker lists Senna as number one}}</ref> He was [[Death of Ayrton Senna|killed]] in an accident while leading the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]] for [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]].<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-ayrton-senna-1433227.html</ref> 

Senna began his motorsport career in [[karting]], moving up to [[Open wheel car|open-wheel]] racing in 1981, and winning the [[British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula 3]] championship in 1983. He made his Formula One debut with [[Toleman|Toleman-Hart]] in [[1984 Formula One season|1984]] before moving to [[Team Lotus|Lotus-Renault]] the [[1985 Formula One season|following year]] and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In [[1988 Formula One season|1988]], he joined Frenchman [[Alain Prost]] at [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]]-[[Honda Racing F1|Honda]]. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year and Senna claimed his first [[Formula One World Championship|World Championship]]. Prost claimed the championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in [[1990 Formula One season|1990]] and [[1991 Formula One season|1991]]. In [[1992 Formula One season|1992]], the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]] combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the [[1993 Formula One season|1993 season]] as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in [[1994 Formula One season|1994]].

Senna has often been voted as the best and most influential <!-- The point of whether or not he is "one" of the greatest drivers in history, already has been cited in the first paragraph. Therefore is redundant. The title as "greatest" is consensus of the polls, and fellow drivers themselves. Including Alonso and Schumacher. This text does not define him as the greatest. Only that he has been named often as mentioned. Numbers are not needed.--> Formula One driver of all time in various motorsport polls.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://f1greatestdrivers.autosport.com/?driver=1 |title=Formula 1's Greatest Drivers - AUTOSPORT.com - Ayrton Senna |publisher=F1greatestdrivers.autosport.com |date= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80517 |title=Drivers vote Senna the greatest ever - F1 news |publisher=Autosport.Com |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/sports/alonso-voted-best-driver-news-news-khxqOjgjchi.html |title=Alonso voted best driver |publisher=Sify.com |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/20324109 |title=BBC Sport - Formula 1's greatest drivers.

He holds a record six victories at the [[Monaco Grand Prix]], and is the fifth-most successful driver of all time in terms of [[Most Grand Prix wins|race wins]]. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Prost. In the [[Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grands Prix]] of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.

== Early life and career ==
[[File:Ayrton_Senna_-_3_Years_Old.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Senna at age 3.]]
Senna was born in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of [[Santana (São Paulo)|Santana]], a neighbourhood of [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://senna.globo.com/institutoayrtonsenna/br/noticias_interna.asp?cod_Noticia=128 |title=Gafisa presta homenagem a Ayrton Senna: "morador ilustre a gente não esquece" |publisher=Senna.globo.com |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> The middle child of wealthy Brazilian landowner and factory owner Milton da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva, he had an older sister, Viviane and a younger brother, Leonardo.<ref name=champion>{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna: Tragic Hero|url=http://www.f1-grandprixhistory.net/Senna.html#Introduction|publisher=History and Legends of Grand Prix Racing|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> He was [[left-handedness|left-handed]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Do left-handers make better drivers?|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/262406-do-left-handers-make-better-drivers|publisher=Metro|date=12 August 2008|accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref>

The house where Senna spent the first four years of his life belonged to Neide's father, João Senna. It was located on the corner of Avenida Aviador Guilherme with Avenida Gil Santos Dumont, less than 100 meters from Campo de Marte, a large area where they operated the Aeronautics Material park and an airport. Senna was highly athletic, excelling in gymnastics and other sports, and developed an interest in cars and motor racing at the age of four. He also suffered from poor motor coordination and had trouble climbing stairways by the age of three. An [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) found that Senna was not suffering from any problems. His parents gave Senna the [[nickname]] "Beco".<ref name=child>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Richard|title=The Death of Ayrton Senna|year=2010 |origyear=1995|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=}}</ref> At the age of seven, Senna first learned to drive a Jeep around his family's farm and gained the advantage of changing gears without the use of a clutch.<ref name=book>{{cite book|title=Formula One: The Story of Grand Prix Racing|last=Kapadia|first=Behram|year=2004|publisher=Silverdale Books|isbn=1-85605-899-9|page=66}}</ref>

Senna attended Colegio Rio Branco in the São Paulo neighbourhood of [[Jardins]] and graduated in 1977 with a grade 5 in physics along with other grades in mathematics, chemistry, and English. He later enrolled in a college that specialised in business administration, but dropped out after three months.<ref name=veja>{{cite web|title=100 years in 34|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/especiais/extras/fechado/senna04.html|publisher=Veja|date=3 May 1994|accessdate=24 August 2012|language=Portuguese}}</ref> Overall, his grades amounted up to 68%.<ref name=child />

[[File:Ayrton Senna Karting.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Senna began racing [[go-kart]]s in Brazil at the age of 13.]]
Senna's first kart was built by his father using a small 1-[[Horsepower|HP]] lawnmower engine. Senna started racing at Interlagos and entered a [[karting]] competition at the age of 13.<ref name=video>"Ayrton Senna – The Right to Win (2004)</ref> He started his first race on pole position, facing rivals who were some years older than him; despite this, he managed to lead most of the race before retiring after colliding with a rival. His father supported his son and Lucio Pascal Gascon soon managed the developing talent.<ref>''Ayrton Senna: Racing in My Blood, Official Video Biography'' (Kultur Video, 1991).</ref>

Senna went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977. He contested the [[Karting World Championship]] each year from 1978 to 1982, finishing runner-up in 1979 and 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportsetc.com/info/senna.htm|title=Ayrton Senna – Racing Career|publisher=MotorSports Etc}}</ref> In 1978, he was the teammate of [[Terry Fullerton]], from whom Senna later felt was the rival he got the most satisfaction racing against also because of the lack of money and politics at that level.<ref name=asenna>{{cite news|last=Calkin|first=Jessamy|title=Senna: the driver who lit up Formula One|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/8524259/Senna-the-driver-who-lit-up-Formula-One.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=15 August 2012|location=London}}</ref>

In 1981, Senna moved to England to begin [[Open wheel car|single-seater]] racing, winning the [[RAC plc|RAC]] and [[Townsend Thoreson|Townsend-Thoreson]] [[Formula Ford]] 1600 Championships that year with the [[Van Diemen]] team.

[[File:Ayrton Senna Beginning - Formula Ford 1981, Van Diemen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|17-year old Senna in his British Formula Ford 1600 single seater.]]
Despite this, Senna initially did not believe he would continue in motorsport. At the end of that season, under pressure from his parents to take up a role in the family business, Senna announced his retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil.<ref name=child /><ref>Hilton 1999 pp. 38–40</ref> Before leaving England, however, Senna was offered a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team for £10,000. Back in Brazil, he decided to take this offer and returned to live in England. As da Silva is a very common [[Brazilian name]], he instead adopted his mother's maiden name, Senna.<ref>Hilton (2005), pp. 9, 33–43, 154.</ref> Senna went on to win the 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships.<ref>{{cite news|title=From the Vault: F1 is robbed one of its most dazzling talents|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/apr/30/formulaone|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080505113059/http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/apr/30/formulaone| archivedate= 5 May 2008 | deadurl= no| date=30 April 2008| location=London}}</ref> For that season, Senna arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool.<ref name=child />

In [[1983 British Formula Three season|1983]], Senna drove in the [[British Formula Three Championship]] for the [[West Surrey Racing]] team. He dominated the first half of the season until [[Martin Brundle]], driving a similar car for [[Jordan Grand Prix#Early history|Eddie Jordan Racing]], closed the gap in the second part of the championship. Senna won the title at the final round after a closely fought and, at times, acrimonious battle with the Briton.<ref>Hilton, Christopher, ''Ayrton Senna&nbsp;– The Complete Story'' (2004), pp. 99–116.</ref> In November that year, Senna also triumphed at the inaugural [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix]] with [[Teddy Yip (businessman)|Teddy Yip]]'s [[Toyota]]-powered [[Theodore Racing Team]].<ref>Hilton (2005), pp. 43–47, 154.</ref><ref>Greg Girard, Ian Lambot, and Philip Newsome, ''Macau Grand Prix: The Road To Success'' (Watermark Surrey, 1998).</ref>

== Formula One career ==

===Toleman (1984)===
[[File:Toleman TG184.jpg|thumb|Senna's [[Toleman TG184]] from {{F1|1984}} on display in the [[Donington Grand Prix Collection]].]]
In 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams [[WilliamsF1|Williams]], [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]], [[Brabham]], and [[Toleman]]. [[Peter Warr]] of [[Team Lotus|Lotus]], [[Ron Dennis]] of McLaren, and [[Bernie Ecclestone]] of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on. During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) [[Donington Park]] circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams' reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg.<ref name="senna">{{cite news|title=Senna Remembered|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3605323.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090503020557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3605323.stm| archivedate= 3 May 2009 | deadurl= no| first=Andrew| last=Benson| date=1 May 2009}}</ref> Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the [[1984 Formula One season|1984 season]].<ref name="senna" /> Both Williams boss [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that Senna insisted that he got to run their cars before anyone else (other than their regular drivers such as Rosberg) so that he would have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car.

Peter Warr actually wanted to replace [[Nigel Mansell]] with Senna at Lotus, but their British-based title sponsor, [[Imperial Tobacco]] ([[John Player & Sons]]), wanted a British driver. Senna, however, was determined to drive that season and certainly on his own terms. Senna's test for Brabham occurred at Paul Ricard in November 1983, and he set lap times two seconds slower than the team's lead driver, [[Nelson Piquet]], who allegedly gave Senna the nickname "the São Paulo taxi driver".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Senna impressed the Brabham team and was linked to their second seat. However, the team's main sponsor, Italian dairy company [[Parmalat]], wanted an Italian driver. Brabham's second car was eventually shared by brothers [[Teo Fabi|Teo]] and [[Corrado Fabi]], while Piquet convinced Ecclestone to sign his friend [[Roberto Moreno]] as the test driver.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Clarkson |first=Tom |last2= |first2= |author2= |authorlink2= |date=18 October 2012|title=When Senna drove for Brabham |trans_title= |journal=F1 Racing |volume=201 |series= |issue=November 2012 |pages=62–67 |at= |publisher=Haymarket Publications |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |arxiv= |isbn= |pmc= |url= |laysource= }}</ref><ref>Rubython, Tom, ''The Life of Senna'' (2004), p. 90</ref> Consequently, he joined Toleman, a relatively new team, using less competitive [[Pirelli]] tyres.<ref>Hilton (2004), pp. 121–122.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Drackett|first=Phil|title=Brabham : Story of a racing team|publisher=Arthur Barker|year=1985|isbn=0-213-16915-0}} pp. 134–135</ref> Venezuelan [[Johnny Cecotto]], a former [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] world champion, was his team mate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy birthday to Johnny Cecotto|url=http://richardsf1.com/2010/01/25/happy-birthday-to-johnny-cecotto/|publisher=25 January 2010}}</ref> During 1984, Senna hired Nuno Cobra to assess his physical condition. Senna had been worried about his condition due to low weight.<ref name=video />

Senna made his debut at the [[1984 Brazilian Grand Prix]] in [[Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet|Rio de Janeiro]], where he qualified 17th, but had the dubious honour of being the first retirement of the season when the [[Hart (racing)|Hart 415T]] engine blew its turbo on lap 8. He scored his first [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|World Championship point]] in his second race at the [[1984 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]] at [[Kyalami]] with severe muscle spasms, replicating that result two weeks later at the [[1984 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]].

A combination of tyre issues and a fuel-pressure problem resulted in his failure to qualify for the [[1984 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], the only time this happened during his career. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying at [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] due to a dispute with tyre supplier [[Pirelli]] (Toleman were in the process of switching from Pirelli to [[Michelin]]). Senna then suffered a fuel-pressure problem in the wet Saturday session at Tosa (the furthest point on the circuit from the pits) and did not have enough time for it to be fixed to allow him to make the grid.<ref>Hilton (2004), p 138.</ref> Senna's best result of the season came at the [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], the first wet-weather race of the season. Qualifying 13th on the grid, he made steady progress in climbing through the field, passing [[Niki Lauda]] for second on lap 19. He quickly began to cut the gap to race leader [[Alain Prost]], but before he could attack Prost, the race was stopped on lap 31 for safety reasons, as the rain had grown even heavier. At the time the race was stopped, Senna was catching Prost by about 4 seconds per lap (while the [[Tyrrell 012|Tyrrell]]-[[Cosworth DFV|Ford]] of [[Stefan Bellof]] was catching both at the same rate).<ref>Mark Hughes and Simon Arron, ''The Complete Book of Formula One'' (Motorbooks International, 2003), p. 310.</ref> Senna passed Prost when Prost stopped in front of the red flag, before the end of the 32nd lap. According to the rules, the positions counted were those from the last lap completed by every driver, lap 31, at which point Prost was still leading.<ref name="Autocourse1">Hamilton, Maurice (1984) ''Autocourse 1984–85'' p.141 Hazleton publishing ISBN 0-905138-32-5</ref>  Senna's second place was his first podium in Formula One.<ref>{{cite web|title=ESPN Profile|url=http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/driver/1095.html|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> The popular belief was that with Prost's [[McLaren MP4/4|McLaren]]-[[Techniques d'Avant Garde|TAG]] having major brake troubles (they were regularly locking up due to not generating enough heat in the conditions), the premature ending of the race had robbed Senna of his maiden Grand Prix win. However, Toleman mechanics later confirmed that his [[Toleman TG184]] had suffered significant suspension damage due to an early race incident, and his constant running over the curbs at the Chicane du Port and through the Piscine (swimming pool) over the last few laps before the red flag. The mechanics confirmed that had the race not been stopped, Senna would have been forced to retire within a few laps of the flag.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Renowned throughout his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long before the advent of telemetry, this characteristic  led Senna's first F1 race engineer, [[Pat Symonds]], to regard the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix|US Grand Prix]] in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:<ref>{{cite web|last=Vasconcelos|first=Luis|title=Pat Symonds remembers Senna: Ayrton moved the goal posts!|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft27905.html=Grandprix.com|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref><blockquote>The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said "I'm sure that the wall moved!" and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, to have a look at the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened - we could see it from the tyre marks - was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.</blockquote>

[[File:Eröffnungsrennen 1984-05-12.jpg|thumb|Senna won the [[saloon (automobile)|saloon]] exhibition race to celebrate the opening of the new [[Nürburgring]] in 1984.]] That season, Senna took two more podium finishes—third at the [[1984 British Grand Prix|British]] and [[1984 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese]] Grands Prix—and placed 9th in the Drivers Championship with 13 points overall. He did not take part in the [[1984 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] after he was suspended by Toleman for being in breach of his contract by signing for [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] for 1985 without informing the Toleman team first.<ref>Hilton (2004), pp. 149–152.</ref> Senna became the first driver Lotus had signed not personally chosen by team founder [[Colin Chapman]], who had died in 1982.

Senna also raced in two high-profile non-Formula One races in 1984: The [[1984 1000 km of Nürburgring|ADAC 1000-km Nürburgring]] where, alongside [[Henri Pescarolo]] and [[Stefan Johansson]], he co-drove a [[Joest Racing]] [[Porsche 956]] to finish 8th, as well as an exhibition race to celebrate the opening of the new [[Nürburgring]] before the [[1984 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]]. Notably this race involved several past and present Formula 1 drivers, including [[Stirling Moss]] and past World Champions [[Jack Brabham]], [[Denny Hulme]] and [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]]), driving identical [[Mercedes-Benz W201#190 E 2.3-16 & 2.5-16 "Cosworth"|Mercedes 190E 2.3–16]] sports cars. [[Alain Prost]] started from pole position, but Senna took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning ahead of [[Niki Lauda]] and [[Carlos Reutemann]].<ref name="1000kmNürburgring">{{cite web | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc1984.html#4 | title = FIA World Endurance Championship 1984 | publisher=wsrp.ic.cz | accessdate =14 January 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061230194431/http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc1984.html| archivedate= 30 December 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref> After the race, Senna was quoted as saying, "Now I know I can do it."<ref>Hilton (2004), p 140.</ref> Senna was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race, taking over from [[Emerson Fittipaldi]].

===Lotus (1985–1987)===
;1985
[[File:1985 European GP Senna.jpg|thumb|Senna driving the [[Team Lotus]] [[Lotus 97T|97T]] at the [[1985 European Grand Prix]].]]
Senna was partnered in his first year at [[Team Lotus|Lotus-Renault]] by Italian driver [[Elio de Angelis]]. At the second round of the season, the [[1985 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]], Senna took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career. He converted it into his first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from [[Michele Alboreto]]<ref>Timothy Collings and Sarah Edworthy, ''The Formula One Years: A Season-by-Season Account of the World's Premier Motor Racing Championship from 1950 to the Present Day'' (Carlton Books, 2002), p. 208.</ref> and lapping everyone up to and including 3rd placed [[Patrick Tambay]]. The race was the first 'Grand Slam' of Senna's career, as he also set the fastest lap of the race.

He would not finish in the points again until coming second at the [[1985 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]], despite taking pole three more times in the intervening period. (His determination to take pole at the [[1985 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] had infuriated Alboreto and Niki Lauda; Senna had set a fast time early and was accused of deliberately baulking the other drivers by running more laps than necessary, a charge he rejected, though the accusations would continue in [[1985 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] when drivers accused him of running on the racing line when on his slow down lap forcing others on qualifiers to move off line and lose time).<ref>Hamilton, Maurice (ed.) (1985) ''Autocourse 1985&nbsp;– 1986'' Hazleton publishing pp.74 & 104 ISBN 0-905138-38-4</ref> Two more podiums followed in [[1985 Dutch Grand Prix|the Netherlands]] and [[1985 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], before Senna added his second victory, again in wet conditions, at the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps]] in Belgium.<ref>Hilton (2004), p 427</ref> Senna's relationship with De Angelis soured over the season, as both drivers demanded top driver status within Lotus and, after spending six years at the team, De Angelis departed for Brabham at the end of the year, convinced that Lotus were becoming focused around the Brazilian.<ref>Hilton (2004), p 163</ref>  Senna and De Angelis finished the season 4th and 5th respectively in the driver rankings, separated by five points in the quick but unreliable [[Lotus 97T|97T]]. In terms of qualifying, however, Senna had begun to establish himself as the quickest in the field: his tally of seven poles that season was far more than that of any of the other drivers (Renault's [[V6 engine|V6]] qualifying engines were reported to be producing over {{Convert|1000|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}).<ref>{{cite news|title=Mansell after Grand Prix mark|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4h1NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mDQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1280,421147&dq=ayrton+senna&hl=en|newspaper=Rome News-Tribune|date=3 November 1985|page=15B}}</ref>

;1986
[[File:Senna Brands 1986.jpg|thumb|Senna driving the [[Lotus 98T]] at the [[1986 British Grand Prix]].]]
De Angelis was replaced at Lotus by [[Scotland]]'s [[Johnny Dumfries]] after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time. Senna allegedly pushed for his former flat mate and fellow Brazilian [[Maurício Gugelmin]] to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor [[John Player & Sons]] (JPS) insisted on a British driver which led to the signing of Dumfries. Senna later admitted "It was bad, bad. Until then I had a good relationship with Derek."<ref>Hilton (2004), p. 170.</ref> Senna started the season well, coming second in [[1986 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] behind the [[Williams FW11|Williams]]-[[Honda F1|Honda]] of Nelson Piquet, and winning the [[1986 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]] by just 0.014s from Piquet's team mate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races.<ref>Hilton (2004), p 428</ref> However, poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season, saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet, as well as defending and eventual champion, Alain Prost. Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the [[1986 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]], thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna, Lotus 98T|url=http://www.thomsonstudio.com/node/62|publisher=Thomson Studio}}</ref>

After winning the [[1986 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]] - which took place one day after Brazil was eliminated from the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] - Senna asked a trackside supporter for the [[Brazilian flag]] and he drove one lap waving it. Thereafter, he repeated this ritual every time he won a race.<ref name=asenna /> Senna also had a brief foray into rallying where he tried out a [[Vauxhall Nova]], a [[Austin Metro|MG Metro 6R4]], a [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]] and a [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] on a stretch of land closed to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrc.com/news/features-archive/senna-%A1piloto-de-rallye/?fid=14986 |title=Senna: The rally driver!|publisher=wrc.com|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>

[[Team Lotus]] had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new team-mate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, [[Satoru Nakajima]].

===McLaren (1988–1993)===

====1988====
[[File:Senna 1988.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Senna won his first world title in {{F1|1988}} driving that season's dominant [[McLaren MP4/4]].]]
In 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team.<ref name="prostfan.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.prostfan.com/senna2.htm |title=Ayrton Senna by Alain Prost |publisher=prostfan.com |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years.<ref>Hughes and Arron (2003), p. 340.</ref> However, the experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[WilliamsF1|Williams]], [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], Lotus, and [[March Engineering|March]].

One notable incident of the year was at the [[1988 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], where Senna outqualified Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the race before crashing on lap 67.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGowan|first=Tom|title=The fast and the furious: Ayrton Senna's greatest F1 moments|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/motorsport/05/06/motorsport.f1.senna.greatest/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> Instead of returning to the pit lane, Senna went back to his apartment and did not contact the team until he walked into the pit garage as they were packing up later that night. As the television cameras had not captured his crash, team boss [[Ron Dennis]] did not know what had caused his DNF until then, though Prost speculated that judging from the tyre marks, it appeared as though Senna had clipped the inside barrier at Portiers, which pitched him into the outside guard rail. At the [[1988 Portuguese Grand Prix]], Prost made a slightly faster start than Senna, but the Brazilian dived into the first corner ahead. Prost responded and went to pass Senna at the end of the first lap. Senna swerved to block Prost, forcing the Frenchman to nearly run into the pit wall at {{convert|290|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Prost kept his foot down and soon edged Senna into the first corner and started pulling away. Though Prost was angered by Senna's manoeuvre, the Brazilian got away with a warning from the FIA. At the postrace team debrief, Prost voiced his anger at the move which prompted Senna to apologize to Prost for the incident. Ultimately, the pair won 15 of 16 races in the [[McLaren MP4/4]] in 1988 with Senna coming out on top, winning his first Formula One world championship title by taking eight wins to Prost's seven. Prost scored more points over the season, but had to drop three second places as only the 11 best scores counted.<ref>Bruce Jones, ed. ''50 Years of the Formula One World Championship'' (Carlton, 1999). pp. 221–222.</ref>

However, the biggest incident of the year happened at the [[1988 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]. With two laps remaining, Senna held a five-second lead over the [[Ferrari F1/87#F1/87/88C|Ferrari]]s of [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Michele Alboreto]], who were closing in on the [[McLaren MP4/4|McLaren]] (Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo Chicane, Senna closed on the [[Williams FW12|Williams]] of [[Jean-Louis Schlesser]] (standing in for a sick Nigel Mansell). Schlesser steered wide, attempting to give Senna room to lap him, losing then regaining control to avoid going into the sand trap. Unfortunately, Senna did not give the Williams room and took his normal racing line. Subsequently, Senna's McLaren was T-boned and ended up beached on a curb with broken rear suspension. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] would go on to an emotional 1-2 finish, the first in an [[Italian Grand Prix]] since the death of the team's founder [[Enzo Ferrari]]. This would prove to be the only race McLaren did not win in 1988.

During the season, Senna rewrote the record books. His eight wins beat the old record of seven jointly held by [[Jim Clark]] ({{f1|1963}}) and Prost (1984). His 13 pole positions also beat the record of nine held by Nelson Piquet (1984).

====1989====
[[File:Mclaren mp4 5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Senna driving the [[McLaren MP4/5]] in {{F1|1989}}.]]
The following year, the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it.<ref>Christopher Hilton, ''Ayrton Senna: The Whole Story'' (Haynes, 2004)</ref> Tension and mistrust between the two drivers increased when Senna overtook Prost at the restart of the [[1989 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], a move which Prost claimed violated a prerace agreement (Senna denied the existence of any agreement, though Prost's story was backed up by John Hogan of the team's major sponsor, [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]]). Senna took an early lead in the championship with victories in San Marino, [[1989 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], and [[1989 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]]. Senna also achieved the feat of leading every lap of those races which was not equalled until [[Sebastian Vettel]] in {{f1|2012}}.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tremayne|first=David|title=Sebastian Vettel wins Ayrton Senna-style to extend title advantage|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/sebastian-vettel-wins-ayrton-sennastyle-to-extend-title-advantage-8229982.html|publisher=The Independent|date=29 October 2012|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London}}</ref> Senna also managed to win in [[1989 German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[1989 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], and [[1989 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]]. However, unreliability in [[1989 United States Grand Prix|Phoenix]], [[1989 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], [[1989 French Grand Prix|France]], [[1989 British Grand Prix|Britain]], and [[1989 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], together with collisions in [[1989 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] and [[1989 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], swung the title in Prost's favour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame – Ayrton Senna 1989–1994|url=http://marshallgp.com/2011/10/18/hall-of-fame-ayrton-senna-1989-1994/|publisher=Marshall GP|accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref>

Prost took the 1989 world title after a collision with Senna at the [[Suzuka Circuit]] in Japan, [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|the penultimate race of the season]], which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the [[gurney flap]] from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna.<ref>{{cite web|title=Senna Journalists Special - Maurice Hamilton's commentary|url=http://www1.skysports.com/f1/news/22058/9291619/the-world-saw-him-as-a-mclaren-man-maurice-hamilton-on-his-new-senna-book|publisher=SpySportsF1|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners- a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] of [[Alessandro Nannini]] and went on to claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which was not part of the track.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19891023&id=G1pPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IZADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6594,2083754|title=Drama in Suzuka: Senna disqualified, Prost 'wins' world title|newspaper=New Straits Times|page=28}}</ref><ref>Jones, ed.

Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00018.html |title=F1 – Grandprix.com &gt; Features &gt; News Feature &gt; McLaren versus Jean-Marie Balestre |publisher=Grandprix.com |date=1 December 1989 |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place.

====1990====
[[File:McLaren MP4-5B 2009 Japan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[McLaren MP4/5B]] raced by Senna in {{F1|1990}}.]]
In 1990, Senna took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second places, and three thirds. With Prost gone to Ferrari, he also had a new team mate in Austrian driver Gerhard Berger. Among his victories were the opening round in [[1990 United States Grand Prix|Phoenix]], in which he diced for the lead for several laps with a then-unknown [[Jean Alesi]] before coming out on top, and in [[1990 German Grand Prix|Germany]], where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win. As the season reached its final quarter, however, Alain Prost in his Ferrari rose to the challenge with five wins, including a crucial victory in [[1990 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] where he and team mate [[Nigel Mansell]] finished 1–2 for the Scuderia. Senna had gone out with a damaged radiator, and the gap between Senna and Prost was now reduced to 9 points with two races remaining.<ref>{{cite web|title=1990 – Senna's Revenge|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/f1-information/seasons/1990-formula-one-season-history-sennas-revenge/|publisher=F1 Fanatic}}</ref>

At the penultimate round of the championship in [[1990 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack. After qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton,<ref>{{cite web|title=Senna Journalists Special |url=http://www1.skysports.com/f1/news/22058/9291619/the-world-saw-him-as-a-mclaren-man-maurice-hamilton-on-his-new-senna-book|publisher=SpySportsF1|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 270&nbsp;km/h (170&nbsp;mph) and spun out of the race, making Senna world champion.<ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 106–107.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prostfan.com/senna2.htm |title=Ayrton Senna at Suzuka revisited |publisher=Motorsport magazine |accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>

Following the second championship-deciding collision in two years, [[Jackie Stewart]] interviewed Senna at the [[1990 Australian Grand Prix]] (where Senna won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble forced him to slide off into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which Senna had been involved over the last few years, stating that Senna had made more contact with other cars and drivers in the last four years than all the champions before him. An angry Senna questioned how someone like Stewart, himself a triple world champion, could ask questions like he did, knowing the pressure under which drivers raced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgSe1CUa3SA |title=Ayrton Senna's Famous interview with Jackie Stewart |publisher=YouTube |date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> Senna later told Stewart he would not talk to him again.

A year later, after taking his third world championship, Senna explained to the press his actions of the previous year in Suzuka. He maintained that prior to qualifying fastest, he had sought and received assurances from race officials that pole position would be changed to the left, clean side of the track (where the racing line was), only to find this decision reversed by [[Jean-Marie Balestre]] after he had taken pole.<ref>Menard and Vassal(2003), p. 107.</ref> Senna said that he was not going to accept what he saw as unfair decision-making by Balestre, including his 1989 disqualification and the incorrect pole position in 1990 (though some in the F1 paddock noted that the pole position at Suzuka was actually on the same side of the track it had been since F1 returned to Japan in 1987, and many privately wondered why Senna was suddenly making a fuss about it, considering he had been on pole there in both 1988 and 1989, when he was also fighting Prost for the championship).<ref>"Senna blows his top at Suzuka," printed from http://www.autosport.com on 30 May 2007</ref> Senna stated that no matter what happened, he would not yield the corner and that Prost taking his normal racing line would result in an accident. Prost would later go on record slamming Senna's actions as "disgusting", saying that he seriously considered retiring from the sport after that incident.<ref name="prostfan.com"/>

====1991====
[[File:Ayrton Senna McLaren MP4-6 1991 United States.jpg|thumb|Senna won the [[1991 United States Grand Prix]] in his [[McLaren MP4/6]].]]
In {{f1|1991}}, Senna became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the likes of which littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor. In preseason testing, Senna made public misgivings about the car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the engine was not as powerful as the prior year's V10.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Codling |first1=Stuart|last2=Mann|first2=James|last3=Windsor|first3=Peter|last4=Murray|first4=Gordon|title=Art of the Formula 1 Race Car |authorlink= |publisher=Motorbooks |location= |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-7603-3731-8 |pages= |page=177 |accessdate=7 November 2012 |url=}}</ref> Senna won the first four races as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge. Before the [[1991 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]], Senna was injured in a jet-skiing accident near São Paulo for which he required stitches on the back of his head. During qualifying for that Grand Prix, he attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over the car after crashing into a tyre barrier.<ref>{{cite news|title=Senna returns to the front of the pack|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vYJUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5472,2118430&dq=ayrton+senna+mexico&hl=en|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=6 July 1991|page=47}}</ref> At the [[1991 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] at Silverstone, Senna's car had come to a halt on the final lap, but he was not left stranded out on the circuit, as race-winner Mansell pulled over on his parade lap and allowed the Brazilian to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. During the [[1991 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320&nbsp;km/h (200&nbsp;mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.

Though Senna's consistency, the car's competitiveness and the Williams's unreliability at the beginning of the season gave him an early advantage, Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development program and demanded further improvements to the car before it was too late. These modifications enabled him to make a late-season push, and he managed to win three more races to secure the championship, which was settled for good in [[1991 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] (yet again) when Mansell (who needed to win), went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams-Renault into the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Gerhard Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for his support over the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o_ROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5769,2993516&dq=ayrton+senna&hl=en|title=Senna gives up win for driver's title|newspaper=Boca Raton News|date=21 October 1991|page=11}}</ref> Senna was planning to move to the Williams team for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, [[Nobuhiko Kawamoto]], personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did out of a sense of loyalty.<ref>Ernesto Rodrigues, ''Ayrton: The Hero Revealed'' (1994)</ref>

That year, as had been the case in 1988 and 1990, Senna won the prestigious [[Autosport Awards|"International Racing Driver Award"]] granted by British magazine ''[[Autosport]]'' annually. The award was presented by [[Stirling Moss]] and Senna was interviewed on stage by Formula 1 commentator, [[Murray Walker]]. During the interview, Senna confirmed that at the [[Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA) gala dinner in [[Paris]] the day before, under the auspices of Jackie Stewart, Senna had indeed gifted one of his helmets to his renowned foe, Jean-Marie Balestre, because of the sincere atmosphere that presented itself.<ref>{{cite web|title=EXCLUSIVE: Watch Ayrton Senna at the 1991 AUTOSPORT Awards |url=http://plus.autosport.com/free/feature/3941/exclusive-watch-ayrton-senna-at-the-1991-autosport-awards/|publisher=[[Autosport]]|date=31 October 2011|accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref>

====1992====
[[File:Ayrton Senna 1992 Monaco.jpg|thumb|Senna won the [[1992 Monaco Grand Prix]] in his [[McLaren MP4/7A]].]]
In 1992, Senna's determination to win manifested itself in dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering [[Williams FW14|FW14B]] car.<ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 129–130.</ref> McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting the new model running (it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) and in addition to lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit.<ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 128–129.</ref> During practice for the second race of the season in [[1992 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]] on a circuit Senna was heavily critical of, his car hit a bump that caused a loss of downforce and hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. He had to be extricated from the car by circuit doctors; although he raced the next day, albeit retiring from the race due to gearbox failure. Senna scored wins in [[1992 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], [[1992 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], and [[1992 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] that year. During qualifying for the [[1992 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], French driver [[Érik Comas]] crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. He got out of his car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman, disregarding his own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. He later went to visit Comas in the hospital. His actions won universal praise from those in Formula One and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image. Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and [[Riccardo Patrese]], and Benetton's [[Michael Schumacher]].<ref>Jones (1999), pp. 253, 257.</ref><ref>Collings and Edworthy (2002), pp. 244–247.</ref>

Senna's relationship with Schumacher had deteriorated throughout {{f1|1992}}. At the [[1992 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]], Schumacher accused Senna of 'playing around' while attempting to overtake Senna, who had a problem with his engine. At the [[1992 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]], Schumacher collided with Senna, resulting in Senna's retirement. Senna later confronted Schumacher, who admitted responsibility for the accident. At a test session for the [[1992 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], Senna and Schumacher had a confrontation in the pits, with Senna grabbing Schumacher by the collar and accusing him of endangering him by blocking him on the track.<ref>{{cite news|title=Motor Racing: Testy times for Senna and Schumacher|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-testy-times-for-senna-and-schumacher-1533774.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=17 July 1992|accessdate=14 October 2012|location=London}}</ref>

Questions about Senna's intentions for the upcoming {{f1|1993}} season lingered throughout 1992, as he did not have a contract with any team by the end of that year. Ferrari had offered him a contract which Senna discussed with [[Niki Lauda]], but decided to decline the offer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferrari fail in attempt to recurit Senna|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=21 August 1992|page=45}}</ref> He felt the McLaren cars were becoming less competitive than in previous years, especially given Honda's decision to abandon the sport at the end of 1992 and McLaren's lack of active suspension relating to rival Williams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1blog.com/f1-biography/f1-biography-senna-gets-penske-test/|title=F1 Biography: Senna Gets Penske Test|publisher=f1b|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref>

Given this scenario, Senna secured an [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] testing session with the support of conpatriot and [[Team Penske|Penske]] driver, [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]. In December 1992, in fact, Senna visited [[Firebird International Raceway]] in [[Chandler, Arizona]],<ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 132.</ref> to test a 1992 [[Penske PC-20|Penske PC-21]] racer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ayrtonsenna.com.br/en/historias/dentro-das-pistas/provas-especiais/o-teste-com-a-penske-na-formula-indy/|title=Penske test in Indy|publisher=Ayrton Senna Official|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> Unlike the more advanced F1 cars, this IndyCar was powered by a turbo [[Chevrolet]]-[[Ilmor]] V8, had a traditional transmission with clutch pedal and iron brakes, and was markedly heavier due to its bigger physical size in comparison to a smaller Formula One car. To familiarise himself, Senna initially ran 14 relatively slow laps before completing a further 10 laps on the same tyres and setting a best time of 49.09 seconds. By comparison, Fittipaldi had set a best time of 49.70 seconds, which he later improved to 48.5 seconds, only by using the new 1993 [[Penske PC-22]] at his disposal during this test session.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fagnan|first=René|url=http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/penske-engineer-recalls-the-day-ayrton-senna-drove-an-indy-car?artid=147013|title=Penske engineer recalls the day Ayrton Senna drove an Indy Car|publisher=Auto123.com|date=27 August 2012|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref>

====1993====
[[File:Senna 1993 European GP.jpg|thumb|Senna won the [[1993 European Grand Prix]] in changing conditions, in what many considered one of the best drives of his career.]]
For {{f1|1993}}, attempts by McLaren boss [[Ron Dennis]] to secure a supply of the dominant Renault V10 engines failed.<ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 130.</ref> Similarly, Senna's offers to drive for [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]] for free also failed, given that Alain Prost (who was returning to the sport after a sabbatical year) succeeded in obtaining the inclusion of a clause in his contract with Williams vetoing Senna from joining as a team mate. Faced with this, during a press conference at the season-opening test session at the [[Estoril Circuit]] in [[Portugal]], an infuriated Senna called Prost a coward, leading to some commentators stating that what Prost had done was no different from Senna vetoeing Derek Warwick from joining Lotus in 1986.<ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 129–132.</ref><ref>Collings and Edworthy (2002), p. 239, 250.</ref>

By this time, McLaren was forced to take a customer supply of [[Cosworth#HB|Ford]] V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]].<ref>"Constructors: McLaren International", GP Encyclopedia, printed from http://www.grandprix.com on 30 May 2007.</ref> McLaren hoped to make up for the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system - though the system itself proved difficult at times, especially for new team mate [[Michael Andretti]].<ref name="autogenerated1">"History of McLaren: Time Line – the 1990s." printed from http://www.mclaren.com on 30 May 2007.</ref> With this plan, Dennis finally persuaded Senna to stay with McLaren. The Brazilian, however, agreed to do so only for the first race in [[1993 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]], where he would assess whether McLaren's equipment was competitive enough for him to put in a good season. After driving McLaren's 1993 car, the [[McLaren MP4/8]], Senna concluded that the new car had a surprising potential, albeit with a Ford V8 engine down on power relative to Prost's Renault V10.<ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 133.</ref> Senna thus extended his deal with McLaren on a race-by-race basis instead of a full-year contract, ending up staying for the whole of 1993 in any event.<ref>Collings and Edworthy (2002), p. 250.</ref> Reportedly, this engagement was on a $1 million per race basis<ref>{{cite web|title=Fangio: all-time great and gentleman|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/fangio-alltime-great-and-gentleman-1592066.html|publisher=The Independent|date=18 July 1995}}</ref> and, despite midseason testing with a [[Lamborghini V12]] proved encouraging, with McLaren then signing an engine supply deal with [[Peugeot]] for the {{f1|1994}} season, it all proved insufficient to continue to retain Senna past 1993.

In the opening race in South Africa, Senna finished in second place after surviving a collision with Schumacher.<ref>"Grand Prix Results: South African GP, 1993", GP Encyclopedia, printed from http://www.grandprix.com on 30 May 2007.</ref> Senna won in changing conditions in [[1993 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] and [[1993 European Grand Prix|Donington]].

He was fifth at the first corner and led the race at the end of the first lap going on to lap all but second place in a race where up to seven pit stops were required by some drivers for rain or [[slick tyres]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/results/season/1993/86/|title=1993 European Grand Prix|publisher=Formula 1|accessdate=16 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606050843/http://www.formula1.com/results/season/1993/86/| archivedate= 6 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 134.</ref> Senna then scored a second-place finish in [[1993 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and a record-breaking sixth win at [[1993 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]].<ref>Ian Thomsen, "Senna, Hill and Monaco: Roaring Through the Ghost of a Winner Past", ''International Herald Tribune'', Monday, 24 May 1993; printed from http://www.iht.com on 28 May 2007.</ref> After Monaco, the sixth race of the season, Senna unexpectedly led the championship from Prost in the Williams-Renault.<ref>Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 134–135.</ref> As the season progressed, Alain Prost and [[Damon Hill]] asserted the superiority of their [[Williams FW15C|Williams-Renault cars]], while Senna suffered mechanical failures in [[1993 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]], [[1993 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], [[1993 British Grand Prix|Britain]], [[1993 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], and [[1993 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]]. Senna won the penultimate race of the season in [[1993 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], which was marked by an incident involving [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan's]] rookie [[Eddie Irvine]], twice unlapping himself against Senna. Immediately after the race, Senna attended at Jordan's garage and, following a lengthy and heated discussion, punched the Irishman in the face.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ayrton-senna.com/senna/suzuka.html |title=Ayrton Senna Suzuka 1993 |publisher=ayrton-senna.com |accessdate=19 March 2011}}</ref>

The season concluded in [[1993 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], with what would be Senna's 41st and last F1 career win, as well as the last win for an active-suspension F1 car (ironically, 1987 had the first victory for such cars also at the hands of Senna in Monaco). The win in Adelaide was an emotional one due to Senna ending his successful career with McLaren and defeating his biggest rival, Prost, for the last time. Because of the Frenchman's imminent retirement from the sport, Senna surprised the F1 community by openly welcoming Prost on the top step of the podium, which many considered a sign of pacification between the duo. Overall, Senna finished the championship second to Prost.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>Collings and Edworthy (2002), pp. 251–253.</ref>

During [[Tina Turner]]'s after-race concert in [[Adelaide]], Senna surprised everyone, including Turner, when he appeared on-stage midway through the night. With the crowd cheering, Turner admitted she was a fan of the Brazilian and resang her hit "[[The Best (song)|The Best]]" as a tribute to Senna and his Australian Grand Prix win earlier in the day.

===Williams (1994)===
[[File:Williams FW16B and FW15C Donington Grand Prix Collection.jpg|thumb|[[Damon Hill]]'s 1994 [[Williams FW16]] an earlier version of which, bearing race number 2, was the last car raced by Senna.]]
For 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team given the retirement of Prost<ref name=senna94>{{cite web|last=Lopes|first=Rafael|last2=Murgel|first2=Leonardo|last3=Grünwald|first3=Alexander|title=Ayrton Senna: o período na Williams|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/Esportes/Noticias/0,,MUL1105495-17078,00-AYRTON+SENNA+O+PERIODO+NA+WILLIAMS.html|publisher=Globo|date=1 May 2009|accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref> and was reportedly paid a $20 million salary.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=The Last Ride|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1005161/index.htm|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=9 May 1994|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> With Prost's retirement at the end of 1993, and Williams' consequential lack of a defending World Champion carrying race number 1 for a second year running, Senna would race in 1994 with number 2 and teammate Damon Hill would race with number 0 for the second year in a row.

Rule changes for 1994 had banned active suspension, traction control, and ABS. During preseason testing, the new [[Williams FW16]] car exhibited none of the superiority of the [[Williams FW15C|FW15C]] and [[Williams FW14B|FW14B]] cars that preceded it, and Senna found himself in close running with the [[Benetton B194]] of Schumacher. Senna expressed his discomfort with the handling of his car, stating, "I have a very negative feeling about driving the car and driving it on the limit and so on&nbsp;... Some of that is down to the lack of electronic change. Also, the car has its own characteristics which I'm not fully confident in yet."<ref>Autosport 24 January 1994 Vol 134 No. 4 p.28</ref> Senna further added, "It's going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna 1960–1994: In his own words|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/espn/sport/story/13315.html#|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref>

The first race of the season was at Interlagos in [[1994 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], where Senna took pole position. He took an early lead, but Schumacher's Benetton was never far behind. Schumacher took the race lead for good after passing Senna in the pits. While trying for a win, he pushed too hard and spun the car coming out of Junção on lap 56, stalling it and retiring from the race.<ref name=senna94 /> The second race was the inaugural [[1994 Pacific Grand Prix|Pacific Grand Prix]] at Aida, where Senna again placed the car on the pole. However, after being beaten to the first corner by second-qualifier Schumacher, he was hit from behind in the first corner by [[Mika Häkkinen]] and his race came to a definitive end when, while spinning backwards into the first corner's gravel trap, the Ferrari driven by [[Nicola Larini]] T-boned the Williams. Both drivers retired with front-suspension damage. Hill also retired with transmission problems, while Schumacher took the victory again.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pacific GP, 1994 Race Report|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr550.html|publisher=grandprix.com}}</ref>

It was Senna's worst start to a Formula One season, failing to finish or score points in the first two races, despite taking pole position both times. Schumacher was leading Senna in the drivers' championship by 20 points.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/photo_galleries/3636399.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Senna retrospective | date=21 April 2004 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> In occasion of the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, Ferrari president [[Luca Cordero di Montezemolo]] revealed that, on 27 April 1994, he had held discussions at his home in Bologna with Senna about a future Ferrari engagement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna wanted to sign for Ferrari before his tragic death at Imola, reveals Luca di Montezemolo|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/10800400/Ayrton-Senna-wanted-to-sign-for-Ferrari-before-his-tragic-death-at-Imola-reveals-Luca-di-Montezemolo.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

====Season controversies and end====
The 1994 season was the subject of sweeping rule changes, most notably banning the use of electronic "driver aids" such as active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control. From the start, suspicion of foul play mainly involving the Benetton team was said to have troubled Senna. For example, instead of returning to the pit area after his first lap retirement at the Pacific Grand Prix, Senna opted to stand near the first corner and watch the cars complete the race to see if he could detect whether any now banned traction control system was being used.<ref name=grandprix-pacific94>{{cite web | title = Grand Prix Results: Pacific GP, 1994 | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr550.html | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | accessdate = 2008-08-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080905180229/http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr550.html| archivedate= 5 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He returned to the Williams box after the race suspicious that the Benetton car was illegal.<ref name=saward>{{cite web | title = Globetrotter: Rocking the boat | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gt/gt00044.html | first = Joe | last = Saward | authorlink = Joe Saward | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | date = 1994-08-11 | accessdate = 2008-08-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080929033558/http://www.grandprix.com/gt/gt00044.html| archivedate= 29 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Indeed, in an interview for the 20th anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death, his then team mate, Damon Hill, revealed that Senna had "concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine" with "special tweak" giving Benetton an advantage.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Last Teammate (1994 San Marino Grand Prix's 20th Anniversary documentary) @ 8'25"|url=http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/f1/9293944/|publisher=SkySportsF1|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|title=The Last Teammate (1994 San Marino Grand Prix's 20th Anniversary documentary) @ 8'25"|url=http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/f1/9293944/|publisher=SkySportsF1|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>

The season ended at the [[1994 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] in Adelaide, where the first-corner chicane at the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] was renamed the "Senna Chicane". Schumacher went on to win the driver's world championship title controversially after a collision that forced his retirement and that of his rival, and Senna teammate, Damon Hill. At the official FIA conference after the race, the German dedicated his title to Senna.<ref>{{cite video|title=1994 Australian Grand Prix Press Conference with Michael Schumacher|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVX-kgy6oCQ|publisher=FIA|date=13 November 1994|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>

== Death ==
{{Main|Death of Ayrton Senna|1994 San Marino Grand Prix}}

Senna died aged 34 after succumbing to fatal injuries sustained during his final race at the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], on 1 May 1994.

===Racing crash===
The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the "[[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]]" circuit located in Imola, Italy, between Thursday, 28 April, and Sunday, 1 May 1994. Senna stayed in room no. 200 at the Hotel Castello in Castel San Pietro Terme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hotel Castello Suite 200, where Senna stayed in his last night|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/photo/main-gallery/hotel-castello-suite-200-where-ayrton-senna-stayed-in-his-last-night-1692458/|publisher=motorsport.com}}</ref>

The European leg of the F1 season, starting at Imola, was traditionally considered the beginning of the yearly competition. Senna, who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna's interview by Murray Walker, 28 May 1994|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iErwQ9Y0q-Y}}</ref> Williams brought modified FW16s to Imola in an attempt to improve the car's handling.

On Friday, Senna placed the car on the pole for a then-record 65th and final time, but he was upset by events unfolding that race weekend. Senna complained about the FW16's handling and reported that the car's performance was generally worse after the engineers' latest adjustments.<ref>''Senna'' film (2010)</ref> During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and protégé [[Rubens Barrichello]] was involved in a serious accident when his Jordan became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence. Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event. Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness.<ref>Hilton (2004), p. 341</ref>

During Saturday qualifying, Austrian rookie [[Roland Ratzenberger]] was killed after the front wing of his Simtek-Ford broke entering the {{convert|310|km/h|mph|adj=on|abbr=on}} Villeneuve corner, sending the car into a concrete wall.<ref>{{cite news|title=The incredible journey of F1 legend Ayrton Senna is released in UK cinemas|url=http://duncanblog.dailymail.co.uk/2011/06/the-incredible-journey-of-f1-legend-ayrton-senna-is-released-in-uk-cinemas-.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=3 June 2011|location=London}}</ref> Senna immediately visited the accident scene and medical centre. There he was met by FIA Medical Chief Professor [[Sid Watkins]], who suggested to a tearful Senna to retire from racing and go [[fishing]] (a hobby they both shared), to which Senna replied that he could not stop racing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayrton, Prof & Me|url=http://www.institutequarterly.com/IQ-ISSUE02-article-03.html|publisher=Institute Quarterly}}</ref> Senna was later called in front of the stewards for commandeering an official car and climbing the medical centre fence, and a row ensued, although Senna was not punished.<ref name=hours>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Dylan|title=The last 96 hours of Ayrton Senna|url=http://8w.forix.com/senna1994.html|publisher=8wforix|date=22 April 2011|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>

Senna spent his final morning on the Sunday talking to former team mate and rival Alain Prost to discuss the re-establishment of the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]], with the aim of improving safety in Formula One. Prost had retired from the sport at the end of the 1993 season, and was now a media presenter. As the most senior driver in competition, Senna offered to take the role of leader, starting from the next race in Monaco. During the drivers' briefing, concerns had been raised about the mainly promotional use of a Porsche 911 lead car for the warm-up lap, with organizers agreeing to abandon the practice.<ref name="hours" /> It is said that [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] Chief Engineer [[Patrick Head]] had pranked Senna on the grid by advising him that the lead car would not be excluded from the warm-up lap after all.

At the start of the Grand Prix, Senna retained the lead from Schumacher, but proceedings soon became interrupted by a startline accident. [[JJ Lehto]]'s Benetton-Ford had stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of [[Pedro Lamy]]. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the [[Opel Vectra]] medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. The Vectra's slow pace was later questioned because of the consequential drop in tyre pressures on the Formula One cars. Senna had pulled alongside the Vectra and gestured to the driver, [[Max Angelelli]], to increase his speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enterf1.com/news/049-the-bite-point.asp |title=History of the F1 Safety Car |publisher=enterF1.com |date=21 April 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace with the third-quickest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.

[[File:Senna accident.jpg|thumb|left|Senna in his damaged [[Williams FW16]] immediately after crashing at the Tamburello corner of the Imola circuit during the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]].]]
As Senna rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around {{convert|307|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around {{convert|233|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag was shown as a consequence of the accident.

Within two minutes of crashing, Senna was extracted from his race car by Professor Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. Initial treatment took place by the side of the car, with Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss (around 4.5 l). Because of Senna's poor neurological condition, Professor Watkins performed an on-site [[tracheotomy]] and requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Dr Gordini.

At 18:40, the head of the hospital's emergency department, Dr Fiandri<ref>{{cite web|last=Lorenzini|first=Tommaso|url=http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/sfoglio/11599274/Ayrton-Senna--il-racconto-della.html|title=Ayrton Senna, il racconto della dottoressa: "Così mi morì in braccio"|publisher=Libero Quotidiano|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> made the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17, which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped working.<ref name="hours" /> Professor Watkins later said that as soon as he saw Senna's fully dilated pupils, he knew that his [[brainstem]] was inactive and that he would not survive.<ref name=asenna />

The right-front wheel and [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] are believed to have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna on the right side of his helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. In addition, a piece of the upright assembly, most likely a [[tie rod]], penetrated the helmet visor, which was a new, thinner version, above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal [[basilar skull fracture|skull fractures]], [[traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]] and a ruptured [[Superficial temporal artery|temporal artery]].<ref>Hilton (1994), p. 386</ref>

As later revealed, when the medical staff examined Senna, a furled [[Austrian flag]] was found in his car—a flag that he had intended to raise in honour of Ratzenberger after the race.<ref>{{cite news|first = Andrew|last = Longer|title = Ayrton Senna: The Last Hours|url = http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F9242ED73BC537B&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=63FF7C9CECF24CA8828B27BFD2B2546B|publisher=The Times|page=30|date=31 October 1994|quote=Back at the track, in the shattered remains of Senna's car, they discovered a furled Austrian flag Senna had intended to dedicate his 42nd grand prix victory to Ratzenberger's memory.}}</ref> Photographs of Senna being treated on the track by emergency medical personnel were taken by Senna's friend and ''Autosprint'''s picture editor, Angelo Orsi. Out of respect, those photographs have never been made public.<ref name="hours" />

On 27 April 2014, as part of celebrating Senna on the 20th anniversary of his death, a three-journalist panel composed of Murray Walker, Maurice Hamilton, and David Tremayne interviewed by SkySportF1's Simon Lazenby concurred that, at [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|his final F1 grand prix race]], Senna was under extreme pressure due to: 
* the serious crash of his young compatriot, [[Rubens Barrichello]] during Friday practice, whom Senna visited in hospital;
* the death of F1 rookie Roland Ratzenberger during Saturday qualifying;
* being 20 points behind in the [[1994 Formula One season|Drivers' Championship]];
* suspicion of the rival [[Benetton B194]] car using an illegal traction control system;
* the poor performance of his [[Williams FW16]];
* family disapproval of his then-girlfriend, [[Adriane Galisteu]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Senna - Journalist Special|url = http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/f1/9294240/the-f1-show-senna-tribute|publisher=SkySportF1|date=27 April 2014}}</ref>

Senna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Brazilian government declared three days of national mourning. The [[Italian Air Force]] offered to fly the coffin back to Brazil, but the Senna family wished that it return home in a Brazilian plane.  Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, Senna's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country in the passenger cabin of a [[VARIG]] [[McDonnell-Douglas MD-11]] airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends.  The plane was escorted by fighter jets into [[São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport]] on Thursday, 5 May 1994, where it was met by São Paulo's mayor, [[Paulo Maluf]], and state governor, Luís Antônio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers from the Policia da Aeronautical to a [[fire engine]], where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin on the 20-mile journey into the city.  Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.<ref>Rubython (2004), p. 422</ref>

An estimated three million people flocked to the streets of Senna's hometown of São Paulo to offer him their salute. This is widely accepted as the largest recorded gathering of mourners in modern times.<ref>{{cite news|last=Margolis|first=Mac|title=Death of Speeding Star Pains a Nation Looking for Heroes : Ayrton Senna's fatal crash shattered Brazil, fueling anger and sadness|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=10 May 1994}}</ref> Over 200,000 people filed past as his body lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in [[Ibirapuera Park]].  After the public viewing, a [[21-gun salute]] was fired by the 2nd Artillery Brigade and seven [[Brazilian Air Force]] jets flew in a diamond formation as the funeral procession made its way to [[Cemiterio do Morumbi|Morumbi Cemetery]].  Many prominent motor-racing figures attended Senna's state funeral, such as team managers [[Ken Tyrrell]], Peter Collins, Ron Dennis, and Frank Williams, and driver Jackie Stewart.

A testament to the adulation he inspired among fans worldwide was the scene at the Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where the McLaren cars were typically displayed after each race. Upon his death, so many floral tributes were received, they overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ja:アイルトン・セナの去った夜|url=http://www.honda.co.jp/collection-hall/episodes_old/motor/mp44/index.html|language=Japanese}}</ref> This was despite the fact Senna no longer drove for McLaren and that McLaren in the preceding seasons did not use Honda power.

===Italian prosecution===
Italian law requires that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities that led to the fatality, suspended fortwith. Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with [[manslaughter]]. The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4587195.stm|work=BBC News|title=Top designers acquitted on Senna| date=27 May 2005}}</ref> This prosecution culminated with verdict no. 15050 handed down by the Italian [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassatio]] on 13 April 2007, which stated: "It has been determined that the accident was caused by a  [[steering column]] failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on [[Patrick Head]], culpable of omitted control". Head, however, was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.<ref>Gazzetta dello Sport: Senna, Head Responsabile http://www.gazzetta.it/Motori/Formula1/Primo_Piano/2007/04_Aprile/13/senna.shtml</ref>

The criminal charges focused on the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed causing the accident and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his [[Williams FW16|FW16]]'s steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and [[Adrian Newey]] satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as there was insufficient time to instead manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.

[[File:Ayrton Senna with a Dog.jpg|thumb|Senna at home in his native Brazil.]]
Senna was a devout [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], once saying: "Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune. It doesn't mean that I'm immortal" (1989).<ref name="The Huffington Post">{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/manish-pandey/ayrton-senna_b_909096.html |title=Ayrton Senna: The Faith Of The Man Who Could Drive On Water |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=1 August 2011 |first=Manish |last=Pandey}}</ref> He often read the Bible on long flights from São Paulo to Europe.<ref name="Philip">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2323502/Spirit-of-Ayrton-Senna-is-Lewis-Hamiltons-spur.html|title=Spirit of Ayrton Senna is Lewis Hamilton's spur|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|first=Robert|last=Philip|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=27 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100713182200/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2323502/Spirit-of-Ayrton-Senna-is-Lewis-Hamiltons-spur.html| archivedate= 13 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/f1/news/story?id=4565293|title=Hamilton visits Senna's grave|publisher=ESPN |date=16 October 2009|accessdate=27 July 2010}}</ref> According to sister Viviane, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death after the events of the race weekend: "On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself."<ref name="The Huffington Post"/>

As his profile rose, Senna expressed concern over the poor in Brazil. After his death,  he was discovered to have quietly donated millions of his personal fortune<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebritynetworth.com/list/top-50-richest-athletes/ |title=Top 50 Richest Athletes |publisher=Celebrity Net Worth |date= |accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> (estimated at around $400 million) to help poor children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/45/ |title=The Official Formula 1 Website |publisher=Formula1.com |accessdate=24 June 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090609155545/http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/45/| archivedate= 9 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Shortly before his death, he created the framework for an organisation dedicated to Brazilian children, which later became the [[Instituto Ayrton Senna]] (IAS).<ref>{{cite news|last=Widdows |first=Rob |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/2750524/Instituto-Ayrton-Senna-Gone-but-not-forgotten.html |title=Instituto Ayrton Senna: Gone but not forgotten |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 February 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

Senna was often quoted as using driving as a means for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life: "The harder I push, the more I find within myself. I am always looking for the next step, a different world to go into, areas where I have not been before. It's lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing. I have experienced new sensations, and I want more. That is my excitement, my motivation."<ref>Collings and Edworthy (2002), p. 238.</ref>

Towards the end of his career, Senna became increasingly preoccupied with the dangers of his profession. On the morning of his death, he initiated the reformation of the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association|GPDA]] safety organisation, with which he had intended to work to improve the safety of his sport.<ref>{{cite news|title=The F1 FAQ|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/bel/faq.html|publisher=Atlas F1}}</ref>

In the late 1980s, to take advantage of the close relationship Honda had formed with Senna, the Japanese company asked him to help fine-tune the [[Honda NSX]]'s suspension setting during its final development stages. Test runs were conducted at various circuits, including five sessions with prototypes at the Suzuka Circuit where chief NSX engineer [[Shigeru Uehara]] and his team were present to gather Senna's direct input.<ref>{{cite news|title=Honda's NSX shows why Ayrton was the greatest|url=http://www.nsxprime.com/FAQ/Media/2002-09-01-sundaytimes.jpg|work=The Sunday Times|first=Andrew|last=Frankel|date=1 September 2002|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref> Senna found the prototype NSX initially lacked chassis stiffness to the level to which he was accustomed, so the final production version was further reinforced to his satisfaction.<ref>{{cite news|title=Honda NSX: Cult favourite resurrected|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/motoring/news/article.cfm?c_id=9&objectid=10773432|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=17 December 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref>

Senna reportedly had access to three of these cars: a black 1993 NSX in Brazil, which he ordered to his specifications, bearing license plate BSS-8888, which represents his initials for "Beco" – his childhood nickname – "Senna da Silva" and 8 to commemorate his first F1 championship in 1988; a red one with licence plate SX-25-59, which was loaned to him by Honda Portugal; a black one purchased by Antonio Carlos de Almeida Braga, who was a close personal friend, manager, and mentor of Ayrton Senna.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna|url=https://sennamcf.wordpress.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref>

Senna was also instrumental in bringing [[Audi]] cars into his native country, both as an import and manufacturing business.  Audi entered Brazil in 1994 via Senna's company, Senna Import, founded in 1993. Sales began in April that year, just a month before his untimely death. In 1999, [[Audi Senna]] was created as a joint venture of Audi with Senna Import.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audi.com.br/br/brand/pt/company/audi_no_brasil.html |title=Audi Brasil &gt; Companhia &gt; Audi no Brasil |publisher=Audi.com.br |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101006064625/http://www.audi.com.br/br/brand/pt/company/audi_no_brasil.html| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Aside from the black NSX mentioned above, Senna's other personal car in 1994 was a silver [[Audi S4#C4|Audi 100 S4]] Avant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/classificados/veiculos/ult1670u1406.shtml |title=Folha Online – Classificados – Veículos – Audi expõe S4 de Ayrton Senna no Salão do Automóvel – 20/10/2004 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=20 October 2004 |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Senna: aceleramos os carros do campeão|url=http://caranddriverbrasil.uol.com.br/carros/carros/especial/senna-aceleramos-os-carros-do-campeao/8013|publisher=Car and Driver (Portugal)|date=11 June 2014|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref>

Senna owned several properties, including an [[organic farming|organic]] farm in [[Tatuí]], Brazil (where he built a go-kart track in 1991), a beach house in [[Angra dos Reis]], Brazil, an apartment in [[São Paulo]], an apartment in [[Monaco]], and a house in [[Algarve]], Portugal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Europe House of the Day|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704828104576021633581862742.html|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 December 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110125063543/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704828104576021633581862742.html| archivedate= 25 January 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref> In 1994, the latter residence is where Senna let his last girlfriend, Adriane Galisteu, stay for the start of the European leg of the F1 season.

Senna was married to Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza from 1981 until 1982. Vasconcelos, whom he had known since childhood, had difficulty adapting to her husband's racing life in England. Vasconcelos later said: "I was his second passion. His first passion was racing...

One of the most extravagant claims involving Senna's past partners was made by Edilaine de Barros, a former model better known as Marcella Praddo. She alleged that that the couple dated from 1992 to 1994. Weeks after Senna's death, de Barros' child, Victoria, was born and claims that Senna was the father were soon made but abandoned following rejection of those claims by the Senna family. Years later, after joining a religious sect, the former model was convinced to sue against the estate of Senna. In 2000, DNA tests of hair and saliva samples given by Senna's parents conclusively proved that he was not the father of de Barros' child.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.autosport.com/news/atlasf1-report.php/id/2772/|title=Senna Cleared by DNA Tests in Patrimony Case|author=Atlas F1|publisher=Autosport.com|date=11 August 2000|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Senna_1.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of Ayrton Senna at the Parco delle Acque Minerali by the Tamburello corner of the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]] in [[Italy]].]]
Many safety improvements were made in the sport following Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths. These include improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher crash safety standards (such as larger sills along the driver cockpit) and major cuts to engine power. The Tamburello corner and other parts of the Imola circuit were altered for 1995. This was despite calls for action in 1989, after a serious high-speed crash in which Senna's friend, Gerhard Berger, suffered burns to his hand. No action took place after that crash because, following an inspection by Senna and Berger, they ended up siding with officials who had, for years, claimed that the wall could not be moved further back due to a river nearby.<ref>{{cite news|last=Alsop|first=Derick|title=Motor Racing: Hill confronts life on the track after Senna|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-hill-confronts-life-on-the-track-after-senna-after-the-double-tragedy-at-imola-it-is-back-to-the-wheel-derick-allsop-reports-from-monte-carlo-1435486.html|work=The Independent|date=12 May 1994|accessdate=16 August 2012|location=London}}</ref> Revised on-track medical procedures also saw personnel hold up curtains at crash sites, to prevent the public from viewing distressing images as had occurred on live television with Senna.

A few months before his death, Senna had discussed with his sister the foundation of a charitable organization, based on a desire to contribute to those less fortunate in a more organised and effective manner.  After his death, Viviane Senna set up the IAS in his honor, which has invested nearly US$80&nbsp;million over the last 12 years in social programs and actions in partnership with schools, government, [[Non governmental organization|NGOs]], and the private sector, aimed at offering children and teenagers from low-income backgrounds the skills and opportunities they need to develop their full potential as persons, citizens, and future professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://senna.globo.com/institutoayrtonsenna/ |title=Instituto Ayrton Senna |publisher=Senna.globo.com |accessdate=2 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101009155058/http://senna.globo.com/institutoayrtonsenna/| archivedate= 9 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The foundation is officially advised by [[Bernie Ecclestone]], Frank Williams, Alain Prost, and Gerhard Berger. The [[Senninha]] ("Little Senna") cartoon character, born in 1993/94, was another means by which Senna extended his role-model status in favour of Brazilian children.<ref>{{cite web|title=Senna's World:SENNINHA|url=http://www.sennaworld.com/senninha.html|publisher=Senna's World}}</ref>

[[File:Monum -Senna 05.JPG|thumb|right|A monument dedicated to Senna's Formula 1 racing, located at the entrance of the tunnel under [[Ibirapuera Park]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]In his home country of Brazil, the main freeway from the international airport to São Paulo and a tunnel along route to the heart of the city are named in his honour. Also, one of the most important freeways of Rio de Janeiro is named after Senna ("Avenida Ayrton Senna"). The main road in Senna's Portuguese resort at [[Quinta do Lago]], Algarve, was also dedicated to him, because his villa there was very near (but not on) this road. A portion of the [[Interlagos]] circuit in São Paulo is named the "Senna Esses Chicane" in his honor. In the English town of [[Reading, Berkshire]], where Senna lived for a short period of time, an avenue in the suburb of Tilehurst was named after him.<ref>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2095008_ayrton_senna_a_legend_but_not_in_the_garden ‘Ayrton Senna a legend... but not in the garden’] "Ayrton Senna Road, Tilehurst, Berkshire, RG41 4JQ"</ref>

In April 2000, Senna was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=International Motorsports Hall of Fame adds Andretti|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HDgfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0s8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2027,265093&dq=ayrton+senna+international+hall+of+fame&hl=en|newspaper=Herald-Journal|date=2 November 1999|page=D2}}</ref> That year,  the UK public also voted Senna's opening lap of the 1993 European Grand Prix, the 43rd in the list of the [[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest Sporting Moments]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest_sporting/results.html|title=100 Greatest sporting moments – results|work=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate= 28 August 2014}}</ref>

In 2004, a book called ''Ayrton: The Hero Revealed'' (original title: ''Ayrton: O Herói Revelado''<ref>written by Ernesto Rodrigues, [http://www.objetiva.com.br Editora Objetiva]</ref>) was published in Brazil for the 10th anniversary of his death. Senna remains a national hero in Brazil and his grave attracts more visitors than the graves of John F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley combined.<ref name="Philip"/>

In addition, to mark the 10th anniversary of Senna's death, on 21 April 2004, over 10,000 people attended a charity match in a football stadium near Imola. The game was organised by several devoted Italian and Canadian fans of Senna, bringing the Brazil team that won the 1994 World Cup to face the "Nazionale Piloti", an exhibition team composed exclusively of top race car drivers. Senna had been a part of the latter in 1985. Michael Schumacher, [[Jarno Trulli]], Rubens Barrichello, [[Fernando Alonso]], and many others faced the likes of [[Dunga]], [[Careca]], [[Cláudio Taffarel|Taffarel]], and several of the team that won the FIFA World Cup in the United States 10 years earlier. The match finished 5–5 and the money was donated to the IAS. Viviane Senna, the president of the IAS, was also involved in the kick-off of this match. That same weekend, Bernie Ecclestone revealed that he still believed Senna was and remained the best F1 driver he had ever seen.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

Since his death, Senna has been the subject of several songs (either wholly dedicated to him or simply referring to him) including by: Italian singer-songwriter [[Lucio Dalla]] (song titled "Ayrton"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfoglio.it/im-with-the-band/2014/04/27/il-mistico-e-la-belva-ayrton-senna-secondo-lucio-dalla___1-v-90063-blog_c350.htm|title=Il mistico e la belva.

Between 1996 and 1998, to pay tribute to Senna, the Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati produced three special "Senna" editions of their [[Ducati 916|916]] superbike. Ducati was at the time owned by Claudio Castiglioni, a personal friend of Senna who was an avid Ducati owner and endorsed the release of this 916 in March 1994. In 2002, under the presidency of Castiglioni, [[MV Agusta]] also released the special-edition [[MV Agusta F4 series#F4 750 Senna|F4 750 Senna]] motorbike followed by the [[MV Agusta F4 series#F4 Senna 1000|F4 Senna 1000]] in 2006.

[[File:Adelaide_Grand_Prix_Track_Senna_Chicane.jpeg|thumb|right|The "Senna Chicane" at the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]], [[South Australia]]]]

The organisers of the former Formula One Grand Prix street circuit in Adelaide, South Australia, renamed the first chicane the "Senna Chicane" in his honour in 1994. Other motorsports circuits have similarly named sections of their track after Senna, such as the [[Circuito de Jerez]] in Spain and the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] in Canada. A shortened version of the Adelaide circuit—which remains the site of Senna's last Formula One win—and the chicane remain in use for local motorsport events, and a commemorative concrete plaque installed in 1995 bearing Senna's signature and hand prints is also located there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/people/sport/display/50134-ayrton-senna|title=Ayrton Senna - Monument Australia|author=UBC Web Design|work=monumentaustralia.org.au}}</ref> The Adelaide circuit was said to be a favourite of Senna's, and he was reportedly unhappy about the upcoming shift of venue from Adelaide to Melbourne in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna Blog – A Tribute to Life|url=http://ayrton-senna.co.uk/blog/f1-legacy-ayrton-senna/|accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref> Also, a road is named after him in the Adelaide suburb of Wingfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Senna+Rd,+Wingfield+SA+5013,+Australia/@-34.8422568,138.5654026,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6ab0c80e57dc52af:0xc84137a51e7e8b89|title=Google Maps|work=Google Maps}}</ref>

==Helmet design==
[[File:AyrtonSennasFullFaceHelmet.jpg|thumb|upright|Senna's helmet bearing the colours of the [[Flag of Brazil|Brazilian national flag]].]]
In his karting days, Senna's helmet consisted of a plain white background with notable features absent. He experimented with several designs to satisfy him, such as a white, yellow, and green helmet,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rubens Barrichello shares an early helmet design for Ayrton Senna|url=http://www.anchorfan.com/image/rubens-barrichello-shares-an-early-helmet-design-for-ayrton-senna|publisher=Anchor Fan|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> before settling on a design by Sid Mosca that included a yellow background with a green stripe surrounding the upper visor and a light metallic blue stripe surrounding the lower visor (both stripes are delineated in the other stripe's color) that was first seen in 1979; Mosca also painted helmets for Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet.

According to Mosca, the blue and green stripes symbolised movement and aggression, while the overall yellow colour symbolised youth;<ref name=video /> the three colors were also identifiable with the [[Flag of Brazil]]. The helmet never had significant changes, apart from sponsorship. One such change was that Senna would occasionally alter the stripe from blue to black. The tone of yellow changed a number of times, while usually a rich sunburst yellow, in 1985 and 1986 in some races, he used a fluorescent neon yellow colour. In 1994, the helmet was a lighter, paler yellow to complement the blue and white of the Williams car. He used a number of helmet brands throughout his career. From 1977 to 1989, he used Bell (Star - '77 to '82, XFM-1 - '83 to '89), from 1990 to 1991 Honda's own Rheos brand, 1992 to 1993 he used Shoei (X-4) and for 1994 he returned to using Bell (M3 Kevlar).<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering Ayrton: That iconic helmet|url=http://richardsf1.com/2011/07/18/remembering-ayrton-that-iconic-helmet/|publisher=richardsf1|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> The helmet worn by Senna in the fatal race was returned to Bell in 2002 and was incinerated while family members watched.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morrison|first1=Mac|title=The Helmet|journal=[[Autoweek]]|date=28 April 2014|volume=64|issue=9|page=53}}</ref>

[[File:Bruno Senna demonstrating Lotus 97T 2010 Japan.jpg|thumb|upright|Bruno Senna's helmet design is an adaptation of his uncle's (seen here parading the 1985 Lotus 97T at the [[2010 Japanese Grand Prix]]).]]
His nephew [[Bruno Senna|Bruno]] wore a modified version of his helmet design (a yellow helmet with a green and blue stripe) during his Formula One career, but the stripes are shaped after an S rather than being straight, under the chin area it has a green stripe, and it has a blue rounded rectangle in the top area. Bruno sported a modified helmet design for the final three races of the 2011 season to honour the 20th anniversary of Ayrton winning his last world championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Senna wearing special helmet for anniversary|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/269710/senna-wearing-special-helmet-for-anniversary/|publisher=gpupdate.net|date=13 October 2011|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>

At the [[1995 Brazilian Grand Prix]], Rubens Barrichello incorporated part of Senna's helmet design into his own.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Richard|title=Spirit of Senna in the air|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/spirit-of-senna-in-the-air-1613061.html|work=The Independent|date=27 March 1995|accessdate=16 August 2012|location=London}}</ref> For the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]], another variant of Senna's helmet was used by Lewis Hamilton and by Barrichello too. Hamilton used the design with permission from Senna's sister Viviane and the helmet was later sold in support of the IAS.<ref>{{cite web|title=Friday practice – selected team and driver quotes|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2011/11/12833.html|publisher=Formula1.com|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> At the [[2015 Brazilian Grand Prix]], Hamilton again varied his helmet design (this time, the rear only given FIA restrictions on design changes in force from 2015) accompanied with a [[Twitter]] announcement stating "Just for you, Brazil!! A tribute to the greatest".<ref>{{cite web|title=Just for you, Brazil!

Outside of motor racing, Brazilian cyclist [[Murilo Fischer]] wore a helmet based on Senna's helmet colour scheme of yellow with green and blue stripes on stage 11 of the [[2015 Giro d'Italia]], which finished on the Imola circuit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/news-shorts-kng-shines-in-the-rain-fischer-honours-senna |title=News Shorts: Küng shines in the rain, Fischer honours Senna |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=22 May 2015 |website=[[cyclingnews.com]] |access-date=22 May 2015}}</ref>
