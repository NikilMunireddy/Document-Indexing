The '''Holy Land''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקוֹדֵשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}, {{lang-la|Terra Sancta}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|الأرض المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Al-Arḍ Al-Muqaddasah''}}) is an area roughly located between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] but also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Historically, it is synonymous with both the [[Land of Israel]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and the [[Lebanon|Lebanese Republic]], the [[Syria|Syrian Arab Republic]] and the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]]. It is considered [[holy]] by certain [[Jews]], [[Christian]]s, and [[Muslim]]s.

Part of the significance of the land stems from the [[religious significance of Jerusalem]], the holiest city to [[Judaism]], the historical region of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus's ministry]], and the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] event in [[Islam]] and [[Mount Nebo]], where [[Moses]] presumably died. The perceived holiness of the land to Christianity was part of the motivation for the [[Crusades]], as European Christians sought to win the Holy Land back from the Muslim [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]. The Turks had taken over the Holy Land after defeating the Muslim [[Arabs]], who had in turn [[Muslim conquests|conquered the area]] from the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]].

Many sites in the Holy Land have long been [[pilgrimage]] destinations for adherents of the [[Abrahamic religions]], including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and [[Bahá'ís]]. [[Pilgrim]]s visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their [[faith]], confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the Holy Land.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.metti-bronner.com/Jerusalem.pdf |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date= 2011-06-01|accessdate=1 July 2011 }}</ref>

Jews do not commonly refer to the [[Land of Israel]] as "Holy Land" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקוֹדֵשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}). The [[Tanakh]] explicitly refers to it as "holy land" in only one passage, in {{bibleverse||Zechariah|2:16|HE}}. The holiness of the Land of Israel is generally implied in the Tanakh by the Land being given to the [[Israelites]] by God, that is, it is the "[[promised land]]", an integral part of [[Covenant (biblical)|God's covenant]]. In the [[Torah]] many [[mitzvot]] commanded to the Israelites can only be performed in the Land of Israel,<ref>Aharon Ziegler, ''Halakhic positions of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik: Volume 4'', KTAV Publishing House, 2007, p.173</ref> which serves to differentiate it from other lands. For example, in the Land of Israel, "no land shall be sold permanently" (Lev. 25:23). [[Shmita]] is only observed with respect to the land of Israel, and the observance of many [[Jewish holiday|holy]] days is different, as an extra day is observed in the [[Jewish diaspora]].

According to Eliezer Schweid:
{{quote|The uniqueness of the Land of Israel is...'geo-theological' and not merely climatic. This is the land which faces the entrance of the spiritual world, that sphere of existence that lies beyond the physical world known to us through our senses. This is the key to the land's unique status with regard to prophecy and prayer, and also with regard to the commandments<ref>''The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny'', By Eliezer Schweid, Translated by Deborah Greniman, Published 1985 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, ISBN 0-8386-3234-3, p.56.</ref>}}

From the perspective of the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], the holiness of Israel had been concentrated since the sixteenth century, especially for burial, in the "[[Four Holy Cities]]": [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]] - as [[Judaism]]'s holiest cities. Jerusalem, as the site of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], is considered especially significant.<ref name=1000BCE>
Since the 10th century BCE. "For Jews the city has been the pre-eminent focus of their spiritual, cultural, and national life throughout three millennia." Yossi Feintuch, ''U.S. Policy on Jerusalem'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, p. 1. ISBN 0-313-25700-0

According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is Mount [[Moriah]], the location of the [[binding of Isaac]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the name "[[Jerusalem]]" 669 times, often because many mitzvot can only be performed within its environs. The name "[[Zion]]", which usually refers to Jerusalem, but sometimes the Land of Israel, appears in the Hebrew Bible 154 times.

The [[Talmud]] mentions the religious duty of colonising Israel.<ref name="Herzog1967">{{cite book|author=Isaac Herzog|title=The Main Institutions of Jewish Law: The law of obligations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq3XAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 June 2011|year=1967|publisher=Soncino Press|page=51}}</ref> So significant in Judaism is the act of purchasing land in Israel, the Talmud allows for the lifting of certain religious restrictions of [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] observance to further its acquisition and settlement.<ref name="Zahavi1962">{{cite book|author=Yosef Zahavi|title=Eretz Israel in rabbinic lore (Midreshei Eretz Israel): an anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK7hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 June 2011|year=1962|publisher=Tehilla Institute|page=28|quote=If one buys a house from a non-Jew in Israel, the title deed may be written for him even on the Sabbath.

A story says that when R. Eleazar b. Shammua' and R. [[Johanan HaSandlar]] left Israel to study from R. [[Judah ben Bathyra]], they only managed to reach [[Sidon]] when "the thought of the sanctity of Israel overcame their resolution, and they shed tears, rent their garments, and turned back". Due to the Jewish population being concentrated in Israel, emigration was generally prevented, which resulted in a limiting of the amount of space available for Jewish learning. However, after suffering persecutions in Israel for centuries after the destruction of the Temple, Rabbis who had found it very difficult to retain their position moved to Babylon, which offered them better protecion. Many Jews wanted Israel to be the place where they died. R. Anan said, "To be buried in Israel is like being buried under the altar". The saying "His land will absolve His people" implies that burial in Israel will cause one to be absolved of all one's sins.

[[File:Holy sepulchre mass.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Christianity, as it is the purported site of Christ's resurrection.]]

For [[Christian]]s, the [[Land of Israel]] is considered holy because of its association with the birth, ministry, [[crucifixion]] and [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]], whom Christians regard as the Savior or [[Messiah]], and because it is the land of his people, the Jews (according to the Bible). Christian books, including editions of the Bible, often had maps of the Holy Land (considered to be Galilee, Samaria, Judea). For instance, the ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel book through Holy Scripture) of Heinrich Bünting (1545-1606), a German Protestant pastor, featured such a map.<ref name="wdl"/> His book was very popular, and it provided "the most complete available summary of biblical geography and described the geography of the Holy Land by tracing the travels of major figures from the Old and New testaments."<ref name="wdl">{{cite web|title=Description of the Holy Land|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2891/|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1585|language=German|author1=Bünting, Heinrich}}</ref>

As a geographic term, the description "Holy Land" loosely encompasses modern-day [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Lebanon]], western [[Jordan]] and south-western [[Syria]].

{{See also|Jerusalem in Islam}}
In the [[Qur'an]], the term {{lang|ar|'''الأرض المقدسة'''}} ({{transl|ar|''Al-Ard Al-Muqaddasah''}}, {{lang-en|"Holy Land"}}) is mentioned at least seven times, once when [[Moses]] proclaims to the [[Children of Israel]]: "O my people! Enter the holy land which [[Allah]] hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin." ([[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an/Al-Meada|Surah 5:21]])

Jerusalem (referred to as Al-Quds, meaning the "Holy") has particular significance in Islam. The Qur'an refers to [[Muhammad]]'s experiencing the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] as "a Journey by night from the Sacred ([[Mecca]]) Mosque to the Farthest ([[al-Aqsa]]) Mosque, whose precincts We did bless" (17:1). [[Hadith|Ahadith]] associate the "Farthest Mosque" as Al-Quds; for example, as narrated by [[Abu Huraira]]: "On the night journey of Allah's Apostle, two cups, one containing wine and the other containing milk, were presented to him at Al-Quds (Jerusalem). He looked at them and took the cup of milk. Angel Gabriel said, "Praise be to Allah, who guided you to Al-Fitrah (the right path); if you had taken (the cup of) wine, your Ummah would have gone astray".  However, some modern scholars argue that the 'Farthest Mosque' (al-Masjid al-Aqsa) was a building or prayer site just outside Medina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3596681,00.html|title=The myth of al-Aqsa:Holiness of Jerusalem to Islam has always been politically motivated|website=Ynetnews|date=15 Sep 2008|author=[[Mordechai Kedar]]}} </ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/temples.html|title=The Jewish Temples: The Temples of Jerusalem in Islam|author=[[Martin Kramer]]|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref> The present mosque of that name had not been built in Muhammad's day, nor does the Qur'an contain any reference to Jerusalem, apart from the reference to the change of the qibla from Jerusalem to Mecca. [[Jerusalem]] was Islam's first [[Qibla]] (direction of prayer), however, this was later changed to the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] following a revelation to Muhammad by the Archangel Gabriel, by which it is understood by scholars {{who|date=February 2016}} that it was in answer to the rejection by the Jews of Muhammed's prophetship.

The exact region referred to as "Blessed Land" in the Qur'an verse [21:71] has been interpreted differently by various scholars: [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] likens it to a wide land range including, [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]], especially the cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]; Az-Zujaj describes it as, ''"[[Damascus]], Palestine, and a bit of [[Jordan]]"''; [[Qatada]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=August 2015}} claims it to be, ''"the [[Levant]]"''; [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] as, ''"the area between [[al-Arish]] and the [[Euphrates]]"''; and [[Ibn Abbas]] as, ''"the land of [[Jericho]]"''.<ref>Ali (1991), p. 934</ref>

==Bahá'í Faith==
Bahá'ís consider [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Haifa]] sacred as [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], was exiled to the prison of Acre from 1868 and spent his life in its surroundings till his death in 1892. In his writings he set the slope of [[Mount Carmel]] to host the [[Shrine of the Báb]] which his appointed successor [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] erected in 1909 as a beginning of the [[Terraces (Bahá'í)|terraced gardens]] there. The Head of the religion after him, [[Shoghi Effendi]], began building other structures and the [[Universal House of Justice]] continued the work until the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] was brought to its current state as the spiritual and administrative centre of the religion.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Jay D.
