'''County Wexford''' ({{lang-ga|Contae Loch Garman}}) is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]] and is part of the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]]. It is named after the town of [[Wexford]] and was based on the historic [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] territory of [[Uí Ceinnselaig|Hy Kinsella]] (''Uí Ceinnsealaigh''), whose capital was [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]].<ref>''Furlong'', p. 18.</ref><ref>Byrne, ''Irish Kings and High Kings'', pp 130–164.</ref> [[Wexford County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county. The population of the county is 145,273 according to the 2011 census.

County Wexford was one of the earliest areas of [[Ireland]] to be [[Christianity|Christianised]], in the early 5th century. Later, from 819 onwards, the Vikings plundered many Christian sites in the county.<ref name= A.F.M.>[[Annals of the Four Masters]] (A.F.M.)</ref> Wexford town became a Viking settlement near the end of the 9th century.<ref name= A.F.M./>

Wexford was the site of the invasion of Ireland by [[Normans]] in 1169 at the behest of [[Dermot MacMurrough|Diarmuid Mac Murrough]], King of Uí Cheinnsealaig and [[Kings of Leinster|king of Leinster]] (Laigin), which led to the subsequent colonisation of the country by the [[Anglo-Norman]]s.

The native Irish began to regain some of their former territories in the 14th century, especially in the north of the county, principally under [[Art mac Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh|Art MacMurrough Kavanagh]]. Under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the great religious houses were dissolved, 1536–41; in County Wexford this included Glascarrig Priory, Clonmines Priory, [[Tintern Abbey (County Wexford)|Tintern Abbey]], and [[Dunbrody Abbey]].

On 23 October 1641, a major rebellion broke out in Ireland, and County Wexford produced strong support for [[Confederate Ireland]]. [[Oliver Cromwell]] and his English Parliamentarian Army arrived 1649 in the county and captured it. The lands of the Irish and Anglo-Normans were confiscated and given to Cromwell's soldiers as payment for their service in the Parliamentarian Army. At [[Duncannon]], in the south-west of the county, [[James II of England|James II]], after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]], embarked for [[Kinsale]] and then to exile in France.

County Wexford was the most important area in which the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] was fought, during which significant battles occurred at [[Battle of Vinegar Hill|Vinegar Hill (Enniscorthy)]] and [[Battle of New Ross (1798)|New Ross]]. The famous ballad [[Boolavogue (song)|Boolavogue]] was written in remembrance of the Wexford Rising. At Easter 1916, a small [[Easter Rising|rebellion]] occurred at [[Enniscorthy]] town, on cue with that in [[Dublin]].<ref>''Furlong and Hayes'', pp 46 - 70.</ref> During [[World War II]], [[Luftwaffe|German planes]] bombed [[Campile]].<ref>''Furlong'', p. 143.</ref><ref name=WexPeop2000>{{cite web

==Geography and political subdivisions==
Wexford is the 13th largest of Ireland's thirty-two counties in area and 14th largest in terms of population.<ref>{{cite book| first=Eoghan| last=Corry| title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland| year=2005| id= | pages=186–191}}</ref> It is the largest of Leinster's 12 counties in size, and fourth largest in terms of population. The county is located in the south-east corner of the island of Ireland. It is bounded by the sea on two sides—on the south by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and on the east by [[St George's Channel|St. George's Channel]] and the [[Irish Sea]]. The [[River Barrow]] forms its western boundary. The [[Blackstairs Mountains]] form part of the boundary to the north, as do the southern edges of the [[Wicklow Mountains]]. The adjoining counties are [[County Waterford|Waterford]], [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]], [[County Carlow|Carlow]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]].

County Wexford is known as Ireland's "sunny southeast" because, in general, the number of hours of sunshine received daily is higher than in the rest of the country. This has resulted in Wexford becoming one of the most popular places in Ireland in which to reside. The county has a mild, but changeable, [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], a continuation of the [[Gulf Stream]], moderates winter temperatures. There is a [[Weather station|meteorological station]] located at [[Rosslare Harbour]].<ref>[http://www.met.ie/climate/rosslare.asp Rosslare MET Station.]</ref> January and February are generally the coldest months, with temperatures ranging between 4–8 {{nowrap|°C}} on average.<ref name="RosslareMET30yrAv">{{cite web|url=http://www.met.ie/climate/rosslare.asp|title=Climate - 30 Year Averages – Rosslare MET Station - monthly and annual mean and extreme values (1961-1990)|work= MET ÉIREANN Website|accessdate=14 May 2008}}</ref> July and August are generally the warmest months, with temperatures ranging between 12–18 {{nowrap|°C}} on average.<ref name="RosslareMET30yrAv"/> The [[prevailing winds]] are from the south-west.<ref name="METwind">{{cite web|url=http://www.met.ie/climate/wind.asp|title=Climate - Wind|work= MET ÉIREANN Website|accessdate=15 May 2008}}</ref> Precipitation falls throughout the year. Mean Annual [[Rain]]fall is between 800–1200&nbsp;mm.<ref name="METrainfall">{{cite web|url=http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp|title=Climate - Rainfall – & Map (Mean Annual Rainfall (mm) 1961-90)|work= MET ÉIREANN Website|accessdate=15 May 2008}}</ref> Generally, the county receives less [[snow]] than more northerly parts of [[Ireland]]. Serious snowfalls are relatively rare, but can occur. The one exception is [[Mount Leinster]], visible from a large portion of the county, which is frequently covered with snow during the winter months. [[Frost]] is frequent in winter months, less in coastal areas.

===Mountains and hills===
[[File:Mt Leinster.jpg|right|thumb|Mount Leinster]]
Largely low-lying fertile land is the characteristic landscape of the county. The highest point in the county is Mount Leinster (795 m,<ref>''The Times Atlas of the World'', p. 107 (Map - Ireland).</ref> 2610&nbsp;ft) in the [[Blackstairs Mountains]] in the north-west on the boundary with County Carlow.

Other high points:
*[[Black Rock Mountain, County Wexford|Black Rock Mountain]], which is 599 m (1,965&nbsp;ft) high. It is located near the Wexford-Carlow border, within County Wexford.
*[[Croghan Mountain]] (or ''Croghan Kinsella'') on the Wexford-Wicklow border - 606 m (1,988&nbsp;ft) high
*Annagh Hill 454 m (1,490&nbsp;ft), near the Wicklow border
*[[Slieveboy]] at 420 m (1,378&nbsp;ft) high

Notable hills include: Carrigbyrne Hill, Camross (or Camaross) Hill (181 m),<ref name = OSI77DSer>OSI, ''Discovery Series 77''.</ref> Carrigmaistia (167 m),<ref name = OSI77DSer/> Bree Hill (179 m),<ref name = OSI77DSer/> Gibbet Hill, Vinegar Hill, Slievecoiltia and Forth Mountain (237 m),<ref name = OSI77DSer/> and Tara Hill.

[[File:River Barrow Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 1363920.jpg|right|thumb|Bridge over the River Barrow at [[New Ross]].]]

===Rivers and lakes===
The major rivers are the [[River Slaney|Slaney]] and the [[River Barrow|Barrow]].

At {{convert|192|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, the river Barrow is the second longest river on the island of Ireland.<ref name="OSiRivers">{{cite web|url=http://www.osi.ie/mapping/FAQ/longRivers.shtml |title=FAQ - Longest Rivers in Ireland |work=Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) Website |accessdate=19 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071119035731/http://www.osi.ie/mapping/FAQ/longRivers.shtml |archivedate=19 November 2007 }}</ref>

Other smaller rivers of note are the Owenduff, Pollmounty, Corrock, Urrin, Boro, Owenavorragh, Sow and [[River Bann (Wexford)|Bann]] rivers.

There are no significant fresh-water lakes in the county. Small seaside lakes or [[lagoon]]s exist at two locations – one is called [[Lady's Island Lake]] and the other Tacumshin Lake.

The ''Wexford Cot'' is a flat bottomed boat used for fishing on the tidal mudflats in wexford,<ref>[http://rowingforpleasure.blogspot.ie/2009/08/wexford-cot.html Wexford Cot] Rowing for Pleasure</ref> also a canoe shaped Punt fitted with a gun, called a ''Float'' in Wexford is used traditionally to shoot game birds in the [[North Slob]] mud flats.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vm5dr Wexford to Killiney] Coast, Series 4, Episode 6, www.bbc.co.uk</ref>

===Islands===
The [[Saltee Islands]] lie 5&nbsp;km offshore from Kilmore Quay, while the smaller [[Keeragh Islands]] are 1.5&nbsp;km offshore from Bannow.

===Soil===
Most, but not all, of the county was covered with the [[ice sheet]] during the last [[Ice age]]. As the [[ice]] retreated, County Wexford would have been one of the first areas to be covered with [[Moraine|glacial drift]] (a mixture of [[boulder]]s, [[clay]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]]) that blanketed the existing [[bedrock]]. This has led to high quality [[soil]]s, suitable for a wide range of [[agriculture]]. A very detailed soil survey of the county was published in 1964, as part of the 'National Soil Survey of Ireland'. It classifies each area of the county according to its specific [[soil type]].<ref>Gardiner, M.J. & Pierce Ryan. ''Soils of County Wexford''. Dublin: An Foras Talúntais, 1964.</ref>

Most of the county is covered with soil called ''[[brown earth]]s'', described as well-drained and having a wide use range. After that, [[Gley soil|''gleys'']] (poorly to imperfectly drained with a limited use range) are the next major soil type, primarily located in the south-east of the county and east of [[Gorey]] (along the coast). Gleys are dotted elsewhere around the county in small areas, and where they occur they generally form [[bog]]land. The last major soil type is ''[[brown podzolic]]s'', located mainly near the edges of the [[Blackstairs Mountains|Blackstairs Mountain range]] and around [[Bunclody]] and in the baronies of East Shelmalier and South Ballaghkeen. Though there are areas covered with other [[soil type]]s, these are of limited extent.

===Flora===
Common species of tree include [[oak]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]], [[alder]], [[Prunus spinosa|blackthorn]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[beech]] and [[birch]]. Less common (but plentiful) are [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]] and [[Scots pine]] (also called red deal). [[Elm]] is now far less common, due to the devastating effects of [[Dutch elm disease]]. [[Ulex europaeus|Gorse]] (or furze) is very common. A priority habitat in Wexford is the [[grey dune]], on which many native wild flora grow, including [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] and [[pyramidal orchid]]. Despite the designation of much of this habitat as a [[Special Area of Conservation]], it remains threatened by destruction for agricultural intensification{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. There is very little natural forest in the county. Most natural trees and vegetation grow on [[hedge]]rows.

===Fauna===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lady Bugs in Wexford.png|thumb|Ladybirds in County Wexford, Ireland.]] -->

South-eastern Wexford is an important site for wild birds—the north side of [[Wexford Harbour]], the [[North Slob]], is home to 10,000 [[greater white-fronted goose|Greenland white-fronted geese]] each winter (roughly one third of the entire world's population), while in the summer [[Lady's Island Lake]] is an important breeding site for [[tern]]s, especially the [[roseate tern]]. The [[grey heron]] is also seen.

Throughout the county [[Common pheasant|pheasant]], [[Common wood pigeon|wood pigeon]] and [[feral]] [[Rock pigeon|pigeons]] are widespread. [[Swan]]s, [[Mallard|wild duck]], [[Common kingfisher|kingfisher]], and owls (the long-eared owl, the short-eared owl, and the [[barn owl]]) are less common - but plentiful. [[Red grouse]], once common, are now extremely scarce. The species has been in decline for some decades. Threats include habitat degradation, disease, predation and over-hunting. Red grouse in Ireland are now considered threatened.<ref>[http://www.bto.org/birdtrack/bird_recording/red_list_ireland.htm ] {{wayback|url=http://www.bto.org/birdtrack/bird_recording/red_list_ireland.htm |date=20070607150808 |df=y }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.client.teagasc.ie/environment/natural_heritage/Birds_of_conservation_concern_in_Ireland.asp |title=Teagasc - Environment |publisher=Client.teagasc.ie |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref> The [[corncrake]], also once very common, is now almost never seen. Smaller birds—such as crows, swallows, robins, wrens and so on—are very common. The first [[magpie]]s in [[Ireland]] were recorded by Robert Leigh, of Rosegarland, County Wexford, as having appeared in the County of Wexford about 1676.<ref>Herbert F. Hore (ed.), ''"A Chorographic Account of the Southern part of the County of Wexford, written Anno 1684, by Robert Leigh. Esq., of Rosegarland, in that County"'' in ''"The Journal of the Kilkenny and South-East of Ireland Achaeological Society"'' (Dublin, 1859), p. 467.</ref><ref>See William Thompson, ''"The Natural History of Ireland"'', Vol. 1 - (London, 1849), p. 328, for further details - other historical accounts mentioned here confirm Leigh's statement.</ref>
Land mammals include [[badger]], [[European rabbit|rabbit]], [[European otter|otter]], [[hedgehog]], [[red fox]], [[American mink|mink]], [[bat]]s, [[squirrel]]s ([[red squirrel|red]] and [[Eastern gray squirrel|grey]]), [[rat]]s ([[brown rat|brown]] and [[black rat|black]] - both [[introduced species]]), and [[Mouse|mice]] ([[Wood mouse|wood (or field)]] and [[house mouse|house]]). Two types of [[hare]]—the [[Mountain hare|Irish (or mountain) hare]] and the less common [[European hare|brown (or European) hare]]—are found. Hare is not nearly as common as rabbit. The [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea hibernica'') is also reasonably common. Locally the [[stoat]] is just as often incorrectly called a [[weasel]].

Only two types of [[Pinniped|seal]] are found on County Wexford's coast—[[gray seal|Atlantic grey seals]] are very plentiful in coastal areas, but the slightly smaller [[Harbor seal|common (or harbour) seal]] is less common, yet plentiful. The ''[[small tortoiseshell]] butterfly'' (reddish-orange colour, with black markings) is the most common species of [[butterfly]] in the county. Various types of [[moth]] are also common. The [[common frog]] is plentiful, and is the only type of [[frog]] found.

==Local government==
[[Wexford County Council]] has twenty-one members. The [[Wexford (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Wexford constituency]] is represented by five deputies in [[Dáil Éireann]]: [[John Browne (Fianna Fáil)|John Browne]] ([[Fianna Fáil|FF]]), [[Paul Kehoe]] ([[Fine Gael|FG]]), [[Brendan Howlin]] ([[Labour Party (Ireland)|Lab]]), [[Liam Twomey]] ([[Fine Gael|FG]]) and [[Mick Wallace]] ([[Independent (politician)|Ind]])

==Culture==
Since 1951, an [[opera]] festival, [[Wexford Festival Opera]], takes place every year in the Theatre Royal in Wexford town and runs for several weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wexfordopera.com|title=Wexford Festival Opera|work=wexfordopera.com}}</ref> A new Opera House has recently replaced the old one on the same site, it is now called Wexford Opera House. The new theatre opened in 2008 and consists of two theatres, the O'Reilly theatre and the Jerome Hynes theatre.

There is a renowned singing tradition in County Wexford. Having an abundance of traditional songs, many of which relate to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion of 1798]], the county has for many years had a strong presence in the Irish traditional singing scene. Noted singers include [[List of All-Ireland Fleadh champions|All-Ireland Fleadh Champions]] [[Paddy Berry]], Seamus Brogan and Niall Wall. Paddy Berry has also collected and published a number of songs from Wexford.

Beaches in [[Curracloe]], County Wexford were used to film the opening scenes of the movie ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', which depicted the [[Normandy landings|D-day]] assault on [[Omaha Beach]]. ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (2002 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', directed by [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]], was partly filmed in the village of [[Duncannon]] in 2000 &mdash; Duncannon Fort being used for one of the main scenes.<ref name=WexPeop28Aug2000>{{cite news

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
[[File:Cattle near Duncormick.JPG|right|thumb|Cattle near Duncormick.]]
The economy is chiefly agricultural. [[Cattle]], [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], [[pig]] rearing and some [[horse breeding]] are the main types of [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]] practiced. [[Poultry]] rearing, once popular, has very much declined. [[Wheat]], [[barley]], [[rapeseed]], and [[oat]]s are grown, as are [[potato]]es. [[Sugar beet]] is no longer grown due to the withdrawal of [[European Union|EU]] [[Subsidy|subsidies]]. The numbers involved in farming have been declining for many years and many of the seasonal workers are now eastern Europeans. [[Mushroom]]s are also grown indoors. [[Tomato]]es are grown under glass, for example at [[Campile]].

Wexford [[Garden strawberry|strawberries]] are famous and can be bought in shops and wayside stalls throughout the summer. Every year, near the end of June, a 'Strawberry Fair' Festival takes place in the town of [[Enniscorthy]], and a ''Strawberry Queen'' is crowned. [[Dairy farming]] forms an important part of the agricultural industry. Locally produced [[milk]] is on sale in many supermarkets. Wexford Irish [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] is an award-winning brand, and Carrigbyrne, a full-flavoured soft [[cheese]], is produced near New Ross.

===Forestry===
Evergreen tree species are extensively cultivated, especially in more recent years—[[Norway spruce]] and [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] are the most common varieties planted. These are generally sown on poorer quality soils (mainly in bogs and on hills or mountainsides). A small amount of [[deciduous]] trees are also planted, though these require better soils.

===Mining===
[[Silver]] was once mined at Clonmines—primarily in Tudor times. [[Lead]] was mined at Caim, 1818 - c. 1850—this mine also contains [[zinc]]; the two are usually found together. Copper ore ([[malachite]]) is found at Kerloge, just south of the town of [[Wexford]]. [[Iron]] is found in small quantities at Courtown Harbour. The county is not noted for mineral reserves. No significant mining activity is currently practised, with the exception of quarrying for stone. In 2007, a significant oil find was made 60 kilometres off Hook Head in Co Wexford.<ref name=Ind10thOct07>{{cite news

It was completed in November 2002 and was the first wind farm on the east coast of Ireland. Wind farms now exist at a few other locations in the county, such as [[Ballywater Wind Farm]], at Cahore (near [[Kilmuckridge]]), on the county's east coast, and Richfield wind farm, located in the southeast of the county.
