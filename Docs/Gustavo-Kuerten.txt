'''Gustavo Kuerten''' ({{IPA-pt|ɡusˈtavu ˈkiɾtẽ}}; born September 10, 1976), also known as '''Guga''', is a retired former [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles players|World No. 1]] [[tennis player]] from [[Brazil]]. He won the [[French Open (tennis)|French Open]] three times ([[1997 French Open – Men's Singles|1997]], [[2000 French Open – Men's Singles|2000]], and [[2001 French Open – Men's Singles|2001]]), and was the [[2000 Tennis Masters Cup – Singles|Tennis Masters Cup champion in 2000]], becoming the only player to defeat [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Andre Agassi]] in the same major tournament.

Kuerten suffered many problems with injuries which led him to miss a number of tournaments between 2002 and 2005. After a few failed attempts of comebacks, he retired from top-level tennis in May 2008.

Kuerten is commonly known as ''Guga'' ({{IPA-pt|ˈɡuɡɐ|pron}}), an affectionate nickname which is a common abbreviation of the name ''Gustavo'' in [[CPLP|Portuguese-speaking countries]].
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Early life==
Kuerten was born in [[Florianópolis]] in southern Brazil. He began playing tennis when he was six, an early start to a life and career marked by family tragedy. His father, Aldo, a former amateur tennis player, died of a heart attack in 1985 while umpiring a junior tennis match in [[Curitiba]], when Kuerten was only eight years old. His older brother, Raphael, is currently his business manager. His youngest brother, Guilherme, suffered prolonged oxygen deprivation and consequently irreparable brain damage during birth, and as a result suffered from mental retardation and severe physical disability until his death in 2007.<ref>[http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2007news/guga_brother.asp ATPtennis.com – Tennis news from around the world] {{wayback|url=http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2007news/guga_brother.asp |date=20071110065350 }}</ref> Kuerten was deeply affected by his brother's daily struggles, later donating the entire prize money from one tournament he has won every year of his professional career so far to a hometown NGO that provides assistance for people suffering from similar disabilities. He gave every trophy he won to his younger brother as a souvenir, including the three miniature replicas of the French Open men's singles trophy. His favourite football team is Brazilian [[Avaí Futebol Clube]].

As a young player, Kuerten first learned from Carlos Alves. Alves would continue to coach Kuerten for the next 8 years. When he was 14 years old, Kuerten met [[Larri Passos]] who would be his coach for the following 15 years. Passos convinced Kuerten and his family that the youth was talented enough to make a living out of playing tennis. The two started traveling all over the world to participate in junior tournaments. Kuerten turned professional in 1995.

==Professional career==
As a junior player in South America, Guga always stood out winning many of the most important tournaments in the region. Curiously, many times he played in an age group above his. For example, when he was 16 instead of playing in the category 15–16 he many times played in the category 17–18.

After two years as a professional, Kuerten rose to the position of no. 2 player in Brazil, second only to [[Fernando Meligeni]], and had his then highest point by helping the [[Brazil Davis Cup team]] defeat [[Austria Davis Cup team|Austria]] in 1996 and reach the competition's first division, the World Group.

Following his unexpected victory in the 1997 French Open - which was not only his maiden ATP Tour victory but also the first time he had even reached a professional ranking final - Kuerten had a difficult year and a half, adjusting to his sudden fame and the pressure of being expected to win. 1998 was the worst year in his career that was not related to injuries. The pressure for him to become an "ambassador" for tennis in Brazil was made evident after his early defeat to a then unknown [[Marat Safin]] in the 1998 French Open: the entire body of Brazilian journalists that had been dispatched to Paris to cover the event immediately returned home, leaving the rest of the tournament unaccounted for in Brazil.

Like many South Americans, his favorite court surface is clay. He won three [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles, all of them at the French Open, played on the clay courts of [[Stade Roland Garros|Roland Garros]]. He won these titles in 1997, 2000 and 2001. In every one of the three French Open victories he defeated Russia's [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in the quarterfinal match and defeated exactly two Top 10 players on his way to the title. Kuerten became the No. 1 player in the world in 2000 using his unique serve and strong ground strokes.

Kuerten won at least one title a year between 1997 and 2004. The streak came to an end in 2005, when injuries and below-average performances kept him from winning tournaments. He was also a regular participant for Brazil in the [[Davis Cup]].

Kuerten embraces the baseline style of play, with heavily topspin ground strokes and a solid serve that enables him to wear down his opponent from the back of the court. His unique "[[grunting (tennis)|grunt]]" when he strikes the ball is recognised by hundreds of fans around the world. He plays right-handed with a single-handed backhand using a [[grip (tennis)|western grip]].

===1997===

At the 1997 French Open, he became the first Brazilian to win a Grand Slam singles title since [[Maria Bueno|Maria Ester Bueno]] last single title at [[1966 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|1966 U.S. Open]]. Victories over three former champions: [[Thomas Muster]] (3rd round), [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] (quarterfinals) and [[Sergi Bruguera]] (final) made him the third-lowest ranked Grand Slam Champion (ranked 66th) and this led to him entering the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] top 20. Only [[Mark Edmondson]] (ranked 212th) and [[Goran Ivanišević]] (ranked 125th) were ranked lower than Kuerten when winning a Grand Slam singles title.

He received his French Open trophy from former champions [[Björn Borg]] and [[Guillermo Vilas]]. When called to the stage to receive the winner's trophy, Kuerten reverently bowed a few times to his childhood idol Borg, who was waiting at the top of the stairs to shake his hand. Later, during the ceremony, Vilas whispered something in Kuerten's ear that caused him to laugh during the speech of the chairman of the event. Kuerten later refused to reveal what it was that Vilas had said, claiming it would be inelegant to do so, but journalists that were equipped with powerful lenses were able to read Vilas's lips, and it was revealed that he had said in Spanish something like: "Get ready kid, it's going to rain women on your lap!"

===1999===
In 1999, he became one of three South Americans to complete the year in the top 10 in all the history of the ATP rankings. In May he won the [[Rome Masters]], beating [[Patrick Rafter]] in the final. In June he reached the quarterfinals at the French Open. At [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], he became the first Brazilian to reach the quarterfinals since [[Thomaz Koch]] in 1972. He was defeated by [[Andre Agassi]] in the quarterfinals, but had lost just one set until that stage. In July, he defeated [[Sébastien Grosjean]] 9–7 in the fifth set of the [[1999 Davis Cup]] quarterfinal between Brazil and [[France Davis Cup team|France]]. That match lasted 4 hours and 43 minutes. He also became the first Brazilian to qualify for the ATP World Championship, today known as the ATP [[Tennis Masters Cup]], which is exclusive to the eight best ranked players in the calendar year.

===2000===
Kuerten won his second French Open title by defeating [[Magnus Norman]] (who had beaten him a few weeks earlier in the final of the [[Rome Masters]]) on his 11th match point. Kuerten became the first South American to finish the year as World No. 1 in the history of the ATP rankings (since 1973). It was a close contest with young up-and-comer [[Marat Safin]] at the year's last event, the [[2000 Tennis Masters Cup – Singles|Tennis Masters Cup]] (in its first year under that name) in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, with one loss meaning that Safin would have been No. 1. In order to finish the year as the world No. 1 player, Kuerten did what many critics had deemed impossible (for him to do): beat [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Andre Agassi]] in back-to-back matches on an indoor hard court.

He broke an eight-year hold of players from the U.S. on the year-end No. 1 position. He also became the first South American to finish in Top 5 in consecutive years since [[Guillermo Vilas]] of [[Argentina]] in 1977–78.

===2001===
In 2001, he won his third French Open crown, joining former greats [[Björn Borg]] (6), [[Ivan Lendl]] (3) and [[Mats Wilander]] (3) with three or more French Open titles in the [[Tennis Open Era|Open Era]]; former champion [[Jim Courier]] presented him with the trophy. His road to the title was not uneventful: Kuerten saved a match point against Fourth Round opponent [[Michael Russell (tennis)|Michael Russell]]. He also won the biggest hardcourt title of his career in August at the [[Cincinnati Masters]], where he defeated [[Patrick Rafter]] in the final. He led the ATP in prize money for the second straight year, with US$4,091,004.

===2004===
In an injury-ridden year, Kuerten still managed to win one ATP Tour title, which he did at home, by winning the [[Brasil Open]] for the second time. In that year, the tournament had been moved from September to February, and the surface had been changed from hard to clay (all this was done as a result of a compromise with the Buenos Aires Open, in Argentina, and the Viña del Mar Open, in Chile, so as to tighten up a clear South American tournament circuit). With his victory, Kuerten became the only player so far to have won the title on both surfaces and dates (he had won the previous version of the tournament in 2002).

The one other noteworthy event in Kuerten's season was that he was responsible for the only defeat of [[Roger Federer]] in a Grand Slam event in that year. In Kuerten's only previous encounter against Federer on clay, in the Hamburg Masters 2002, Federer defeated Kuerten 6–0, 1–6, 6–2. When they met again in the third round at the French Open in 2004, it was Federer who was in dominant form, the world #1, and expected to win handily against the injury-ridden Kuerten. Instead, it was Kuerten who overpowered and dominated Federer, sending him off in straight sets (6–4, 6–4, 6–4). This would remain the last time that Federer was defeated in any Grand Slam prior to the quarter-finals stage until his Round 2 loss against [[Serhiy Stakhovsky]] at Wimbledon in [[2013 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|2013]].

On September 1, Kuerten announced that he would be withdrawing from the ATP Tour for an indefinite period of time, in order to undergo detailed exams of his operated hip, which had reportedly started to bother him again. He did not play again for the rest of the year.

===2006===
In the first months of 2006, injuries and weak performances kept Kuerten from reclaiming his status as a top world player. Ranked out of the top 200, Kuerten was no longer the top player in Brazil (currently behind [[Ricardo Mello]] and [[Flávio Saretta]]) and was expected to need wildcards to play any of the main tournaments of the season. His main attempt to come back, at the 2006 Brasil Open, was cut short in the first round. Following this debacle, Kuerten managed to obtain wildcards to play in the two North American Masters Series events, Miami and Indian Wells, but injuries forced Kuerten to withdraw from both. The French Tennis Federation had announced that Kuerten, as a three-time champion, would have every chance of being granted a wildcard to play at the [[2006 French Open]], provided that he managed to remain active throughout the 2006 season leading up to the French Open. Because Kuerten had been inactive in the Men's Tour since mid-February, he was not granted the wildcard to play, thus missing the French Open for the first time in his professional career.

===2007===
Kuerten's form did not improve in 2007. Because his ranking was not high enough to qualify for ATP Tour tournaments, Kuerten relied on [[wild card (sports)|wild cards]] to enter those events. Kuerten finished with a 2–7 win–loss record for the year.

In November, Gustavo Kuerten's younger brother, Guilherme, who had [[cerebral palsy]], died.

===2008===
Kuerten made an announcement that he expected 2008 to be his final year of play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/01/06/sports/LA-SPT-TEN-Kuerten.php |title=Report: Brazil's Kuerten to play his last season in 2008 – ',International Herald Tribune', |work=International Herald Tribune |date=March 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080220224038/http://www.iht.com:80/articles/ap/2008/01/06/sports/LA-SPT-TEN-Kuerten.php |archivedate=February 20, 2008 }}</ref> Kuerten chose to devise his schedule around tournaments that had sentimental value to him, such as the [[French Open (tennis)|French Open]], where he lost in the first round, the [[Brasil Open]], and the [[Miami Masters]]. After two first-round defeats in singles ([[Costa do Sauípe]], l. to Berlocq and Miami, l. to Grosjean), Kuerten won his first ATP Masters Series level match in a long time, partnering [[Nicolás Lapentti]], in Miami, against [[Feliciano López]] and [[Fernando Verdasco]].

===Retirement===
On May 25, 2008, Gustavo Kuerten played his last professional singles match in front of 15,000 spectators at [[Stade Roland Garros|Roland Garros]]. He arrived on court wearing his 'lucky' uniform, the same blue & yellow one that he wore in 1997 when he won his first French Open tournament. Despite saving a match point against his opponent [[Paul-Henri Mathieu]], he finally lost in three sets (6–3, 6–4, 6–2)—his result in the final of French Open in 1997. He was honoured after the game by the tournament organizers and by all the fans present for what he has achieved throughout his career.

==Sponsors==
During his career, Guga used [[Head (company)|Head]] racquets and [[Diadora]] clothes, changing them on a short period for [[Olympikus]] and Head. In 2012, after his retirement, he signed a sponsor deal with French brands [[Lacoste]] (for clothes) and [[Peugeot]] (for TV commercials). Guga also has his own clothes and glasses brand, named "Guga Kuerten".

==Life after tennis==
Since retirement he has settled down in his place of birth, the Brazilian island of [[Florianópolis]], where he enjoys being an active member of life in the lakeside district of [[Lagoa da Conceição]]. He still enjoys teaching and playing tennis with the local enthusiasts. After a match, he is known to enjoy some [[sake]] down at the local Mexican restaurant Cafe do Sol.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In his hometown, he is known as the "Cachorro Grande" ("Big Dog").{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} He is an avid [[surfing|surfer]] and can sometimes be seen surfing at Praia Brava where he has an apartment.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Kuerten has been accepted to a drama course on CEART, Center of Arts at [[Santa Catarina State University]] (UDESC) in Florianópolis. He began his studies there on February 16, 2009.<ref>{{cite news| work= USA Today | agency= Associated Press | title= Kuerten going from the courts to college | date= 26 January 2009 | location= São Paulo, Brazil| accessdate= 15 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://oglobo.globo.com/educacao/vestibular/mat/2009/01/27/aprovado-no-vestibular-2009-de-teatro-da-udesc-guga-leva-trote-de-amigos-754160505.asp | title= Aprovado no vestibular 2009 de teatro da Udesc Guga leva trote de amigos | work=O Globo | language= Portuguese | date= 27 January 2009}}</ref>

''Notes:''
* 1997: Defeated 3 champions, who had won the previous 4 editions, ''en route'' to title: Bruguera (1993–94), Muster (1995) and Kafelnikov (1996).
* 2000: As in 1997, faced Kafelnikov in the quarterfinal match; second final of the year against Norman ("a historical rivalry", in Kuerten's words).
* 2001: For the third time faced Kafelnikov in the quarterfinal match; for the second time, faced Ferrero in the semifinal match. Saved a match point against Russell in the 4th round.

: * Kuerten later described this as his best-played tournament, given how many difficult opponents he had to defeat ''en route'' to the title. One statistic supports this position: The average ranking of his opponents was '''13.16''' which was the best of any of his Grand Slam or Masters Series title wins. It is also the best for any Cincinnati champion since the ATP world rankings began in 1973. (The second- and third-best average opponent rankings in Cincinnati were [[Andre Agassi]]'s 18.16 in 2004, and [[Patrick Rafter]]'s 18.80 in 1998, although in 1998, Rafter only had to play 5 matches.)

Kuerten was first called to play for Brazil in the [[Davis Cup]] in 1996, when he became the second-best ranked player in the country (to [[Fernando Meligeni]]). Since then, Kuerten has always answered the invitations to play, claiming that it was a unique opportunity to represent his country.

In the 1999 and 2000 seasons, Kuerten took criticism from his fans, who accused him of not giving 100% in the Davis Cup matches. They claimed he was more concerned with sparing his energy for the ATP tournaments. At one point, Kuerten interrupted a match to argue with a fan who had shouted out for him to apply himself to the match at hand.

In 2004, following the country's unexpected defeat to [[Canada Davis Cup team|Canada]] in the Repechage match, and the country's demotion to the American Group I after having been defeated by [[Sweden Davis Cup team|Sweden]] in that year's First Round, discontent with the politics of the [[Brazilian Tennis Confederation]] spilled over. Kuerten refused to play for Brazil in the American Group I. The unexpected firing of then captain of the Brazilian team, Ricardo Accioly, was the trigger. Kuerten thought it was an arbitrary decision, since it was made without consulting the players. In his view that was just the last in a sequence of questionable decisions made by organization's board.

All other professional Brazilian players followed Kuerten's lead, as well as the newly appointed captain, former player [[Jaime Oncins]]. As a result, Brazil had to play the first round in the Zonal Group with a team made up of junior players (which was only possible after much negotiation, during which time the country was at risk of forfeiting the Round, which would have resulted in automatic demoting to the American Group II), which resulted in a defeat and the possibility of demotion to the American Group II.

The protest continued, and as a result, Brazil had to play the Repechage match again with a junior team, and was demoted to the American Group II for the 2005 season. As of 2005, following the fall of the BTC board in the aftermath of the protest, Kuerten and the other players have decided to return to the team, now captained by former player [[Fernando Meligeni]]. Kuerten, however, had to delay his return beyond the end of the players' strike, since his hip injuries kept him off courts between September 2004 and May 2005. He returned in the Tie with the [[Netherlands Antilles]], valid for the Second Round of the American Zonal Group II, which was played in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], Brazil (on clay) between July 15 and July 17, 2005.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> During the Doubles match, the star of the Austrian team, Thomas Muster, got angry over what he claimed to be disrespectful Brazilian fans, who were allegedly insulting him from the stands. The match umpire did not recognize his claim, so Muster walked off the court, throwing the match. He then convinced the entire Austrian team to defect the tie, which led to the cancellation of the two singles matches on Sunday and the automatic demotion of Austria to the European Zonal Group I.
