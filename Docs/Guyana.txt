It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, [[Brazil]] to the south and southwest, [[Suriname]] to the east and [[Venezuela]] to the west. With {{convert|215000|sqkm|sqmi}}, Guyana is the fourth-smallest country on mainland South America after [[Uruguay]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]].

The region known as "[[The Guianas|Guyana]]" comprised the [[Guiana Shield|large shield landmass]] north of the [[Amazon River]] and east of the [[Orinoco River]] known as the "Land of many waters". Originally inhabited by several indigenous groups, Guyana was settled by the Dutch before coming under [[British Empire|British control]] in the late 18th century. It was governed as the plantation economy of [[British Guiana]] until independence in 1966, and officially became a republic within the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1970. The legacy of British rule is reflected in the country's diverse population, which includes [[Indian people|Indian]], African, Amerindian, and multiracial groups.

Guyana also has the distinction of being the only South American nation in which English is the official language. The majority of the population, however, speak [[Guyanese Creole]], an [[English-based creole language]] with slight Dutch, [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] and Caribbean influences. In addition to being part of the [[Anglophone Caribbean]], Guyana is one of the few [[Caribbean]] countries that is not an island in the West Indies. The [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), of which Guyana is a member, is [[Secretariat (administrative office)|headquartered]] in Guyana's capital and largest city, [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]]. In 2008, the country joined the [[Union of South American Nations]] as a founding member.

== Etymology == <!--linked-->

The name "Guyana" is derived from ''Guiana'', the original name for [[The Guianas|the region]] that formerly included Guyana (British Guiana), [[Suriname]] ([[Dutch colonization of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]]), [[French Guiana]], and parts of [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]]. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' Guyana is derived from an Indigenous Amerindian language and means "land of many waters".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Guyana | title=Guyana | publisher=Oxford Dictionaries | accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of Guyana}}

There are nine [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] tribes residing in Guyana: the [[Wai-wai people|Wai Wai]], Machushi, Patamona, Arawak, Carib, Wapishana, Arecuna, Akawaio, and Warrau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html |title=Ministry of Amerindian Affairs – Georgetown, Guyana |publisher=Amerindian.gov.gy |date= |accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref> Historically the [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] tribes dominated Guyana. Although [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted Guyana during his third voyage (in 1498), the Dutch were the first to establish colonies: [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] (1616), [[Berbice]] (1627), and [[Demerara]] (1752). After the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] assumed control in 1796, the Dutch formally ceded the area in 1814. In 1831 the three separate colonies became a single British colony known as [[British Guiana]].

[[File:LocationNetherlandsGuiana.png|thumb|left|A map of [[Dutch colonization of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]] 1667–1814.]]
Since its Independence in 1824 Venezuela has claimed the area of land to the west of the [[Essequibo River]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of Spanish claims on the area dating to the sixteenth century, claimed was theirs. In 1899 an international tribunal ruled the land belonged to Great Britain. The border disputes persist and no final settlement has been reached <ref name=foxlatino>{{cite web |title = Guyana ponders judicial action in border dispute with Venezuela |url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/12/23/guyana-ponders-judicial-action-in-border-dispute-with-venezuela |work = FoxNews Latino |date=23 December 2014 |accessdate = 22 February 2015 }}</ref>

[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|Map of British Guiana.]]
Guyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 26 May 1966 and became a republic on 23 February 1970, remaining a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] and the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), along with the British government, played a strong role in influencing political control in Guyana during this time.<ref>[http://www.guyana.org/govt/US-declassifed-documents-1964-1968.html US Declassified Documents (1964–1968)]. guyana.org {{wayback|url=http://www.guyana.org/govt/US-declassifed-documents-1964-1968.html |date=20070212125256 |df=y }}</ref> The American government supported [[Forbes Burnham]] during the early years of independence because [[Cheddi Jagan]] was identified as a [[Marxist]]. They provided secret financial support and political campaign advice to Burnham's [[People's National Congress]], to the detriment of the Jagan-led [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]], which was mostly supported by Guyanese of East Indian background.

In 1978, Guyana received international notice when 918 members of the American cult, [[Peoples Temple]], died in a mass murder/suicide. Most of the suicides were American and more than 300 children were killed; the people were members of a group led by [[Jim Jones]] in [[Jonestown]], the settlement which they had created. Jim Jones's bodyguards had earlier attacked people taking off at a small remote airstrip close to Jonestown, killing five people, including [[Leo Ryan]], the only US [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]] ever assassinated in the line of duty.

In May 2008, President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Guyana has ratified the treaty.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Guyana}}

The territory controlled by Guyana lies between latitudes [[1st parallel north|1°]] and [[9th parallel north|9°N]], and longitudes [[56th meridian west|56°]] and [[62nd meridian west|62°W]].

The country can be divided into five natural regions; a narrow and fertile marshy plain along the Atlantic coast (low coastal plain) where most of the population lives; a white sand belt more inland (hilly sand and clay region), containing most of Guyana's mineral deposits; the dense [[rain forest]]s (Forested Highland Region) in the southern part of the country; the desert [[savannah]] in the southern west; and the smallest interior lowlands (interior savannah) consisting mostly of mountains that gradually rise to the Brazilian border.

Some of Guyana's highest mountains are [[Mount Ayanganna]] ({{convert|2042|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), [[Monte Caburaí]] ({{convert|1465|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) and [[Mount Roraima]] ({{convert|2810|m|ft|0|disp=or}} – the highest mountain in Guyana) on the Brazil-Guyana-Venezuela [[tripoint]] border, part of the [[Pakaraima]] range. Mount Roraima and Guyana's table-top mountains ([[tepui]]s) are said to have been the inspiration for [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 novel ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]''. There are also many volcanic [[escarpment]]s and waterfalls, including [[Kaieteur Falls]] which is believed to be the largest water drop in the world.<ref name=independent>{{cite news|title= South America: Do the continental: The best of what's new; spectacular waterfalls, forgotten cities, pre-Inca trails |work = The Independent |date=14 November 2004 |page = Features, page 3 | accessdate=22 February 2015 |first = Mark |last = Rowe }}</ref> North of the [[Rupununi River]] lies the [[Rupununi savannah]], south of which lie the [[Kanuku Mountains]].

[[File:Rupununi Savannah.jpg|thumb|[[Rupununi Savannah]].]]

The four longest rivers are the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]] at {{convert|1010|km|mi|0}} long, the [[Courantyne River]] at {{convert|724|km|mi|0}}, the [[Berbice River|Berbice]] at {{convert|595|km|mi|0}}, and the [[Demerara River|Demerara]] at {{convert|346|km|mi|0}}. The Corentyne river forms the border with Suriname. At the mouth of the Essequibo are several large islands, including the {{convert|145|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide [[Shell Beach, Guyana|Shell Beach]] lies along the northwest coast, which is also a major breeding area for [[sea turtle]]s (mainly [[leatherback sea turtle|leatherbacks]]) and other wildlife.

The local [[climate]] is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and generally hot and humid, though moderated by northeast [[trade winds]] along the coast. There are two rainy seasons, the first from May to mid-August, the second from mid-November to mid-January.

Guyana has one of the largest unspoiled [[rainforest]]s in South America, some parts of which are almost inaccessible by humans. The rich natural history of Guyana was described by early explorers [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Charles Waterton]] and later by naturalists Sir [[David Attenborough]] and [[Gerald Durrell]]. In 2008, the [[BBC]] ran a three-part programme called ''Lost Land of the Jaguar'' which highlighted the huge diversity of wildlife, including undiscovered species and rare species such as the [[giant otter]] and [[harpy eagle]].

In 2012, Guyana received a $45 million reward from Norway for its rainforest protection efforts. This stems from a 2009 agreement between the nations for a total of $250 million for protecting and maintaining the natural habitat. Thus far, the country has received $115 million of the total grant.

===Boundary disputes===
{{see also|Schomburgk Line|Borders of Suriname}}
Guyana is in [[Territorial dispute|border disputes]] with both [[Suriname]], which claims the area east of the left bank of the [[Corentyne River]] and the New River in southwestern Suriname, and [[Venezuela]] which claims the land west of the Essequibo River, once the [[Dutch colony]] of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] as part of Venezuela's [[Guayana Essequiba]].<ref name = foxlatino/><ref>{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20090406062803 |url=http://www.guyanachronicle.com/ARCHIVES/archive%2017-06-07.html |title=Tribunal decision tentatively set for August}}. guyanachronicle.com, Archives for 17 June 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://landofsixpeoples.com/news701/nk0702053.html |title=Guyana to experience ‘massive' oil exploration this year |publisher=Landofsixpeoples.com |date=5 February 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbean360.com/News/Business/Stories/2007/04/27/NEWS0000004303.html |title=News in the Caribbean |publisher=Caribbean360.com |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> The maritime<ref>[http://www.islandjournal.net/reportc.htm?section=caribbeannewsnow&story=Foreign-affairs-minister-reiterates-Guyana%27s-territorial-sovereignty&id=21520&catid=13 Foreign affairs minister reiterates Guyana's territorial sovereignty].

The ruling concerning the [[Caribbean Sea]] north of both nations found both parties violated treaty obligations and declined to order any compensation to either party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1147 |title=official site of the Permanent Court of Arbitration |publisher=Pca-cpa.org |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

When the British surveyed British Guiana in 1840, they included the entire [[Cuyuni River]] basin within the colony. Venezuela did not agree with this as it claimed all lands west of the Essequibo River. In 1898, at Venezuela's request, an international [[Arbitral tribunal|arbitration tribunal]] was convened, and in 1899 they issued an award giving about 94% of the disputed territory to British Guiana.

Venezuela never has accepted the award by this treaty, and raised the issue again at the time of Guyana's independence. This issue is now governed by the Treaty of Geneva of 1966, which was signed by the Governments of Guyana, Great Britain and Venezuela, and Venezuela continues to claim [[Guayana Esequiba (Zona en Reclamación)|Guayana Esequiba]].<ref name="Ishmael">[http://www.guyana.org/features/trail_diplomacy.html Ishmael, Odeen (1998, rev. 2006) "The Trail Of Diplomacy: A Documentary History of the Guyana-Venezuela Border Issue"] Dr. Ishmael was Ambassador of Guyana to Venezuela when this was written.</ref> Venezuela calls this region "Zona en Reclamación" (Reclamation Zone) and Venezuelan maps of the national territory routinely include it, drawing it in with dashed lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.a-venezuela.com/mapas/map/html/politico.html |title=Mapa Politico de Venezuela |publisher=A-venezuela.com|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

Specific small disputed areas involving Guyana are [[Ankoko Island]] with Venezuela; Corentyne River<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.islandjournal.net/reportc.htm?section=caribbeannewsnow&story=Guyana-and-Suriname-border-dispute-continues-despite-UN-findings&id=11740&catid=13 |title=Guyana and Suriname border dispute continues despite UN findings |accessdate=15 December 2008 |first=Oscar |last=Ramjeet |date=28 October 2008 |work=Caribbean Net News}}</ref> with Suriname; and [[New River Triangle]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2008/opinion/letters/10/24/there-is-no-agreement-recognizing-suriname%E2%80%99s-sovereignty-over-the-corentyne-river/ |title=There is no agreement recognizing Suriname's sovereignty over the Corentyne River |accessdate=15 December 2008 |first=Carolyn |last=Rodrigues-Birkett |date=24 October 2008 |work=Stabroek Newspaper }}</ref> with Suriname. In 1967 a Surinamese survey team was found in the [[New River Triangle]] and was forcibly removed. In August 1969 a patrol of the [[Guyana Defence Force]] found an unauthorised military camp and a partially completed airstrip inside the triangle, and documented evidence of the Surinamese intention to occupy the entire disputed area. After an exchange of gunfire, the [[Surinamese]] were driven from the triangle.

===Environment and biodiversity===
{{see also|Category:Flora of Guyana|Category:Fauna of Guyana}}
[[File:Guyana BMNG.png|thumb|Satellite image of Guyana from 2004.]]
The following habitats have been categorised for Guyana: coastal, marine, littoral, estuarine palustrine, mangrove, riverine, lacustrine, swamp, savanna, white sand forest, brown sand forest, montane, cloud forest, moist lowland and dry evergreen scrub forests (NBAP, 1999). About 14 areas of biological interest have been identified as possible hotspots for a National Protected Area System.

More than 80% of Guyana is still covered by forests, ranging from dry evergreen and seasonal forests to montane and lowland evergreen rain forests. These forests are home to more than a thousand species of trees. Guyana's tropical climate, unique geology, and relatively pristine ecosystems support extensive areas of species-rich rain forests and natural habitats with high levels of [[endemism]]. Approximately eight thousand species of plants occur in Guyana, half of which are found nowhere else.

Guyana has one of the highest levels of [[biodiversity]] in the world. Guyana, with 1,168 [[vertebrate]] species, 814 bird species, boasts one of the richest mammalian fauna assemblages of any comparably sized area in the world. The [[Guiana Shield]] region is little known and extremely rich biologically. Unlike other areas of South America, over 70% of the natural habitat remains pristine.

The rich natural history of British Guiana was described by early explorers [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Charles Waterton]] and later by naturalists Sir [[David Attenborough]] and [[Gerald Durrell]].

In February 2004, the Government of Guyana issued a title to more than {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}} of land in the Konashen Indigenous District declaring this land as the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area (COCA), to be managed by the [[Wai-Wai (people)|Wai Wai]]. In doing so Guyana created the world's largest Community-Owned Conservation Area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.org/Documents/CI_Konashen_COCA_Biodiversity_Booklet.pdf |title=Biodiversity in the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area, Guyana |format=PDF |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

This important event followed a request made by the Wai Wai community to the government of Guyana and Conservation International Guyana (CIG) for assistance in developing a sustainable plan for their lands in Konashen. The three parties signed a Memorandum of Cooperation which outlines a plan for sustainable use of the Konashen COCA's biological resources, identifies threats to the area's biodiversity, and helps develop projects to increase awareness of the COCA as well as generate the income necessary to maintain its protected status.
[[File:Golden frog Kaieteur (2).jpg|thumb|''Anomaloglossus beebei'' (Kaieteur), specific to the Guianas.]]
[[File:Rurrenabaque Bolivia - The Amazon.jpg|thumb|The [[hoatzin]], the national bird of Guyana.]]

The Konashen Indigenous District of Southern Guyana houses the headwaters of the Essequibo River, Guyana's principal water source, and drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. Southern Guyana is host to some of the most pristine expanses of evergreen forests in the northern part of South America. Most of the forests found here are tall, evergreen hill-land and lower montane forests, with large expanses of flooded forest along major rivers. Thanks to the very low human population density of the area, most of these forests are still intact. The Smithsonian Institution has identified nearly 2,700 species of plants from this region, representing 239 distinct families, and there are certainly additional species still to be recorded.

Such incredible diversity of plants supports even more impressive diversity of animal life, recently documented by a biological survey organised by Conservation International. The clean, unpolluted waters of the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]] watershed support a remarkable diversity of fish and aquatic invertebrates, and are home to [[giant otters]], [[capybaras]], and several species of [[caimans]].

On land, large mammals, such as [[jaguar]]s, [[tapirs]], [[bush dog]]s, [[giant anteater]]s, and [[saki monkey]]s are still common. Over 400 species of birds have been reported from the region, and the reptile and amphibian faunas are similarly rich. The Konashen COCA forests are also home to countless species of insects, arachnids, and other invertebrates, many of which are still undiscovered and unnamed.

The Konashen COCA is relatively unique in that it contains a high level of biological diversity and richness that remains in nearly pristine condition; such places have become rare on earth. This fact has given rise to various non-exploitative, environmentally sustainable industries such as ecotourism, successfully capitalising on the biological wealth of the Konashen COCA with comparatively little enduring impact.

===World Heritage sites===
Guyana signed the [[Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage#Convention and background|Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage]] treaty in 1977, the first Caribbean country to do so. In the mid-1990s, Guyana began the process of selecting sites for World Heritage nomination, and three sites were considered: [[Kaieteur National Park]], [[Shell Beach, Guyana|Shell Beach]] and Historic Georgetown. By 1997, work on Kaieteur National Park was started, and in 1998 work on Historic Georgetown was begun. To date, however, Guyana has not made a successful nomination.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Guyana submitted the Kaieteur National Park, including the [[Kaieteur Falls]], to UNESCO as its first World Heritage Site nomination. The proposed area and surrounds have some of Guyana's most diversified life zones with one of the highest levels of [[endemic]] species found in South America. The Kaieteur Falls are the most spectacular feature of the park, falling a distance of 226&nbsp;metres. The nomination of Kaieteur Park as a World Heritage Site was not successful, primarily because the area was seen by the evaluators as being too small, especially when compared with the Central Suriname Nature Reserve that had just been nominated as a World Heritage Site (2000). The dossier was thus returned to Guyana for revision.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Guyana continues in its bid for a World Heritage Site. Work continues, after a period of hiatus, on the nomination dossier for Historic Georgetown. A tentative list indicating an intention to nominate Historic Georgetown was submitted to UNESCO in December 2004. In April 2005, two Dutch experts in conservation spent two weeks in Georgetown supervising architecture staff and students of the [[University of Guyana]] in a historic building survey of the selected area. This is part of the data collection for the nomination dossier.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:GuyanaKaieteurFalls2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kaieteur Falls]] is the world's largest single-drop waterfall by volume.]]

Meanwhile, as a result of the Kaieteur National Park being considered too small, there is a proposal to prepare a nomination for a Cluster Site that will include the Kaieteur National Park, the [[Iwokrama Forest]] and the [[Kanuku Mountains]]. The Iwokrama rain forest, an area rich in biological diversity, has been described by Major General (Retired) Joseph Singh as "a flagship project for conservation." The Kanuku Mountains area is in a pristine state and is home to more than four hundred species of birds and other animals. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Guyana holds two of the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[Global 200]] eco-regions,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} the Guianan and [[Guiana Highlands]] moist forests. It is also home to several endemic species including the [[Chlorocardium|greenheart]] tree.

== Economy ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
{{main|Economy of Guyana|Agriculture in Guyana}}
{{see also|List of Guyanese companies}}
[[File:Tractor in field of rice by Khirsah1.jpg|thumb|A tractor in a [[rice field]] on Guyana's coastal plain.]]

The main economic activities in Guyana are agriculture (production of rice and [[Natural brown sugar|Demerara sugar]]), [[bauxite]] mining, gold mining, timber, shrimp fishing and minerals. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled [[labour (economics)|labour]] and a deficient infrastructure. In 2008, the economy witnessed a 3% increase in growth amid the global [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|economic crisis]], grew an impressive 5.4% in 2011 and 3.7% in 2012.

Until recently, the government was juggling a sizeable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities combined with troubles in the bauxite and sugar industries, had threatened the government's tenuous fiscal position and dimmed prospects for the future. However, the Guyanese economy has rebounded slightly and exhibited moderate economic growth since 1999, thanks to an expansion in the agricultural and mining sectors, a more favourable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support of international organisations.

The sugar industry, which accounts for 28% of all export earnings, is largely run by the company [[GuySuCo]], which employs more people than any other industry. Many industries have a large foreign investment. For example, the mineral industry is heavily invested in by the American company [[Reynolds Metals]] and the British-Australian [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto's]] Rio Tinto Alcan subsidiary; the Korean/Malaysian Barama Company has a large stake in the logging industry.

[[File:Guyana Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|Graphical depiction of Guyana's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]
The production of [[balatá]] (natural [[latex]]) was once big business in Guyana. Most of the balata bleeding in Guyana took place in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains in the Rupununi. Early exploitation also took place in the North West District, but most of the trees in the area were destroyed by illicit bleeding methods that involved cutting down the trees rather than making incisions in them. Uses of balatá included the making of [[cricket]] balls, the temporary filling of troublesome tooth cavities, and the crafting of figurines and other decorative items (particularly by the Macushi people of the Kanuku mountains).

Major [[private sector]] organisations include the Private Sector Commission (PSC)<ref>{{cite web|author=RedSpider, Romona Khan |url=http://www.psc.org.gy |title=Private Sector Commission |publisher=Psc.org.gy |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> and the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgetownchamberofcommerce.org |title=Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) |publisher=Georgetownchamberofcommerce.org|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

The government initiated a major overhaul of the tax code in early 2007. The [[Value Added Tax]] (VAT) was brought into effect, replacing six different taxes. Prior to the implementation of the VAT, it had been relatively easy to evade sales tax, and many businesses were in violation of tax code. Many businesses were very opposed to VAT introduction because of the extra paperwork required; however, the Government has remained firm on the VAT. By replacing several taxes with one flat tax rate, it will also be easier for government auditors to spot [[embezzlement]]. This was prevalent under the former PPP/C regime who authorised the VAT to be equal to 50% of the value of the good. While the adjustment to VAT has been difficult, it may improve day-to-day life because of the significant additional funds the government will have available for public spending.

President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] had made [[debt relief]] a foremost priority of his administration. He was quite successful, getting US$800&nbsp;million of debt written off by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank Group|the World Bank]] and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB), in addition to millions more from other industrial nations. Jagdeo was lauded by IDB President Moreno for his strong leadership and negotiating skills in pursuing debt relief for Guyana and several other regional countries.

[[File:Population Guyana.PNG|left|thumb|A graph showing the population of Guyana from 1961 to 2003. The population decline in the 1980s can be clearly seen.]]

Most of Guyana's population (90%) lives in a narrow coastal strip which ranges from {{convert|10|to|40|mi|disp=flip}} in width and which makes up approximately 10% of the nation's total land area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geographia.com/guyana/geninfo.html |title=Guyana General Information|publisher=Geographia.com|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

The present population of Guyana is racially and ethnically heterogeneous, with ethnic groups originating from [[India]], Africa, Europe, and China, as well as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] or aboriginal peoples. Despite their diverse ethnic backgrounds, these groups share two common languages: English and [[Guyanese Creole|Creole]].

The largest ethnic group is the [[Indo-Guyanese]] (also known as [[Indo-Caribbeans|East Indians]]), the descendants of indentured labourers from [[India]], who make up 43.5% of the population, according to the 2002 census. They are followed by the [[Afro-Guyanese]], the descendants of slaves from Africa, who constitute 30.2%. Guyanese of mixed heritage make up 16.7%, while the indigenous peoples (known locally as [[Amerindians]]) make up 9.1%. The indigenous groups include the [[Arawaks]], the [[Wai-Wai (people)|Wai Wai]], the [[Kalina people|Caribs]], the [[Akawaio people|Akawaio]], the [[Arecuna]], the [[Patamona]], the [[Wapixana]], the [[Macushi]] and the [[Warao people|Warao]].<ref name="cia"/> The two largest groups, the Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese, have experienced some racial tension.<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2005/09/050920_guyana_race.shtml Guyana turns attention to racism]".

Most Indo-Guyanese are descended from [[Bhojpuri]]-speaking [[Bihari people|Bihari]] and Uttar Pradesh migrants.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RCF6NnEv9oAC&pg=PA30 |title=Music of Hindu Trinidad |author=Helen Myers |isbn=9780226554532 |year=1999}}</ref> Many Indo-Guyanese are also descended [[Tamil language|Tamil]] speaking Tamils from [[Tamil Nadu]], and [[Telugus]] of [[Telangana]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]] in [[South India]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter17.pdf |title=Indian Diaspora }}</ref>

The distribution pattern in the 2002 census was similar to those of the 1980 and 1991 censuses, but the share of the two main groups has declined. Indo-Guyanese made up 51.9% of the total population in 1980, but by 1991 this had fallen to 48.6%, and then to 43.5% in the 2002 census. Those of African descent increased slightly from 30.8% to 32.3% during the first period (1980 and 1991) before falling to 30.2% in the 2002 census. With small growth in the overall population, the decline in the shares of the two larger groups has resulted in the relative increase of shares of the multiracial and Amerindian groups. The Amerindian population rose by 22,097 people between 1991 and 2002. This represents an increase of 47.3% or annual growth of 3.5%. Similarly, the multiracial population increased by 37,788 persons, representing a 43.0% increase or annual growth rate of 3.2% from the base period of 1991 census. The number of [[Portuguese Guyanese|Portuguese]] (4.3% of the population in 1891) has been declining constantly over the decades.<ref>"[http://www.guyana.org/special/portuguese.html Portuguese emigration from Madeira to British Guiana]"</ref>

===Language===
{{main|Languages of Guyana}}
English is the official language of Guyana and is used for education, government, media, and services. The vast majority of the population speaks [[Guyanese Creole]], an English-based creole with slight African and East Indian influence, as their native tongue.<ref>Damoiseau, Robert (2003) ''Eléments de grammaire comparée français-créole guyanais'' Ibis rouge, Guyana, ISBN 2-84450-192-3</ref> In addition, [[Cariban languages]] ([[Akawaio language|Akawaio]], [[Wai-Wai (people)|Wai-Wai]], and [[Macushi]]) are spoken by a small minority, while [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic languages]] are retained for cultural and religious reasons.

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Guyana}}
Data from a 2002 census on religious affiliation indicated that approximately 57% of the population was Christian, 28% were [[Hindu]] and 7% were Muslims, while 4% of the population did not profess any religion.<ref name=report>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90256.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Guyana]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>

Most Guyanese Christians are either Protestants or Roman Catholics and include a mix of all races.

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of Guyana}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}

[[File:Old residence.jpg|thumb|left|The State House, Guyana's presidential residence.]]
[[File:Cottage of city Georgetown.jpg|thumb|right|The Supreme Court of Guyana.]]
[[File:Parliament building, Guyana.jpg|thumb|right|Guyana's parliament building since 1834.]]

The [[politics of Guyana]] takes place in a framework of a [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Guyana]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Guyana]].

Historically, politics are a source of tension in the country, and violent riots have often broken out during elections. During the 1970s and 1980s, the political landscape was dominated by the People's National Congress.

In 1992, the first "free and fair" elections were overseen by former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]], and the People's Progressive Party has led the country since. The two parties are principally organised along ethnic lines and as a result often clash on issues related to the allocation of resources.

General Elections were held on 28 November 2011, which resulted in a re-election of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) and installation of that party's presidential candidate [[Donald Ramotar]] as President.

On 11 May 2015, early general elections were held, resulting in a victory for A Partnership For National Unity-Alliance For Change (APNU-AFC) Coalition party. APNU-AFC, a multi-ethnic, multi-party coalition, won a majority, 33 of 65 seats in the National Assembly. On 16 May 2015, retired army general David A. Granger was sworn in as the eighth Executive President of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.

===Military===

===Transport===
{{main|Transport in Guyana}}
[[File:LethemBridge.jpg|thumb|right|Cross-border bridge from Guyana to [[Brazil]] near [[Lethem, Guyana|Lethem]].]]
There are a total of {{convert|116|mi|km|disp=flip}} of railway, all dedicated to ore transport. There are {{convert|4952|mi|km|disp=flip}} of highway, of which {{convert|367|mi|km|disp=flip}} are paved. Navigable waterways extend to {{convert|669|mi|km|disp=flip}}, including the Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo rivers.
There are ports at Georgetown, Port Kaituma, and [[New Amsterdam, Guyana|New Amsterdam]]. There is one international airport ([[Cheddi Jagan International Airport]], Timehri); one regional airport ([[Ogle Airport]]); and about 90 airstrips, nine of which have paved runways. Guyana, [[Suriname]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] are the only three regions in South America which [[drive on the left]].

===Electricity===
{{main|Electricity sector in Guyana}}
The electricity sector in Guyana is dominated by [[Guyana Power and Light]] (GPL), the state-owned vertically integrated utility. Although the country has a large potential for hydroelectric and [[bagasse]]-fueled power generation, most of its 226 [[Megawatt|MW]] of installed capacity correspond to inefficient thermoelectric diesel-engine driven generators.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Several initiatives are in place to improve [[Hinterland energy in Guyana|energy access in the hinterland]].

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{main|Water supply and sanitation in Guyana}}
Key issues in the [[Water supply|water]] and [[sanitation]] sector in Guyana are poor service quality, a low level of cost recovery and low levels of access. A high-profile management contract with the British company [[Severn Trent]] was cancelled by the government in February 2007. In 2008 the public utility Guyana Water Inc implemented a Turnaround Plan (TAP) to reduce [[non-revenue water]] and to financially consolidate the utility. NRW reduction is expected to be 5% per annum for the three-year period of the plan, A midterm review is now due to examine the success of the TAP.

[[File:Queens College Guyana.jpg|thumb]]
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}

Guyana's educational system is considered to be among the best in the Caribbean, but it deteriorated significantly in the 1980s, because of inadequate funding and emigration of many highly educated citizens. Although the education system recovered in the 1990s, it still does not produce the quality of educated students necessary for Guyana to modernise its workforce.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The country lacks a critical mass of expertise in many of the disciplines and activities on which it depends.

The educational system does not sufficiently focus on the training of Guyanese in science and technology, technical and vocational subjects, [[business management]], or [[computer science]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Guyanese education system is modelled on the former [[British education]] system. Students are expected to take the NGSA (National Grade Six Assessment) for entrance into high school in grade 7. They take the [[CXC]] at the end of high school. Schools have introduced the [[Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination|CAPE]] exams which all other Caribbean countries have introduced. The [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] system, inherited from the British era, has all but disappeared and is offered only in a few schools.

Further adding to the problems of the educational system, many of the better-educated professional teachers have emigrated to other countries over the past two decades, mainly because of low pay, lack of opportunities and crime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Guyana's culture is very similar to that of the English-speaking Caribbean, and has historically been tied to the English-speaking Caribbean as part of the British Empire when it became a possession in the nineteenth century. Guyana is a founding member of the [[Caricom]] (Caribbean Community) economic bloc and also the home of the Bloc's Headquarters, the CARICOM Secretariat.

Guyana's geographical location, its sparsely populated rain-forest regions, and its substantial Amerindian population differentiate it from English-speaking Caribbean countries. Its blend of Indo-Guyanese (East Indian) and Afro-Guyanese (African) cultures gives it similarities to [[Trinidad]] and distinguishes it from other parts of the Americas. Guyana shares similar interests with the islands in the [[West Indies]], such as food, festive events, music, sports, etc.

Guyana plays international cricket as a part of the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies cricket team]], and the [[Guyanese cricket team|Guyana team]] plays [[first class cricket|first-class cricket]] against other nations of the Caribbean. In March and April 2007 Guyana co-hosted the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]]. In addition to its CARICOM membership, Guyana is a member of [[CONCACAF]], the international football federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean.

Events include [[Mashramani]] (Mash), [[Phagwah]] ([[Holi]]), and [[Deepavali]] ([[Diwali]]).
