'''William James''' "'''Count'''" '''Basie''' (August 21, 1904&nbsp;– April 26, 1984)<ref name="NYT1984"/> was an American [[jazz]] pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. His mother taught him to play the piano and he started performing in his teens. Dropping out of school, he learned to operate lights for vaudeville and to improvise accompaniment for silent films at a local movie theater in his home town of [[Red Bank, New Jersey]]. By 16 years old, he increasingly played jazz piano at parties, resorts and other venues. In 1924, he went to [[Harlem]], where his performing career expanded; he toured with groups to the major jazz cities of Chicago, St. Louis and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. In 1929 he joined [[Bennie Moten]]'s band in Kansas City, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935.

In 1935, Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], and in 1936 took them to [[Chicago]] for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two "split" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists [[Lester Young]] and [[Herschel Evans]], the guitarist [[Freddie Green]], trumpeters [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry "Sweets" Edison]] and singers [[Jimmy Rushing]] and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]]. Basie's theme songs were "[[One O'Clock Jump]]", developed in 1935 in the early days of his band, and later "[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]".

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
William Basie was born to Harvey Lee  and Lillian Basie in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]].<ref>Basie Centennial Ball</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Basie| first=Count |year=2000 |title=Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie | publisher=Paladin Grafton Books | isbn = 0-586-08638-2 | page=25}}</ref> His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several wealthy families in the area.<ref>Count Basie (1985), ''Good Morning Blues'', p. 26</ref> Both of his parents had some type of musical background. His father played the [[mellophone]], and his mother played the piano; in fact, she gave Basie his first piano lessons. She took in laundry and baked cakes for sale for a living. She paid 25 cents a lesson for piano instruction for him.<ref name="Count Basie, 1985, p. 33">Count Basie, 1985, p. 33</ref><ref>Count Basie and his Friends, myspace.com</ref>

Not much of a student in school, Basie dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by touring carnivals which came to town. He finished junior high school<ref>Count Basie, 2001, p. 29</ref> but spent much of his time at the Palace Theater in Red Bank, where doing occasional chores gained him free admission to performances. He quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to the acts and the [[silent movie]]s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 32</ref>

Though a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of [[Sonny Greer]], who also lived in Red Bank and became [[Duke Ellington]]'s drummer in 1919, Basie at age 15 switched to piano exclusively.<ref name="Count Basie, 1985, p. 33"/> Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pick-up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson's "Kings of Syncopation".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 33–34, plate 3</ref> When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]] at the [[Jersey Shore]], and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 41</ref>

===Early career===
Around 1920, Basie went to [[Harlem]], a hotbed of jazz, where he lived down the block from the [[The Harlem Alhambra|Alhambra Theater]]. Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was by then the drummer for the Washingtonians, [[Duke Ellington]]'s early band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 51</ref> Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were "making the scene," including [[Willie "the Lion" Smith]] and [[James P. Johnson]].

Basie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including ''Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies'' as part of the ''Hippity Hop'' show; on the [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Keith]], the [[Columbia Burlesque]], and the [[Theater Owners Bookers Association]] (T.O.B.A.) [[vaudeville]] circuits; and as a soloist and accompanist to [[blues]] singers Katie Krippen and Gonzelle White.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 55</ref><ref>Robinson, J. Bradford. ''Count Basie.'' in Kernfeld, Barry. ed. ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1.'' London: MacMillan, 2002. p. 155.</ref> His touring took him to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[St. Louis]], [[New Orleans]], and Chicago. Throughout his tours, Basie met many jazz musicians, including [[Louis Armstrong]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 96</ref> Before he was 20 years old, he toured extensively on the Keith and TOBA vaudeville circuits as a solo pianist, accompanist, and music director for blues singers, dancers, and comedians. This provided an early training that was to prove significant in his later career.<ref>"Bill; William (1904 -1984) Bandleader and Pianist." PBS. PBS, n.d. Web. Nov 30, 2012. <http://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_basie_count.htm></ref>

Back in Harlem in 1925, Basie gained his first steady job at Leroy's, a place known for its piano players and its "[[cutting contests]]." The place catered to "uptown celebrities," and typically the band winged every number without sheet music using "head arrangements."<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 68</ref> He met [[Fats Waller]], who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play that instrument. (Basie later played organ at the Eblon Theater in Kansas City).<ref name="NYT1984">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0821.html |last=Wilson | first= John S. |title= On This Day: Count Basie, 79, Band Leader And Master of Swing, Dead |publisher=New York Times|date=April 27, 1984 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref> As he did with Duke Ellington, Willie "the Lion" Smith helped Basie out during the lean times by arranging gigs at "house-rent parties," introducing him to other leading musicians, and teaching him some piano technique.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 77</ref>

In 1928, Basie was in [[Tulsa]] and heard [[Walter Page]] and his Famous [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]], one of the first [[big band]]s, which featured [[Jimmy Rushing]] on vocals.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 6</ref> A few months later, he was invited to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. It was at this time that he began to be known as "Count" Basie (see [[Jazz royalty]]).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 20</ref>

===Kansas City years===
The following year, in 1929, Basie became the pianist with the [[Bennie Moten]] band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten's ambition to raise his band to the level of Duke Ellington's or [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 116</ref> Where the Blue Devils were "snappier" and more "bluesy," the Moten band was classier and more respected, and played in the "[[Kansas City jazz|Kansas City stomp]]" style.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 120</ref> In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with [[Eddie Durham]], who notated the music.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, plate 10</ref>
Their "[[Moten Swing]]", which Basie claimed credit for,<ref name="Basie2002">{{cite book|last=Basie|first=Count|title=Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8osZnKqbRwQC&pg=PA127|year=2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81107-4|page=127}}</ref> was widely acclaimed and was an invaluable contribution to the development of swing music, and at one performance at the [[Pearl Theatre (Philadelphia)|Pearl Theatre]] in Philadelphia in December 1932, the theatre opened its door to allow anybody in to hear the band perform.<ref name="Daniels2006">{{cite book|last=Daniels|first=Douglas Henry|title=One O'clock Jump: The Unforgettable History of the Oklahoma City Blue Devils|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3tmQ4w1uR8C&pg=PA144|date=January 2006|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-7136-6|page=144}}</ref> 
During a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 122</ref> The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Ben Webster]].

When the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months, calling the group "Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms."  When his own band folded, he rejoined Moten with a newly re-organized band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 146</ref> When Moten died in 1935 after a surgical procedure, the band unsuccessfully tried to stay together but couldn't make a go of it.

Basie formed a new band that year, which included many Moten alumni, with the important addition of tenor player [[Lester Young]]. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece "[[One O'Clock Jump]]."<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 67</ref> According to Basie, "we hit it with the [[rhythm section]] and went into the [[riff]]s, and the riffs just stuck.  We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F." It became his signature tune.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 162</ref>

===John Hammond and first recordings===
[[Image:CountBasieEthelWatersStageDoorCanteen.jpg|right|thumb|Basie and band, with vocalist [[Ethel Waters]], from the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]
At the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as "Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm," moved from Kansas City to Chicago, where they honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Ballroom.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 171</ref> Right from the start, Basie's band was noted for its rhythm section. Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Young complained of [[Herschel Evans]]' vibrato, Basie placed them on either side of the [[alto]] players, and soon had the tenor players engaged in "duels".  Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.<ref>Stanley Dance, ''The World of Count Basie'', Da Capo, New York, 1980, ISBN 0-306-80245-7, p. 68</ref>

In that city in October 1936, the band had a recording session which the producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] later described as "the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever had anything to do with".<ref>1981 interview cited in "The Lester Young Story" (Properbox 16) p14–15</ref> Hammond had heard Basie's band over short-wave radio and went to Kansas City to check them out.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 165</ref> He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings.  Those four sides were released on [[Vocalion Records]] under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were "Shoe Shine Boy", "Evening", "Boogie Woogie", and "Oh, Lady Be Good".  After Vocalion became a subsidiary of [[Columbia Records]] in 1938, "Boogie Woogie" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled ''[[Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44)|Boogie Woogie]]'' (Columbia album C44).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Boogie-Woogie/release/1944476  |title=Various – Boogie Woogie |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>  When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with [[Decca Records]], but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 181</ref>

By then, Basie's sound was characterized by a "jumping" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), [[Freddie Green]] (guitar), [[Jo Jones]] (drums), [[Walter Page]] (bass), [[Earle Warren]] (alto sax), [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry Edison]] (trumpet), [[Benny Morton]] and [[Dickie Wells]] (trombone).<ref>Leonard Feather, ''The Encyclopedia of Jazz'', Bonanza Books, 1960, p.112</ref> Lester Young, known as "Prez" by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie "Holy Man", "Holy Main", and just plain "Holy".<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 104</ref>

Basie favored [[blues]], and he would showcase some of the most notable blues singers of the era after he went to New York: [[Billie Holiday]], [[Jimmy Rushing]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Helen Humes]], and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]]. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band's abilities, such as [[Eddie Durham]] and [[Jimmy Mundy]].

===New York City and the swing years===
When Basie took his orchestra to New York in 1937, they made the Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement).<ref name=nicholson>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Stuart |date=2004 |title=Ella Fitzgerald: A Biography of the First Lady of Jazz, Updated Edition |url= |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=50-51 |isbn= 9781136788130 | oclc=884745086 |quote=Toward the end of 1937, Ella moved again, this time to the Woodside Hotel at 2424 Seventh Avenue at 142nd Street, to be close to Jo Jones, the drummer from the Count Basie band. The band had recently hit town and was playing the Roseland Ballroom, and most of its members were staying at the Woodside...}}</ref> Soon, they were booked at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, "We caught the great Count Basie band which is supposed to be so hot he was going to come in here and set the Roseland on fire.  Well, the Roseland is still standing".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 184</ref> Compared to the reigning band of [[Fletcher Henderson]], Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 107</ref>

The producer John Hammond continued to advise and encourage the band, and they soon came up with some adjustments, including softer playing, more solos, and more standards.  They paced themselves to save their hottest numbers for later in the show, to give the audience a chance to warm up.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 188</ref> His first official recordings for [[Decca Records|Decca]] followed, under contract to agent MCA, including "[[Pennies from Heaven (song)|Pennies from Heaven]]" and "[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 186</ref>

Hammond introduced Basie to [[Billie Holiday]], whom he invited to sing with the band. (Holiday did not record with Basie, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 200</ref> The band's first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with the vocalists Holiday and [[Jimmy Rushing]] getting the most attention.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 190</ref> Durham returned to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part, the orchestra worked out its numbers in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings.  There were often no musical notations made. Once the musicians found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their "head arrangements" and collective memory.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 199</ref>

Next, Basie played at the [[Savoy Ballroom|Savoy]], which was noted more for lindyhopping, while the Roseland was a place for [[fox-trot]]s and [[conga]]s.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 202</ref> In early 1938, the [[Savoy Ballroom|Savoy]] was the meeting ground for a "battle of the bands" with [[Chick Webb]]'s group. Basie had Holiday, and Webb countered with the singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]].  As ''[[Metronome magazine|Metronome]]'' magazine proclaimed, "Basie's Brilliant Band Conquers Chick's"; the article described the evening:
<blockquote>"Throughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick's forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick's brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick's thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 208</ref></blockquote>
The publicity over the big band battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a boost and wider recognition.  Soon after, [[Benny Goodman]] recorded their signature "[[One O'Clock Jump]]" with his band.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 207</ref>

A few months later, Holiday left for [[Artie Shaw]]'s band.  Hammond introduced [[Helen Humes]], whom Basie hired; she stayed with Basie for four years.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 211</ref> When [[Eddie Durham]] left for [[Glenn Miller]]'s orchestra, he was replaced by [[Dicky Wells]].  Basie's 14-man band began playing at the Famous Door, a mid-town nightspot with a [[CBS]] network feed and [[air conditioning]], which Hammond was said to have bought the club in return for their booking Basie steadily throughout the summer of 1938. Their fame took a huge leap.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 217–218</ref> Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from [[Jimmy Mundy]] (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and [[Earl Hines]]), particularly for "Cherokee", "Easy Does It", and "Super Chief".<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 229</ref> In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the [[William Morris]] Agency, who got them better fees.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 247</ref>

On 19 February 1940, Count Basie and his Orchestra opened a four-week engagement at [[Southland (jazz venue)|Southland]] in Boston, and they broadcast over the radio on 20 February.<ref name="Vail2003">{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Ken|title=Count Basie: Swingin' the Blues, 1936-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWZjiRBQJBkC&pg=PA36|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4882-5|page=36}}</ref>
On the West Coast, in 1942 the band did a spot in ''Reveille With Beverly'', a musical film starring [[Ann Miller]], and a "Command Performance" for [[Armed Forces Radio]], with Hollywood stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Carmen Miranda]], [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], and the singer [[Dinah Shore]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 260</ref> Other minor movie spots followed, including ''Choo Choo Swing'', ''Crazy House'', ''Top Man'', ''Stage Door Canteen'', and ''Hit Parade of 1943''.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 262</ref> They also continued to record for OKeh Records and  Columbia Records.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 274</ref> The war years caused a lot of members turn over, and the band worked many play dates with lower pay. Dance hall bookings were down sharply as [[swing music|swing]] began to fade, the effects of the [[1942–44 musicians' strike|musicians' strikes of 1942–44]] and 1948 began to be felt, and the public's taste grew for [[pop music|singers]].

Basie occasionally lost some key soloists. However, throughout the 1940s, he maintained a big band that possessed an infectious rhythmic beat, an enthusiastic team spirit, and a long list of inspired and talented jazz soloists.<ref>"THE BIOGRAPHY OF COUNT BASIE." THE BIOGRAPHY OF COUNT BASIE. Swingmusic.net, n.d. Web. Nov 30, 2012. <http://www.swingmusic.net/Count_Basie.html></ref>

===Post-war and later years===
The big band era appeared to have ended after the war, and Basie disbanded the group. For a while, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra. In 1950, he headlined the [[Universal-International]] short film ''[["Sugar Chile" Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet]].'' He reformed his group as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952. Basie credits [[Billy Eckstine]], a top male vocalist of the time, for prompting his return to Big Band.  He said that  [[Norman Granz]] got them into the [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] club and promoted the new band through recordings on the [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], [[Clef Records|Clef]], and [[Verve Records|Verve]] labels.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 289–290</ref> The [[jukebox]] era had begun, and Basie shared the exposure along with early [[rock'n'roll]] and [[rhythm and blues]] artists. Basie's new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on "head" and more on written arrangements.

Basie added touches of [[bebop]] "so long as it made sense", and he required that "it all had to have feeling". Basie's band was sharing Birdland with such bebop greats as [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Miles Davis]]. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, "so it doesn't matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat".<ref>Dance, 1980, p. 5</ref>  Basie also added [[flute]] to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 281, 304</ref> Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, [[Tommy Turrentine]], [[Johnny Letman]], [[Idrees Sulieman]], and [[Joe Newman (trumpeter)|Joe Newman]] (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, [[Benny Powell]], [[Matthew Gee]] (trombone); [[Paul Quinichette]] and [[Floyd "Candy" Johnson]] (tenor sax); [[Marshal Royal]] and [[Ernie Wilkins]] (alto sax); and [[Charlie Fowlkes]] (baritone sax).<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 293</ref> ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine reported, "(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this."<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 299</ref> In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue [[Ball and Chain (restaurant)|Ball and Chain]] in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.<ref>https://books.google.ca/books?id=KnTSqVu9Zr4C&pg=PA59</ref>

In 1958, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially appreciated in France, The Netherlands, and Germany in the 1950s; these countries were the stomping grounds for many [[expatriate]] American jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. [[Neal Hefti]] began to provide arrangements, notably "[[Lil Darlin']]". By the mid-1950s, Basie's band had become one of the preeminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the "Birdland Stars of 1955", whose lineup included [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Erroll Garner]], [[Lester Young]], [[George Shearing]], and [[Stan Getz]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 315</ref>

In 1957, Basie released the live album ''[[Count Basie at Newport]]''.  "[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]" (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 318</ref> The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a command performance for [[Queen Elizabeth II]], along with [[Judy Garland]], [[Vera Lynn]], and [[Mario Lanza]].<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 323</ref> He was a guest on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]],'' a venue also opened to several other black entertainers. In 1959, Basie's band recorded a "greatest hits" double album ''The Count Basie Story'' ([[Frank Foster (musician)|Frank Foster]], arranger) and "Basie and Eckstine, Inc.": album featuring Billy Eckstine, [[Quincy Jones]] (as arranger) and the Count Basie Orchestra. It was released by Roulette Records, then later reissued by Capitol Records.

Later that year, Basie appeared on a television special with [[Fred Astaire]], featuring a dance solo to "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]", followed in January 1961 by Basie performing at one of the five [[John F. Kennedy]] Inaugural Balls.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 335, 337</ref> That summer, Basie and [[Duke Ellington]] combined forces for the recording ''First Time! The Count Meets the Duke'', each providing four numbers from their play books.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 339</ref>

[[Image:Countbasie.jpg|thumb|Count Basie (left) in concert (Cologne 1975)]]
During the balance of the 1960s, the band kept busy with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 353</ref>

Through steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1980s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as the [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[Cinderfella]]'' (1960) and the [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), playing a revised arrangement of "April in Paris".

During its heyday, ''[[The Gong Show]]'' (1976–80) used Basie's "Jumpin' at the Woodside" during some episodes, while an NBC stagehand named Eugene Patton would dance on stage; Patten became known as "Gene Gene, the Dancing Machine".

==The singers==
Basie hitched his star to some of the most famous vocalists of the 1950s and 1960s, which helped keep the Big Band sound alive and added greatly to his recording catalog. Jimmy Rushing sang with Basie in the late 1930s. Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album ''[[One O'Clock Jump (album)|One O'Clock Jump]]'', and 1956's ''[[Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings]]'', with "[[Every Day I Have the Blues|Every Day (I Have the Blues)]]" becoming a huge hit. With Billy Eckstine on the album ''[[Basie/Eckstine Incorporated]]'', in 1959. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] made some memorable recordings with Basie, including the 1963 album ''[[Ella and Basie!]]''. With the 'New Testament' Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a youthful [[Quincy Jones]], this album proved a swinging respite from her ''Songbook'' recordings and constant touring she did during this period. She even toured with the Basie Orchestra in the mid-1970s, and Fitzgerald and Basie also met on the 1979 albums ''[[A Classy Pair]]'', ''[[Digital III at Montreux]]'', and ''[[A Perfect Match (Ella Fitzgerald album)|A Perfect Match]]'', the last two also recorded live at Montreux.  In addition to [[Quincy Jones]], Basie was using arrangers such as [[Benny Carter]] ''(Kansas City Suite)'', [[Neal Hefti]] ''([[E=MC² (Count Basie album)|The Atomic Mr Basie]])'', and [[Sammy Nestico]] ''(Basie-Straight Ahead)''.

[[Frank Sinatra]] recorded for the first time with Basie on 1962's ''[[Sinatra-Basie]]'' and for a second studio album on 1964's ''[[It Might as Well Be Swing]]'', which was arranged by [[Quincy Jones]]. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966's live ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'' which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London's [[Royal Festival Hall]] with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the [[NSPCC|National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]]. Sinatra later said of this concert "I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting".<ref name="CharlesPignon">Pignon, Charles (2004). ''The Sinatra Treasures,'' Virgin Books, ISBN 1-85227-184-1</ref>

Basie also recorded with [[Tony Bennett]] in the early 1960s—their albums together included the live recording at Las Vegas and ''Strike Up the Band'', a studio album.  Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Other notable recordings were with [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Sarah Vaughan]]. One of Basie's biggest regrets was never recording with [[Louis Armstrong]], though they shared the same bill several times.<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 362</ref> In 1968 Basie and his Band recorded an album with [[Jackie Wilson]] titled ''"Manufacturers of Soul"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jackie-Wilson-Count-Basie-Manufacturers-Of-Soul/master/371537 |title=Jackie Wilson & Count Basie - Manufacturers Of Soul at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/jackie_wilson/manufacturers_of_soul/ |title=Manufacturers of Soul by Jackie Wilson : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>

==Legacy and honors==
[[Image:Basie theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey]]
Count Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog. Basie is remembered by many who worked for him as being considerate of musicians and their opinions, modest, relaxed, fun-loving, dryly witty, and always enthusiastic about his music.<ref>Dance, 1980, pp. 7–8</ref> In his autobiography, he wrote, "I think the band can really ''swing'' when it swings ''easy'', when it can just play along like you are cutting butter."<ref>Count Basie, 1985, p. 370</ref>
