The '''Houston Independent School District''' ('''HISD''') is the largest [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system in [[Texas]], and the seventh-largest in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060309232254/http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/showStory.cfm?ArticleID=6127 Houston ISD automates lunch]. ([http://archive.is/Cr7db Archive]) ''eSchool News online''</ref> Houston ISD serves as a community [[school district]] for most of the city of [[Houston]] and several nearby and insular municipalities in addition to some [[unincorporated areas]]. Like most districts in Texas it is [[independent school district|independent]] of the city of Houston and all other municipal and county jurisdictions. The district has its headquarters in the Hattie Mae White Educational Support Center (HMWESC) in Houston.

In 2013, the school district was rated "met standards" by the [[Texas Education Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2009/index.html|title = 2009 Accountability Rating System|publisher = Texas Education Agency}}</ref>

In the 1920s, at the time [[Edison Oberholtzer]] was superintendent, Hubert L. Mills, the business manager of the district, had immense political power in HISD. He had been in the employment of the district over one decade before Oberholtzer started. By the 1930s the two men were in a power struggle.<ref name=Kirklandp137>Kirkland, p.

In the mid-1960s Gertrude Barnstone and Black board member Hattie Mae White, the sole politically liberal members of the school board, often clashed with more conservative board members in meetings held on Monday nights; the two women made efforts to racially integrate the schools.<ref>Alvarez, Olivia Flores.

Simultaneously [[Mexican Americans]] were being discriminated against when they were being labeled as whites and being put with only [[African Americans]] as part of HISD's desegregation / integration plan.  This kept both Mexican Americans and African Americans away from Anglos while satisfying integration requirements set forth by the 1954 [[Brown v. Board of Education]] court case decision.  Many Mexican Americans took their children out of the public schools and put them in "huelga," or protest schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Subtractive Schooling: U.S. - Mexican Youth and the Politics of Caring - Angela Valenzuela - Google Books|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=haOuu_tcc3kC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=Many+Mexican+Americans+took+their+children+out+of+the+public+schools+and+put+them+in+%22huelga,%22+or+protest+schools&source=bl&ots=SU75N-kd5h&sig=UStub1QBFC137VISbNbzZxpzVJQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBGoVChMI59ah_syHyAIVxSSOCh1yKQiD#v=onepage&q=Many%20Mexican%20Americans%20took%20their%20children%20out%20of%20the%20public%20schools%20and%20put%20them%20in%20%22huelga%2C%22%20or%20protest%20schools&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref> On August 31, 1970 and organized by the [[Mexican-American Education Council]] (MAEC), they began three weeks of boycotts, protests, and picketing.  This action lasted approximately three weeks, during which up to 75% of the student bodies of some high schools participated in the boycotts.  During the protests MAEC demanded twenty issues to be resolved and HISD began rezoning school areas within its jurisdiction in response.  However, this rezoning encouraged "white flight" since minorities were now entering "white schools" in large numbers.<ref>Angela Valenzuela ''Subtractive Schooling: U.S.-Mexican Youth and the Politics of Caring (New York: State University of New York Press, 1999) p. 39-49</ref> At first the district used [[desegregation busing in the United States|forced busing]], but later switched to a voluntary [[magnet school]] program in order to discourage "white flight".<ref name="Wrong3"/>

The district eventually integrated races in a semi-peaceful manner. River Oaks Elementary School became the first school to implement the HISD's Vanguard Program in the Fall of 1972, with a program for 4th-6th graders. This program was initially named the Elementary School For The Gifted. The Vanguard Program name was adopted a year later.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} A [[desegregation busing]] plan, protested by Anglo White westside neighborhoods not wanting their children bused to predominately black schools, was rejected by the court system but [[white flight]] began by the 1970s.<ref name=Davison/>

In 1987 Olivia Munoz, the district's foreign language director, said that an increase in interest in foreign languages prompted the district to add foreign language languages to four high schools.<ref name="Languages">"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3CF0CC3A477D8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM LANGUAGES DRAWING STUDENTS Houston schools increase offerings to meet demands]."

In 1992, the district, under superintendent Frank Petruzielo, massively rezoned Houston schools, moving students from overcrowded ones to underutilized ones. Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD school board member and author of ''Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston'', wrote that Petruzielo accomplished this goal with a minimum of press coverage and controversy by using a participative process that minimized conflict between various Houston neighborhoods.<ref name=McAdamsp57>McAdams, p.

In 1994, after superintendent Petruzielo left the district, the school district voted 6-1 to make Yvonne Gonzalez the interim superintendent; the school district board members described this as a "symbolic" motion as Gonzalez was the first Hispanic interim superintendent. Gonzalez served until [[Rod Paige]] became the superintendent.<ref>Markley, Melanie. "[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1994_1180894 Hispanic named interim HISD superintendent]."

In the 1990s, after voters rejected a $390 million bond package, Paige contracted with [[The Varnett School]]<!--Not YET a public school-->, [[River Oaks Academy]], and [[Wonderland School]] to house 250 students who could not be placed in HISD schools. The schools were paid $3,565 per student. This was 10% lower than the district's own per pupil cost.<ref>Eggers, William D.

As of 2007 several existing HISD schools were converting to [[K-8 school]] setups while other new K-8 schools were opening. Prior to the bond election in November 2007, the district abandoned a proposal to convert several schools into K-8 campuses due to African American neighborhoods communities resisting proposed school consolidations.<ref name=RadcliffeK8>Radcliffe, Jennifer.

===Secession movements===
In 1977, group of citizens in western Houston tried to form Westheimer Independent School District out of a portion of Houston ISD. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] rejected the appeals after formation of the district was denied.

HISD once served the Harris County portion of [[Stafford, Texas|Stafford]], until the [[Stafford Municipal School District]] was established in 1982 to serve the entire city of Stafford. Most of Stafford was in [[Fort Bend ISD]], with a small amount in Houston ISD.<ref>{{cite web

===Reporting of school violence===
A 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' report which asserted that HISD did not report school violence to the police created controversy in the community as teachers, students, and parents expressed concern about the district's downplaying of campus violence.<ref>"[http://www.click2houston.com/education/2629076/detail.html Article Critical Of HISD Security Concerns]," ''[[KPRC-TV]]'' {{wayback|url=http://www.click2houston.com/education/2629076/detail.html |date=20040730004649 }}</ref> HISD officials held a news conference after the publication of the story. During the conference, HISD asserted that ''The New York Times'' published the story in an attempt to discredit the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s new accountability standards for school districts nationwide, which were partly modeled after HISD's system.

===Hurricane Katrina===
In 2005, HISD enrolled evacuees from the areas affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]] who were residing in Houston. The [[NRG Astrodome|Houston Astrodome]], the shelter used for hurricane evacuees, is located within the HISD boundaries.

Many Katrina evacuees stayed for the long term within the Houston ISD boundaries. [[Walnut Bend Elementary School]]'s enrollment increased from around 600 to around 800 with the addition of 184 evacuees; Walnut Bend, out of all of the Houston-area elementary schools, took the most Katrina victims.<ref>"[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/05/katrina/3399167.html Louisiana students distributed unevenly]," ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', October 17, 2005</ref> Nearby Paul Revere Middle School, located in the [[Westchase, Houston, Texas|Westchase]] district, gained 137 Katrina victims. Revere, out of all of the Houston-area middle schools, has taken in the most Katrina victims.

Houston ISD's "West Region," which includes Walnut Bend and Revere, had about one-fifth of Houston ISD's schools but contained more than half of the 5,500 Katrina evacuees in Houston schools.

At the start of the 2006-2007 school year, around 2,900 Hurricane Katrina evacuees were still enrolled in Houston ISD schools. Around 700 of them were held back due to poor academic performance. 41% of evacuee 10th graders and 52% of evacuee juniors were held back.

According to the October 2006 "For Your Information" newsletter, the eleven HISD schools which took the largest number of Katrina evacuees were:
* Elementary schools: Bonham, Foerster, McNamara, [[Walnut Bend Elementary School|Walnut Bend]]
* Middle schools: Fondren, Revere, [[Sharpstown Middle School|Sharpstown Middle]]
* High schools: [[Lee High School (Houston)|Lee]], [[Sharpstown High School|Sharpstown High]], [[Westbury High School (Houston)|Westbury]], [[Westside High School (Houston)|Westside]]

A [[University of Houston]] study concluded that the presence of Katrina evacuees did not impact the test score grades of native Houstonian students.<ref>Radcliffe, Jennifer. "[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6614695.html UH study finds no Katrina effect on grades]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. September 12, 2009. Retrieved on September 12, 2009.</ref>

===District organization===
On December 1, 1994, HISD board members voted to divide HISD into 12 numbered geographic districts; of eleven districts, each district had one to three high schools. The 12th district was an alternative district.<ref>Markley, Melanie. "[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1994_1242308 HISD to divide district into 12 geographic areas]."

Prior to Summer 2005, HISD had 13 administrative districts.  Originally, the number of districts were to be cut to three, but HISD decided on cutting the number to five in fall 2005.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Micro Systems Enterprises===
In 2007 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]], and the [[United States Department of Justice]] began an investigation probing business relationships between Micro Systems Enterprises, a vendor, and HISD. Frankie Wong, former president of Micro Systems, and two [[Dallas Independent School District]] administrators received criminal charges.<ref>Edwards, Wendell.

HISD's magnet (Performing Arts, Science, Health Professions, Law Enforcement, etc.) high schools are{{who|date=November 2010}} considered a model for other urban school districts as a way to provide a high quality education and keep top performing students in the inner city from fleeing to [[private school]]s or [[exurb]]an school districts. Magnet schools are popular with parents and students that wish to escape low-performing schools and school violence. The members of the administration of schools losing students to higher-performing campuses, such as Bill Miller of [[Yates High School]], complained about the effects.<ref>"[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2005_3900502 Transfer policy hinders schools]," ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', September 4, 2005</ref>

There are 55 elementary magnet schools, 30 magnet middle schools, and 27 magnet high schools.  Some magnet schools are mixed comprehensive and magnet programs, while others are solidly magnet and do not admit any "neighborhood" students.

In April 1997 a lawsuit against HISD seeking to end race-based admissions to magnet schools was filed on behalf of two white applicants to [[Lanier Middle School (Houston)|Lanier Middle School]] who were denied admission because the quota for White students was filled. The lawsuit was funded by the group "Campaign for a Color-Blind America".<ref>Gore, p.

==Schools==
{{Main|List of Houston Independent School District schools}} 
In HISD grades [[kindergarten]] through 5 are considered to be elementary school, grades 6 through 8 are considered to be middle school, and grades 9 through 12 are considered to be high school. Some elementary schools go up to the sixth grade.

Every house in HISD is assigned to an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school. HISD has many alternative programs and transfer options available to students who want a specialized education and/or dislike their home schools.

===Characteristics of schools and White enrollment===
Donald McAdams wrote that in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and stronger test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low test scores and little to no parent support.<ref name=McAdamsp59>McAdams, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=4eY4cg07-CAC&pg=PA59&dq=%22Overall,+ethnic+enrollments+in+District+Five+were+almost%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xTt3UpX7GLLksATY_oDoBA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Overall%2C%20ethnic%20enrollments%20in%20District%20Five%20were%20almost%22&f=false 59].</ref> He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children as long as the minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> He added that very poor black children tended to go to their neighborhood schools outside of District 5.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> McAdams also stated that White middle class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, [[English as a second language|non-English speaking]] Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.<ref name=McAdamsp59/>

According to McAdams, the White middle class community accepted minority percentages of around 50% for elementary schools, and for middle and high schools the White community accepted minority percentages of over 70 because classes at those levels were separated by academic ability.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> If percentages of minorities exceeded the tolerable levels at a particular school, white parents withdrew their children from the said school until there were few White people left.<ref name=McAdamsp5960>McAdams, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=4eY4cg07-CAC&pg=PA59&dq=%22Overall,+ethnic+enrollments+in+District+Five+were+almost%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xTt3UpX7GLLksATY_oDoBA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Overall%2C%20ethnic%20enrollments%20in%20District%20Five%20were%20almost%22&f=false 59]-[http://books.google.com/books?id=4eY4cg07-CAC&pg=PA60&dq=%22White+communities+would+support+schools+with+minority+enrollments+up+to+50%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YUx4UtDsF8nesASum4HoBw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22White%20communities%20would%20support%20schools%20with%20minority%20enrollments%20up%20to%2050%22&f=false 60].</ref> According to McAdams, HISD administrators knew about the levels of minority percentages tolerable to White middle class parents.<ref name=McAdamsp59/>

McAdams argued that class was a far more important consideration than race to White parents.<ref name=McAdamsp59/> He stated that despite how "negative" his comments about White HISD residents sounded, many of the White parents were "not necessarily racists" but instead wanted high quality academic instruction in their schools, as methods and instructions for poor children were not suited for middle class children.<ref name=McAdamsp60>McAdams, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=4eY4cg07-CAC&pg=PA60&dq=%22White+communities+would+support+schools+with+minority+enrollments+up+to+50%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YUx4UtDsF8nesASum4HoBw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22White%20communities%20would%20support%20schools%20with%20minority%20enrollments%20up%20to%2050%22&f=false 60].</ref> McAdams argued that the attitude of the White community being willing to send their children to schools with about 50% minority enrollment was more progressive than the previous White attitude around the 1960s which was hostile to any minority enrollment in White schools.<ref name=McAdamsp60/>

Houston ISD's administration building from July 1970 to March 2006 was the {{convert|201150|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Hattie Mae White Administration Building, located at 3830 Richmond Avenue. The facility was labeled the "[[Taj Mahal]]" due to the counter-clockwise circular layout and the split-level floor pattern. The design made it difficult for wheelchair-bound individuals to navigate the building. The complex cost U.S.$6 million. The building had tropical indoor [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]s, causing critics to criticize the spending priorities of the district. When the district considered cutting a popular [[kindergarten]] program for financial reasons, taxpayers voted many board members out of office. The district sold the former complex for $38 million to a company which demolished the site and developed a mixed-use commercial property; demolition began on September 14, 2006. Demolition crews destroyed the Will Rogers Elementary School, an adjacent elementary school located at 3101 Weslayan that closed in spring 2006. The former HISD administration building appears in the film ''[[The Thief Who Came to Dinner]]''.<ref name="Tearing"/>
