The '''Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari''' is an auto racing circuit near the [[Italy|Italian]] town of [[Imola]], {{Convert|40|km|mi|1}} east of [[Bologna]] and {{Convert|80|km|mi|1}} east of the [[Ferrari]] factory in [[Maranello]]. The circuit is named after [[Ferrari]]'s late founder [[Enzo Ferrari|Enzo]] and his son [[Alfredo Ferrari|Dino]] who had died in the 1950s. Before Enzo Ferrari's death in 1988 it was called ''''Autodromo Dino Ferrari''''. The circuit has [[FIA]] Grade 1 license.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/tableaulicencescircuit.pdf|title=LIST OF FIA LICENSED CIRCUITS|date=6 February 2015|publisher=[[FIA]]|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref>

It was the venue for the [[Formula One]] [[San Marino Grand Prix]] (for many years two Grands Prix were held in Italy every year, so the race held at Imola was named after the nearby [[Sovereign state|state]]) and it also hosted the 1980 edition of the [[Italian Grand Prix]], which usually takes place in [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]. When Formula One visits Imola, it is seen as the 'home circuit' of [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and masses of ''[[tifosi]]'' (Ferrari supporters) come out to support the local team.

'''Imola''', as it is colloquially known, is one of the few major international circuits to run in an anti-clockwise direction. ([[Istanbul Park]], [[Korea International Circuit]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit]], [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace]], [[Circuit of the Americas]], and the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] are other anti-clockwise circuits used recently by Formula One.)

==History==
The track was inaugurated as a semi- permanent venue in 1953, and it had no [[chicane]]s, so the run from Rivazza all the way to Tosa, through the pits and the Tamburello was totally flat out, as was the run from Acque Minerali all the way to Rivazza was just a long straight with a few small bends; and the circuit remained in this configuration until 1972. 

In April 1953, the first motorcycle races took place, while the first car race took place in June 1954. In April 1963, the circuit hosted its first Formula One race, as a non-championship event, won by [[Jim Clark]] for [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]. A further non-championship event took place at Imola in [[1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix|1979]], which was won by [[Niki Lauda]] for [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo]].
In 1980 Imola officially debuted in the Formula One calendar by hosting the 50th Italian Grand Prix. It was the first time since the 1948 Edition held at Parco del Valentino that the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza]] did not host the Italian Grand Prix. The race was won by [[Nelson Piquet]] and it was such a success that a new race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was established especially for Imola in 1981. The race was held over 60 laps of the 5 kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 300 kilometres.

The track was also used as part of the finishing circuit for the [[1968 UCI Road World Championships]], which saw Italian cyclist [[Vittorio Adorni]] winning with a lead of 10 minutes and 10 seconds over runner up [[Herman Van Springel]], the second largest winning margin in the history of the championships, after [[Georges Ronsse]]'s victory in [[1928 UCI Road World Championships|1928]]. In addition Adorni's countryman [[Michele Dancelli]] took the bronze and five of the top six finishers were Italian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/giro-ditalia-stage-11-preview-organizers-bring-back-1968-worlds-finish-circuit-in-imola |title=Giro d’Italia stage 11 preview: Organizers bring back 1968 Worlds finish circuit in Imola |last=Fotheringham |first=Alasdair|author-link=Alasdair Fotheringham |date=19 May 2015|website=[[cyclingnews.com]]|access-date=20 May 2015}}</ref> The circuit was also used for stage 11 of the [[2015 Giro d'Italia]], which was won by [[Ilnur Zakarin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/giro-ditalia/stage-11/results |title=Giro d'Italia stage 11: Zakarin motors to win on F1 track in Imola |last1=O'Shea |first1=Sadhbh |date=20 May 2015 |website=[[cyclingnews.com]]|access-date=20 May 2015}}</ref>

==The Tamburello corner==<!-- [[Tamburello (infamous race track corner)]] and [[Tamburello (corner)]] redirect to here -->
{{main|San Marino Grand Prix}}
Despite the addition of the [[chicane]]s, the circuit was subject to constant safety concerns, mostly regarding the flat-out ''Tamburello'' corner, which was very bumpy and had dangerously little room between the track and a concrete wall which protects the Santerno river that runs behind it. In [[1987 San Marino Grand Prix|1987]], [[Nelson Piquet]] had an accident there during practice and missed the race due to injury.  In the [[1989 San Marino Grand Prix]], [[Gerhard Berger]] crashed his [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] at Tamburello after a front wing failure. The car caught fire after the heavy impact but thanks to the quick work of the firefighters and medical personnel Berger survived and missed only one race (the [[1989 Monaco Grand Prix]]) due to burns to his hands.  [[Michele Alboreto]] also had a fiery accident at the Tamburello corner testing his Footwork Arrows at the circuit in 1991 but escaped injury. [[Riccardo Patrese]] also had an accident at the Tamburello corner in 1992 while testing for the Williams team.

==1994 San Marino Grand Prix==
[[Image:Imola-pitlane.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The old pitlane, June 2006.]]
In the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]], during Friday practice [[Rubens Barrichello]] was launched over a curb and into the top of a tyre barrier at the Variante Bassa, knocking the Brazilian unconscious though quick medical intervention saved his life.  During Saturday qualifying Austrian [[Roland Ratzenberger]] crashed head-on into a wall at over 310&nbsp;km/h at the Villeneuve corner after his [[Simtek]] lost the front wing, dying instantly from a [[basilar skull fracture]].  The tragedy continued the next day, when the three-time World Champion [[Ayrton Senna]] lost control of his [[Williams FW16|car]] and crashed into the concrete wall at the Tamburello corner on Lap 7. He [[Death of Ayrton Senna|succumbed]] shortly after impact as a piece of the car had pierced his helmet and skull. In two unrelated incidents, several spectators and mechanics were also injured during the event.

[[Image:GrandPrix Circuit San Marino Changes.svg|thumb|200px|right|Diagram showing the differences between the 1994 and 2006 circuit layouts.]]
In the aftermath, the circuit continued to host Grands Prix, but revisions were immediately made in an attempt to make it safer.  The flat-out Tamburello corner was reduced to a 4th gear left-right sweeper, and a gravel trap was added to the limited space on the outside of the corner.  Villeneuve corner, previously an innocuous 6th gear right-hander into Tosa, was made a complementary 4th gear sweeper, also with a gravel trap on the outside of the corner.  In an attempt to retain some of the quickness and character of the old circuit, the arduous chicane at Acqua Minerali was eliminated, and the Variante Bassa was straightened into a single chicane. Many say that the new circuit configuration is not as good as it used to be as a result of the new chicanes at Tamburello and Villeneuve.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/circuit_guide/4244433.stm|title=Circuit Guide - Imola|author=BBC | date=2006-02-17 | accessdate=2010-01-01 | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/mar/03/formulaone3|title=Imola, San Marino|author=The Guardian | location=London | date=2003-03-03 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

Another modification made to the Imola track is that of Variante Alta, which is situated at the top of the hill leading down to Rivazza and has the hardest braking point on the lap. The Variante Alta, formerly a high-kerbed chicane, was hit quite hard by the drivers which caused damage to the cars and occasionally was the site of quite a few accidents. Before the 2006 Grand Prix, the kerbs were lowered considerably and the turn itself was tightened to reduce speeds and hopefully reduce the number of accidents at the chicane.
[[Image:Imola2007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Imola during reconstruction, March 2007.]]
The Grand Prix was removed from the calendar of the [[2007 Formula One season]].<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5294664.stm|title=San Marino loses Grand Prix race|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=29 August 2006|work=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> SAGIS, the company that owns the circuit, hoped that the race would be reinstated at the October 2006 meeting of the FIA [[World Motorsport Council]] and scheduled for the weekend of 29 April 2007, providing renovations to the circuit were completed in time for the race, but the reinstatement was denied.<ref name="f1.gpupdate.net">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/128578/imola-hopes-to-get-back-on-2007-calendar/|title=Imola hopes to get back on 2007 calendar|accessdate=2011-01-30|date=30 August 2006|work=f1.gpupdate.net}}</ref>

==Recent developments==
Since 2007, the circuit has undergone major revisions. The Variante Bassa [[chicane]] has been removed, making the run from Rivazza 2 to the first Tamburello chicane totally flat-out, much like the circuit in its original fast-flowing days. However the chicane has been reinstalled for motorcycle races.

[[Image:Imola2008.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The new pitbox and start/finish straight, April 2008.]]
The old pit garages and paddock have been demolished and completely rebuilt while the pitlane was extended and resurfaced. The reconstruction overseen by German track architect [[Hermann Tilke]].

In June 2008, with most of the reconstruction work completed, The [[FIA]] gave the track a "1T" rating, meaning that an official Formula One Test can be held at the circuit; circuits require the "1" homologation to host a Formula One Grand Prix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/080623094510.shtml|title=Imola receives '1T' FIA rating|accessdate=2008-09-02|date=30 August 2006|work=en.f1-live.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080721055819/http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/080623094510.shtml| archivedate= 21 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, as of August 2011, the track received a '1' FIA homologation rating after a recent inspection by Charlie Whiting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-imola-eyes-return-with-top-fia-rating|title=F1: Imola Eyes Return With Top FIA Rating|accessdate=2011-09-05|date=5 September 2011}}</ref>

The circuit hosted the [[2008 World Touring Car Championship season|2008 WTCC]] Race of Europe, on 21 September 2008.

In 2011, the [[6 Hours of Imola]] was revived and added to the [[Le Mans Series]] and [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] as a season event.

During June of 2015, the owners of the circuit confirmed they were in talks to return to the Formula 1 World Championship calendar should [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]], whose contract runs out after the {{F1|2016}} season, be unable to make a new deal to keep hosting a round of the world championship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/exclusive-imola-begins-talks-to-save-italian-grand-prix/|title=Exclusive: Imola begins talks to save Italian Grand Prix|work=Motorsport.com|date=15 June 2015|accessdate=11 July 2015}}</ref>

==In media==
In 2010, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] filmed his DVD, ''The Italian Job'' at the Imola circuit as well as [[Lydden Hill Race Circuit]] in England, and the [[Fiorano Circuit]], Ferrari's test track.

In 2012, the BBC's ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' had a segment at the Imola circuit.
