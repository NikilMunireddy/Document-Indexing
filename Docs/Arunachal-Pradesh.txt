'''Arunachal Pradesh''' {{IPAc-en|,|ar|@|,|n|ah|ch|@|l|_|p|r|@|'|d|E|sh}} ([[अरुणाचल प्रदेश]]) is one of the twenty-nine states of the [[India|Republic of India]]. Located in [[northeast India]], it holds the most north-eastern position among the states in the north-east region of India.  Arunachal Pradesh borders the states of [[Assam]] and [[Nagaland]] to the south, and shares international borders with [[Bhutan]] in the west, [[Burma]] in the east and [[China]] in the north. [[Itanagar]] is the capital of the state.

Most of the state, formerly called the [[North-East Frontier Agency]], was ceded to Britain by the [[Tibet (1912–51)|Tibetan government]] with the [[Simla Accord (1914)]]. China does not recognise the legality of that treaty, and [[Sino-Indian border dispute|claims most of the state]] as [[South Tibet]]. The state is seen to have major potential for [[hydropower]] development.<ref name=Wirsing>{{cite book|last=Wirsing|first=Robert G. |title=International Conflict Over Water Resources in Himalayan Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUlW4mb3TzcC&pg=PA103 |year=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0230237834|page=103|author2=Christopher Jasparro |author3= Daniel C.

}}</ref> in [[Sanskrit]], is also known as the ''Orchid State of India'' or the ''Paradise of the Botanists''. Geographically, it is the largest among the North-east Indian states commonly known as the [[Seven Sister States]]. As in other parts of [[Northeast India]], the people native to the state trace their origins to the [[Tibeto-Burman]] people. In recent times,  large number of migrants from various parts of India and other lands have built extensive economic and cultural ties with the state's population.

No reliable population count of the migrant population exists, and the percentage estimating the total actual population accordingly, vary. Arunachal Pradesh has the highest number of regional languages in the Indian subcontinent,<ref>Lonely Planet India</ref> enriched with diverse culture and traditions.

== History ==

===Prehistory===
[[Neolithic]] tools found in Arunachal Pradesh indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least eleven thousand years. The earliest inhabitants of Bhutan and adjoining Himalayan areas of South Asia were the people from [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], whose history predates the onset of [[Bronze Age]] in South Asia around 3300BC before the coming of other ethnic groups from [[Tibet]] and [[South China]] some 2,000 years ago.

=== Early history ===
The history of pre-modern Arunachal Pradesh remains shrouded in mystery. Oral histories possessed to this day by many Arunachali tribes of [[Tibeto-Burman]] stock are much richer and point unambiguously to a northern origin in modern-day Tibet. Again corroboration remains difficult. From the point of view of material culture it is clear that most indigenous Arunachali groups align with Burma-area hill tribals, a fact that could either be explainable in terms of a northern Burmese origin or from westward cultural diffusion.

From the same perspective the most unusual Arunachali group by far is the [[Puroik people|Puroik]]/[[Sulung]], whose traditional staple food is called "tasey" or "taase" made from sago palm and whose primary traditional productive strategy is foraging. While speculatively considered a [[Tibeto-Burman]] population, the uniqueness of Puroik culture and language may well represent a tenuous reflection of a distant and all but unknown pre-Tibeto-Burman, Tai and Indo-Aryan past.

According to the Arunachal Pradesh government, the Hindu texts [[Kalika Purana]] and [[Mahabharata]] mention the region as the Prabhu Mountains of the [[Puranas]], and where sage [[Parashuram]] washed away sins, the sage Vyasa meditated, King [[Bhishmaka]] founded his kingdom, and Lord [[Krishna]] married his consort [[Rukmini]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/tourism.htm|title=Official Web Page of Government of Arunachal Pradesh|publisher=}}</ref>

Recorded history from an outside perspective only became available in the [[Ahom language|Ahom]] and [[Sutiya people|Sutiya]] chronicles. The [[Monpa people|Monpa]] and [[Sherdukpen]] do keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well. Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul, which flourished between 500 B.C. and 600 A.D. This region then came under the loose control of [[Tibet]] and [[Bhutan]], especially in the Northern areas. The remaining parts of the state, especially those bordering [[Myanmar]], were under the control of the [[Sutiya Kingdom|Sutiya Kings]] until the Ahom-Sutiya battle in the 16th century. The [[Ahom people|Ahoms]] held the areas until the annexation of India by the British in 1858. However, most Arunachali tribes remained in practice largely autonomous up until Indian independence and the formalisation of indigenous administration in 1947.

Recent excavations of ruins of Hindu temples such as the 14th century Malinithan at the foot of the Siang hills in [[West Siang]] were build during the [[Sutiya Kingdom|Sutiya reign]]. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar, has led to suggestions that the Idu ([[Mishmi people|Mishmi]]) had an advanced culture and administration in prehistoric times. Again, however, no evidence directly associates Bhismaknagar with this or any other known culture but the [[Sutiya Kingdom|Sutiya rulers]] held the areas around Bhismaknagar from the 12th to 16th century. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old [[Tawang Monastery]] in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth [[Dalai Lama]] [[Tsangyang Gyatso, 6th Dalai Lama|Tsangyang Gyatso]] was born in [[Tawang Town|Tawang]].<ref>[http://www.tibet.cn/t/040616zazc_cyjc/200402004617135758.htm 仓央嘉措生平疏议] (Biography of Cangyang Gyaco; in Chinese) {{wayback|url=http://www.tibet.cn/t/040616zazc_cyjc/200402004617135758.htm |date=20050212163624 |df=y }}</ref>

=== Drawing of McMahon line ===
[[Image:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|right|British map published in 1909 showing the Indo-Tibetan traditional border (''eastern section on the top right'')]]
[[File:1922 Map of India by Bartholomew in Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|British map published in 1922 shows an Indo-Bhutan-Tibetan border different from the 1909 map.]]
In 1913–1914 representatives of China, Tibet and Britain met in India ending with the [[Simla Accord (1913)|Simla Accord]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html |title=Simla Convention |publisher=Tibetjustice.org |date= |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> However, the Chinese representatives refused the territory negotiation. This treaty's objective was to define the borders between Inner and Outer Tibet as well as between Outer Tibet and [[British India]]. British administrator, [[Sir Henry McMahon]], drew up the {{convert|550|mi|km}} [[McMahon Line]] as the border between British India and Outer Tibet during the Simla Conference. The Tibetan and British representatives at the conference agreed to the line and Tibet ceded [[Tawang]] and other Tibetan areas to the British Empire. The Chinese representative had no problems with the border between British India and Outer Tibet; however on the issue of the border between Outer Tibet and Inner Tibet the talks broke down. Thus, the Chinese representative refused to accept the agreement and walked out.{{Citation needed|reason=2009-02-26|date=February 2009}} The Tibetan Government and British Government went ahead with the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Agreement]] and declared that the benefits of other articles of this treaty would not be bestowed on China as long as it stays out of the purview.<ref>Lamb, Alastair, ''The McMahon line: a study in the relations between India, China and Tibet, 1904 to 1914'', London, 1966, p529</ref> The Chinese position was that Tibet was not independent from China, so Tibet could not have independently signed treaties, and per the Anglo-Chinese (1906) and Anglo-Russian (1907) conventions, any such agreement was invalid without Chinese assent.<ref name="int">{{Cite book|title=Aspects of India's International relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|author=Ray, Jayanta Kumar|series=History of science, philosophy, and culture in Indian civilization: Towards independence|publisher=[[Pearson PLC]]|year=2007|isbn=978-81-317-0834-7|page=202}}</ref>

Simla was initially rejected by the Government of India as incompatible with the 1907 [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. However, this agreement (Anglo-Russian Convention) was renounced by Russia and Britain jointly in 1921. However, with the collapse of Chinese power in Tibet, the line had no serious challenges as [[Tibet]] had signed the convention, therefore it was forgotten to the extent that no new maps were published until 1935, when civil service officer [[Olaf Caroe]] called attention to this issue. The [[Survey of India]] published a map showing the McMahon Line as the official boundary in 1937.<ref name="Ray2007">{{cite book|last=Ray|first=Jayanta Kumar|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nyk6oA2nOlgC&pg=PA203|accessdate=20 July 2014|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-0834-7|pages=203–}}</ref> In 1938, the British finally published the Simla Convention as a bilateral accord two decades after the Simla Conference; in 1938 the Survey of India published a detailed map showing Tawang as part of [[North-East Frontier Agency]]. In 1944 Britain established administrations in the area from Dirang Dzong in the west to [[Walong]] in the east. Tibet, however, altered its position on the McMahon Line in late 1947 when the Tibetan government wrote a note presented to the newly independent Indian Ministry of External Affairs laying claims to (Tawang) south of the McMahon Line.<ref>Lamb, 1966, p580</ref> The situation developed further as India became independent and the People's Republic of China was established in 1949. In November 1950, with the PRC poised to take over Tibet, India unilaterally declared that the McMahon Line is the boundary—and, in 1951, forced the last remnants of Tibetan administration out of the Tawang area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/21spec.htm |title=The battle for the border |publisher=Rediff.com |date=23 June 2003 |accessdate=6 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101016133743/http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/21spec.htm| archivedate= 16 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=India's China War |last=Maxwell |first=Neville |year=1970 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |isbn=9780224618878 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/12249475/Indias-China-War-Neville-Maxwell}}</ref> The PRC has never recognised the McMahon Line, and claims Tawang on behalf of Tibetans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/JF27Df01.html|title=China toys with India's border|publisher=[[Asia Times]]|first=Sudha|last=Ramachandran|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=18 September 2010|work=South Asia| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100811003928/http://atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/JF27Df01.html| archivedate= 11 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The [[14th Dalai Lama]], who led the Tibetan government from 1950 to 1959, was quoted in 2003 as saying that Tawang was "actually part of the Tibetan administration" before the Simla Accord.<ref name="tpt">{{cite news |title= Tawang is part of India: Dalai Lama |publisher=TNN |date=4 June 2008 | url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Tawang_is_part_of_India_Dalai_Lama_/articleshow/3097568.cms |accessdate=4 June 2008}}</ref> He clarified his position in 2008, saying that as far as Tibet was concerned "Tawang is part of India".<ref name="tpt"/>

=== Sino-Indian War ===
{{Main|Sino-Indian War}}

The NEFA ([[North-East Frontier Agency]]) was created in 1955. The issue was quiet for nearly a decade, a period of cordial Sino-Indian relations, but the re-emergence of the issue was a major cause of the Sino-Indian War of 1962. The cause of the escalation into war is still disputed by both Chinese and Indian sources. During the war in 1962, the PRC captured most area of Arunachal Pradesh. However, China soon declared victory, voluntarily withdrew back to the [[McMahon Line]] and returned Indian prisoners of war in 1963. The war resulted in the termination of [[barter]] trade with Tibet, although in 2007 the state government has shown signs to resume barter trade with Tibet.<ref>[http://in.news.yahoo.com/061227/48/6amqn.html PM to visit Arunachal in mid-Feb]{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

==== Tawang ====
[[File:Tawang Monastery (Tibetan Buddhist).jpg|thumb|Tawang Monastery (Tibetan Buddhist)]]
In recent years, PR China has occasionally made statements in conjunction with its claims on Tawang. India has rebutted these claims by the Chinese government and the Indian [[Prime Minister]] has informed the Chinese government that Tawang is an integral part of India. India reiterated this to the Chinese prime minister when the two prime ministers met in Thailand in October 2009.

China objected to the visit of the [[Dalai Lama]] to Tawang in November 2009 though the Dalai Lama had previously visited Tawang several times since he left Tibet in 1959. India rejected the Chinese objection and said that the Dalai Lama is an honoured guest in India and could visit any place in India. The Dalai Lama visited Tawang on 8 November 2009. About 30,000 people including those from neighbouring countries, Nepal and Bhutan, attended his religious discourse.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/asia/india/2009/11/10/232126/Thousands-flock.htm Thousands flock to see Dalai Lama in Indian state.]</ref>

He was received and welcomed by the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh and the people of Arunachal Pradesh. The residents of Tawang painted their houses and decorated the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sify.com/news/Dalai-Lama-stresses-on-peace-as-30-000-attend-Tawang-discourse-news-Features-jljl4bihbdd.html|title=Dalai Lama stresses on peace as 30,000 attend Tawang discourse|publisher=[[Sify]]|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>

=== Current name ===
NEFA was renamed as Arunachal Pradesh by Late Sri Bibhabasu Das Shastri, then the director of research, on 20 January 1972 and it became a [[Union Territory]]. Arunachal Pradesh became a state on 20 February 1987.

More recently, Arunachal Pradesh has come to face threats from certain insurgent groups, notably the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (NSCN), who are believed to have base camps in the districts of [[Changlang]] and [[Tirap district|Tirap]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030812/asp/northeast/story_2255514.asp |title=Apang rules out Chakma compromise |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=12 August 2003 |accessdate=6 October 2010 |location=Calcutta, India}}</ref> There are occasional reports of these groups harassing local people and extorting protection money.<ref>[http://in.news.yahoo.com/040611/43/2dkto.html ] {{wayback|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/040611/43/2dkto.html |date=20050508024329 |df=y }}</ref>

Especially along the Tibetan border, the [[Indian army]] has a considerable presence due to concerns about Chinese intentions in the region. [[Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India)|Special permits]] called [[Inner Line Permit]]s (ILP) are required to enter Arunachal Pradesh through any of its checkgates on the border with [[Assam]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Mountains of Arunachal Pradesh.jpg|thumb|A lake at [[Sela Pass|Sela]] on the way to [[Tawang Town|Tawang]] in West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.]]
[[File:Salna Bari , Bhalukpong.jpg|thumb|A view from [[Bhalukpong]], a small town by the southern reaches of the Himalayas.]]

Arunachal Pradesh is located between 26.28° N and 29.30° N latitude and 91.20° E and 97.30° E longitude and has 83,743 square kilometre area.

Most of Arunachal Pradesh is covered by the [[Himalayas]]. However, parts of [[Lohit District|Lohit]], [[Changlang]] and [[Tirap District|Tirap]] are covered by the [[Patkai]] hills. Kangto, Nyegi Kangsang, the main Gorichen peak and the Eastern Gorichen peak are some of the highest peaks in this region of the Himalayas. The land is mostly mountainous with the Himalayan ranges running north south. These divide the state into five river valleys: the Kameng, the Subansiri, the Siang, the Lohit and the Tirap. All these are fed by snow from the Himalayas and countless rivers and rivulets. The mightiest of these rivers is Siang, called the Tsangpo in Tibet, which becomes the Brahmaputra after it is joined by the Dibang and the Lohit in the plains of Assam.

The Himalayan ranges that extend up to the eastern Arunachal separate it from Tibet. The ranges extend toward Nagaland, and form a boundary between India and Burma in Changlang and Tirap district, acting as a natural barrier called Patkai Bum Hills. They are low mountains compared to the Greater Himalayas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.north-east-india.com/arunachal-pradesh/trekking-arunachal.html |title=Trekking in Arunachal, Trekking Tour in Arunachal Pradesh, Adventure Trekking in Arunachal Pradesh |publisher=North-east-india.com |date= |accessdate=6 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100830032326/http://www.north-east-india.com/arunachal-pradesh/trekking-arunachal.html| archivedate= 30 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
The climate of Arunachal Pradesh varies with elevation. Areas that are at a very high elevation in the Upper Himalaya close to the Tibetan border have an alpine or [[tundra]] climate. Below the Upper Himalayas are the Middle Himalayas, where people experience a temperate climate. Areas at the sub-Himalayan and sea-level elevation generally experience humid, sub-tropical climate with hot summers and mild winters.

Arunachal Pradesh receives heavy rainfall of {{convert|2000|to|4100|mm|in}} annually, most of it between May and September. The mountain slopes and hills are covered with alpine, temperate, and subtropical forests of dwarf [[rhododendron]], [[oak]], [[pine]], [[maple]], [[fir]], and [[juniper]]; [[Sal tree|sal]] (''[[Shorea robusta]]'') and [[teak]] are the main economically valuable species.

=== Biodiversity ===
Bio-geographically it lies in the Eastern Himalayan province, the richest biogeographical province of the Himalayan zone which is also classified as the biodiversity hotspot. Arunachal Pradesh is endowed with diverse forests and magnificent wildlife.

Arunachal Pradesh's [[Gross domestic product|gross state domestic product]] was estimated at US$706 million at current prices in 2004 and US$1.75 billion at current prices in 2012. Agriculture primarily drives the economy. Jhum, the local term used for shifting cultivation is being widely practised among the tribal groups, though owing to the gradual growth of other sources of income in the recent years, it is not being practised as prominently as it was earlier. Arunachal Pradesh has close to 61,000 square kilometres of forests, and forest products are the next most significant sector of the economy. Among the crops grown here are rice, maize, millet, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, ginger, and oilseeds. Arunachal is also ideal for horticulture and fruit orchards. Its major industries are rice mills, fruit preservation and processing units, and handloom handicrafts. [[Sawmill]]s and plywood trades are prohibited under law.<ref>[http://www.thisismyindia.com/arunachal-pradesh/arunachal-pradesh-economy.html Arunachal Pradesh Economy], ''This Is My India''</ref>

Arunachal Pradesh accounts for a large percentage share of India's untapped hydroelectric potential. In 2008, the government of Arunachal Pradesh signed numerous memorandum of understanding with various companies planning some 42 hydroelectric schemes that will produce electricity in excess of 27,000 MW.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatogether.org/2008/feb/env-arunachal.htm |title=Massive dam plans for Arunachal |publisher=Indiatogether.org |date= |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> Construction of the [[Upper Siang Hydroelectric Project]], which is expected to generate between 10,000 and 12,000 MW, began in April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article53042.ece|title=India pre-empts Chinese design in Arunachal|work=The New Indian Express}}</ref>

The state, on account of its unrivalled aesthetics and diverse cultural heritage possesses a great tourism potential. Popular tourist attractions include [[Tawang]] (a town with a Buddhist monastery) at 3000&nbsp;m elevation, [[Ziro]] (which holds cultural festivals),Yomcha (limestone caves called 'tapen uru'), the Namdapha tiger project in [[Changlang]] district and Sela lake near [[Bomdila]] with its [[bamboo]] bridges overhanging the river. Religious places of interest include Malinithan in Lekhabali, Rukhmininagar near [[Roing]] (the place as per the popular Hindu mythology, Rukmini, Lord Krishna's wife, said to have lived), and [[Parshuram Kund]] in [[Lohit district]] as [[Puranas]] is the lake where sage [[Parshuram]] washed away his sins,<ref>{{cite web | title = 70,000 devotees take holy dip in Parshuram Kund|publisher=Indian Express | url = http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/70000-devotees-take-holy-dip-in-parshuram-kund/1061283/ |date=Jan 18, 2013| accessdate = 2014-06-29  }}</ref> The Ganga lake(Gyaker sinyi or Gekar Sinyi)and various other tourist hot spots.

The state provides abundant scope for angling, boating, rafting, trekking and hiking. Rafting and trekking are common activities. Some suggested routes for travel or trekking are
* Tezpur–Tipi–Bomdila-Tawang-se la pass
* Tinsukia–Tezu-Parasuramkund
* Margherita–Miao-Namdapha
* Itanagar–Ziro-Daporijo–Along (or Aalo)-pandighat.
* Aalo - Yomcha (52&nbsp;km)

Over the years, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Museum, Itanagar]] has become an important tourist destination in the state capital.<ref name=ita>{{cite web |title=Itanagar |url=http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/itanagar.htm |date= |publisher=[[Government of Arunachal Pradesh]]|quote=Jawaharlal Nehru State Museum.. }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=President to visit Arunachal Pradesh  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2002/10/14/stories/2002101403721300.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |quote=..Jawaharlal Nehru State Museum..|date=14 October 2002 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>

The state is rich in wildlife and has a number of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks with rare animals, birds and plants. Perhaps the highest diversity of mammals in India is in Arunachal Pradesh (200+ species).<ref>Choudhury, Anwaruddin (2003) ''The mammals of Arunachal Pradesh''.

Arunachal Pradesh can be roughly divided into a set of semi-distinct cultural spheres, on the basis of tribal identity, language, religion and material culture: the Tibetic area bordering [[Bhutan]] in the west, the Thanyi area in the centre of the state, the Mishmi area to the east of the Thanyi area, the [[Tai peoples|Tai]]/[[Singpho people|Singpho]]/[[Tangsa]] area bordering Myanmar, and the "[[Naga people|Naga]]" area to the south, which also borders Myanmar. In between there are transition zones, such as the [[Aka (tribe)|Aka]]/[[Hruso people|Hruso]]/[[Miji people|Miji]]/[[Sherdukpen]] area, which provides a "buffer" of sorts between the Tibetic Buddhist tribes and the animist Thanyi hill tribes. In addition, there are isolated peoples scattered throughout the state, such as the Sulung.

Within each of these cultural spheres, one finds populations of related tribes speaking related languages and sharing similar traditions. In the Tibetic area, one finds large numbers of [[Monpa people|Monpa]] tribespeople, with several subtribes speaking closely related but mutually incomprehensible languages, and also large numbers of Tibetan refugees. Within the Thanyi area, major tribes include the [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]], which many people have recently come to apply to encompass the derogatory words; like dafla & Hills Miri. [[Apatani people|Apatani]] also live among the [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]], but are distinct. In the centre, one finds predominantly [[Galo people]], with the major sub-groups of Karka, Lodu, Bogum, [[Lare]] and Pugo among others, extending to the [[Ramo]] and Pailibo areas (which are close in many ways to Galo). In the east, one finds the [[Adi people|Adi]] with many subtribes including [[Padam tribe|Padam]], [[Dusadh|Pasi]], [[Minyong]] and [[Bokar]], among others. [[Milang]], while also falling within the general "Adi" sphere, are in many ways quite distinct. Moving east, the Idu, Miju and Digaru make up the "Mishmi" cultural-linguistic area, which may or may not form a coherent historical grouping.

Moving southeast, the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] [[Khamti people|Khamti]] are linguistically distinct from their neighbours and culturally distinct from the majority of other Arunachalese tribes. They follow the Theravada∞ sect of Buddhism.  They also exhibit considerable convergence with the [[Singpho people|Singpho]] and [[Tangsa]] tribes of the same area, all of which are also found in Burma. Besides, the [[Nocte language|Nocte]] and [[Wancho language|Wancho]] exhibit cultural and possibly also linguistic affinities to the tribes of [[Nagaland]], which they border. 

In addition, there are large numbers of migrants from diverse areas of India and Bangladesh, who, while legally not entitled to settle permanently, in practice stay indefinitely, progressively altering the traditional demographic makeup of the state.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Finally, populations of "Nepalis" (in fact, usually Tibeto-Burman tribespeople whose tribes predominate in areas of Nepal, but who do not have tribal status in India) and [[Chakma people|Chakmas]] are distributed in different areas of the state (although reliable figures are hard to come by).

[[Image:BuddhaTwang.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Buddhism]] is practised by 13% of the population. Shown here is a statue of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] in [[Tawang]], Arunachal Pradesh.]]

Literacy has risen in official figures to 66.95% in 2011 from 54.74% in 2001. The literate population is said to number 789,943. The number of literate males is 454,532 (73.69%) and the number of literate females is 335,411 (59.57%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/Table-2(3)_literacy.pdf |title=Census of India: Provisional Population Tables – Census 2011 |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |date= |accessdate=11 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110409075627/http://www.censusindia.gov.in:80/2011-prov-results/data_files/Table-2(3)_literacy.pdf |archivedate=9 April 2011 }}</ref>

An uncertain but relatively large percentage of Arunachal's population are nature worshippers (indigenous religions), and follow their own distinct traditional institutions like the Nyedar Namlo by the Nyishi, the Rangfrah by the Tangsa & Nocte, Medar Melo by the Apatani, the Kargu Gamgi by the Galo and Donyi-Polo Dere by the Adi under the umbrella of the indigenous religion the Donyi-Polo. A small number of Arunachali people have traditionally identified as [[Hindu]]s, although the number is growing as animist traditions are merged with Hindu traditions. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] predominates in the districts of [[Tawang]], [[West Kameng]], and isolated regions adjacent to [[Tibet]]. [[Theravada Buddhism]] is practised by groups living near the Burmese border. Around 30% of the population are followers of the Christian faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01.html|title=Census of India : C-1 Population By Religious Community|publisher=}}</ref>

A law has been enacted to protect the indigenous religions (e.g., Donyi-Poloism, Buddhism) in Arunachal Pradesh against the spread of other religions, though no comparable law exists to protect the other religions.

As per 2001 census, out of the 705,158 tribals living in Arunachal, 333,102 are Animist (47.24%), 186,617 are Christian (26.46%), 92,577 are Hindu (13.13%), and 82,634 are Buddhist (11.72%).

Out of the 101 recognised tribes, 37 have an animist majority (Nyishi, Adi Gallong, Tagin, Adi Minyong, Adi, Apatani.etc.), 23 have a Christian majority (Wancho,Mossang Tangsa, Bori, Yobin.etc.), 15 have a Hindu majority (Mishmi, Mishing/Miri, Deori, Aka, Longchang Tangsa.etc.) and 17 have a Buddhist majority (Monpa, Khampti, Tawang Monpa, Momba, Singpho, Sherdukpen.etc.).

Modern-day Arunachal Pradesh is one of the linguistically richest and most diverse regions in all of Asia, being home to at least 30 and possibly as many as 50 distinct languages in addition to innumerable dialects and subdialects thereof. Boundaries between languages very often correlate with tribal divisions—for example, Apatani and Nyishi are tribally and linguistically distinct—but shifts in tribal identity and alignment over time have also ensured that a certain amount of complication enters into the picture—for example, Galo is and has seemingly always been linguistically distinct from Adi, whereas the earlier tribal alignment of Galo with Adi (i.e., "Adi Gallong") has only recently been essentially dissolved.

The vast majority of languages indigenous to modern-day Arunachal Pradesh belong to the Paleao-Mongoloid with [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] groups of language family. The majority of these in turn belong to a single branch of Tibeto-Burman, namely Aabhu Thanyi language. Almost all [[Tani languages|Thanyi languages]] are indigenous to central Arunachal Pradesh, including (moving from west to east) speak Thanyi language viz., the Nyishi, the Apatani, the Tagin, the Galo, the Bokar, the Adi, the Padam, the Pasi, and the Minyong. The Thanyi language is noticeably characterised by an overall relative uniformity, suggesting relatively recent origin and dispersal within their present-day area of concentration. Most of the Thanyi languages are mutually intelligible with at least one other Thanyi language, meaning that the area constitutes a [[dialect chain]], as was once found in much of Europe; only Apatani and Milang stand out as relatively unusual in the Thanyi context. Thanyi languages are among the better-studied languages of the region.

To the east of the Thanyi area lie three virtually undescribed and highly endangered languages of the "[[Mishmi]]" group of Tibeto-Burman, [[Idu Mishmi language|Idu]], Digaru and [[Miju Mishmi tribe|Miju]]. A number of speakers of these languages are also found in Tibet. The relationships of these languages, both amongst one another and to other area languages, are as yet uncertain. Further south, one finds the [[Jingpho language|Singpho]] (Kachin) language, which is primarily spoken by large populations in Myanmar, and the [[Nocte language|Nocte]] and [[Wancho language]]s, which show affiliations to certain Naga languages spoken to the south in modern-day Nagaland.

To the west and north of the Thanyi area are found at least one and possibly as many as four Bodic languages, including Dakpa and Tshangla; within modern-day India, these languages go by the cognate but, in usage, distinct designations [[Monpa language|Monpa]] and [[Memba]]. Most speakers of these languages or closely related Bodic languages are found in neighbouring Bhutan and Tibet, and Monpa and Memba populations remain closely adjacent to these border regions.

Between the Bodic and Thanyi areas lie a large number of almost completely undescribed and unclassified languages, which, speculatively considered Tibeto-Burman, exhibit many unique structural and lexical properties that probably reflect both a long history in the region and a complex history of language contact with neighbouring populations. Among them are [[Sherdukpen]], [[Bugun]], [[Aka (tribe)|Aka]]/[[Hruso languages|Hruso]], [[Koro language (India)|Koro]], [[Miji language|Miji]], Bangru and [[Puroik language|Puroik]]/[[Sulung]]. The high linguistic significance these languages is belied by the extreme paucity of documentation and description of them, even in view of their highly endangered status. Puroik, in particular, is perhaps one of the most culturally and linguistically unique and significant populations in all of Asia from proto-historical and anthropological-linguistic perspectives, and yet virtually no information of any real reliability regarding their culture or language can be found in print.

Finally, other then the Bodic and Thanyi language there is also certain migratory languages which are largely spoken by migratory and central Government employees who are serving in the state in different departments and institutions in modern-day Arunachal Pradesh. They are classified as Non-Tribal as per the provisions of the Constitution of India.

Outside of Tibeto-Burman, one finds in Arunachal Pradesh a single representative of the Tai languages language family, spoken by the tribe like the Khampti and Singpho which is closely affiliated to the Shan language of the Myanmar. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates from 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern Burma. In addition to these non-[[Indo-European]] languages, the Indo-European languages [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], English, [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and especially [[Hindi]] are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily as a result of the primary education system—in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking immigrant teachers from Bihar and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India—a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-creolized variety of Hindi as its mother tongue. Despite, or perhaps because of, the linguistic diversity of the region, English is the only official language recognised in the state.

The speakers of major languages of the state according to the 2001 census are Nyishi (208,337), Adi (193,379), Bengali (97,149), Nepali (94,919), Hindi (81,186), Monpa (55,428), Assamese (51,551), Wancho (48,544), Tangsa (34,231), Mishmi (33,522), Mishing (33,381), Nocte (32,591),  and Others (64,711).<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/partb.htm http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/partb.htm] 2001 census language data</ref><ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/parta.htm http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/parta.htm] Scheduled languages, census 2001</ref>

Arunachal Pradesh has two highways: the 336&nbsp;km National Highway 52, completed in 1998, which connects [[Jonai]] with Dirak,<ref>[http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/lsdeb/ls10/ses1/0113099101.htm Oral Answers to Questions September 13, 1991], ''Parliament of India''</ref> and another highway, which connects [[Tezpur]] in Assam with [[Tawang Town|Tawang]].<ref>[http://www.icar.org.in/nrcyak/background.html ] {{wayback|url=http://www.icar.org.in/nrcyak/background.html |date=20070928040347 |df=y }}</ref>
As of 2007, every village has been connected by road thanks to funding provided by the central government. Every small town has its own bus station and daily bus services are available. All places are connected to [[Assam]], which has increased trading activity. An additional National Highway is being constructed following the [[Ledo Road|Stillwell Ledo Road]], which connects Ledo in Assam to Jairampur in Arunachal.
Work on the ambitious 2,400&nbsp;km two-lane [[Trans-Arunachal Highway]] Project announced by Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] on 31 January 2008 on his maiden visit to the state, was scheduled to be completed by 2015–16 but now due to political and social reasons it may take another decade.

In 2014, two major highways were proposed to be built in the state: [[East-West Industrial Corridor Highway, Arunachal Pradesh]] in the lower foot hills of the state and {{convert|2,000|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} Mago-[[Thingbu]] to [[Vijaynagar, Changlang|Vijaynagar]] [[Mago-Thingbu to Vijaynagar Border Road|Arunachal Pradesh Frontier Highway]] along the [[McMahon Line]],<ref name=BR1>{{cite web|title=Top officials to meet to expedite road building along China border|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Top-officials-to-meet-to-expedite-road-building-along-China-border/articleshow/44831871.cms|work=Dipak Kumar Dash|publisher=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=BR2>{{cite web|title=Narendra Modi government to provide funds for restoration of damaged highways|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-narendra-modi-government-to-provide-funds-for-restoration-of-damaged-highways-2020106|work=|publisher=dnaindia|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=BR3>{{cite web|title=Indian Government Plans Highway Along Disputed China Border|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/10/indian-government-plans-highway-along-disputed-china-border/|work=Ankit Panda|publisher=thediplomat.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=BR4>{{cite web |url= http://www.livemint.com/Politics/nqEwdXxkIgrSHPpTSzsFRN/Govt-planning-road-along-McMohan-line-in-Arunachal-Pradesh.html |title= Govt planning road along McMohan line in Arunachal Pradesh: Kiren Rijiju |publisher= Live Mint |accessdate= 2014-10-26}}</ref>  alignment map of which can be seen here <ref>http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20141016/nat7.jpg</ref> and here.<ref>http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/images/state_map.jpg</ref><ref name=BR5>{{cite web |url= http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20141016/nation.htm|title=China warns India against paving road in Arunachal|work=Ajay Banerjee|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate= 2014-10-26}}</ref>

=== Railway ===
Arunachal Pradesh got its first railway line in late 2013 with the opening of the new link line from Harmuti on the main [[Rangia-Murkongselek section|Rangpara North-Murkongselak railway line]] to Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh. The construction of the 33 kilometre {{RailGauge|1676mm}} [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] railway line was completed in 2012, and the link became operational after the gauge conversion of the main line under [[Project Unigauge]]. The state capital Itanagar was added to the Indian railway map on 12 April 2014 via the newly built 20 kilometre Harmuti-Naharlagun railway line, when a train from Dekargaon in [[Assam]] reached [[Naharlagun railway station]], 10 kilometres from the centre of Itanagar, a total distance of 181 kilometres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/travel/arunachal-pradesh-capital-itanagar-put-on-indias-railway-map-139950.html|title=Arunachal Pradesh Capital Itanagar Put On India's Railway Map|work=indiatimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-04-12/news/49080232_1_harmuti-railway-map-arunachal-pradesh|title=Arunachal Pradesh now on railway map, train reaches Naharlagun, a town near capital Itanagar|work=timesofindia-economictimes}}</ref>
