{{2012 Summer Paralympics Sidebar}}

The '''2012 Summer Paralympics''', the fourteenth [[Summer Paralympic Games]], and also more generally known as the '''London 2012 Paralympic Games''', were a major international [[multi-sport event]] for [[Disabled sports|athletes with disabilities]] governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC), that took place in [[London]], [[England]] from 29 August to 9 September 2012. These Paralympics were one of the largest multi-sport events ever held in the [[United Kingdom]] after the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], and were the largest Paralympics ever: 4,302 athletes from 164 [[National Paralympic Committee]]s participated, with fourteen countries appearing in the Paralympics for the first time ever. A total of 503 events in 20 sports were held during these games; for the first time since their suspension after the [[2000 Summer Paralympics|2000 Paralympics]], events for the [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] were also held in selected sports.

The lead-up to these games prominently emphasized the return of the Paralympic movement to its spiritual birthplace: in 1948, the British village of [[Stoke Mandeville]] first hosted the [[IWAS World Games|Stoke Mandeville Games]], an athletics event for disabled British veterans of the [[Second World War]] held to coincide with the opening of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in London. They were the first-ever organized sporting event for disabled athletes, and served as a precursor to the modern Paralympic Games.<ref name=guardian-massmarket/><ref name=bbc-phistory>{{cite news|title=History of the Paralympics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/3628745.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=6 July 2004}}</ref> Stoke Mandeville also co-hosted the [[1984 Summer Paralympics]] with [[Long Island]], New York, after its original host, the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], pulled out due to financial issues.<ref name=sml-1984>{{cite web|title=Mandeville Legacy: Stoke Mandeville 1984|url=http://www.mandevillelegacy.org.uk/page_id__40_path__0p4p14p22p.aspx|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>
 
Organizers expected the Games to be the first Paralympics to achieve [[mass market|mass-market]] appeal, fuelled by continued enthusiasm from the British public following the country's [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|successful performance at the Summer Olympics]], awareness of the United Kingdom's role in the history of the Paralympics, public attention surrounding South African sprinter [[Oscar Pistorius]] (who, only just prior to the Paralympics, became the first double amputee to compete in the Summer Olympics alongside able-bodied athletes), a major marketing campaign instituted by the Games' local broadcaster, and growing media coverage of [[Paralympic sports|Paralympic sport]]. The games ultimately met these expectations, breaking records for ticket sales, heightening the profile of the Paralympics in relation to the Olympics, and prompting IPC president [[Philip Craven]] to declare them the "greatest Paralympic Games ever."<ref name=guardian-massmarket/><ref name=guardian-emotional-finale>{{cite news|title=Paralympics closing ceremony review: an emotional and fiery finale|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/09/paralympics-closing-ceremony-finale-coldplay| work = [[The Guardian]] |accessdate=12 September 2012|location=London|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=9 September 2012}}</ref>

==Development and preparation==
{{Main|2012 Summer Olympic development}}
As with the Olympics, the 2012 Summer Paralympics were overseen by [[LOCOG]] and the [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] (ODA). LOCOG was responsible for overseeing the staging of the games, while the ODA dealt with infrastructure and venues.<ref>{{Citation |author=London 2012|authorlink=LOCOG|year=2005|title=LOCOG Formally Established|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/news/media-resources/manual-news/1999-2009/2005/10/07/london-2012-locog-formally-established/|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author=Olympic Delivery Authority|authorlink=Olympic Delivery Authority |year=2007 |title=Annual Report and Accounts 2006-2007|publisher=Olympic Delivery Authority|publication-place= London|page=10|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/250791/0741.pdf|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

The [[Government Olympic Executive]] (GOE) within the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) was the lead Government body for co-ordinating the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. The GOE reported through the DCMS Permanent Secretary to the Minister for Sports and the Olympics [[Hugh Robertson (politician)|Hugh Robertson]]. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management and the [[London 2012 Olympic Legacy]].<ref>{{Citation|author=Government Olympic Executive|authorlink=Government Olympic Executive|year=2011|title=London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Annual Report February 2011|publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport|publication-place= London|page=2|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/77633/DCMS_GOE_annual_report_february_2011.pdf|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

===Venues and infrastructure===
[[File:ParalympicCyclingatBrandsHatch.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Brands Hatch]] circuit hosted [[road cycling]] during the Paralympics.]]
{{Further|Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics}}
The 2012 Summer Paralympics used many of the same venues as the 2012 Summer Olympics, along with several new locations such as [[Eton Manor]] for wheelchair tennis and [[Brands Hatch]] for road cycling.<ref name=guardian-paraprep/> London's purpose-built Olympic venues and facilities, including the Olympic Village itself, were designed to be accessible as possible so they could easily accommodate the Paralympics. Some venues also contained additional accessible seating areas during the Paralympics.<ref name=guardian-paraprep>{{cite news|title=London 2012: let the Paralympics preparations begin|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/13/london-2012-paralympic-preparations-begin?newsfeed=true| work = [[The Guardian]] |accessdate=18 August 2012|first=Alexandra|last=Topping|date=13 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=paralympic-twists>{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=Paralympics reignite the Olympic buzz but with added twists|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/london-paralympics-olympics-differences-similiarities?newsfeed=true| work = [[The Guardian]] |accessdate=31 August 2012|location=London|date=30 August 2012}}</ref>

===Public transport===
{{See also|2012 Summer Olympics#Public transport}}
[[Transport for London]] operated the Paralympic Route Network (a downsized version of the Olympic Route Network operated during the Summer Olympics) to facilitate road traffic between venues and facilities. The network provided {{convert|8.7|mi|abbr=off}} of lanes specifically reserved for Paralympic athletes and officials.<ref name=lm-prn>{{cite web|title=London sets out road plans for Paralympics|url=http://www.logisticsmanager.com/Articles/19021/London+sets+out+road+plans+for+Paralympics.html|publisher=Logistics Manager|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> TfL continued to operate its ''Get Ahead of the Games'' website during the Paralympics, which provided updates and advice for commuters during the Games.<ref name=les-cycling>{{cite news |title=The Olympic commute...

He feared that the end of the school summer holiday (which fell during the Games) would result in increased traffic, and that commuters might not heed traffic warnings or change their [[travel behavior|travel behaviour]] as they had during the Olympics.<ref name=guardian-transport>{{cite news|title=Transport fears as Paralympic ticket sales surge|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/12/paralympic-games-london-transport-fears?newsfeed=true| work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 August 2012|location=London|first1=Gwyn|last1=Topham|first2=Alexandra|last2=Topping|date=12 August 2012}}</ref>

[[Sevenoaks railway station]] was designated as the preferred station for spectators travelling to watch the cycling at [[Brands Hatch]]. Organisers chose Sevenoaks over the closer [[Swanley railway station]] because of its "existing step-free access and excellent transport links", and because Swanley did not yet have a [[wheelchair lift]]. Whilst organisers did not believe that Swanley would be able to have wheelchair lifts installed by the start of the Paralympics, the station finished their installation by early August 2012.<ref name=bbc-swanley-lifts>{{cite news|title=New station lifts open in time for Paralympics|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-19258777|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 August 2012|date=14 August 2012}}</ref>

===Lead-up and promotion===
[[File:London 2012 countdown clock (1).jpg|thumb|A digital clock in [[Trafalgar Square]], counting down to the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics]]

====Handover ceremony====
The formal handover occurred during the closing ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] in Beijing, when [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]] received the [[Paralympic flag#Flag|Paralympic Flag]] from Mayor of Beijing [[Guo Jinlong]]. This was followed by a cultural presentation by Britain, which was similar to its presentation during the [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|Olympics' closing ceremony]]. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the [[Royal Ballet]], and [[Candoco]], a [[physically integrated dance]] group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by [[Ade Adepitan]], to music composed by [[Philip Sheppard (musician)|Philip Sheppard]]. The top of the bus was open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as [[Tower Bridge]], [[30 St Mary Axe|The Gherkin]] and the [[London Eye]]. [[Cherisse Osei]], drummer for [[Mika (singer)|Mika]], and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus folded up into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.london2012.com/documents/press-kits/paralympic-handover-media-guide.pdf |title=Media guide to the London 2012 Paralympic Games Handover segment, Closing Ceremony, Beijing 2008 Games. |publisher=London 2012 |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref> Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] on 26 September 2008.

====Paralympic Day and Super Saturday====

On 8 September 2011 [[Trafalgar Square]] staged ''International Paralympic Day'', hosted by [[Rick Edwards]], [[Ade Adepitan]] and [[Iwan Thomas]], to coincide with a visit to London by representatives of the IPC. The event celebrated the Paralympic Games, showcasing and demonstrating the 20 sports that would feature during the Games (with some sessions also made inclusive to people with hearing disabilities). It also featured appearances by Paralympic athletes [[Oscar Pistorius]], [[Ellie Simmonds]] and [[Sascha Kindred]], and the unveiling of a bronze statue of Pistorius by [[Ben Dearnley]]. British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and London's mayor Boris Johnson also appeared.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/london-2012-host-international-paralympic-day-september-2011|title=London 2012 to Host International Paralympic Day in September 2011|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14819063 | publisher=BBC News | title=London 2012: David Cameron visits Paralympic Day | date=8 September 2011}}</ref> Two days later on 10 September, supermarket chain [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Channel 4]] presented ''Sainsbury's Super Saturday'', a family event at [[Clapham Common]]. The event featured showcases of Paralympic sports, and a concert featuring pop music acts including [[Nicola Roberts]], [[Olly Murs]], [[The Wanted]], [[Will Young]], [[Pixie Lott]], [[Dappy]], [[Sugababes]], [[The Saturdays]], [[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]] and [[Taio Cruz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://j-sainsbury.co.uk/media/events/2011/20110910-sainsburys-super-saturday/|title=Sainsbury's Super Saturday|publisher=J Sainsbury plc|accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/paralympics/summer-paralympics/2012/109672-sainsburys-super-saturday-is-a-hit-as-pop-stars-help-promote-london-2012-paralympics|title=Sainsbury’s Super Saturday is a hit as pop stars help promote London 2012 Paralympics|publisher=Inside the Games|author= Tom Degun|date=10 September 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref>

====Channel 4 promotional campaign {{anchor|Channel 4 television advert}}====
[[Channel 4]], the host broadcaster of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the United Kingdom, promoted its coverage of the Games with a multi-platform advertising campaign that included television adverts, online content, and [[billboard advertising]], some of which carrying the tagline "Thanks for [[2012 Summer Olympics|the warm-up]]." Overall, Channel 4's campaign aimed to change the public's view of the Paralympics, encouraging viewers to see the Games as an "event in its own right" rather than as an afterthought to the Olympics.<ref name=time-londonpromotion>{{cite news|title=After the 2012 London Olympics, Will Sponsors Embrace the Paralympics?|url=http://olympics.time.com/2012/09/07/after-london-2012-will-sponsors-and-media-finally-embrace-the-paralympics/|work=Time|accessdate=5 January 2014|date=7 September 2012}}</ref> As part of the campaign, Channel 4 produced a two-minute-long trailer for its coverage entitled ''Meet the Superhumans'', which was directed by Tom Tagholm with input from Deborah Poulton, 2012 Paralympic Project Leader and Alison Walsh, Editorial Manager of Disability, both at Channel 4. The trailer, set to [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s song "[[Harder Than You Think]]", focused on the competitive and "superhuman" aspects of Paralympic sport, while acknowledging the personal events and struggles that reflected every athlete's participation in the Games. ''Meet the Superhumans'' premiered on 17 July 2012, and aired simultaneously as a "roadblock" advert on 78 different commercial television channels in the UK (which included rival channels [[ITV1]] and [[Sky1]]).<ref name=adott-c4paralympics>{{cite web|title=Ad of the Day: Paralympic Games Forget the Olympics.

The advert was met with critical acclaim: ''[[Adweek]]'''s Tim Nudd declared it "the summer's most stunning sports commercial",<ref name=adott-c4paralympics/> while Simon Usborne of ''[[The Independent]]'' felt it was "an act of branding genius" and "a clear bid to bring the Paralympics from the sporting wings to centre stage."<ref name=ind-c4para/> The advert was seen by an estimated audience of 10 million viewers; Channel 4's marketing and communications chief Dan Brooke estimated that reaction to the advert through [[social media]] was double that of the première of the BBC's trailer for its Olympics coverage.<ref name=adott-c4paralympics/><ref name=ind-c4para/>

''Meet the Superhumans'' won a Golden Lion award at the [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity|Cannes Lions Festival]] in June 2013, losing the overall award to ''[[Dumb Ways to Die]]''. [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty|Sir John Hegarty]], the jury president said of it: "When you've got some really outstanding work it is tragic in some ways it can't get a bigger award, but there can only be one grand prix", while jury member Carlo Cavallone added "[Meet the Superhumans] is an amazing campaign, one of the golds that went through [the judging process] immediately ... Everyone felt it had the highest level of craft. It puts an issue that was really important before London 2012 to raise awareness of the Paralympics [and] they were hyper successful … ''Dumb Ways to Die'' was a tough contender."<ref>{{cite news|title=Cannes Lions: Dumb Ways to Die scoops top award|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jun/22/cannes-lions-advertising-awards|work = [[The Guardian]] |date=22 June 2013|accessdate=23 June 2013|location=London|first=Mark|last=Sweney}}</ref>

In August 2009 [[Royal Mail]] unveiled a series of 30 stamps (reflecting the 30th Olympiad) about the coming Olympic and Paralympic Games. They were released in batches of ten between 2009 and July 2011; each stamp featured an Olympic or Paralympic sport and the London 2012 logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmailgroup.com/royal-mail-launches-major-series-olympic-stamps-london-2012|title=Royal Mail launches major series of Olympic Stamps for London 2012 |publisher=Royal Mail Group |date=24 August 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/summer-olympics/2012/13670-royal-mail-releases-final-set-of-2012-olympic-stamps |title=Royal Mail releases final set of 2012 Olympic stamps &#124; London 2012 |publisher=insidethegames.biz |date=22 July 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14244890 | publisher=BBC News | title=Year-to-go Olympic stamps unveiled by Royal Mail | date=22 July 2011}}</ref>

As it had done during the Olympics, Royal Mail honoured Britain's Paralympic gold medallists by painting a [[post box]] gold in each of their home towns (along with an additional post box outside the [[National Spinal Injuries Centre]] in [[Stoke Mandeville]], in honour of its role in the Games' history),<ref name="Pock Post">{{cite news|title=Gold Post Boxes Launched For ParalympicsGB Gold Medal Winners|url=http://www.pocklingtonpost.co.uk/community/gold-post-boxes-launched-for-paralympicsgb-gold-medal-winners-1-4876138|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=Pocklington Post|date=29 August 2012}}</ref> and featured them on commemorative stamps released throughout the Games.<ref name=rm-stamps/><ref name=guardian-rmstamps/> Royal Mail originally planned only to release a series of six stamps with group portraits of Britain's medallists; however, the decision was met with backlash from critics, who argued that the organization was discriminating against Paralympians by not granting them the same individual recognition as their Olympian counterparts.<ref name=rm-stamps/> Olympic [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow minister]] [[Tessa Jowell]] was also critical of Royal Mail's plan, saying that the stamps were a symbolic aspect of Britain's celebration of the Olympics and that "it would be a shame if this important symbol was not offered to our Paralympian heroes as well."<ref name=guardian-rmstamps/>

Royal Mail initially defended its decision, arguing that it would have been "logistically and practically impossible" to issue individual stamps for each gold medallist, since it expected the British team to meet or exceed its performance at Beijing of 42 gold medals.<ref name=rm-stamps>{{cite news|title=Royal Mail defends decision to deny Paralympic gold medallists own stamps|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/08/royal-mail-defends-paralympic-stamps| work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 August 2012|location=London|first=Matthew|last=Taylor|date=8 August 2012}}</ref> As a result of the criticism, Royal Mail announced on 15 August 2012 that it would release individual stamps for each British gold medallist during the Paralympics.<ref name=guardian-rmstamps>{{cite news|title=Royal Mail will issue stamp for every UK Paralympic gold medal winners|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/15/royal-mail-pressure-paralympics-stamps?newsfeed=true| work = [[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 August 2012|location=London|first=Alexandra|last=Topping|date=15 August 2012}}</ref>

====Test events====
{{main|London Prepares series}}
Several Paralympics-specific events were held during the [[London Prepares series]] of test events for the Olympic and Paralympic Games; these included the London International [[Goalball]] Tournament, and the London Disability Grand Prix—which was also the first Paralympic event to be held at London's Olympic Stadium.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/london_2012/9397066.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=London 2012 test events unveiled | date=24 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=bbc-para-goalball>{{cite web|title=GB goalball hopeful on Paralympic place after test event|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/16033528|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref>

The Paralympic torch relay began on 22 August, when groups of [[Community integration|disabled and non-disabled]] [[Scouting and Guiding in the United Kingdom|scouts]] kindled four Paralympic flames on the highest peaks of each nation of the United Kingdom; [[Scafell Pike]] in England, [[Ben Nevis]] in Scotland, [[Slieve Donard]] in Northern Ireland, and [[Snowdon]] in Wales. On 24 August the four flames were used to light ceremonial cauldrons in London, [[Edinburgh]], [[Belfast]] and [[Cardiff]] during special "Flame Festival" events; smaller "Flame Celebration" events were also held in various communities over the [[bank holiday]] weekend.<ref name=bbc-torchrelay/><ref name=ind-relay>{{cite news|title=Mountain cauldrons will spark Paralympic torch relay|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympics/mountain-cauldrons-will-spark-paralympic-torch-relay-8050170.html|work= [[The Independent]]|accessdate=19 August 2012|location=London|first=Jerome|last=Taylor|date=15 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=telegraph-relaybegin>{{cite news|title=Paralympics 2012: flames lit across Britain at the start of Paralympic torch relay celebrations|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9492379/Paralympics-2012-flames-lit-across-Britain-at-the-start-of-Paralympic-torch-relay-celebrations.html| work = [[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=23 August 2012|location=London|first=Tim|last=Williams|date=22 August 2012}}</ref>

===Ticketing===
2.7 million tickets were offered in total, including event-specific tickets and those granting access solely to the Olympic Park, along with multi-event passes offered for ExCeL London and Olympic Park that were intended to allow spectators to discover a variety of Paralympic events.<ref name="paralympic-twists"/><ref name=bbc-27million/> Unlike previous Paralympics, tickets were in extremely high demand, and the ticket allocation was increased from the originally planned 2.5 million. Whilst the period during the Olympics has historically been the busiest for Paralympic sales, 1.4 million tickets were already sold before the start of the Summer Olympics, already surpassing the total number sold in Sydney.<ref name=ind-snapped>{{cite news|title=2.1m Paralympic tickets snapped up|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympics/21m-paralympic-tickets-snapped-up-8022473.html| work = [[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 August 2012|location=London|first=Helen|last=William|date=8 August 2012}}</ref> The high demand resulted in technical issues with the [[Ticketmaster]]-operated website, which led to complaints via [[social networking service]]s by users who were struggling to order.<ref name=dm-raceon>{{cite news|title=Race is on for Paralympic seats: Event set to sell out... that's if you can actually buy a ticket|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2187994/Paralympics-2012-Event-set-sell--thats-actually-buy-ticket.html| work = [[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=15 August 2012|location=London|first1=Paul|last1=Sims|first2=James|last2=Burman|date=13 August 2012}}</ref>

===Opening ceremony===
[[File:Paralympic flames.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Paralympic cauldron.]]
{{main|2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony}}
The opening ceremony was held on 29 August at the Olympic Stadium. It was inspired by [[William Shakespeare]]'s play "[[The Tempest]]" and themed around the concept of "Enlightenment". It featured appearances by [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]], along with actors [[Ian McKellen]] and [[Nicola Miles-Wildin]] playing the roles of [[Prospero]] and [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] from "The Tempest". The ceremony also featured a performance by British electronic music group [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]].<ref name=guardian-oczip/> The leading UK disabled theatre company [[Graeae Theatre Company|Graeae]] played their version of the polio survivor [[Ian Dury]]'s 1981 protest song '[[Spasticus Autisticus]]'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgemckay.org/spasticus-autisticus-at-the-paralympics-opening-ceremony/|title=Spasticus Autisticus at the Paralympics opening ceremony|last1=McKay|first1=George |date=30 August 2012|accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref>

The final bearers of the Paralympic flame represented several generations of Paralympic athletes. Joe Townsend, a [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] who lost both of his legs after stepping on a [[land mine]] on duty in [[Afghanistan]] (who represented the future, as he plans to compete [[2016 Summer Paralympics|in Rio]]), delivered the flame to Olympic Stadium via a [[zipline]] from the [[ArcelorMittal Orbit]] tower. He passed the flame to long-time British [[Five-a-side football]] captain [[David Clarke (five-a-side footballer)|David Clarke]], who then passed it to the lighter of the [[2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron|Paralympic cauldron]], [[Margaret Maughan]], who was the winner of Britain's first gold medal at the [[1960 Summer Paralympics|first official Paralympics]], in Rome.<ref name=guardian-oczip>{{cite news|title=Paralympics 2012 opening ceremony: Games launched on a storm of ideas|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/paralympics-2012-opening-ceremony-games-launched-storm-ideas?newsfeed=true| work = [[The Guardian]] |accessdate=30 August 2012|location=London|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=30 August 2012}}</ref>

{{Main|2012 Summer Paralympics medal table}}
This table is based on the medal count of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).<ref>{{cite web| author = Database | date = | url=http://www.paralympic.org/results/historical|title=Medal Standings - London 2012 Paralympic Games|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate= 22 April 2014}}</ref>

The ranking is sorted primarily by the number of gold medals earned by a National Paralympic Committee (NPC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC Country Code.

Broadcast rights to the 2012 Summer Paralympics were sold to local broadcasters by LOCOG, with production of the world feeds sub-contracted to [[Olympic Broadcasting Services]] (OBS). The Games saw a significant growth in media coverage for the Paralympics; LOCOG reached deals with over 36 broadcasters to televise the Games in over 100 countries. LOCOG chief [[Sebastian Coe]] stated that "beyond how the commercial value of this package has raised the bar financially for the Paralympic movement, the fantastic broadcast coverage we have agreed will help us take advantage of this opportunity to inspire disabled people of all ages to take up sport and be a catalyst for continued change in public attitudes towards disability." LOCOG reached deals with broadcasters such as [[China Central Television]], the [[Korean Broadcasting System]], [[NHK]], [[Rede Globo]] and [[SporTV]] in [[Brazil]], the TV Pool (a consortium of free-to-air broadcasters in [[Thailand]] consisting of [[Channel 3 (Thailand)|Channel 3]], [[Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Channel 5|Channel 5]], [[BBTV Channel 7]], and [[Modernine TV]]), and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] to air coverage.<ref name=guardian-massmarket/><ref name=nation-scramble-thisisthetvpool>{{cite web|title=Scramble to prevent blank TVs|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Scramble-to-prevent-blank-TVs-30185620.html| work = [[The Nation]]|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=telegraph-paralympictv>{{cite news|title=London 2012 Paralympics: organisers hail record broadcast deals|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9226149/London-2012-Paralympics-organisers-hail-record-broadcast-deals.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=25 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=guardian-paralympictv>{{cite web|title=Paralympics TV deals break new ground as ticket rush continues|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/27/paralympics-tv-deals-ticket-rush|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref> The games were to be broadcast on television in the United Kingdom by [[Channel 4]], replacing long-time Paralympic broadcaster [[BBC Sport|BBC]] in a £9 million deal; the [[BBC]] still held radio rights, with coverage on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra|5 Live Sports Extra]].<ref name=bbc-c4paralympics>{{cite news|title=Channel 4 lands 2012 Paralympics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/london_2012/8448236.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=8 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| date = 16 August 2012 | title=BBC Paralympic Coverage Details|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/19118962|publisher= [[BBC Sport]]|accessdate= 9 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="telegraph-adverts"/> The IPC [[webcast]] approximately 780 hours of its coverage through its [[YouTube]] channel, with four streams of coverage in [[English language|English]] and one in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-announce-london-2012-livestream-commentators |title=IPC Announce London 2012 Livestream Commentators |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]] |date=16 August 2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>

Channel 4's coverage of the Games was billed as the most extensive Paralympic coverage ever broadcast in the United Kingdom; it promised over 150 hours of live coverage throughout the Games on Channel 4 and sister channel [[More4]], and additional coverage online and through special channels carried by [[Freesat]], [[BSkyB|Sky]] and [[Virgin TV]] (in both standard and high definition). The broadcaster also invested around £600,000 towards training new on-air personalities with expertise in disability sports for the Games, many of whom were disabled themselves—they would also be joined by ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' anchor [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]], and BBC Sport personality [[Clare Balding]]. Channel 4 also broadcast supplemental programming to lead towards the Games, such as Paralympic-focused documentaries, other IPC championships, and ''That Paralympic Show'', a weekly program focusing on disability sports.<ref name=bbc-c4paralympics/><ref name="telegraph-adverts"/><ref name=dailymail-balding>{{cite news|title=INSIDE THE BOX: Balding's got Channel 4 jumping for joy as she gets on her marks to front Paralympic broadcast|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2189570/Clare-Baldings-got-Channel-4-jumping-joy-gets-marks-Paralympic-broadcast.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=16 March 2014|location=London|first=Dan|last=Wootton|date=16 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=bnow-c4paralympics>{{cite web|title=C4 opens Paralympic tender process|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/c4-opens-paralympic-tender-process/5064735.article|work=Broadcast Now|accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-to-be-the-paralympic-broadcaster-in-the-uk-in-2012|title=Channel 4 to be the Paralympic Broadcaster in the UK in 2012|date=8 January 2010|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|page=3|accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/unprecedented-rolling-coverage-london-2012 |title=Unprecedented Rolling Coverage for London 2012 |publisher=Paralympic.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=ds-c4paralympics>{{cite web|title=Channel 4 starts Paralympic Games push|url=http://www.digitalspy.ca/media/news/a258640/channel-4-starts-paralympic-games-push.html|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref> During the Games, comedian [[Adam Hills]] (who himself was born without a right leg, and hosted the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s coverage of the [[2008 Summer Paralympics|Beijing Paralympics]]) would host ''[[The Last Leg]]'', a Paralympic-themed [[late night talk show]] following the conclusion of each night's coverage.<ref>{{cite news |title=Australian comedian Adam Hills: 'I was born without a foot.

== Controversies ==

=== Atos involvement ===
{{See also|Atos#Atos Healthcare|Work Capability Assessment}}
The role of IT company [[Atos]] as a technology provider and official sponsor of the Paralympic Games was criticised by [[disability rights|disability-rights]] groups, due to its contract with Britain's [[Department for Work and Pensions]] to carry out [[Work Capability Assessment|work capability assessments]], which determine eligibility for [[Disability Living Allowance|disability benefits]].<ref name=guardian-oczip/> They argued that Atos's programme had lacked integrity and was intended to help cut government spending, since the assessments have resulted in many disabled workers being incorrectly judged as "fit for work" and denied benefits.<ref name=guardian-atosmp>{{cite web|title=Atos comes under attack in emotional Commons debate|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/17/atos-attack-emotional-commons-debate|work=The Guardian|accessdate=5 October 2013}}</ref> Therefore, the groups considered it [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]] for Atos to sponsor a sporting event for the disabled whilst simultaneously operating a programme that has negatively affected their lives.<ref name=guardian-atos-2/> [[UK Uncut]], a political group opposed to [[public service|public-service]] budget cuts, held a series of protests dubbed "The Atos Games" to coincide with the start of the Paralympics, culminating with joint demonstrations with [[Disabled People Against Cuts]] outside the London headquarters of both Atos and the Department for Work and Pensions on 31 August 2012.<ref name=guardian-atos-2>{{cite news|title=The Atos Games will showcase disabled people's anger at Paralympic sponsors|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2195885/The-Paralympics-celebrate-strength-disabled-people--protests-accompany-them.html| work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=30 August 2012|location=London|first=Sonia|last=Poulton|date=30 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=guardian-atos1>{{cite news|title=Paralympics organisers defend sponsor Atos in face of protests|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/28/atos-paraylmpic-involvement-brings-protests| work = [[The Guardian]] |accessdate=30 August 2012|location=London|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=28 August 2012}}</ref> Speaking at the protests, comedian [[Jeremy Hardy]] said that the programme's intent to "victimise people with disabilities" was "blatant and shameless."<ref name=guardian-atos-3>{{cite news|title=Paralympic sponsor Atos hit by protests|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/31/paralympic-sponsor-atos-hit-protests?newsfeed=true| work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 August 2012|location=London|first=Esther|last=Addley|date=31 August 2012}}</ref>

During the opening ceremony some British athletes reportedly obscured the Atos logo on their accreditation passes in protest of their involvement.<ref name=guardian-oczip/> However, an official from the [[British Paralympic Association]] denied that this had been the case.<ref name="guardian-atos-3"/> LOCOG defended Atos's involvement, stating that the company was "a critical and valued member of [the companies] delivering these Games", due to the technologies it has provided, which included information systems for managing volunteers and distributing event results.<ref name=guardian-atos1/>

=== Ticketing ===
Controversy arose about seating rules for wheelchair users, after two disabled mothers accused LOCOG of having discriminatory policies. One claimed she had been told by a LOCOG staff member that spectators in a wheelchair area at the Velodrome could only be accompanied by one adult, and children could not attend without being accompanied by another able-bodied adult, while another was told that her ability to sit in a wheelchair area with her children at [[ExCeL London]] was "not guaranteed."  A [[petition]] for improved access for disabled families, started by one of the mothers on [[Change.org]], quickly collected over 30,000 signatures. LOCOG denied having discriminatory policies, stating that disabled parents could steward their children in wheelchair seating areas at events with unreserved seats, but may not all be able to sit together at events with reserved seating.<ref name=dm-wc>{{cite news |title=Paralympics rules 'make disabled feel non-human': Fury after wheelchair-user parents are told they cannot sit with families at event |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2188996/Paralympics-rules-make-disabled-feel-non-human-Fury-wheelchair-user-parents-told-sit-families-event.html |work =[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=18 August 2012 |location=London |first=Inderdeep |last=Bains |date=15 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=c4-assure>{{cite web |title=Locog assures disabled parents over Paralympic tickets |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/disabled-parents-successful-in-paralympic-ticket-campaign |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>

LOCOG faced further criticism for how it handled the sale of tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas was replaced by a dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an [[0844]] [[Premium-rate telephone number#United Kingdom|revenue share]] number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former [[sports minister]] [[Gerry Sutcliffe]] viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline.<ref name=bbc-bookings-discrim>{{cite news |title=Paralympics wheelchair bookings 'discriminate', MP says |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19384473 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 August 2012 |date=26 August 2012}}</ref> LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.<ref name=telegraph-phone>{{cite news |title=Paralympics organisers accused of discriminating against wheelchair users with high-cost phone line |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9500253/Paralympics-organisers-accused-of-discriminating-against-wheelchair-users-with-high-cost-phone-line.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=28 August 2012 |location=London |date=26 August 2012}}</ref>

A minor incident occurred involving blind Member of Parliament [[David Blunkett]], who was attending the opening ceremony alongside a [[Channel 4]] director. Blunkett was denied access to his seat at Olympic Stadium because there was no room for his [[guide dog]], and had to watch the ceremony from seats in the stadium's gantry instead. However, Blunkett noted that this was an isolated incident and chose not to make an issue of it, simply advising organisers to "seek to find a solution rather than impose a preconceived notion of what is or is not possible."<ref name=telegraph-blunkett>{{cite news |title=David Blunkett turned away from stadium for Paralympics' opening ceremony because of his guide dog |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9512924/David-Blunkett-turned-away-from-stadium-for-Paralympics-opening-ceremony-because-of-his-guide-dog.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=11 September 2012 |location=London |first=Christopher |last=Hope |date=31 August 2012}}</ref>

=== British television coverage ===
British official broadcaster [[Channel 4]] received some criticism for its coverage of the Paralympics. Users of Twitter complained that its coverage of the opening ceremony contained too many commercial breaks, drawing comparisons to [[Olympics on NBC#2012 Opening Ceremony|similar complaints]] faced by [[NBC]] during the Olympics' opening ceremony (although unlike the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], who televised the Olympics in the United Kingdom, both NBC and Channel 4 are commercially supported networks). Complaints noted that Channel 4 had shown five ad breaks within the first hour of the ceremony, and that ironically, it had recently broadcast a six-hour long late-night [[dance music]] special with no adverts at all. Channel 4 defended the criticism by stating that it had broadcast "significantly fewer" commercials than normal for primetime programming during the ceremony, and that the ad breaks were needed in order to help the channel invest in broadcasting programming such as the Paralympics. Criticism was also made towards comments made by [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] and [[Krishnan Guru-Murthy]] during the telecast; Snow was criticized for making comments about [[war|war-torn]] countries during the parade of nations, while Guru-Murthy received similar criticism for quipping that "looking at the ages of these athletes, which have been helpfully provided to us, they're really quite old."<ref name="telegraph-adverts">{{cite news|last=Hough |first=Andrew |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9507747/Paralympics-2012-Channel-4-under-fire-over-opening-ceremony-adverts.html |title=Paralympics 2012: Channel 4 under fire over opening ceremony adverts |work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 August 2012|accessdate= 30 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Rosie Taylor |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2195499/Paralympics-2012-Viewers-anger-Channel-4-Opening-Ceremony-interrupted-adverts.html |title='Nice, sell cars off the back of the national anthem': Viewers' anger at Channel 4 as coverage of Opening Ceremony is interrupted by repeated advert breaks| work = [[Daily Mail]] |date= 29 August 2012|accessdate= 30 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref><ref name=bbc-c4rave>{{cite web|title=Channel 4 to host all-night rave|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-18997826|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

Channel 4 was also accused of showing too many studio segments during the first few days of the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where [[Eleanor Simmonds]] set a new personal best and almost beat the world record, [[Sarah Storey]] winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed during the first few days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, and that it was operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress.<ref name=c4-backatcritics>{{cite news|title=Channel 4 hits back at critics after boost from Paralympics audiences|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/01/channel-4-paralympics-audiences?newsfeed=true| work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 September 2012|location=London|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=1 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=inde-shorts>{{cite news|title=Paralympic Shorts: It's officially the greatest Games ever|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympics/paralympic-shorts-its-officially--the-greatest-games-ever-8114025.html| work = [[The Independent]]|accessdate=9 September 2012|location=London|first=Liam|last=O'Brien|date=7 September 2012}}</ref> The amount of live coverage was also affected by [[Olympic Broadcasting Services]], who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's [[Channel 4 News|news department]] did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.<ref name=c4-backatcritics/>

=== American television coverage ===
In the United States, [[NBC Sports]] held the broadcast rights to both the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012. NBC had been frequently criticised in past years by American athletes and IPC officials for its minimal coverage of past Paralympics, and it was speculated by critics that NBC's history of inadequate coverage may have impacted [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|New York City's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics]]. In [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]], it did not air any coverage while the Games were in progress (neither live or [[Broadcast delay|delayed]]), choosing to air a recap documentary on NBC in November 2008, followed by a week of highlights on [[Universal Sports]].<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/Sports/NBC-Paralympics-Documentary-35433.aspx NBC to Air Stirring Documentary on 2008 Paralympics]" ''[[TV Guide]]''. November 7, 2008. Retrieved on November 7, 2008.</ref> While relatively larger than its Beijing coverage, NBC produced only five-and-a-half hours of specials featuring tape delayed highlights of the Games; most of them aired on pay-TV channel [[NBCSN]], while the last aired on [[NBC]] a week following the conclusion of the Games. No coverage of the opening and closing ceremonies, nor any live coverage, was provided.<ref name=nbc-para/><ref name=tele-nbc>{{cite news|title=NBC criticised Paralympics after opening ceremony blackout|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9509190/NBC-criticised-Paralympics-after-opening-ceremony-blackout.html|work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=10 September 2012|location=London|date=30 August 2012}}</ref> By contrast, some broadcasters (such as the host broadcasters, and broadcasters in Australia and Spain) planned to air at least 100 hours or more of coverage from London,<ref name="rtve-para12"/><ref name=apc-paralogie/><ref name=theaus-abc2/><ref name="tele-nbc"/> and NBC itself had provided extensive coverage of the London Olympics, which was heavily-viewed.<ref name=nbc-para/>

NBC's lack of coverage drew the ire of American [[disability rights]] groups and IPC president Philip Craven, who expressed his disappointment for American athletes and viewers who were unable to fully experience the games on television. Craven remarked that "some people think that North America always [leads] on everything, and on this they don't. It's about time they caught up."<ref name="tele-nbc"/> Following the closing ceremonies, Craven hinted that the IPC might exercise greater scrutiny on broadcasters at future Paralympics by stating that "if we find our [[values]] don't fit, we'll have to go somewhere else."<ref name=metro-nbc>{{cite web|title=American broadcaster NBC could lose right to show Games after criticisms|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/10/american-broadcaster-nbc-could-lose-right-to-show-games-after-criticisms-569957/| work = [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> NBC acquired the rights to the [[2014 Winter Paralympics|2014]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics|2016]] Paralympic Games in September 2013; the broadcaster vowed to air a relatively larger amount of Paralympic coverage from [[Sochi]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] respectively—in particular, NBC and NBCSN are to air at least 66 hours from Rio. Craven praised NBC's decision to devote a relatively larger amount of airtime to future Paralympics, sharing his hope that U.S. audiences would be "as captivated and emotionally enthralled as the billions around the world who tuned in to London 2012 last summer."<ref name=telegraph-nbcparalympics>{{cite news|title=Paralympic Movement given huge boost as American channels NBC and NBCSN will cover next two Games|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/10330949/Paralympic-Movement-given-huge-boost-as-American-channels-NBC-and-NBCSN-will-cover-next-two-Games.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=10 February 2014|location=London|first=Gareth A|last=Davies|date=24 September 2013}}</ref>

===Women's discus medals===

During the women's class F35/36 discus competition, an error in scoring caused the wrong medals to be presented. In this combined class event, final standings were determined based on a points calculation. The calculation converted distances thrown into points, to account for the different functional impairments of the participating athletes. Due to an error in the scoring system, the gold medal in the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete [[Mariia Pomazan]]. When the mistake was discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete [[Wu Qing (athlete)|Wu Qing]] had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/03/paralympics-2012-gold-medal-ukrainian| newspaper=The Guardian| title=Paralympic discus thrower must return gold medal, says IPC| date=3 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9526868/Paralympics-2012-Mariia-Pomazan-returns-discus-gold.html| newspaper=The Telegraph| title=Paralympics 2012: Mariia Pomazan returns discus gold| date=6 September 2012}}</ref>
