== Priorities ==
The Department outlined its aims for this Parliament in its Business Plan, which was published in May 2011 and superseded its Structural Reform Plan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Business Plan|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/corporate-publications/business-plan/ho-business-plan-2011-15/|work=Home Office|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref> The plan said the department will:

::1. Empower the public to hold the police to account for their role in cutting crime
:::* Introduce directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners and make police actions to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour more transparent
::2. Free up the police to fight crime more effectively and efficiently
:::* Cut police bureaucracy, end unnecessary central interference and overhaul police powers in order to cut crime, reduce costs and improve police value for money. Simplify national institutional structures and establish a National Crime Agency to strengthen the fight against organised crime (and replace the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]])
::3. Create a more integrated criminal justice system
:::*Help the police and other public services work together across the criminal justice system
::4. Secure our borders and reduce immigration
:::*Deliver an improved migration system that commands public confidence and serves our economic interests. Limit non-EU economic migrants, and introduce new measures to reduce inflow and minimise abuse of all migration routes, for example the student route. Process asylum applications more quickly, and end the detention of children for immigration purposes
::5. Protect people's freedoms and civil liberties
:::*Reverse state interference to ensure there is not disproportionate intrusion into people‟s lives
::6. Protect our citizens from terrorism
:::*Keep people safe through the Government‟s approach to counter-terrorism
::7. Build a fairer and more equal society (through the [[Government Equalities Office]])
:::*Help create a fair and flexible labour market. Change culture and attitudes. Empower individuals and communities. Improve equality structures, frontline services and support; and help Government Departments and others to consider equality as a matter of course

The Home Office publishes progress against the plan on the 10 Downing Street website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Business Plan:Home Office|url=http://transparency.number10.gov.uk/transparency/srp/view-srp/40|work=Home Office|publisher=10 Downing Street|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
On 27 March 1782, the Home Office was formed by renaming the existing [[Southern Department (England)|Southern Department]], with all existing staff transferring. On the same day, the [[Northern Department]] was renamed the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]].

To match the new names, there was a transferring of responsibilities between the two Departments of State. All domestic responsibilities were moved to the Home Office, and all foreign matters became the concern of the Foreign Office.

Most subsequently created domestic departments (excluding, for instance, those dealing with education) have been formed by splitting responsibilities away from the Home Office.

The initial responsibilities were:
* Answering [[petition]]s and addresses sent to the King
* Advising the King on
**Royal grants
**[[warrant (law)|Warrant]]s and [[letter patent|commission]]s
**The exercise of [[Royal Prerogative (United Kingdom)|Royal Prerogative]]
* Issuing instructions on behalf of the King to officers of [[the Crown]], [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenant]] and [[magistrates]], mainly concerning law and order
* Operation of the secret service within the UK
* Protecting the public
* Safeguarding the rights and liberties of individuals

Responsibilities were subsequently changed over the years that followed:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casbah.ac.uk/cats/archive/138/PROA00008.htm |title=Changes to Home Office responsibilities |publisher=Casbah.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref>

=== Anonymous attack ===
On 7 April 2012, [[hacktivist]] group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] temporarily took down the UK Home Office website. The group took responsibility for the attack, which was part of ongoing Anonymous activity in protest against the deportation of hackers as part of Operation TrialAtHome. One Anonymous source claimed in their tweet it was also launched in retaliation for "draconian surveillance proposals".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/news/anonymous-cyber-attack-uk-521/ |title=Anonymous takes down the UK Home Office website }}</ref>

=== Union Action ===
On 18 July 2012, the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]] announced that thousands of Home Office employees would{{clarify|date=August 2012}} go on strike over jobs, pay and other issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18889900 |title=Home Office staff vote to strike over jobs and pay |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-07-18 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}</ref> However, the [[Public and Commercial Services Union|PCSU]] called off the strike before it was planned it claimed the department had, subsequent to the threat of actions, announced 1,100 new border jobs.<ref>http://union-news.co.uk/2012/07/pcs-calls-off-home-office-olympic-strike-after-extra-staff-are-posted-in/</ref>

[[File:Lunar House 86.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Lunar House]] in [[Croydon]], which holds the headquarters of the Home Office UK Border Agency]]

== Location ==
From 1978 to 2004, the Home Office was located at [[102 Petty France|50 Queen Anne's Gate]], a [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] office block in [[Westminster]] designed by Sir [[Basil Spence]], close to [[St. James's Park tube station]]. Many functions, however, were devolved to offices in other parts of London and the country, notably the headquarters of the [[Immigration and Nationality Directorate]] in [[Croydon]].

In 2005, the Home Office moved to a new main office designed by Sir [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] at [[2 Marsham Street]], Westminster, SW1P 4DF, on the site of the demolished [[Marsham Towers]] building of the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]].<ref>[http://www.terryfarrell.co.uk/projects/finishing/finish_marsham.html New Home Office building] {{wayback|url=http://www.terryfarrell.co.uk/projects/finishing/finish_marsham.html |date=20060926144808 |df=y }}</ref> 

For external shots of its fictional Home Office, the TV series [[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]] uses an aerial shot of the [[Government Offices Great George Street]] instead, serving as stand-in to match the distinctly less modern appearance of the fictitious accommodation interiors the series uses.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Research ==
To meet the UK's 5-year science and technology strategy,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/PoliceST_S2_part11.pdf?view=Binary |title=Police Science and Technology Strategy: 2004 - 2009 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=homeoffice.gov.uk |accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref> the Home Office sponsors research in [[police science]]s including:
* [[Biometrics]] – including face and voice recognition
* [[Cell type]] analysis – to determine the origin of cells (e.g. hair, skin)
* [[Chemistry]] – new techniques to recover latent fingerprints
* [[DNA]] – identifying offender characteristics from DNA
* Improved [[Forensic profiling|Profiling]] – of illicit drugs to help identify their source
* [[Raman Spectroscopy]] – to provide more sensitive drugs and explosives detectors (e.g. roadside drug detection)
* [[Terahertz imaging]] methods and technologies – e.g. image analysis and new cameras, to detect crime, enhance images and support anti-terrorism

== Devolution ==

Most front-line law and order policy areas, such as policing and criminal justice, are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland but the following [[Reserved and excepted matters|reserved and excepted]] matters are handled by Westminster.

'''Scotland'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_14#sch5-pt1 |title=Scotland Act 1998, Schedule 5, Part I |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref>

Reserved matters:
* [[Misuse of drugs|The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]
* [[Extradition]] legislation, but the Scottish Ministers (through the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]]) have executive responsibility for all aspects of mutual legal assistance
* Most aspects of [[Firearms]] legislation, but Scottish Ministers have some executive responsibilities for the licensing of firearms. Further powers are transferred under the [[Scotland Act 2012]]
* [[Immigration]] and [[nationality]]
* [[animal experiments|Scientific procedures]] on live animals

The [[Scottish Government Justice and Communities Directorates]] are responsible for devolved justice and home affairs policy.

'''Northern Ireland'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980047_en_11#sch2 |title=Northern Ireland Act 1998, Schedule 2 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=4 November 1950 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref>

Excepted matters:
* [[Extradition]] (as an [[international relations]] matter)
* [[Immigration]] and [[nationality]]

The following matters were not transferred at the devolution of policing and justice on 12 April 2010 and remain reserved:<ref>{{cite web|author=Northern Ireland Assembly Information Office |url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports2009/100309.htm#4 |title='&#39;Policing and Justice'&#39; motion, Northern ireland Assembly, 12 April 2010 |publisher=Niassembly.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref>
* [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Drug classification]]
* [[Parades]]
* Security of [[explosives]]
* [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]

The Home Office's main counterparts in Northern Ireland are:
* [[Department of Justice (Northern Ireland)|Department of Justice]] (policing, public order and community safety)
* [[Northern Ireland Office]] (national security in Northern Ireland)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/index/about-the-nio.htm |title=About the NIO |publisher=Nio.gov.uk |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref>

The Department of Justice is accountable to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] whereas the Northern Ireland Office is a [[United Kingdom Government|UK Government]] department.

'''Wales'''

Under the Welsh devolution settlement, specific policy areas are transferred to the [[National Assembly for Wales]] rather than reserved to Westminster.
