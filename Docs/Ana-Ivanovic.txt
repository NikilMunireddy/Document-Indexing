== Early life ==
Ivanovic was born in [[Belgrade]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. Ivanovic's mother Dragana, a lawyer, has been court-side during most of her matches. Her father Miroslav, a self-employed businessman, attended as many events as he possibly could. Ivanovic has a younger brother, Miloš, with whom she loved to play basketball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anaivanovic.com/media/press/6/anaivanovic_pressrelease_english.pdf |title=Ana Ivanovic – the fastest mover in the world |accessdate=13 June 2007 |format=PDF |work=Ana Ivanovic.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070703163437/http://www.anaivanovic.com/media/press/6/anaivanovic_pressrelease_english.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 3 July 2007}}</ref>

Ivanovic first picked up a racket at the age of five after watching [[Monica Seles]], a fellow [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]], on television.<ref name=WTA /> She started her career after memorizing the telephone number of a local tennis clinic from an advertisement. During the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], she was forced to train during the morning to avoid bombardments. Later, she admitted that she trained in an abandoned swimming pool in the winter, as no tennis facilities were available. At 13 she moved to train in [[Basel]], Switzerland, because of the better training facilities and coaching.<ref name="basel">{{cite web | url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Ana-Ivanovic-On-Swiss-Bliss.aspx | title=Ana Ivanovic on Swiss bliss | accessdate=15 March 2016}}</ref> Manager Dan Holzmann was from Basel as well and it was with him that Ana and her mother stayed until they could afford an apartment.<ref name="basel2">{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1028098/The-truth-Wimbledon-bombshell-Is-tennis-star-Ana-Ivanovics-rags-riches-story-seems.html | title=Daily Mail: Rags to riches? | accessdate=15 March 2016}}</ref> When she was 15, Ivanovic spent four hours in a locker room crying after a defeat – the first that her new manager had witnessed. She thought that Dan Holzmann, the manager in question, would abandon her, thinking her not good enough to become a professional tennis player. However, he has remained her manager to this day.<ref>{{cite news| work= Time| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1816482,00.html| author= Sean Gregory| title= Ana Ivanovic: Tennis's Next Megastar| date= 19 June 2008| accessdate= 6 April 2013}}</ref>

=== 2008: French Open champion and world No. 1 ===
Ivanovic started the year at the [[2008 Medibank International]], where she made the quarterfinals, eventually losing to world No. 1 [[Justine Henin]] despite having had break points in the third set.

In her first round robin match, Ivanovic captured a two set victory over Pironkova. She then went on to defeat Stosur . She needed one more victory to come first in her group. However, Ivanovic lost to Vesnina for the second time this year despite leading 5–2 in 3rd set and serving two times for a match. But despite losing, she still qualified for the semi-finals by winning a set, therefore coming second in her group (after Stosur). In her semi-final match, she lost to eventual champion [[Simona Halep]] despite leading 3–0 in 3rd set with 2 breaks in her own.

Ivanovic ended the 2013 season with a rank of 16.

=== 2014: Resurgence and return to the Top 5===

Ivanovic started the 2014 season by winning title in [[2014 ASB Classic|Auckland]], defeating [[Venus Williams]] in the final in three sets, for her 12th title and her first since November 2011. At the [[2014 Australian Open|Australian Open]], she defeated No. 1 ranked [[Serena Williams]] in the 4th round for her first win over Serena, after battling past [[Samantha Stosur]] in three sets. She lost to 30th seed Canadian [[Eugenie Bouchard]] in the quarterfinals in three sets.<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=19 January 2014 |url=http://www1.skysports.com/tennis/australian-open/story/29993/9123410/australian-open--ana-ivanovic-caused-an-upset-by-beating-serena-williams-in-three-sets |title=Australian Open: Ana Ivanovic caused an upset by beating Serena Williams in three sets |publisher=Skysports |date=19 January 2014 |author=Tim Clement}}</ref> On set point for Bouchard, Ivanovic double-faulted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.si.com/2014/01/21/eugenie-bouchard-australian-open/ |title=Eugenie Bouchard a WTA star in the making |work=Sports Illustrated |date=21 January 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>

At the next four tournaments of the Asian and American series, Ivanovic failed to make the quarterfinals at all of them. She beat some top players like [[Angelique Kerber]] (saving match point) in Dubai and [[Flavia Pennetta]] in Miami. But there were some big outages like a double bagel against [[Petra Kvitová]] after Ivanovic won the first set. In [[2014 Monterrey Open|Monterrey]], Ivanovic was the 2nd seed and went on to win her 2nd title of the year, by defeating 3rd seed and former world No. 1 [[Caroline Wozniacki]] in the semifinals and [[Jovana Jakšić]] in the WTA's first-ever all-Serbian final, putting bad results behind her.

Representing [[Serbia]] in [[2014 Fed Cup World Group II Play-offs|Fed Cup]] against [[Romania]], Ivanovic lost against [[Sorana Cîrstea]], but beat world No. 5 [[Simona Halep]] in straight sets. Serbia would go on to lose the tie 4–1.

Ivanovic then participated in [[2014 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart]] where she made it all the way to the final, achieving back-to-back finals for the first time in her career. It was also the first time in 5 years, since the [[2009 BNP Paribas Open]], that Ivanovic had reached a Premier level final. En route she achieved other career milestones, defeating [[Julia Görges]] for her 400th career win and world No. 6 [[Jelena Janković]] for her 40th career top 10 win. She eventually lost to 2-time defending champion [[Maria Sharapova]] in the final in three sets.

In [[2014 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]], Ivanovic won her first three matches in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals, losing to [[Simona Halep]] in just one hour. Ivanovic gained revenge for her Stuttgart defeat against [[Maria Sharapova]] at the [[2014 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Italian Open]], whom she defeated in third round in straight sets, later going to be the only person to defeat Sharapova on clay that year. The win was significant for a whole host of reasons, but most significantly she became the first player other than [[Serena Williams]] to defeat Sharapova on clay since 2011 and ended her winning streak in Rome (Sharapova was 47–3 on the surface and was undefeated in Rome since 2011). It was also the first time since the semifinals at the [[2007 French Open]] that Ivanovic had defeated Sharapova. Against world number 1 [[Serena Williams]], in her second appearance in the Rome semifinals, she lost in three sets; she was the only player to take a set off Williams in the whole tournament.

At [[2014 French Open|Roland Garros]] Ivanovic was the 11th seed. This was her best Grand Slam seeding since the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] where she was the same seed. In the first two rounds, she defeated rising stars, [[Caroline Garcia]] and [[Elina Svitolina]], before falling to 23rd seed [[Lucie Šafářová]] in straight sets. This marked the 5th straight time that Šafarova had beaten Ivanovic.

Ivanovic made a quick transition from clay to grass as she won her first grass court title in [[Aegon Classic|Birmingham]], as the first seed. Ivanovic beat [[Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová]], a later Wimbledon quarterfinalist, in the final. In all matches, she lost five or less games. At [[2014 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] Ivanovic came in again as the 11th seed. She started well, with wins over [[Zheng Jie]] and [[Francesca Schiavone]], all in straight sets. In third round she faced grass court specialist and 2013 Wimbledon runner-up, [[Sabine Lisicki]]. She won their match played earlier in the season. However, she would go on to lose in three sets. The match was particularly strange due to it being played over 3 days over the Middle Sunday. The first part was played on Saturday and with Lisicki leading 6–4, 1–1, the match was suspended due to bad light. On Monday match was played in two parts, being paused due to rain. In the first period of play, Ivanovic had momentum on her side. Upon resumption, Lisicki would go on to win 7 of the next 9 games. After Wimbledon, Ivanovic didn't renew her contract with coach Nemanja Kontic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.com/tennis/2014/07/09/ana-ivanovic-nemanja-kontic-split |title=Ana Ivanovic splits with coach Nemanja Kontic after a year |publisher=''Sports Illustrated'' |date=9 July 2014 |first=Courtney |last=Nguyen |accessdate=21 September 2014 }}</ref> She hired [[Dejan Petrovic]] as her coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.com/tennis/2014/07/19/ana-ivanovic-appoints-new-coach-dejan-petrovic |title=Ana Ivanovic appoints new coach Dejan Petrovic |publisher=''Sports Illustrated'' |date=19 July 2014 |first=Courtney |last=Nguyen |accessdate=21 September 2014 }}</ref>

Ivanovic started the [[US Open Series]] in [[2014 Bank of the West Classic|Stanford]], avenging her Wimbledon loss by defeating [[Sabine Lisicki]] in straight sets. Ivanovic eventually lost in the quarterfinals in three sets to [[Serena Williams]] in their third three-set match of the year. As a result of her quarterfinals run, Ivanovic returned to the top ten in the WTA rankings for the first time since 2009.<ref>[http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/08/ivanovic-explains-reason-coaching-change/52333/#.U97Dx_mSySo Ivanovic explains reason for coaching change], ''tennis.com'', 2 August 2014</ref> Then at the [[2014 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], Ivanovic lost to eventual quarterfinalist [[Coco Vandeweghe]] in the second round; but in [[2014 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]], she reached  the Premier 5 final, beating Russians [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] and fifth seed [[Maria Sharapova]] in the process. Against Sharapova, Ivanovic served for the match in the second set, but lost the next four games. Sharapova then served for the match, but Ivanovic saved two match points and went on to victory to set up the final match against [[Serena Williams]]. Ivanovic opened the match well, with a break and break points, but she didn't convert them and Williams broke back. Ivanovic won just two games after that good start.

At the [[2014 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], Ivanovic was seeded eighth, her highest Grand Slam seeding since the [[2009 French Open – Women's Singles|2009 French Open]]. In the first round she beat American [[Alison Riske]] in straight sets only allowing her opponent to win three games, but was upset by unseeded Czech [[Karolína Plíšková]] in the second round in two close sets.

The following month, Ivanovic played in [[2014 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Tokyo]], defeating former world No. 1 [[Victoria Azarenka]], [[Lucie Šafářová]] (ending her five-match losing streak against the Czech) and top seed [[Angelique Kerber]] to reach the final. She then beat reigning US Open finalist [[Caroline Wozniacki]] in straight sets for her 15th title. She marked some personal achievements: this was her 52nd win and 4th title of the season, both personal bests. In Wuhan, she had to play the day after winning Tokyo and decided to retire in the second set of the match against [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]]. Ivanovic came into [[2014 China Open (tennis)|Beijing]] refreshed and beat [[Belinda Bencic]], [[Romina Oprandi]] and [[Sabine Lisicki]] all in straight sets. She set a quarterfinal clash with [[Simona Halep]], but the world No. 2 had to withdraw allowing Ivanovic to advance to the semifinals. Ivanovic lost to [[Maria Sharapova]], but with those points she secured her spot in the [[2014 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]].

Having qualified for the [[2014 WTA Finals|WTA Tour Championships]], Ivanovic was drawn into the Red Group alongside [[Serena Williams]], [[Simona Halep]] and [[Eugenie Bouchard]]. The odds were against Ivanovic for her first match of the tournament against top-seed [[Serena Williams]] and she went on to lose to in straight sets. However, Ivanovic clinched victory in her second match against Canadian [[Eugenie Bouchard]]. Despite defeating [[Simona Halep]] in her final Round Robin match, Ivanovic was unable to progress since she dropped a set in the process. In doing so, she became the first player since [[Lindsay Davenport]] in 2004 to not progress to the semifinals with a 2–1 record in RR play. However, Ivanovic did finish the year ranked No. 5, her second best year-end ranking since turning pro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/4247156/title/10-things-to-know-serena-vs-halep|title=10 things to know Serena vs Halep|date= |accessdate=21 September 2014 }}</ref>

Following the end of the WTA season, Ivanovic played and defeated world No. 1 [[Serena Williams]] in straight sets in an [[The Energi Danmark Champions Battle (Tennis Exhibition)|exhibition match in Denmark]]. She also went on to participate in the inaugural [[International Premier Tennis League]] held in cities across Asia. As part of the [[Indian Aces|Micromax Indian Aces]], Ivanovic played alongside many big names, including [[Roger Federer]] and [[Pete Sampras]]. Due to the new, fast-paced format unique to the IPTL, Ivanovic only played 1 set per match, representing her team in the women's singles category. The Aces went on to clinch the title, with Ivanovic amassing a total of 9 wins and 3 losses.

== Playing style ==
Ivanovic is an offensive baseliner with an aggressive play. In 2007 and 2008, Ivanovic was regarded as one of the best competitors on the women's tour.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} After winning the [[2008 French Open]] and becoming No. 1, Ivanovic endured a decline in form. Many critics attributed this to lack of confidence.<ref name="theatlantic">{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/high-strung/308175/ |title=High Strung |publisher=''The Atlantic'' |date=11 August 2010 |first=Tom |last=Perrotta |accessdate=21 September 2014 }}</ref> At the [[2010 Australian Open]], Hall of Famer [[Martina Navratilova]] commented that, "while she has absolutely no confidence in herself, she still fights till the last point." She has since made some improvements to her playing style after appointing a new coach in 2010. As a result, she started to play with more confidence and won matches more consistently.

=== Serve ===
[[File:Ana Ivanovic at Indian Wells.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Ivanovic serving at [[Indian Wells, California|Indian Wells]], 2008]]
When on form, Ivanovic's serve can be a weapon in her arsenal. She hit a {{convert|124.9|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} serve at the French Open in 2007, the fifth fastest serve of all time on the WTA Tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/news/20100323/ids-serve-speed-leaders_2256076_1978722 |title=IDS Serve Speed Leaders |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |work=sonyericssonwtatour.com }}</ref> However, from 2009 to 2012, her service game has largely been viewed as a liability instead of a weapon. This is because of her inconsistent ball tosses which are directly associated with her diminishing confidence.<ref name="theatlantic"/> Nonetheless, in 2013, under the tutelage of Nigel Sears, her ball tosses have since become more consistent, allowing her to build her game on her powerful first serves.

=== Groundstrokes ===
Ivanovic's forehand is her bread-and-butter shot that took the world by storm in 2007–08, propelling her to the top of the rankings. A flat stroke, hit with not a lot of topspin which gives it its power,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anaivanovic.com/news/anas-guide-forehand |title=Ana's Guide to the Forehand|publisher=Anaivanovic.com |date=2009-07-08 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> Simon Reed believes it to be one of the best forehands in the game.<ref>[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/simon-reed/favourite-shotmakers-women-forehand-268.html Favourite shotmakers: Women's forehand] Accessed 28 April 2011</ref> Conversely, her backhand is much weaker than her forehand and is often targeted by players acquainted with Ivanovic's playing style. Her cross-court backhand generally lacks the depth required to throw her opponents off course.

While Ivanovic's movement and net play were once considered to be her weaknesses, they have both improved over the years. She is considered now to be considerably faster than when she started playing professional tennis.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Surfaces ===
Ivanovic's best surface is the clay court, where her height allows her to strike clean winners off high-bouncing balls. Nonetheless, she is capable of performing well on hard and grass courts as well. When she launched her re-branded site during 2010, she stated in her bio that she likes all surfaces.<ref name=ANAabout>{{cite web|title=Learn more about Ana...|url=http://www.anaivanovic.com/bio/learn-more-about-ana|publisher=anaivanovic.com|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref>

===Ivanovic vs. Janković===
{{Main|Ivanovic–Janković rivalry}}
Ivanovic and her fellow Serbian [[Jelena Janković]] have played each other 12 times with Ivanovic having the advantage 9 to 3 in match wins. The pair played their first match against each other in an abandoned swimming pool used as a tennis court in [[Belgrade]]. A 9-year old Janković won the match, thrashing the 7-year old Ivanovic 7–1.<ref name=ij>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french08/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=3424366|title=Ivanovic, Jankovic have propelled each other to the top|author=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref>  Ivanovic has dominated the majority of the rivalry. When asked why Ivanovic has posed such a problem for herself, Janković remarked that she struggles to read Ivanovic's game mostly due to the fact Ivanovic likes to play short points.<ref name=ij /> Ivanovic leads 2–1 on clay, 6–2 on hard courts and 1–0 on carpet courts.

The longest match contested between the two in the semi-finals at the [[2007 East West Bank Classic|East West Bank Classic]] in [[Los Angeles]].

The relationship between pair has been strained. Both have openly admitted in the past to not liking each other.<ref name=ij /> and have been involved in a number of high-profile spats on and off court. Ivanovic was criticized both by Janković and her mother after Ivanovic decided to withdraw from Serbia's [[2010 Fed Cup World Group Play-offs|Fed Cup World Group play-off]] tie against Slovakia, citing her poor form in 2010<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anaivanovic.com/news/fed-cup-statement |accessdate=2012-01-28 |title=Fed Cup statement|publisher=anaivanovic.com }}</ref> which left Janković the only high-profile player to play the tie which Serbia lost 3–2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fedcup.com/en/news/articles/slovaks-claim-world-group-spot.aspx|title=Slovaks claim World Group spot |accessdate=2012-01-28 |quote= |publisher=fedcup.com }}</ref> During the same weekend, Ivanovic was photographed having coffee with her boyfriend [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] at the island resort of [[Palma, Majorca]]. Snezana Janković denounced Ivanovic in the Serbian press<ref name=fedcup>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-1275343/No-love-lost-big-tennis-fall-Jankovic-Ivanovic.html|title=No love lost in the big tennis fall-out between Jankovic and Ivanovic |accessdate=2012-01-28 |quote= |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London |first=Malcolm |last=Folley |date=8 May 2010}}</ref> whilst herself Janković later admitted she had been disappointed by Ivanovic's no show and said that Ivanovic should have at least supported the team for the bench even if she decided not to play.<ref name=fedcup /> 
Another high profile controversy was after the pair's first meeting in two years in the second round of the [[2010 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open]] in [[Madrid]] where the match was marred however by an incident in which off court cameras appeared to catch Janković mocking Ivanovic's trademark fistpumps towards her mother and camp after the match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adjustingthenet.com/2010/05/12/did-jankovic-cross-the-line-with-mock-fist-pump-of-ivanovic/|title=Did Jankovic Cross the Line With Mock Fist Pump of Ivanovic? |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |publisher=adjustingthenet.com }}</ref> Janković admitted she found Ivanovic's fistpumps "irritating" but that it was not meant to be offensive and was in the heat of the moment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downthelinetennis.com/2010/05/ivanovic-jankovic-letting-cattiness-out.html|title=Ivanovic + Jankovic letting the cattiness out of the bag|accessdate=2012-01-28 |quote= |publisher=downthelinetennis.com }}</ref> After their match in Indian Wells in 2011 however, Ivanovic stated she felt there were no real issues with Janković and both agreed that they have both put the past behind them,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisreporters.net/archives/3015|title=Impressive Ivanovic takes out Jankovic & then appears to bury hatchet|author=Matthew Cronin |publisher=tennisreporters.net|accessdate=30 January 2012 }}</ref> an opinion echoed again by Janković after their Australian Open encounter in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/18/ivanovic-leads-jankovic-in-serbian-rivalry/?page=all|title=Ivanovic leads Jankovic in Serbian rivalry|author=Jocelyn Gecker |publisher=''The Washington Times''|date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>

===Ivanovic vs. Sharapova===
Ivanovic and [[Maria Sharapova]] have met 14 times, Sharapova leading the head-to-head 10–4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/head2head/player1/9499/player2/10999|title=Sharapova – Ivanovic Head 2 Head|author=[[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]|accessdate=2014-09-22}}</ref> Sharapova leads 6–1 on hard courts and 4–2 on clay. Ivanovic leads 1–0 on carpet.

The pair first met at the 2006 [[Generali Ladies Linz]] which Sharapova won in straight sets. Ivanovic beat Sharapova at the [[2007 French Open]] in straight sets easily to advance to her first Grand Slam final. They would meet again at a Grand Slam, this time in the [[2008 Australian Open]] final dubbed the "Glam Slam" final which Sharapova won in straight sets. After that match the pair did not meet for more than four years until the [[2012 BNP Paribas Open]] where Sharapova won after Ivanovic retired after winning the first game in the second set. Ivanovic would then lose the next four meetings that followed.

In 2014, Ivanovic defeated Sharapova for the first time since 2007 at the [[2014 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome Masters]] in straight sets. Their match at the [[2014 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati Masters]] was a dramatic and controversial match. Ivanovic was up a set and a double break before a bad call was made that affected Ivanovic and allowed Sharapova back into the match to steal the second set. Then, in the third set, Ivanovic was up 1–0 15–15 before she took a medical timeout, after which Sharapova took control of the set. Up 4–3 with a break, Sharapova double faulted on break point and sarcastically said to the umpire to "check her blood pressure" referring to the medical timeout that Ivanovic took earlier in the set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.com/tennis/2014/08/16/maria-sharapova-mocks-ana-ivanovic-medical-break|title=Maria Sharapova mocks Ana Ivanovic's medical break during loss|author=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2014-12-09}}</ref> Sharapova broke right back to serve for the match. Sharapova had two match points but failed to convert both. Ivanovic would eventually prevail, recording her first win over Sharapova on the hard courts.

The pair did not need to wait long to meet in 2015, with both drawn as the top 2 seeds in the [[2015 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]]. Both players qualified for the final, but it was Sharapova who once again clinched victory on the hard courts, despite dropping the first set to Ivanovic in a tiebreak.

===Ivanovic vs. Petrova===

Ivanovic and [[Nadia Petrova]] have met 14 times since 2005, Ivanovic leading the head-to-head 9–5 overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/head2head/player1/6564/player2/10999|title=Ivanovic – Petrova Head 2 Head|author=[[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]|accessdate=2015-01-01}}</ref> Ivanovic leads 4–2 on hard courts and 5–1 on clay. Petrova leads 1–0 on both grass and carpet.

The pair first met in the second round of the [[2005 NASDAQ-100 Open]] with Ivanovic winning in straight sets. Later in the year, Petrova reached the semifinals of the [[2005 French Open|French Open]] by defeating Ivanovic in straight sets in the quarterfinals. In the next two matches both players won one, and both were in a round of 16. Ivanovic won two significant matches in 2007. First, she beat Petrova in the 4th round of [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] after a rollercoaster three set match. Later in the summer Ivanovic won in straight sets in their only meeting in a final, in [[2007 East West Bank Classic|Los Angeles]]. At that time, it was 4–2 for Ivanovic in their head-to-head, but Petrova won the next two meetings in two close matches to level the result. However, Ivanovic won five of the next six meetings, including the quarterfinals of the [[2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] when Petrova retired but after Ivanovic had won the first nine games, and the semifinals of the [[2011 Commonwealth Bank Tournament of Champions]] in Bali, which Ivanovic won in straight sets.
