'''Guwahati''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Guwahati.ogg|g|ʊ|w|ə|ˈ|h|ɑ:|t|i}}; ''Pragjyotishpura'' in [[Kamarupa|ancient Assam]], ''Gauhati'' in the modern era) is the largest city of [[Assam]], a major riverine port city and one of the fastest growing cities in [[India]].<ref name="Capital of Assam">{{cite web|url=https://online.assam.gov.in/web/guest/capitalofassam |title=Capital of Assam |publisher=Assam Online Portal |date= |accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

The ancient cities of Pragjyotishpura and [[Durjaya]] ([[North Guwahati]]) were the capitals of the ancient state of [[Kamarupa]] under the [[Varman dynasty|Varman]] and [[Pala dynasty (Kamarupa)|Pala]] dynasties.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://online.assam.gov.in/history | title=History | publisher=Government of Assam | accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>
Many ancient Hindu temples are in the city, giving it the name "City of Temples".<ref name="About Guwahati">{{cite web|url=http://www.guwahationline.in/city-guide/About-Guwahati| title=About Guwahati| publisher=guwahationline.in|date= |accessdate= October 2015}}</ref> [[Dispur]], the capital of Assam, is in the circuit city region located within Guwahati and is the seat of the [[Government of Assam]].

Guwahati lies between the banks of the [[Brahmaputra River]] and the foothills of the [[Shillong]] plateau, with [[Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport|LGB International Airport]] to the west and the town of [[Narengi]] to the east. It is gradually being expanded as North Guwahati to the northern bank of the Brahmaputra. The noted [[Madan Kamdev]] is situated {{convert|30|km}} from Guwahati. The [[Guwahati Municipal Corporation]] (GMC), the city's local government, administers an area of {{convert|216|km2}}, while the [[Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority]] (GMDA) is the planning and development body of greater Guwahati Metropolitan Area. With an area of {{convert|1528|km2}}, Guwahati is the second-largest metropolitan region in eastern India, after [[Kolkata]].<ref name="The Telegraph">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150101/jsp/northeast/story_6181.jsp#.VffzEfmqpBc |title= Magisterial powers for Guwahati top cop |publisher=The Telegraph |date= |accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref>

The Guwahati region hosts diverse wildlife including rare animals such as Asian elephants, pythons, tigers, rhinoceros, [[gaur]]s, primate species, and  endangered birds.<ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2002).

== Etymology ==
Once known as Pragjyotishpura (the Light of the East), Guwahati derives its name from the [[Assamese language|Assamese]] words "Guwa" meaning [[areca nut]] and "Haat" meaning market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kamrupmetro.nic.in/indexmain.asp |title=Kamrup Metro District | publisher=Kamrup(M) District Administration |date= | accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>

To the south-west of the city lies [[Dipor Bil]], a permanent freshwater lake with no prominent inflows apart from monsoon run-off from the hills that lie to the south of the lake. The lake drains into the Brahmaputra, {{cvt|5|km}} to the north, and acts as a natural stormwater reservoir for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guwahationline.in/city-guide/geography-of-guwahati| title= Geography of Guwahati| publisher=Guwahati Online Portal| date= |accessdate=September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.maharashtraweb.com/Assam/Cities/Guwahati/geographyofguwahati.asp |title= Geographical Profile of Guwahati| publisher=Maharashtra Web Portal| date= |accessdate=September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/guwahati/Three-injured-in-leopard-attack-inside-NF-railway-complex-in-Guwahati/articleshow/50234941.cms| title=Three injured in leopard attack| publisher=Times Of India| date= |accessdate=December 2015}}</ref>

===Climate===
Guwahati has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa''), falling just short of a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'').<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

== History ==

===Ancient History===
Guwahati's myths and history go back several thousands of years. Although the exact date of the city's beginning is unknown, references in the epics, [[Puranas]], and other traditional histories of India, lead many to assume that it is one of the ancient cities of [[Asia]]. Epigraphic sources place the capitals of many ancient kingdoms in Guwahati. It was the capital of the kings [[Narakasura]] and [[Bhagadatta]] according to the [[Mahabharata]].<ref>{{Harvcol|Gait|1906|pp=13–15}}</ref> Located within Guwahati is the ancient Shakti temple of Goddess [[Kamakhya Temple|Kamakhya]] in Nilachal hill (an important seat of [[tantra|Tantric]] and [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]]), the ancient and unique astrological temple Navagraha in Chitrachal Hill, and archaeological remains in [[Basistha]] and other archaeological locations of mythological importance.<ref name="Guwahati">{{cite web|url=http://www.guwahatitimes.com/guwahati/guwahati.html| title=Guwahati| publisher=guwahatitimes.com| date= |accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Ashyam.JPG|left|upright|thumb|250px|<center>A view of [[Kamakhya Temple]]</center>]]

The [[Ambari]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=jan2316/at055 | title=Civilisation existed in Guwahati between 2nd, 1st century BC | work=The Assam Tribune | date=22 January 2016 | accessdate=27 January 2016 }}</ref> excavations trace the city to the Hindu kingdoms of [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]]-[[Kushan Empire|Kushana]] period of [[History of India|Indian history]], between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD. During earlier periods of the city's history it was known as [[Pragjyotishpura]], and was the capital of Assam under the [[Varman dynasty|Varman Dynasty]] of the [[Kamarupa]] kingdom. Descriptions by [[Xuanzang]] (Hiuen Tsang) reveal that during the reign of the Varman king [[Kumar Bhaskara Varman|Bhaskar Varman]] (7th century AD), the city stretched for about 30 ''li'' ({{cvt|15|km|disp=or}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enajori.com/assam-in-the-eyes-of-hiuen-tsiang-avinibesh-sharma |title= Assam in the eyes of Hiuen Tsang |publisher=enajori.com |date= |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> It remained as the capital of Assam until the 10th-11th century AD under the rule of the Pala dynasty. Archaeological evidence by excavations in Ambari, and excavated brick walls and houses discovered during construction of the present [[Cotton College, Guwahati|Cotton College]]'s auditorium suggest the city was of economic and strategic importance until the 9th-11th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://online.assam.gov.in/web/guest/history |title=History |publisher= Assam Online Portal |date= |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>

===Medieval History===
The city was the seat of the [[Borphukan]], the civil military authority of the Lower Assam region appointed by the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] kings. The Borphukan's residence was in the present Fancy Bazaar area, and his council-hall, called ''Dopdar'', was about {{convert|300|yd}} to the west of the Bharalu stream. The Majindar Baruah, the personal secretary of the Borphukan, had his residence in the present-day deputy commissioner's residence.{{sfn|Baruah|1993|pp=200–201}}

The Mughals invaded Assam seventeen times, and they were defeated by the Ahoms in [[Battle of Itakhuli]] and [[Battle of Saraighat]]. During the Battle of Saraighat, fought in [[Saraighat]] in 1671, the Mughals were overrun due to the strong leadership and hard work of [[Lachit Borphukan]]. The great embankment called ‘Mumai-Kota Gorh’, named after an incident in which Lachit had to slay (Kota) his own maternal uncle (Mumai) for being lazy in building the embankment (Gorh) that runs along the outskirts of the city, stands as a proof of the hard work and war-readiness on the part of the Ahoms. There was an ancient boat yard in [[Dighalipukhuri]], probably used by the Ahoms in medieval times.<ref name="Guwahati"/> Medieval constructions include temples, ramparts, etc. in the city.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=may1109/City8 | title=Ambari excavation site reveals age of Guwahati | work=The Assam Tribune | date=11 May 2009 | accessdate=12 June 2012 | author=Reporter, Staff | location=Guwahati}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.assamtribune.com/may3009/horizon.html | title=The Tales of Ponds | work=The Assam Tribune | accessdate=12 June 2012 | author=Saikh Md Sabah Al-Ahmed | location=Guwahati}}</ref>

==Urban morphology==
[[File:Guwahati Urban Morphology.png|left|thumb|250px|Guwahati's urban morphology]]

Guwahati's 'urban form' radiates from a central core with growth corridors radiating and extending towards the south, east and west. In the past few decades, southern Guwahati areas such as Ganeshguri, Beltola, Hatigaon, Six Mile and Panjabari began forming a southern sub-center surrounding the capital complex at Dispur. The core area<ref>{{cite web|author=TI Trade |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/jul1109/horizon.html |title=Assam Tribune online |publisher=Assamtribune.com |date= |accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> consists of the old city with [[Pan Bazaar]], [[Paltan Bazaar]], [[Fancy Bazaar]] and [[Uzan Bazaar]], with each area facilitating unique urban activities.<ref name="Capital of Assam"/><ref name="Guwahati's Urban Morphology">{{cite web|url=https://online.assam.gov.in/web/guest/urban |title=Guwahati's Urban Morphology |publisher=Assam Online Portal |date= |accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Guwahati City.jpg|thumb|250px|<center>Guwahati at dusk</center>]]

Among the city corridors, the most important is the corridor formed along the Guwahati-Shillong (GS) Road towards the south (almost {{cvt|15|km|disp=sqbr}} from the city-center). The GS Road corridor is an important commercial area with retail, wholesale and commercial offices developed along the main road; it is also a densely built residential area in the inner parts. The capital complex of Assam at [[Dispur]] is situated in this corridor. This corridor has facilitated the growth of a southern city sub-center at Ganeshguri, along with other residential areas to the south developed during the past few decades.<ref name="Capital of Assam"/><ref name="Guwahati's Urban Morphology"/>

The corridor extending towards the west (around {{cvt|30|km|disp=sqbr}} from the city-center) contains a rail-road linking not only Guwahati but also other parts of the northeastern region east of Guwahati to western Assam and the rest of India. The corridor links residential and historically important areas such as Nilachal Hill (Kamakhya), Pandu, and Maligaon (headquarters of Northeast Frontier Railways) before it separates into two - one towards North Guwahati via the [[Saraighat]] Bridge and the other continuing west towards LGB International Airport via [[Gauhati University]] (Jalukbari). There are also many river ports/jetties along this corridor.<ref name="Capital of Assam"/><ref name="Guwahati's Urban Morphology"/>

The third major corridor extends towards the east (around 15&nbsp;km from the city-center) linking Noonmati ([[Guwahati Refinery]]) and Narengi, and has facilitated residential growth along it. Highway NH-37, which encircles the city's southern parts and links the southern corridor in Noumile to the western corridor in Jalukbari is currently supporting rapid development. Similarly, the VIP Road linking Zoo Road with the eastern corridor and recently completed Hengerabari-Narengi Road are also supporting massive residential development to the east.<ref name="Capital of Assam"/><ref name="Guwahati's Urban Morphology"/>

Guwahati is one among 98 Indian cities which will be upgraded to [[Smart city|Smart Cities]] under a project embarked on by [[Ministry of Urban Development]], Government of India. With the grade of a Smart city, Guwahati will have highly up-to-date and radical provisions like regular and continuous electric supply, first-rate traffic and transport system, superior health care and many other prime utilities. Under this scheme, the city will use digital technology that will act as the integral mechanism of the aforesaid facilities and thereby further elevate the lifestyle of the citizens of Guwahati.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=aug2815/at051 |title=Guwahati among 7 NE Smart Cities |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=28 August 2015 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/smart-cities-list-check-which-cities-have-been-selected-in-pm-modis-smart-city-mission/126368/ |title=Smart City full list |publisher=The Financial Express |date=28 August 2015 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>

==Administration & Governance==
Dispur, the capital of Assam, lies in Guwahati. The passing of North Eastern (Reorganization Areas) Act in 1971 by the [[Indian Parliament]] accorded [[Meghalaya]] the status of a full-fledged state.

==Growth issues==

;Increase in population:
Guwahati has seen a rapid rise in population in the past few years. People from other parts of the state and the region routinely migrate to the city chiefly for education and occupation resulting in undesirable expansion of population in the city, which further brings with it many collateral problems in the city.<ref name="Problems of Guwahati">{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=dec2610/city07|title=Problems of Guwahati |publisher=assamtribune.com |date= |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

;Price rise:
One of the economic problems that the citizens of Guwahati have to put up with is the hike in prices of many essentials, chiefly vegetable, poultry and fish. The prices of these commodities keep escalating at an inordinate rate because of which the buyers find it difficult to buy these items. Vegetables are transported into Assam from [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Delhi]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Meghalaya]] and the truckers en route have to pay considerable amount of money as tax at various check posts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=apr2814/city05|title=Increasing prices of potato causing concern |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=may0613/city06|title=Govt yet to initiate action to check price rise |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> It is one of the causes of rise in prices of vegetables in the markets of Guwahati. The prices of locally available vegetables and fruits undergo large [[Markup (business)|markup]] because of transportation expenses grounds, besides intra-State check posts taxes. In addition to these, the wholesale dealers as well as the retail sellers augment the prices of the commodities according to their own desires. The prices of poultry, mainly chicken that reach the city markets from places like [[Chaygaon]] and [[Barpeta district|Barpeta]] have been soaring rapidly because of similar factors. There has been steep rise in the prices of fishes as well, the prominent varieties of which being Rohu ("Rou"), Catla ("Bahu"), Walking catfish ("Magur") and Monopterus ("Kuchia") among many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=jun3013/city05|title=Abnormal rise in prices of foodstuff hits citizens |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=30 June 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/guwahati/Rise-in-chicken-fish-prices-affects-locals/articleshow/20852487.cms|title=Rise in chicken, fish prices affects locals |publisher=The Times of India |date=1 July 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref>
