'''Altrincham Football Club''' is a semi-professional [[association football]] club in [[Altrincham]], [[Greater Manchester]], England, which plays in the [[National League North]], the sixth tier of English football. The club is notable for its [[FA Cup]] history, having advancing further in the competition than any other semi-professional team.

==History==
Playing in the [[Cheshire County League]] for most of their early history, Altrincham achieved little success until the 1960s, when Altrincham director Noel White hired Freddie Pye as manager. A key turning point in the history of the club is often cited as the signing of [[Jackie Swindells]] in 1965, who in his first full season (1965–66) scored a phenomenal 82 goals in 63 games for the club helping Altrincham to the first of two back-to-back Cheshire League titles.<ref name="jackie swindells">{{cite web|last1=Rowley|first1=Terry|title=Altrincham Football Club Legends Section Eighteen Profiles 52–54|url=http://www.altrinchamfc.co.uk/legend21.htm|website=Altrincham FC|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> The 1968–69 season saw Altrincham join [[Northern Premier League Premier Division|The Northern Premier League]] (NPL) as founder members.<ref name="league records">{{cite web|title=ALTRINCHAM FC LEAGUE RECORD 1946–|url=http://www.lusaweb.co.uk/league1946+.htm|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>

After 11 seasons in the NPL, Altrincham joined the [[Alliance Premier League]] (now the [[Football Conference]]) as founder members at the beginning of the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80]] season, going on to win the league in its first two seasons.<ref name="league records" /> Despite their success Altrincham failed to gain election to [[the Football League]] on both occasions due to the voting system in place at the time. In 1980, Altrincham fell short of election to the Football League by the narrowest of margins.<ref>[http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1979–80/Div41979–80.htm]</ref>

It wasn't until 1987 that automatic promotion was awarded to the league;<ref name="conference promotion">{{cite news|last1=Osbourne|first1=Chris|title=Football League: Battle to stay in League Two|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22111820|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=BBC|date=12 April 2013}}</ref> since then Altrincham have only challenged for promotion in the 1990–91 season, eventually finishing 3rd behind [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] and [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], despite having promotion in their hands with three games left.<ref>[http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/conference/1990–1991/table/1991–04–28]</ref> Much of Altrincham's success in that season was credited to the goal-scoring prowess of [[Ken McKenna (football manager)|Ken McKenna]] who scored 22 goals in the league, picking up the player of the season award in the progress.<ref>[http://www.lusa.u-net.com/legend16.htm]</ref>

Altrincham never regained their success of the 1970s and 1980s and in 1997 they were relegated from the top flight of non-league football to the [[Northern Premier League]] for the first time in their history. They won the NPL title two years later, only to go back down again after just one season in the Conference.<ref name="league records" /> It was five years before they gained promotion again, in 2005 as winners of the Conference North/Conference South playoffs beating [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]] of Conference South at The [[Britannia Stadium]] in the final match.<ref name="conference history">{{cite web|title=History&nbsp;– The Official Football Conference League Website|url=http://www.footballconference.co.uk/history.php|website=Football Conference|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>

Altrincham were uniquely reprieved from relegation for three successive seasons (2005–06, 2006–07 and 2007–08) as a result of other clubs' issues. In the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season, Altrincham finished 18th in the Conference, outside of the [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] zone. However, they were found to have fielded an ineligible player, [[James Robinson (footballer born 1982)|James Robinson]], for 15 matches, during which he scored six goals and Altrincham won 18 points. This led to an 18-point deduction. An appeal to the [[The Football Association|FA]] on 23 May failed, which meant that Altrincham finished in bottom place. However, with [[Canvey Island F.C.|Canvey Island]] resigning from the league and [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] losing their entire points total for breach of the league's rules on club ownership, Altrincham remained in the Conference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/5044276.stm|title=Scarborough relegation confirmed|work=BBC Sport|date=3 June 2006}}</ref>

The [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season saw Altrincham "relegated" on the final day of the season, after a 0–0 draw with [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/6579029.stm|title=Altrincham 0–0 Aldershot|date=28 April 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> although they were later reprieved when [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] (relegated from [[Football League Two]]) were refused permission to play in the [[Conference National]] and ordered to play in the [[Conference North]] instead, as a result of financial problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/boston_united/6738469.stm|title=Boston suffer new demotion blow|date=10 June 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> In [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]], they finished in the Conference relegation zone for the third successive season but were yet again reprieved from relegation when [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] were forced into liquidation.<ref name="0708 season">{{cite web|title=Altrincham FC Review of Season 2007–08|url=http://www.altrinchamfc.co.uk/revu0708.htm|website=Altrincham FC Official Website|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>

The [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season proved to be a much better campaign for Altrincham, with the club spending much of the season in mid-table, and they eventually achieved safety from relegation with two games to spare. Altrincham did even better in [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10]], challenging for a play-off spot early in the campaign and finishing in a relatively safe 14th place.<ref name="league records" /> In 2009, [[Ricky Ponting]], captain of the [[Australian Cricket Team|Australian Cricket team]], became a major shareholder of the club after striking up a friendship with club Chairman Geoff Goodwin, whose Eccles-based coach company [[Go Goodwins]] have the [[England & Wales Cricket Board]] contract to drive the Australia team coach.<ref>[http://media.theage.com.au/sport/sports-hq/pontings-pommy-soccer-secret-667216.html&nbsp;– "pontings pommy soccer secret"]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/altrincham/9495391.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sinnott appointed Altrincham boss | date=24 May 2011}}</ref> However, the club had a poor start to the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]], earning only one point from their first eight games, which resulted in the sacking of long-time manager Graham Heathcoate in September.<ref name=heathcote>{{cite news|title=Altrincham manager Graham Heathcote leaves club|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/altrincham/8998264.stm|accessdate=28 May 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=14 September 2010}}</ref> [[Ken McKenna]] replaced Heathcoate and the team's form gradually improved as the season went on, but their awful start cost them in the end and they were relegated in 22nd place on the final day of the season.<ref name="league records" /> Ironically, had they finished one place higher they would have earned a fourth reprieve from relegation due to [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]] being expelled from the Conference because of financial problems, but this time it was to be [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] who were reprieved.<ref name="southport reprieve">{{cite web|title=Regular reprieves from relegation in the Conference|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/wsc-daily/1016-July-2011/7387-regular-reprieves-from-relegation-in-the-conference|website=When Saturday Comes|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref> After Altrincham's relegation McKenna left the club.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13333997.stm | work=BBC News | title=Manager McKenna leaves Altrincham}}</ref>

In a dramatic finish to their play-off final against Guiseley, Altrincham substitute Greg Wilkinson came on in the last minute of extra-time and scored with his first touch for a 2–1 win.<ref name=wilko>{{cite news|title=Altrincham 2 Guiseley 1: Guiseley’s hearts are broken by one-touch Wilkinson|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/non-league/altrincham-2-guiseley-1-guiseley-s-hearts-are-broken-by-one-touch-wilkinson-1-6610890|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=12 May 2014}}</ref>

==Rivals==
Altrincham's traditional rivals are [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]], a rivalry dating back to when both clubs were in the Cheshire League, and later the Northern Premier League and Conference. The clubs have shared the same division from 2014–present for the first time since 1996. A more recent rivalry has developed with [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] who have been in and out of the Conference in recent times. The intensity of this rivalry was epitomised in Altrincham's 3–0 defeat of Northwich at Moss Lane of Boxing Day 2006. Despite this, many players have played for both clubs over the years, most notably [[Greg Young]], Ryan Brown, and [[Lee Elam]].
