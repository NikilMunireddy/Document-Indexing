A '''gymnasium''' is a type of school with a strong emphasis on academic learning, and providing advanced [[secondary education]] in some parts of Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], comparable to British [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school]]s, [[sixth form college]]s and U.S. [[University-preparatory school|preparatory high schools]]. In its current meaning, it usually refers to secondary schools focused on preparing students to enter a [[university]] for advanced academic study.

Historically, the German ''Gymnasium'' also included in its overall accelerated curriculum post secondary education at college level and the degree awarded substituted for the bachelor's degree (Baccalaureat)<ref>[[:de:Bakkalaureat]] section 'Geschichte' ('History') accessed 3/14/2012</ref> previously awarded by a college or university so that universities in Germany became exclusively graduate schools.  In the US, the German Gymnasium curriculum was used at a number of prestigious universities such as the University of Michigan as a model for their undergraduate college programs.<ref>John Seiler Brubacher, Willis Rudy, "Higher education in transition: a history of American colleges and universities", 4th Edition, 1997 New Brunswick, NJ, page 157/158; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=0O1yXnXkWIsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false%20 Google Books]</ref>  The word ''γυμνάσιον'' (gymnasion) was used in [[Ancient Greece]], meaning a locality for both physical and intellectual education of young men (see [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)]]). The latter meaning of a place of intellectual education persisted in German and other languages, whereas in English the meaning of a place for physical education was retained, more familiarly in the shortened form [[gym]].

In the [[Education in Poland|Polish educational system]] the ''gimnazjum'' is a [[middle school]] (junior high school) for pupils aged 13 to 16. The same applies in the [[Education in Greece|Greek educational system]], with the additional option of ''Εσπερινό Γυμνάσιο'' (evening gymnasium) for adults and working students aged 14 upwards.

==School structure==
The gymnasium is a secondary school which prepares the student for [[higher education]] at a [[university]]. They are thus meant for the more academically minded students, who are sifted out at about the age of 10–13. In addition to the usual curriculum, students of a gymnasium often study [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]].

Some gymnasiums provide general education, others have a specific focus. (This also differs from country to country.) The  four traditional branches are:
*[[humanities]] education (specialising in classical languages, such as [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]])
*modern languages (students are required to study at least three languages)
*mathematical-scientific education
*economical and social-scientific education (students are required to study [[economics]], [[world history]], [[social studies]] and [[business informatics]])

Curricula differ from school to school,  but generally include language, mathematics, [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], physics, chemistry, biology, geography, art (as well as crafts and design), music, history, philosophy, [[civics]] / citizenship,<ref>this subject has different names in the different states of Germany. See [[:de:Gemeinschaftskunde]]</ref> social sciences, and several foreign languages.

Schools concentrate not only on academic subjects, but on producing well-rounded individuals, so physical education and religion or ethics are compulsory, even in non-denominational schools which are prevalent. For example, the German constitution guarantees the separation of church and state, so although religion or ethics classes are compulsory, students may choose to study a specific religion or none at all.

Today, a number of other areas of specialization exist, such as gymnasiums specializing in economics, technology or domestic sciences. In some countries, there is a notion of '''progymnasium''', which is equivalent to beginning classes of the full gymnasium, with the rights to continue education in a gymnasium. Here, the prefix "pro" indicates that this curriculum precedes normal gymnasium studies.

==History==
In the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking]], the Central-European, the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]], the [[Benelux]] (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) and the [[Baltic countries]], this meaning for "gymnasium", that is a secondary school preparing the student for [[higher education]] at a university,  has been the same at least since the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century. The term was derived from the [[classical Greek]] word "[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]", which was originally applied to an exercising ground in ancient [[Athens]]. Here teachers gathered and gave instruction between the hours devoted to physical exercises and sports, and thus the term became associated with and came to mean an institution of learning.<ref name="americana">{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Gymnasia and Real-gymnasia|year=1920}}</ref>

This use of the term did not prevail among the [[Education in ancient Rome|Romans]], but was revived during the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance in Italy]], and from there passed into the Netherlands and Germany during the 15th century. In 1538, [[Johannes Sturm]] founded at [[Strasbourg]] the [[Jean Sturm Gymnasium|school which became the model]] of the modern German gymnasium. In 1812, a [[Prussia]]n regulation ordered that all schools which had the right to send their students to the university should bear the name of gymnasia. By the 20th century, this practice was followed in almost the entire [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian]], [[German Empire|German]], and [[Russian Empire]]s.<ref name="americana"/> In the modern era, many countries which have gymnasiums were once part of these three empires.

==By country==

===Albania===
In Albania a gymnasium ([[Albanian language|Albanian]] Gjimnaz) education takes three years following a compulsory nine-year elementary education and ending with a final aptitude test called ''[[Matura]] Shtetërore''. The final test is standardized at the state level and serves as an entrance qualification for universities.

There are both public (state-run, tuition-free) and private (fee-paying) gymnasium schools in these countries.

The subjects taught are mathematics, the native language, one to three foreign languages, history, geography, informatics, the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), history of art, music, philosophy, logic, physical education and the social sciences (sociology, ethics, psychology, politics and economy).

Gymnasium (Gjimnazi) is generally viewed as a destination for best performing students and as the type of school that serves primarily to prepare students for university, while other students go to technical/vocational schools. Therefore, gymnasiums often base their admittance criteria on an entrance exam, elementary school grades or some combination of the two.

===Austria===
In Austria the Gymnasium has two stages, from the age of 11 to 14, and from 15 to 18, concluding with [[Matura]]. Historically, three types existed. The ''Humanistisches Gymnasium'' focuses on [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]]. The ''Neusprachliches Gymnasium'' puts its focus on actively spoken languages. The usual combination is English, French and Latin; sometimes French can be swapped with another foreign language (like Italian, Spanish or Russian). The ''Realgymnasium'' puts its focus on science. In the last couple of decades more autonomy was granted to schools and various types were developed, focusing on sports, music or economics, for example.

===Northern European countries===
In [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Finland]], [[Greenland]], [[Latvia]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] gymnasium consists of three years, usually starting at age 16 after nine or ten years of primary school. In [[Iceland]] and [[Lithuania]] the gymnasium usually consists of four years of schooling starting at the age of 16, the last year roughly corresponding to the first year of [[college]].

In the Nordic countries, education is meant to be free. This includes not only primary school, but most gymnasiums and universities as well. Furthermore, to help decrease the heritage of historic [[social injustice]], all countries except [[Iceland]] have [[Grant (money)|universal grants]] for students. However, entrance is competitive and based on merit.

In Denmark, there are four kinds of gymnasiums: [[Gymnasium (Denmark)|STX]] (Regular Examination Programme), [[HHX]] (Higher Business Examination Programme), [[Higher Technical Examination Programme|HTX]] (Higher Technical Examination Programme) and [[Higher Preparatory Examination (HF)|HF]] (Higher Preparatory Examination Programme). To attend hf, it is a prerequisite that students add a voluntary tenth year to their primary school education. Hf then lasts only two years, instead of the three required for stx, hhx, and htx. All four type of gymnasiums theoretically gives the same eligibility for university. However, because of different subjects offered, students may be better qualified in an area of further study. 
ex. HHX students have subjects that make them practically more eligible, for studies such as business studies or economy at university.

In the Faroe Islands, there are also four kinds of gymnasiums, which are equivalents to the Danish educations: ''Studentaskúli'' (equivalent to stx), ''Handilsskúli'' (hhx), ''Tekniski skúli'' (htx) and ''HF'' (hf). Studentaskúli and HF are usually located at the same institutions as can be seen in the name of the institute in [[Eysturoy]]: [[Studentaskúlin og HF-skeiðið í Eysturoy]].

In [[Greenland]], there is a single kind of gymnasium, "[[Den Gymnasiale Uddannelse]]" ([[Ilinniarnertuunngorniarneq]]), that replaced the earlier Greenlandic Secondary Education Programme (GU), the Greenland Higher Commercial Examination Programme ([[HHX]]) and the Greenland education to Higher Technical Examination Programme ([[Higher Technical Examination Programme|HTX]]), which were based on the Danish system. This programme allows a more flexible Greenland gymnasium, where students based on a common foundation course can choose between different fields of study that meets the individual student's abilities and interests. The course is offered in [[Aasiaat]], [[Nuuk]], [[Sisimiut]] and [[Qaqortoq]], with one in [[Ilulissat]] to be opened in 2015, latest in 2016 if approved by [[Parliament of Greenland|Inatsisartut]].

In Finland, the admissions to gymnasiums are competitive, the accepted people comprising 51% of the age group.<ref>http://www.minedu.fi/export/sites/default/OPM/Koulutus/ammatillinen_koulutus/hallinto_ohjaus_ja_rahoitus/liitteet/PM__1250_opiskelijapaikan_lisxminen_01012010.pdf</ref> The gymnasiums concludes with the matriculation exam ([[Abitur]]), an exam whose grades are the main criteria for college admissions.

[[File:Gymnasium of Karlovci.jpg|thumb|[[Gymnasium of Karlovci]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]], [[Serbia]]]]
In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]], a gymnasium education takes four years following a compulsory eight or nine-year elementary education and ending with a final aptitude test called ''[[Matura]]''. In Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Serbia the final test is standardized at the state level and serves as an entrance qualification for universities.

There are both public (state-run and tuition-free) and private (fee-paying) gymnasium schools in these countries.

The subjects taught are mathematics, the native language, one to three foreign languages, history, geography, informatics (computers), the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), history of art, music, philosophy, logic, physical education and the social sciences (sociology, ethics or religious education, psychology, politics and economy). Religious studies are optional. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia, [[Latin language|Latin]] is also a mandatory subject in all gymnasiums, just as [[Ancient Greek]] is, with Latin, in a certain type of gymnasiums called Classical Gymnasiums (''klasična gimnazija'').

In all of the countries, the gymnasium (Gimnazija/Gjimnazi) is generally viewed as a destination for best performing students and as the type of school that serves primarily to prepare students for university studies, while other students go to technical/vocational schools. Therefore, gymnasiums often base their admittance criteria on an entrance exam, elementary school grades or a combination of the two.

[[Gymnasium (Germany)|German Gymnasium]]s are selective schools. They offer the most academically promising youngsters a quality education<ref>PISA 2003&nbsp;– Der Bildungsstand der Jugendlichen in Deutschland&nbsp;– Ergebnisse des 2. internationalen Vergleiches Ehmke et al., 2004, In: PISA-Konsortium Deutschland (Hrsg.): PISA 2003&nbsp;– Der Bildungsstand der Jugendlichen in Deutschland&nbsp;– Ergebnisse des 2. internationalen Vergleiches, Münster/NewYork: Waxmann, S.&nbsp;244</ref> that is free in all state-run schools (and generally not above 50 €/month cost in Church-run schools, though there are some expensive private schools). Gymnasiums may expel students who academically underperform their classmates or behave in a way that is seen as unacceptable.
Pupils study subjects like German, mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, arts, music, physical education, religion, history and [[civics]]/citizenship/[[social science]]s<ref>This subject has different names in the different States of Germany; see [[:de:Gemeinschaftskunde]]</ref> and  [[Informatics (academic field)|computer science]]. They are also required to study at least two foreign languages. The usual combinations are English and French or English and [[Latin]], although many schools make it possible to combine English with another language, most often Spanish, [[Ancient Greek]], or Russian. Religious education classes are a part of the curricula of all German schools, yet not compulsory; a student or their parents or guardians can conscientously object taking them, in which case they (along with the confessionless pupils and those whose religion is not being taught in the school) can either elect to take an RE course of another confession or is taught [[ethics]]. In state schools, a student who is not baptised into either the Catholic or the Protestant faith is allowed to choose which of these classes to take.<ref>[http://www.bvsg-nu.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:neu-am-gymnasium&catid=11:eltern&Itemid=36 Die ersten Schritte am Gymnasium]</ref> The only exception to this is the [[States of Germany|state]] of Berlin in which the subject ''ethics'' is mandatory for all students and classes and (Christian) religious studies can only be chosen additionally. A similar situation is to be found in [[Brandenburg]] where the subject ''life skills, ethics, and religious education'' (''Lebensgestaltung, Ethik, Religionskunde – LER'') is the primary subject but parents/guardians or students older than 13 can choose to replace it with (Christian) religious studies or take both. The intention behind LER is that students should get an objective insight on questions of personal development and ethics as well as on the major world religions.<ref>[http://www.mbjs.brandenburg.de/sixcms/detail.php/120349 Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Federal State of Brandenburg – Lebensgestaltung-Ethik-Religionskunde (L-E-R)]</ref>

For younger students nearly the entire curriculum of a Gymnasium is compulsory; in higher grades elective subjects are available and some of the formerly compulsory subjects can be dropped, but the choice is not as wide as in other school systems, like US high schools.

Although some specialist Gymnasiums have English or French as the language of instruction, at most Gymnasiums lessons (apart from foreign language courses) are conducted in [[Standard German]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The number of years of instruction at a Gymnasium differs between the states. It varies between six and seven years in Berlin and [[Brandenburg]] (primary school is six years in both as opposed to four years in the rest of Germany) and eight in [[Bavaria]], [[Hesse]] and [[Baden-Württemberg]] among others. While in [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]] students have never been taught more than eight years in Gymnasium (by default), nearly all states now conduct the [[Abitur]] examinations, which complete the Gymnasium education, after 12 years of primary school and Gymnasium combined. In addition to that, some states still or again offer a 13-year curriculum leading to the Abitur. These final examinations are centrally drafted and controlled (''Zentralabitur'') in all German states except for [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and provide a qualification to attend any German university.

===Italy===
In Italy originally the Gimnasio indicated a typology of five-year [[junior high school]] (age 11 to 16) and preparing to the three year [[Liceo Classico|Classical Lyceum]] (age 16 to 19), a high school focusing on [[classical studies]] and [[humanities]]. After the school reform that unified the junior high school system, the term Gimnasio stayed to indicate the first two year of Liceo Classico, now five years long. Oddly enough, an Italian high school student who enrolls in Liceo Classico follows this study path: Quarta Gimnasio (gymnasium fourth year, age 14), Quinta Gimnasio (gymnasium fifth year, age 15), Prima Liceo (Liceo first year, age 16), Seconda Liceo (Liceo second year, age 17) and Terza Liceo (Liceo third year, age 18). Some believe this still has some sense, since the two-year Gimnasio has a very different set of mind from the Liceo. Gimnasio students spend most of their time studying Greek and Latin grammar, laying the bases for the "higher" and more complicated set of studies of the Liceo, such as Greek and Latin literature and Philosophy.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, gymnasium is the highest variant of secondary education, offering the academically most promising youngsters (top 5%) a quality education that is in most cases free (and in other cases at low cost). It consists of six years, after 8 years (including [[kindergarten]]) of primary school, in which pupils study the same subjects as their German counterparts, with the addition of compulsory [[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]] and ''Klassieke Culturele Vorming'', Classical Cultural Education, history of the Ancient Greek and Roman culture and literature. Schools have some freedom in choosing their specific curriculum, with for example Spanish, Philosophy and "[[Technasium]]", a very technical and highly demanding course, being available as final exams. Usually schools will have all classes mandatory in switching combinations for the first three or so years (with the exception of Technasium which is a free choice from the second year onwards), after which students will choose their subjects in the directions of Economics and Society, Culture and Society, Nature and Health, Nature and Technology or Technology. The equivalent without classical languages is called ''[[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|Atheneum]]'', and gives access to the same university studies (although some extra classes are needed when starting a degree in classical languages or theology). All are government-funded. See [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] for the full article on Dutch "preparatory scientific education".

===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, gymnázium (also spelled gymnasium) is one type of schools that provide secondary education. There are three types of gymnázium distinguished by the length of study: eight-year, six-year and four-year types. It leads to the ''[[maturita]]'' exam.

===Slovak Republic (Slovakia)===
{{Main|Education in Slovakia#Secondary education}}
:''See also {{Look from|Gymnázium}}''

In the [[Slovak Republic]], gymnázium is one type of schools that provide secondary education. There are two types of gymnázium distinguished by the length of study: eight-year and four-year types (more common). Other types are bilingual (usually Slovak/French or Slovak/English) and private gymnáziums. All of them lead to the ''[[maturita]]'' exam.

High school education (lower cycle of high school and upper secondary school education) offers three different orientations (academic,  technological, specialization).
*Russia
**[[Imperial Russia]]: since 1726, 8 years since 1871. Women gymnasiums since 1862; 7 years + optional 8th for specialisation in [[pedagogy]]. Progymnasiums: equivalent to 4 first years of gymnasium.
**[[Russian Federation]]: full 11 or 6–7 years after primary school. Nowadays there are very few schools in Russia, which in their teaching principles and curriculum resemble the prerevolutionalry tradition of Classical Gymnasium. The notable exception is the [[St Petersburg Classical Gymnasium]] where Latin, Ancient Greek and Mathematics are three core subjects. In majority of other cases Russian Gymnasiums are schools specialised in a certain subject (or several subjects) in the humanities ([http://chelschool1.ru example]).
*[[Serbia]] (4 years, starting at age 14/15 after 8 years in elementary/primary school. There are 3 types of gymnasiums: most commonly 1)general gymnasium (општа гимназија) which offers broad education in either 2) natural science (природно-математички смер) or 3) social studies (друштвени смер), available all over Serbia, and a few specialised ones, i.e. science and mathematics (природно-математичка гимназија) -- only one in all of Serbia, in Belgrade; sports (спортска гиманзија) -- just two in Serbia; and language gymnasiums (филолошка гимназија) -- a total of four in Serbia. In the end, everyone has a final exam –a Matura. Completion of the Gymnasium is a prerequisite for enrollment into a university. English and another foreign language (from the selection of German, French Russian (most common languages), Italian or Spanish (less common, few schools in larger cities have these languages in offer)) (in addition to the mother tongue, and in case of minorities also Serbian, of course) are compulsory throughout.
*[[Slovakia]] (4 years starting at age 15 after completing 9 years of elementary school (more common); 8 years starting at age 11 after completing 5 years of elementary school; both end with  [[Matura|Maturita]])
*[[Slovenia]] (4 years, starting at age 14/15, ends with Matura).
*South Africa ([[Paul Roos Gymnasium]] is a well-known gymnasium for boys in the town called Stellenbosch. The school is a boarding school, based on the classic British boarding schools, however it was more influenced by the Protestant faith, hence the German Gymnasium. Foreign languages such as French, German, Mandarin and Latin are studied, [[Afrikaans]] and English are compulsory. School in South Africa: 5 years, starting at age 13/14, at a secondary institution, after 7 years of primary school, ends with Matric).
*Sweden Upper secondary school in Sweden lasts for three years (formerly four years on some programmes). "Gymnasium" is the word used to describe this stage of the education system in Sweden. The [[National Agency for Education (Sweden)|National Agency of Education]] has decided that ''gymnasium'' is equivalent to the international upper secondary school.<ref>http://www.skolverket.se/2.3894/publicerat/2.5006?_xurl_=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.skolverket.se%3A8080%2Fwtpub%2Fws%2Fskolbok%2Fwpubext%2Ftrycksak%2FRecord%3Fk%3D2801</ref> The gymnasium is optional and follows after nine years in elementary school. However, the Swedish term "högskola" (translated to "high school") may cause some confusion. It is in Swedish used almost synonymously to "university", with the only difference being that universities have the right to issue doctoral examinations. In the case of technical universities, these could also be called högskola even when they have right to issue doctoral examinations (e.g. [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers tekniska högskola]], [[Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University|Lunds tekniska högskola]], [[KTH|Kungliga tekniska högskolan]]). A högskola is often located in cities with lower population, except for the technical ones that can be found also in the largest cities. 
*Switzerland (usually 4 years after 9 years of compulsory schooling (primary and secondary&nbsp;I); it is also possible to attend a so-called "Langzeitgymnasium" which lasts 6 years, following a six-year primary schooling; the Gymnasium ends with Matura at the age of 18/19).
*[[Ukraine]] (8 years, starting after 4 years of [[primary school]]).
*United Kingdom: historically, [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]] have been the English equivalent of the gymnasium, selecting pupils on the basis of academic ability (usually through the 11+ test in year 6) and educating them with the assumption that they would go on to study at a [[university]]; such schools were largely phased out under the [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] and [[Edward Heath|Heath]] governments, with less than 5% of pupils now attending grammar schools, and the UK now has no widespread equivalent of the gymnasium. The exception is [[Northern Ireland]] and parts of England including the counties of [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Kent]] which retained the system. Many private, fee-paying [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]]s, including all those commonly referred to as "public" schools, seek to fulfil a similar role to the state grammar school if the scholar has the ability (and thus to the gymnasium in other countries).
*United States
**[[Public school (government funded)|Public school]]: As school districts continue to experiment with educational styles, the [[magnet school]] has become a popular type of [[high school]]. [[Boston Latin School]] and [[Central High School (Philadelphia)]] are both the oldest public schools in the country, and the oldest magnet schools. As the concept has not become entrenched in the various American educational systems, due partly to the [[Federation|federal]], rather than unitary style of education in the US, the term may vary among states.
**[[Private school]]: The equivalent among private schools is the [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]].

==Final degree==<!-- This section is linked from [[Paul Ehrenfest]] -->
Depending on country, the final degree (if any) is called [[Abitur]], [[Artium]], [[Diploma]], [[Matura]], [[Maturita]] or [[Student (degree)|Student]] and it usually opens the way to professional schools directly.
However, depending on which country the issuing school is located in, these degrees are occasionally not fully accredited internationally, and students willing to attend foreign [[university]] often have to submit to further exams to be permitted access to them. The final two or three years at a gymnasium can be seen as an equivalent to the first two years at college in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Relationship with other education facilities==
In countries like Canada or Austria, most university faculties only accept students from secondary schools that last four years (rather than three). This includes all Gymnasium students but only a part of vocational high schools, in effect making Gymnasium the preferred choice for all pupils aiming for university diplomas.

In Germany, other types of secondary school are called ''[[Realschule]], [[Hauptschule]]'' and ''[[Gesamtschule]]''. These are attended by about two-thirds of the students and the first two are practically unknown in other parts of the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} A Gesamtschule largely corresponds to a British or American high school. However, it offers the same school leaving certificates as the other three types of German secondary schools—the ''Hauptschulabschluss'' (school leaving certificate of a Hauptschule after 9th Grade or in Berlin and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] after 10th Grade), the ''Realschulabschluss'', also called'' Mittlere Reife'' (school leaving certificate of a Realschule after 10th Grade), and ''[[Abitur]],'' also called ''Hochschulreife'', after 12th Grade. Students who graduate from Hauptschule or Realschule may continue their schooling at a [[vocational school]] until they have full job qualifications. It is also possible to get an ''erweiterter Realschulabschluss'' after 10th grade that allows the students to continue their education at the ''Oberstufe'' of a gymnasium and get an Abitur. There are two types of vocational school in Germany. The ''[[Berufsschule]]'', a part-time vocational school and a part of Germany's [[dual education system]], and the ''[[Berufsfachschule]]'', a full-time vocational school outside the dual education system. Both types of school are also part of Germany's secondary school system. Students who graduate from a vocational school and students who graduate with a good [[Grade (education)|grade point average]] from a Realschule can continue their schooling at another type of German secondary school, the ''[[Fachoberschule]]'', a vocational high school. The school leaving exam of this type of school, the ''Fachhochschulreife'', enables the graduate to start studying at a [[Fachhochschule]] ([[institute of technology#German language areas – Technische Universitäten and Fachhochschulen|polytechnic]]), and in [[Hesse]] also at a university within the state. Students who have graduated from vocational school and have been working in a job for at least three years can go to [[Berufsoberschule]] to get either a "Fachabitur" (meaning they may go to university, but they can only study the subjects belonging to the "branch" (economical, technical, social) they studied in at Berufschule.) after one year, or the normal "Abitur" (after two years), which gives them complete access to universities.
