Deputy Lieutenant

In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''Deputy Lieutenant''' is a Crown appointment and one of several deputies to the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of a [[lieutenancy area]]: an English [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]], Welsh [[preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]], Scottish [[lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]], or [[Northern Irish]] [[county borough]] or [[counties of Ireland|county]].

In [[Style (manner of address)|formal style]], the postnominal letters '''DL''' may be added: e.g. ''John Brown, CBE, DL''. Should the subject have numerous more important honorifics these postnoms may be omitted, although this is rare.

Deputy Lieutenants are nominated by the Lord Lieutenant, to assist with any duties as may be required: see the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]]; Deputy Lieutenants receive their commission of appointment via the appropriate HM Government Minister by command of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]].<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/ukpga_19970023_en_1#l1g2 Lieutenancies Act 1997] (c. 23), section 2(4). Retrieved 2010-02-01.</ref> In England and Wales, since November 2001, the [[government minister]] responsible for most appointments is the [[Lord Chancellor]], with exceptions such as the [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]].<ref>The Transfer of Functions (Miscellaneous) Order 2001 (SI 2001/3500).</ref> In Scotland, since July 1999 it has been the [[Scottish Ministers]].<ref>The Scotland Act 1998 (Transfer of Functions to the Scottish Ministers etc.) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1820).</ref>

Decades ago,  the number of Deputy Lieutenants for each [[county]] could be  as few as three. Today, however, there may be well over a dozen that are appointed as the number of DLs today correlates with the population of each respective county. DLs tend to be people who either have served the local community, or have a history of public service in other fields.<ref>Lieutenancies Act 1997, section 2(2)(a).</ref>

DLs represent the Lord Lieutenant in his or her absence, including at local ceremonies and official events, from opening exhibitions to inductions of vicars (as requested by the Church of England). They must live within their ceremonial county, or within seven miles (11&nbsp;km) of its boundary.<ref>Lieutenancies Act 1997, section 2(2)(b)</ref> Their appointments do not terminate with any change of Lord Lieutenant,<ref>Lieutenancies Act 1997, section 2(5).</ref> but they are legally required to retire at age of 75.

One of the serving Deputy Lieutenants is appointed to be '''Vice-Lieutenant''',<ref>Lieutenancies Act 1997, section 3.</ref> who in most circumstances will stand in for the Lord Lieutenant when he or she cannot be present. The appointment as Vice-Lieutenant does, however, expire on the retirement of the Lord Lieutenant who made the choice. Generally, the Vice-Lieutenant would then revert to DL.<ref>Lieutenancies Act 1997, section 3(2).</ref>

Unlike the office of '''Lord Lieutenant''', which is an appointment in the gift of the Sovereign, the position of Deputy Lieutenant is an appointment of the Sovereign's appointee, namely the Government or the Crown, and therefore not strictly speaking a direct appointment of the Sovereign.
