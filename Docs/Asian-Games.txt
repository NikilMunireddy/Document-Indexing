The Games were regulated by the [[Asian Games Federation]] (AGF) from the first Games in [[New Delhi]], [[India]], until the [[1978 Asian Games|1978 Games]]. Since the [[1982 Asian Games|1982 Games]] they have been organized by the [[Olympic Council of Asia]] (OCA), after the breakup of the Asian Games Federation.<ref>{{cite web|title=OCA History|url=http://www.ocasia.org/Council/History.aspx|publisher=OCA|accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> The Games are recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and are described as the second largest multi-sport event after the [[Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games Taps Three-Time Olympic Sportscaster For New Sports Radio Talk Show|url=http://www.sportsbizasia.com/news/events/asian-games-taps-threetime-olympic-sportscaster-sports-radio-talk-show/|accessdate=8 September 2010|newspaper=Sports Biz Asia|date=8 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Fully renovated basketball arena ready for Asian Games|url=http://www.sports-city.org/news_details.php?news_id=8819&idCategory=56|accessdate=8 September 2010|newspaper=Sports City|date=22 July 2009}}</ref>

In its history, nine nations have hosted the Asian Games. Forty-six nations have participated in the Games, including [[Israel at the Asian Games|Israel]], which was excluded from the Games after their last participation in [[1974 Asian Games|1974]].

The [[2014 Asian Games|last Games]] was held in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea]] from 19 September to 4 October 2014.

==History==

===Prior formation===
Before the Asian Games were held, a gathering known as the [[Far Eastern Championship Games]] existed which was first mooted in 1912 at a location set between the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], and [[China]]. The Far Eastern Games were first held in [[Manila]] in [[1913 Far Eastern Games|1913]] with 6 participating nations.  Ten more Far Eastern Games were held until [[1934 Far Eastern Games|1934]]. Against the backdrop of the [[second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1934, in the face of Japan's insistence on including [[Manchukuo|Manchu Empire]] as a competitor nation in the Games, China announced its withdrawal from participation. Consequently, the Far Eastern Games scheduled for [[1938 Far Eastern Games|1938]] were cancelled. The organization was ultimately discontinued

===Formation===
After World War II, a number of Asian countries became independent. Many of the newly independent Asian countries desired the formation of a new type of competition whereby Asian dominance was not expressed through violence, but instead strengthened through mutual understanding. During the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], a conversation between sportsmen from China and the Philippines raised the idea of restoring the Far Eastern Games. However, [[Guru Dutt Sondhi]], the Indian International Olympic Committee representative, did not believe that restoration of the Far Eastern Games would sufficiently display the spirit of unity and level of achievement taking place in Asian sports. As a result, he proposed to sports leaders the idea of having a wholly new competition&nbsp; – which came to be the Asian Games. This led to an agreement to form the Asian Athletic Federation. A preparatory committee was then set up to draft the charter for this new body. On 13 February 1949, the Asian Athletic Federation was formally inaugurated in New Delhi, alongside the name Asian Games Federation, with New Delhi announced as the first host city of the Asian Games which were scheduled to be held in 1950.<ref name=FEG>{{cite web|title=亚运会是从什么时候开始举办的,每几年举办一次?|url=http://zhidao.wangchao.net.cn/detail_2890838.html|publisher=wangchao.org|accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=亚运会的前世今生：前身远东运动会 中国成绩优异|url=http://sports.sina.com.cn/o/2010-08-04/04065133499.shtml|accessdate=14 August 2010|newspaper=Sina|date=4 August 2010}}</ref>

===Crisis, reorganization, expansion===
[[File:Indian athletes at the First Asiad.png|thumb|[[1951 Asian Games|First Asian Games]] [[opening ceremony]]]]
Starting in [[1962 Asian Games|1962]], the Games were hit by several crises. First, the host country Indonesia, refused to permit the participation of Israel and Taiwan due to political and religious issues. As a result, the IOC removed its sponsorship of the Games and terminated Indonesia as one of the IOC members.<ref>{{cite news|title=Track: Asian Games Dropped By Olympics|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q3cjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZMoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=738,3903294&dq=1962+asian+games&hl=en|accessdate=14 August 2010|newspaper=Daytona Beach|date=23 August 1962}}</ref> The [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC),<ref>{{cite web|title=第4届 1962年雅加达亚运会|url=http://data.sports.163.com/match/history/0005000BBQFO.html|publisher=data.sports.163.com|accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] (IAAF) and [[International Weightlifting Federation]] (IWF), also removed their recognition of the Games.<ref>{{cite news|title=Penalty Dealt to Indonesia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kMESAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RvcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4386,3223549&dq=1962+asian+games+iaaf&hl=en|accessdate=14 August 2010|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicles|date=13 September 1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Warning|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=al8RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jJYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1306,4815390&dq=1962+asian+games+weightlifting&hl=en|accessdate=14 August 2010|newspaper=The Age|date=30 August 1962}}</ref>

In [[1970 Asian Games|1970]], South Korea dropped its plan to host the Games allegedly due to national security crisis, however the main reason was due to [[financial crisis]], forcing the previous host Thailand to administer the Games again in [[Bangkok]] using funds transferred from South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|title=第六届 1970年曼谷亚运会|url=http://data.sports.163.com/match/history/0005000BBQFL.html|publisher=Data.sports.163.com|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> Prior to the Games, Japan was asked to host the Games, but declined due to [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Thailand’s Sporting Spirit|url=http://www.pattayamail.com/277/sports.htm#hd4|publisher=Pattaya Mail Sports|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> This edition also marked the first time the Games have a television [[broadcasting]] throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=第六届 1970年曼谷亚运会|url=http://data.sports.163.com/match/history/0005000BBQFL.html|publisher=data.sports.163|accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref> In [[1974 Asian Games|1974]], the Games formally recognized the participation of China, North Korea and Mongolia. Israel was allowed to participate despite the opposition from [[Arab world]], while Taiwan was permitted to continue taking part (as "[[Chinese Taipei]]" despite its status was abolished in general meeting on 16 November 1973 by Games Federation.<ref>{{cite web|title=第七届 1974年德黑兰亚运会|url=http://data.sports.163.com/match/history/0005000BBQFK.html|publisher=data.sports.163.com|accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>

The last is [[1978 Asian Games|1978]], [[Pakistan]] dropped its plan to host the Games in 1975 due to financial crisis and [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|political issues]].<ref>{{cite web|title=第8届 1978年曼谷亚运会|url=http://data.sports.163.com/match/history/0005000BBQFI.html|publisher=Data.sports.163.com|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> Thailand offered to help and the Games were once again held in Bangkok. However, once again, like in 1962, Taiwan and Israel were refused the participation by Games Federation, amid political issues and security fears.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games Federation says no to Israel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v7seAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Sr4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1934,684691&dq=1978+asian+games&hl=en|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=3 June 1978}}</ref> Several governing bodies protested against the ban, like IAAF, threatened to bar the participating players from [[1980 Summer Olympics]],<ref>{{cite news|title=New Israeli rejection forces Asian athletes to risk Olympic hope|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WwMuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XaEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2171,3744052&dq=1978+asian+games&hl=en|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=22 November 1978}}</ref> this caused several teams to withdraw prior to the Games.<ref>{{cite news|title=Indonesia, Hong Kong protest ban on Israel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kP0NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LHwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6027,3304995&dq=1978+asian+games&hl=en|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=4 December 1978}}</ref>

Following this series of crises, the National Olympic Committee in Asia decided to revise the constitution of the Asian Games Federation. A new association, named the Olympic Council of Asia, was created in November 1981 with the exclusion of Israel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Israelis facing Asian ban|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Rr4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jO4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2948,6887134&dq=asian+games+federation&hl=en|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=10 December 1981}}</ref> India was already scheduled to host the [[1982 Asian Games|1982 Games]] and the OCA decided not to drop the old AGF timetable.

In [[1994 Asian Games|1994]], the Games included the former [[republics of the Soviet Union]]: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan for the first time. It was also the first time that the Games had been held outside the [[capital city]] of the host country.<ref>{{cite web|title=第12届 1994年广岛亚运会|url=http://data.sports.163.com/match/history/0005000BBQDY.html|publisher=data.sports.163.com|accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref> However, [[National Olympic Committee of Iraq|Iraq]] was suspended from the Games due to the [[Persian Gulf War]] in 1990, while [[Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korea]] boycotted the Games due to political issues. It was also marred by the death of [[Demographics of Nepal|Nepalese]] delegation Nareshkumar Adhikari during the Games' opening ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|title=Let the Games Begin|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QpsWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UxMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1694,953978&dq=1994+asian+games+kazakhstan&hl=en|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=3 October 1994}}</ref>

All four games were opened by [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|H.M.King Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. The date of the closing ceremony remained as 20 December for all 4 games hosted by Thailand.

==Participation==
{{See also|Olympic Council of Asia}}
[[File:Asian Games Doha 2006 fireworks.jpg|thumb|[[2006 Asian Games]]]]
All 45 members affiliated to the [[Olympic Council of Asia|Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)]] are eligible to take part in the Games.

According to membership in the OCA, [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] Kazakhstan participates in the Asian Games but Egypt does not, participating in the [[All-Africa Games]] instead. Various countries participating in the [[European Games]] rather than the Asian Games are partially or fully in Asia: Turkey, Russia (major parts in Asia); Azerbaijan, Georgia (almost completely in Asia); Cyprus, Armenia, Israel (fully in Asia).

In history, 46 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) have sent competitors to the Games. [[Olympic Committee of Israel|Israel]] has been excluded from the Games since 1976, the reason cited as being due to security reasons.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games ban Israel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lR8MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dl0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2486,2066961&dq=israel+asian+games&hl=en|accessdate=29 July 2007|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=26 July 1976}}</ref> Israel requested to participate in the 1982 Games, but the request was rejected by the organizers due to the [[Munich massacre]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Israel not invited to Asian Games |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJAsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PvsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5458,3706701&dq=israel+asian+games&hl=en |accessdate=29 July 2007 |newspaper=Lakeland Ledger |date=26 May 1982 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130930073524/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJAsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PvsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5458,3706701&dq=israel+asian+games&hl=en |archivedate=30 September 2013 }}</ref> Israel is now a member of the [[European Olympic Committees]] (EOC).

Taiwan, Palestine, Hong Kong, and Macau participate in the Asian Games according to membership in OCA. Due to its continuing ambiguous political status, Taiwan participates in the Games under the flag of [[Chinese Taipei]] since 1990. [[Macau Sports and Olympic Committee|Macau NOC]] is allowed to compete as one of the NOCs in Asian Games, despite not being recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for participation in the [[Olympic Games]].

In 2007, the President of OCA, Sheikh [[Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah]], rejected proposal to allow  [[Australian Olympic Committee|Australia]] to participate in the Games. He stated that while Australia would add good value to the Asian Games, it would be unfair to the [[Oceania National Olympic Committees|Oceania National Olympic Committees (ONOC)]].<ref>{{cite news|title=No place for Australia in Asian Games|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/no-place-for-australia-in-asian-games/2007/04/17/1176696841249.html|accessdate=2010-07-29|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2007-04-17}}</ref> Being members of ONOC, Australia and New Zealand participates in [[Pacific Games]] since 2015.
