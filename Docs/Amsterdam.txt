Amsterdam's name derives from ''Amstelredamme'',<ref name="Britannica Eleven">[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], Vol 1, pp. 896–898.</ref> indicative of the city's origin as a dam of the river [[Amstel]]. Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] (17th century), a result of its innovative developments in trade. During that time, the city was the leading center for finance and diamonds.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521845359&ss=exc Cambridge.org], Capitals of Capital -A History of International Financial Centres – 1780–2005, Youssef Cassis, ISBN 978-0-521-84535-9</ref> In the 19th and 20th centuries the city expanded, and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century [[canals of Amsterdam]] and the 19–20th century [[Stelling van Amsterdam|Defence Line of Amsterdam]] are on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].

As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an [[Global city|alpha world city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) study group]]. The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands.<ref>After Athens in 1888 and Florence in 1986, Amsterdam was in 1986 chosen as the [[European Capital of Culture]], confirming its eminent position in Europe and the Netherlands.

==History==
{{Main|History of Amsterdam|Timeline of Amsterdam}}

===Etymology===
[[File:Okerk2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Oude Kerk, Amsterdam|Oude Kerk]] was consecrated in 1306.]]
After the floods of 1170 and 1173 locals of the river Amstel vicinity built a bridge over- and a dam across the river, hence giving its name to the village: "Aemstelredamme". The earliest recorded use of the name "Aemstelredamme" (Amsterdam) comes from a document dated 27 October 1275. Inhabitants of the village, by this document, were exempted from paying a [[toll bridge|bridge toll]] in the County of Holland by Count [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]].{{sfn|Berns|Daan|1993|p=91}}{{sfn|Mak|1994|p=19}} This meant it had been allowed for the inhabitants of the village of Aemstelredamme to travel freely through the County of Holland without having to pay toll at bridges, locks and dams all throughout the county. The certificate describes the inhabitants as ''homines manentes apud Amestelledamme'' (people living near ''Amestelledamme'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/trade/toll_privilege/index.en.html |title=The toll privilege of 1275 in the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106010052/http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/trade/toll_privilege/index.en.html |archivedate=6 January 2016 }}</ref> By 1327, the name had developed into ''Aemsterdam''.{{sfn|Berns|Daan|1993|p=91}}{{sfn|Mak|1994|pp=18–20}}

[[File:Cornelis anthonisz vogelvluchtkaart amsterdam.JPG|thumb|right|upright|180px|A woodcut depicting Amsterdam as of 1544. The famous [[Canals of Amsterdam|Grachtengordel]] had not yet been established.]]

===Founding and Middle Ages===
[[File:Emanuel de Witte - De binnenplaats van de beurs te Amsterdam.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Courtyard of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] by [[Emanuel de Witte]], 1653. The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] was the first [[stock exchange]] to introduce continuous trade in the early 17th century.]]
Amsterdam's founding is relatively recent compared with much older Dutch cities such as [[Nijmegen]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Utrecht]]. In October 2008, [[historical geography|historical geographer]] Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then since [[land reclamation|reclamation of land]] may not have been for farming—it may have been for [[peat]], used as fuel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/%27Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen%27.html|title=Amsterdam 200 jaar ouder dan aangenomen|accessdate=22 October 2008|date=22 October 2008|publisher=Nu.nl|language=Dutch| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081025045803/http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/'Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen'.html| archivedate= 25 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Amsterdam was granted [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] in either 1300 or 1306.<ref name="amnlgeschedenis">{{cite web

In 1345, an alleged [[Blessed Sacrament|Eucharistic miracle]] in the [[Kalverstraat]] rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the [[Protestant Reformation|adoption of the Protestant faith]]. The ''[[Stille Omgang]]''—a silent [[procession]] in civil attire—is today a remnant of the rich pilgrimage history.<ref name="stilleomgang">{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/laatstenieuws/laatstenieuws/article936256.ece/Katholieken_verzameld_voor_Mirakel_van_Amsterdam |title=Mirakel van Amsterdam |language=Dutch |accessdate=21 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808045508/http://www.trouw.nl:80/laatstenieuws/laatstenieuws/article936256.ece/Katholieken_verzameld_voor_Mirakel_van_Amsterdam |archivedate=8 August 2009 }}</ref>

===Conflict with Spain===
In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against [[Philip II of Spain]] and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the [[religious persecution]] of Protestants by the newly introduced [[Inquisition of the Netherlands|Inquisition]]. The revolt escalated into the [[Eighty Years' War]], which ultimately led to Dutch independence.<ref name="80yearswar">{{cite web

The influx of Flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European [[freedom of the press|free press]].<ref>Case in point: After [[Galileo affair|his trial and sentencing]] in Rome in 1633, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] chose [[Lodewijk Elzevir]] in Amsterdam to publish one of his finest works, ''[[Two New Sciences]]''. See Wade Rowland (2003), ''Galileo's Mistake, A new look at the epic confrontation between Galileo and the Church'', New York: [[Arcade Publishing]], ISBN 1-55970-684-8, p. 260.</ref>

===Centre of the Dutch Golden Age===
[[File:Amsterdam-Bowyer-1814.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]], [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], and now demolished weigh house on [[Dam Square]] in 1814.]]
The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's ''[[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]]'', during which it became the wealthiest city in the world.<ref>E. Haverkamp-Bergmann, Rembrandt; The Night Watch (New Jersey: [[Princeton University Press]], 1982), p. 57</ref> Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the [[Baltic Sea]], North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]]. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]]. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading [[Financial centre]] of the world.<ref>[http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/Amsterdam_l.html Amsterdam in the 17th century], The University of [[North Carolina]] at Pembroke</ref> In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first [[stock exchange]] by trading in its own shares.<ref name="The oldest share">{{cite web

===Decline and modernisation===
Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|wars]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] with [[Kingdom of England|England]] and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. However, the later establishment of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 marked a turning point.

[[File:Old-Amsterdam 1891-street-1.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Vijzelstraat looking towards [[Muntplein, Amsterdam|Muntplein]] in 1891]]

The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age.<ref name="Amsterdam City Walks">{{cite web

The [[Amsterdam–Rhine Canal]] was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the [[Rhine]], and the [[North Sea Canal]] was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the [[North Sea]]. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, [[Joseph Conrad]] gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in ''[[q:Joseph Conrad#The Mirror of the Sea (1906)|The Mirror of the Sea]]''.

===Twentieth century===
Shortly before the First World War, the city began expanding, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the ''Aardappeloproer'' (Potato rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.<ref name="aardappeloproer">{{cite web|url=http://www.collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004516/arma39%20het%20aardappeloproer%20in%201917.pdf|title=Aardappeloproer – Legermuseum|format=PDF|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 May 2008| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080528004443/http://www.collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004516/arma39%20het%20aardappeloproer%20in%201917.pdf| archivedate= 28 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref>

After landflood in 1916 the depleted municipalities, Durgerdam, Holysloot, Zunderdorp and [[Schellingwoude]], all lying north of Amsterdam, were, on their own request, annexed to the city on 1 January 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl|title=Amsterdam city archives|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref><ref>http://www.centraledorpenraad.nl/landelijk-noord/historie | website centrale dorpen raad (villages central council)</ref>

[[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to the high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 [[Dutch Jews]] were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]] of which some 60,000 lived in Amsterdam. Perhaps the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl [[Anne Frank]], who died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].<ref name="deportation">{{cite web

Many new suburbs, such as [[Osdorp]], [[Slotervaart (neighborhood)|Slotervaart]], ''Slotermeer'', and ''Geuzenveld'', were built in the years after the Second World War.<ref name="svgeschedenis">{{cite web

These suburbs contained many public parks and wide, open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other incidents of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings and new roads as the automobile became available to most common people.<ref name="stadsherstel">{{cite web

Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect the [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station|Central Station]] and city centre with other parts of the city.

The incorporated large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's formerly Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the ''Jodenbreestraat'', were widened and saw almost all of their houses demolished. During the destruction's peak, the ''Nieuwmarktrellen'' ([[Nieuwmarkt Riots]]) broke out,<ref name="metrostad">{{cite web

As a result, the demolition was stopped, and the highway was never built, with only the metro being finished. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished ''Waterlooplein''. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as ''Stadsherstel Amsterdam'', were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing.<ref name="stadsherstel"/> The entire city centre has reattained its former splendor and, as a whole, is now a [[protected area]]. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the ''Grachtengordel'' ([[Herengracht]], [[Keizersgracht]], and [[Prinsengracht]]) was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].<ref name="unesco">{{cite web|url=https://www.amsterdam.nl/kunstencultuur/monumenten/indexen/nieuws_bma/?ActItmIdt=122633 |title=Monumenten en Archeologie |language=Dutch|accessdate=5 August 2015 |publisher=Gemeente Amsterdam}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref>

===Twenty-first century===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
At the beginning of the new millennium, social problems such as safety, ethnic discrimination and segregation between religious and social groups began to develop. Forty-five percent of the population of Amsterdam has non-Dutch parents. Large social groups come from Suriname, the Dutch Antilles, Morocco and Turkey. Amsterdam is characterised by its (perceived) social tolerance and diversity. The former mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, and his alderman for integration Ahmed Aboutaleb (now mayor of Rotterdam) formulated a policy of "keeping things together" which involves social dialogue, tolerance and harsh measures against those who break the law.

==Geography==
[[File:Amsterdam-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Amsterdam, Sept. 2014]]
Amsterdam is located in the western Netherlands, in the province of [[North Holland]]. The river [[Amstel]] terminates in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]]. Amsterdam is situated {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level|below sea level]].<ref name="elevation">{{cite web

Amsterdam is intensely urbanised, as is the [[Amsterdam Metropolitan Area]] surrounding the city. Comprising {{convert|219.4|km2|1|abbr=off}} of land, the [[city limits|city proper]] has 4,457 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> and 2,275 houses per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="density">

[[File:Amsterdam, the Netherlands - Rapenburgwal.jpg|thumb|One of Amsterdam's many canals]]
[[File:Frozen Prinsengracht.jpg|thumb|Ice skaters on [[Prinsengracht]]]]

===Canals===
Amsterdam is home to more than {{convert|100|km|mi|spell=in|-1|abbr=off}} of [[Canals of Amsterdam|canals]], most of which are navigable by boat. The three main canals are [[Prinsengracht]], [[Herengracht]] and [[Keizersgracht]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the [[Singel]], which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and makes the city centre a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a [[Port of Amsterdam|seaport]]. It has been compared with [[Venice]], due to its division into approximately 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges.<ref>[http://geography.howstuffworks.com/europe/geography-of-amsterdam.htm How Stuff Works, Geography of Amsterdam]</ref>

===Climate===
Amsterdam has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. Both winters and summers are considered mild, although occasionally quite cool. Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant [[Urban heat island|heat-island effect]], nights rarely fall below {{convert|-5|°C|0}}, while it could easily be {{convert|−12|°C|0}} in Hilversum, {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast. Summers are moderately warm but rarely hot. The average daily high in August is {{convert|22.1|°C|1}}, and {{convert|30|°C}} or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. The record extremes range from {{convert|-24|°C}} to {{convert|36.8|°C}}.<ref name="Extreme temps">{{cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm |title=Extreme temperatures around the world |publisher=Herrera, Maximiliano |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>
Days with more than {{convert|1|mm|2}} of [[precipitation]] are common, on average 133 days per year. Amsterdam's average annual precipitation is {{convert|838|mm|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.klimaatatlas.nl/tabel/stationsdata/klimtab_8110_240.pdf |title= Stationsdata station Schiphol 1981–2010 |accessdate= 10 September 2013 |publisher= Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute}}</ref> more than what is measured at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. A large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers. Cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of October through March.

Compared to other important towns in the [[County of Holland]], such as [[Dordrecht]], [[Leiden]], [[Haarlem]], [[Delft]] and [[Alkmaar]], Amsterdam is a relatively young city. In stark contrast to the relative decline of those other Hollandic towns, Amsterdam's population grew in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which was mainly due to rise of the profitable [[Baltic maritime trade (c. 1400–1800)|Baltic maritime trade]] after the Burgundian victory in the [[Dutch–Hanseatic War]]. Still, the population of Amsterdam and other towns in Holland was only modest compared to the towns and cities of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], which comprised the most urbanized area of the Low Countries.

This changed when, during the [[Dutch Revolt]], many people from the Southern Netherlands fled to the North, especially after [[Fall of Antwerp|Antwerp fell to Spanish forces]] in 1585. In thirty years, Amsterdam's population more than doubled from a mere 41,362 inhabitants in 1590 to 106,500 inhabitants in 1620. During the 1660s, Amsterdam's populations reached 200,000. The city's growth levelled off and the population stabilized around 240,000 for most of the 18th century.

At the turn of the 18th century, Amsterdam was the [[List of largest European cities in history|fourth largest city in Europe]], behind [[Constantinople]] (about 700,000), London (550,000) and Paris (530,000). This was all the more remarkable as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the [[Dutch Republic]], which itself was a much smaller state than England, France or the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In contrast to these other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as [[Leiden]] (about 67,000), [[Rotterdam]] (45,000), [[Haarlem]] (38,000), and [[Utrecht]] (30,000).{{sfn|Frijhoff|Prak|2005|p=9}}

The city's population declined in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, dipping under 200,000 in 1820. By the second half of the 19th century, industrialization spurred renewed growth. Amsterdam's population hit an all-time high of 872,000 in 1959, before declining in the following decades due to government-sponsored suburbanization to so-called ''groeikernen'' such as [[Purmerend]] and [[Almere]]. Between 1970 and 1980, Amsterdam experienced its sharpest population decline ever, and by 1985 the city had only 675,570 residents. This was soon followed by [[reurbanization]] and [[gentrification]], however, leading to renewed population growth in the 2010s. The municipal department for Research, Information and Statistics expects a new record population to be set in 2020.<ref name="OISexplosievegroei">{{cite web |url=http://www.ois.amsterdam.nl/nieuwsarchief/2015/explosieve-groei-houdt-aan-871000-amsterdammers-in-2020 |title=Explosieve groei houdt aan: 871.000 Amsterdammers in 2020 |date=25 February 2015 |website=ois.amsterdam.nl |access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref>

In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly [[Huguenot]]s, [[Flemish people|Flemings]], [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Westphalia]]ns. Huguenots came after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was [[History of the Jews in Amsterdam|Jewish]]. Just twenty percent of them survived the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area. Other immigrants, including refugees [[Right of asylum|asylum seekers]] and [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], came from Europe, [[Americas|America]], Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like [[Almere]] and [[Purmerend]], prompted by the third [[Land-use planning|planological]] bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so-called "groeikernen", literally ''cores of growth''. Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the [[Jordaan]] abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the [[Public housing|social housing]] projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of the city'

===Religious history===
In 1578 the previously Roman Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule, late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities. In line with Protestant procedure of that time, all churches were converted to Protestant worship. [[Calvinism]] became the dominant religion, and although Catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve, the [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|Catholic hierarchy]] was prohibited. This led to the establishment of ''schuilkerken'', covert churches, behind seemingly ordinary canal side house fronts. One example is the current debate centre [[de Rode Hoed]].
A large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardic Jews]] from Spain and Portugal, [[Huguenot]]s from France, and Protestants from the [[Southern Netherlands]]. This led to the establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking religious churches. In 1603, the first notification was made of Jewish religious service. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. The Jews came to call the town [[Jerusalem of the West]], a reference to their sense of belonging there.

[[File:The Church of St Nicholas.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Basilica of St. Nicholas, Amsterdam|Basilica of St. Nicholas]]]]
As they became established in the city, other [[Christian denomination]]s used converted Catholic chapels to conduct their own services. The oldest English-language church congregation in the world outside the United Kingdom is found at the [[Begijnhof, Amsterdam|Begijnhof]]. Regular services there are still offered in English under the auspices of the Church of Scotland.<ref name="englishchurch">{{cite web

}}</ref> The Huguenots accounted for nearly 20% of Amsterdam's inhabitants in 1700. Being Calvinists, they soon integrated into the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred by the moniker 'Walloon', are recognisable today as they offer occasional services in French.

In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], Jews from [[Central Europe|Central and Eastern Europe]], which continued into the 19th century. Jews often fled the [[pogrom]]s in those areas. The first Ashkenazi who arrived in Amsterdam were [[refugee]]s from the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmielnicki Uprising]] in Poland and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. They not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the 'Amsterdam dialect' adding a large [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] local vocabulary.

Despite an absence of an official Jewish [[ghetto]], most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city. The main street of this Jewish neighbourhood was the ''Jodenbreestraat''. The neighbourhood comprised the ''Waterlooplein'' and the [[Nieuwmarkt]].<ref name="Jodenbuurt Amsterdam">{{cite web

This led to riots, and as a result the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned and the neighbourhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout.

[[File:Vondelpark, Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vondelpark]] is the largest park in Amsterdam.]]
Catholic churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853. One of the principal architects behind the city's Catholic churches, [[Pierre Cuypers|Cuypers]], was also responsible for the Amsterdam Central Station and the [[Rijksmuseum]], which led to a refusal of Protestant King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] to open 'that monastery'.
In 1924, [[Catholic Church|the Roman Catholic Church]] of the Netherlands hosted the [[Eucharistic Congress|International Eucharistic Congress]] in Amsterdam, and numerous Catholic [[prelate]]s visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums. Catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time. Only in the 20th century was Amsterdam's relation to Catholicism normalised, but despite its far larger [[population size]], the [[Holy orders|Catholic clergy]] chose to place its episcopal see of the city in the nearby provincial town of [[Haarlem]].<ref name="Diocese of Haarlem">{{cite web

In recent times, religious demographics in Amsterdam have been changed by large-scale immigration from former colonies. Immigrants from Suriname have introduced [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Protestantism and [[Lutheranism]], from the Hernhutter variety; [[Hinduism]] has been introduced mainly from Suriname; and several distinct branches of Islam have been brought from various parts of the world. Islam is now the largest non-Christian religion in Amsterdam. The large community of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants have established African churches, often in parking garages in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area, where many have settled. In addition, a broad array of other religious movements have established congregations, including [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Hinduism]]. [[Jews]] make up about 2% of the city's total population.

===Tolerance and ethnic tension===
Although the saying "Leef en laat leven" or "Live and let live" summarises the Dutch and especially the Amsterdam open and tolerant society, the increased influx of religions and cultures after the Second World War, has on a number of occasions strained [[social relation]]s. With 180 different nationalities,<ref>[http://www.ois.amsterdam.nl/nieuwsarchief/2014/amsterdam-groeit-door Onderzoek, Informatie en Statistiek], Gemeente Amsterdam</ref> Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world.<ref>Quest, issue of March 2009</ref> The proportion of the population of immigrant origin in the city proper is about 50%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/7003/ |title=Amsterdam in cijfers 2010 |publisher=Os.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318161044/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/7003/ |archivedate=18 March 2012 }}</ref> and 88% of the population are Dutch citizens.<ref>[http://www.amsterdam.nl/gemeente/organisatie-diensten/dbi/nieuws/2010/juni/inwoneraantal/]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref>

The city has been at times marked by ethnic tension. In 2004 film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] was murdered by [[Mohammed Bouyeri]] in Amsterdam. Among others, in line with attitude changes {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} in Dutch politics towards certain (especially Islamic) minorities Turkish-language and Arabic-language TV channels have been dropped from the basic cable TV package{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. In recent years, politicians are actively discouraged against campaigning in minority languages. In the previous local elections politicians were criticised by current Amsterdam mayor Mr van der Laan (then minister of Integration) for distributing election leaflets in minority languages and in some cases leaflets were collected. Due to this alleged anti-Multicultural stand, van der Laan has been accused of hypocrisy by his own party's [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] main candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Nederland/258644/PvdAlijsttrekker-Van-der-Laan-ongekend-hypocriet.htm |title=Nederland – PvdA-lijsttrekker: Van der Laan ongekend hypocriet |publisher=Elsevier.nl |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> Also during the same period, possibly due to his belief in integration via (possibly not always voluntary) assimilation, Amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the Netherlands which provided immigrants with extensive and free [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] courses, which have benefited many immigrants.<ref>[http://intt.uva.nl/dutch-for-foreigners/dutch-for-foreigners.html Dutch for foreigners – INTT – University of Amsterdam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Amsterdam fans out south from the [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station]]. The oldest area of the town is known as ''[[de Wallen]]'' (the quays). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. To the south of de Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein. The medieval and colonial age [[canals of Amsterdam]], known as ''Grachten'', embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of [[Jordaan]] and de Pijp. The [[Museumplein]] with the city's major museums, the [[Vondelpark]], a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer [[Joost van den Vondel]], and the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]] neighbourhood, with the [[Natura Artis Magistra|zoo]], are also located outside the Grachtengordel.

Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are [[polder]]s. This can be recognised by the suffix ''-meer'' which means ''lake'', as in [[Aalsmeer]], [[Bijlmermeer]], [[Haarlemmermeer]], and [[Watergraafsmeer]].

Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic [[Windscreen wiper|windshield wiper]] as the historian [[Geert Mak]] calls it – and ''not'' from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mak|first=G.|title=Een kleine geschiedenis van Amsterdam|publisher=Uitgeverij Atlas|year=1995|location=Amsterdam/Antwerp|isbn=90-450-1232-4}}</ref>

===Expansion===
{{Main|Expansion of Amsterdam since the 19th century}}

After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, [[Samuel Sarphati]] devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the ''grachtengordel''. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the ''Paleis voor Volksvlijt''.<ref name="joodsmuseum">{{cite web

Following Sarphati, ''Van Niftrik'' and ''Kalff'' designed an entire ring of 19th-century neighbourhoods surrounding the city's centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th-century limit, thus firmly controlling development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/maps/plan_van_niftrik/index.en.html |title=Van Niftrik's plan at the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143743/http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/maps/plan_van_niftrik/index.en.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}</ref> Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.<ref name="oudzuid">{{cite web

In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: ''Plan Zuid'', designed by the architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]], and ''West''. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of ''housing blocks'' for all social classes.<ref name="archiefberlage">{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/planning/uitbreidingsplan_berlage/index.en.html |title=Berlage's Expansion Plan |publisher=Stadsarchief Amsterdam |accessdate=5 June 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name="bmzberlage">{{cite web

After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by [[Car|motor car]]. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the ''Westelijke Tuinsteden''. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the ''Bijlmer''.<ref name="bijlmer">{{cite web

A famous building in [[baroque|baroque style]] in Amsterdam is the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] on [[Dam Square]]. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by [[Culture of France|French culture]]. This is reflected in the architecture of that period.

The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century.
Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city's centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early
20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre.
Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.

===Parks and recreational areas===

[[File:Horses in Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Old-fashioned carriage with horses in Amsterdam.]]

Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. [[Vondelpark]], the largest park in the city, is located in the [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid|Oud-Zuid]] borough and is named after the 17th century Amsterdam author, [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open-air theatre, a playground and several [[horeca]] facilities.

[[File:RedLightDistrictAmsterdamTheNetherlands.jpg|thumb|left|The [[red-light district]] is a main tourist attraction.]]

====Red light district====
{{Main|De Wallen}}
'''De Wallen''', also known as '''Walletjes''' or '''Rosse Buurt''', is a designated area for [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|legalised prostitution]] and is Amsterdam's largest and most well known [[red-light district]]. This neighborhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of roads and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by [[sex worker]]s who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights.

===Retail===
Shops in Amsterdam range from large high end department stores such as [[De Bijenkorf]] founded in 1870 and [[Maison de Bonneterie]] a Parisian style store founded in 1889, to small specialty shops. Amsterdam's high-end shops are found in the streets [[P.C. Hooftstraat]] and ''Cornelis Schuytstraat'', which are located in the vicinity of the [[Vondelpark]]. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval [[Kalverstraat]] in the heart of the city. Other shopping areas include the ''Negen Straatjes'' and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat. ''Negen Straatjes'' are nine narrow streets within the ''Grachtengordel'', the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the ''Negen Straatjes'' a large diversity of privately owned shops. But as the ''Negen Straatjes'' are dominated by fashion stores the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a very wide variety of all kinds of stores, just to name some specialties: candy and other food related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli's, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.

The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the [[Albert Cuyp Market]], Westerstraat-markt, Ten Katemarkt, and [[Dappermarkt]]. Some of these markets are held on a daily basis, like the Albert Cuypmarkt and the Dappermarkt. Others, like the Westerstraatmarkt, are held on a weekly basis.

===Fashion===
Fashion brands like [[G-Star Raw|G-star]], Gsus, BlueBlood, PICHICHI, Iris van Herpen, [[10 feet]] and [[Warmenhoven & Venderbos]], and fashion designers like [[Mart Visser]], [[Viktor & Rolf]], Sheila de Vries, [[Marlies Dekkers]] and [[Frans Molenaar]] are based in Amsterdam. [[Modeling agency|Modelling agencies]] [[Elite Model Management|Elite Models]], Touche models and Tony Jones have opened branches in Amsterdam. Fashion models like [[Yfke Sturm]], [[Doutzen Kroes]] and [[Kim Noorda]] started their careers in Amsterdam. Amsterdam has its garment centre in the World Fashion Center. Buildings which formerly housed brothels in the red light district have been converted to ateliers for young fashion designers, AKA eagle fuel. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Fashion photographers [[Inez and Vinoodh|Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin]] were born in Amsterdam(Netherland).

During the later part of the 16th-century Amsterdam's Rederijkerskamer ([[Chamber of rhetoric]]) organised contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1638, Amsterdam opened its first theatre. Ballet performances were given in this theatre as early as 1642. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was under the influence of German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l_b2vIXHsUkC&pg=PA541&dq=Amsterdam+opera&cd=3#v=onepage&q=Amsterdam%20opera |title=A short history of opera|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|last=Grout|first=Donald Jay|page=541|accessdate=11 January 2010|author2=Hermine Weigel Williams |isbn=978-0-231-11958-0}}</ref> In the 19th century, popular culture was centred on the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly [[vaudeville]] and [[music hall|music-hall]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The [[metronome]], one of the most important advances in European classical music, was invented here in 1812 by [[Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel]].

===Museums===
The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the [[Museumplein]] (Museum Square), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|World's fair]]. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the very large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter.<ref name="ijsbaan">{{cite web

The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]] can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodeled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.<ref name="museumpleinfacelift">{{cite web|url=http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |title=Museumplein krijgt facelift |publisher=Gemeente Amsterdam |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807174714/http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl:80/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |archivedate=7 August 2009 }}</ref>

Next to the Van Gogh museum stands the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]]. This is Amsterdam's most important museum of modern art. The museum is as old as the square it borders and was opened in 1895. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]], [[Karel Appel]], and [[Kazimir Malevich]]. After renovations lasting several years the museum opened in September 2012 with a new composite extension that has been called 'The Bathtub' due to its resemblance to one.

Amsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the [[Verzetsmuseum]] (Resistance Museum), the [[Anne Frank House]], and the [[Rembrandt House Museum]], to the very large, like the [[Tropenmuseum]] (Museum of the Tropics), [[Amsterdam Museum]] (formerly known as Amsterdam Historical Museum), [[Hermitage Amsterdam]] (a dependency of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Saint Petersburg) and the [[Joods Historisch Museum]] (Jewish Historical Museum). The modern-styled [[NEMO (museum)|Nemo]] is dedicated to child-friendly science exhibitions.

===Music===
{{main|List of songs about Amsterdam}}
Amsterdam's musical culture includes a large collection of songs which treat the city nostalgically and lovingly. The 1949 song "Aan de Amsterdamse grachten" ("On the canals of Amsterdam") was performed and recorded by many artists, including [[John Kraaijkamp sr.]]; the best-known version is probably that by [[Wim Sonneveld]] (1962). In the 1950s [[Johnny Jordaan]] rose to fame with "Geef mij maar Amsterdam" ("I prefer Amsterdam"), which praises the city above all others (explicitly Paris); Jordaan sang especially about his own neighbourhood, the [[Jordaan]] ("Bij ons in de Jordaan"). Colleagues and contemporaries of Johnny include [[Tante Leen]], [[Zwarte Riek]], and [[Manke Nelis]]. Other notable Amsterdam songs are "[[Amsterdam (Jacques Brel song)|Amsterdam]]" by [[Jacques Brel]] (1964) and "Deze Stad" by [[De Dijk]] (1989).<ref name="lijflied finale">{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/7024/AMSTERDAMS-LIJFLIED/article/detail/2948441/2011/10/05/Amsterdams-lijflied-de-finale.dhtml|title=Amsterdams lijflied: de finale|date=5 October 2011|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> A 2011 poll by Amsterdam paper ''[[Het Parool]]'' found, somewhat surprisingly, that [[Trio Bier]]'s "Oude Wolf" was voted "Amsterdams lijflied".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/7024/AMSTERDAMS-LIJFLIED/article/detail/2965125/2011/10/12/Amsterdams-Lijflied-Stadsbewoners-leven-als-oude-wolven.dhtml|title=Amsterdams Lijflied: Stadsbewoners leven als oude wolven – AMSTERDAMS LIJFLIED – PAROOL|date=12 October 2011|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> Notable Amsterdam bands from the modern era include the [[Osdorp Posse]] and [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]].

The [[Heineken Music Hall]] is a concert hall located near the [[Amsterdam Arena]]. Its main purpose is to serve as a podium for pop concerts for big audiences. Many famous international artists have performed there. Two other notable venues, [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and the [[Melkweg]] are located near the [[Leidseplein]]. Both focus on broad programming, ranging from [[indie rock]] to [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and other popular genres. Other more subcultural music venues are [[OCCII]], [[OT301]], De Nieuwe Anita, Winston Kingdom and [[Zaal 100]]. [[Jazz]] has a strong following in Amsterdam, with the [[Bimhuis]] being the premier venue. In 2012, [[Ziggo Dome]] was opened, also near Amsterdam ArenA, a state of the art indoor music arena.

The [[Heineken Music Hall]] is also host to many [[electronic dance music]] festivals, alongside many other venues. [[Armin van Buuren]] and [[Tiesto]], some of the world's leading [[Trance music|Trance]] DJ's hail from the Netherlands and perform frequently in Amsterdam. Each year in October, the city hosts the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) which is one of the leading electronic music conferences and one of the biggest club festivals for electronic music in the world. Another popular dance festival is 5daysoff, which takes place in the venues [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and [[Melkweg]]. In summer time there are several big outdoor dance parties in or nearby Amsterdam, such as Awakenings, [[Dance Valley]], [[Mysteryland|Mystery Land]], Loveland, A Day at the Park, Welcome to the Future, and Valtifest.

[[File:Amsterdam Concertgebouw.jpg|thumb|The [[Concertgebouw]] or Royal Concert Hall houses performances of the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] and other musical events]]
Amsterdam has a world-class symphony orchestra, the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]. Their home is the [[Concertgebouw]], which is across the Van Baerlestraat from the Museum Square. It is considered by critics to be a [[List of concert halls|concert hall]] with some of the best [[acoustics]] in the world. The building contains three halls, Grote Zaal, Kleine Zaal, and Spiegelzaal. Some nine hundred concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts & Figures |url=http://www.concertgebouw.nl/facts-figures|publisher=Concertgebouw NV|accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> The opera house of Amsterdam is situated adjacent to the city hall. Therefore, the two buildings combined are often called the [[Stopera]], (a word originally coined by protesters against it very construction: ''Stop the Opera[-house]''). This huge modern complex, opened in 1986, lies in the former Jewish neighbourhood at ''Waterlooplein'' next to the river [[Amstel]]. The ''Stopera'' is the homebase of [[Dutch National Opera]], [[Dutch National Ballet]] and the [[Holland Symfonia]]. [[Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ]] is a concert hall, which is situated in the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] near the central station. Its concerts perform mostly [[20th-century classical music|modern classical music]]. Located adjacent to it, is the ''[[Bimhuis]]'', a concert hall for improvised and [[Jazz]] music.

===Performing arts===
Amsterdam has three main theatre buildings.

The [[Stadsschouwburg (Amsterdam)|Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam]] at the [[Leidseplein]] is the home base of [[Toneelgroep Amsterdam]]. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal program of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. The Stadsschouwburg is currently being renovated and expanded. The third theater space, to be operated jointly with next door [[Melkweg]], will open in late 2009 or early 2010.

[[Stopera|Dutch National Opera and Ballet]] (formerly known as ''Het Muziektheater''), dating from 1986, is the principal opera house and home to [[Dutch National Opera]] and [[Dutch National Ballet]].

[[Carré Theatre|Royal Theatre Carré]] was built as a permanent circus theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for musicals, [[cabaret]] performances and pop concerts.

The recently re-opened DeLaMar Theater houses the more commercial plays and musicals.

Also a new theater has moved into Amsterdam scene in 2014, joining other established venues. [[Theater Amsterdam]], situated in the west part of Amsterdam, Danzigerkade 5 / Westpoortnummer 2036 1013 AP Amsterdam. 
It's a modern building with a panoramic view over the harbour. The theater is the first ever purpose-built venue to showcase a single play entitled ANNE, the play based on Anne Frank's life.

The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or ''kleinkunst'', which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like [[Wim Kan]], [[Wim Sonneveld]] and [[Toon Hermans]] were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy). Contemporary popular artists are [[Youp van 't Hek]], [[Freek de Jonge]], [[Herman Finkers]], [[Hans Teeuwen]], [[Theo Maassen]], [[Herman van Veen]], [[Najib Amhali]], [[Raoul Heertje]], [[Jörgen Raymann]], [[Brigitte Kaandorp]] and [[Comedytrain]]. The English spoken comedy scene was established with the founding of [[Boom Chicago]] in 1993. They have their own theatre at Leidseplein.

===Nightlife===
[[File:Amsterdam Magere Brug.jpg|thumb|left|The Magere Brug or "Skinny Bridge" over the [[Amstel River]] at night]]
Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many ''[[bar (establishment)|cafés]]'' (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cozy. The typical ''Bruine Kroeg'' (brown ''café'') breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. Most ''cafés'' have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many [[discothèque]]s. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the [[Leidseplein]] and the [[Rembrandtplein]]. The [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], [[Melkweg]] and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on some nights. Examples of discothèques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape, Air, John Doe and Club Abe. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), TrouwAmsterdam and Studio 80. [[Bimhuis]] located near the Central Station, with its rich programming hosting the best in the field is considered one of the best jazz clubs in the world. The Reguliersdwarsstraat is the main street for the [[LGBT]] community and nightlife.

===Festivals===

==Government==
[[File:Eberhard van der laan 6765 (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eberhard van der Laan]], [[Burgemeester|mayor]] of Amsterdam since 2010]] 
The city of Amsterdam is a [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a directly elected [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]], a [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] and a [[Burgemeester|mayor]]. Since 1981, the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]], called ''stadsdelen'' or 'districts'. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] was reduced to eight: [[Amsterdam-Centrum]] covering the city centre including the [[Canals of Amsterdam|canal belt]], [[Amsterdam-Noord]] consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ lake]], [[Amsterdam-Oost]] in the east, [[Amsterdam-Zuid]] in the south, [[Amsterdam-West]] in the west, [[Amsterdam Nieuw-West]] in the far west, [[Amsterdam Zuidoost]] in the southeast, and [[Westpoort (Amsterdam)|Westpoort]] covering the [[Port of Amsterdam]] area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/living/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-city-districts|title=Amsterdam City Districts|publisher=Iamsterdam.com|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>

===City government===
{{Main|Government of Amsterdam|Boroughs of Amsterdam}}
As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a directly elected [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]], a [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] and a [[Burgemeester|mayor]] (''burgemeester''). The mayor is a member of the municipal executive board, but also has individual responsibilies in maintaining public order. In July 2010, [[Eberhard van der Laan]] ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]) was appointed [[Burgemeester|mayor]] of Amsterdam by the national government for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]]. After the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2014|2014 municipal council elections]], a governing majority of [[Democrats 66|D66]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] and [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] was formed – the first coalition without the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] since [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/06/12/three-party-coalition-amsterdam-pvda/|title=Three-party coalition in Amsterdam|author=Britt Slegers|publisher=NL Times|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref> Next to the [[Burgemeester|mayor]], the [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] consists of eight ''wethouders'' ('alderpersons') appointed by the [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]]: four [[Democrats 66|D66]] alderpersons, two [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] alderpersons and two [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] alderpersons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amsterdam.nl/gemeente/college/|title=College van burgemeester en wethouders|language=Dutch|publisher=City of Amsterdam|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Amsterdamse stadsdelen 2010.png|thumb|250px|The [[boroughs of Amsterdam]].]]Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into eight [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]], called ''stadsdelen'' or 'districts', a system that was implemented gradually in the 1980s to improve local governance. The [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]] are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (''deelraad''), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, [[Westpoort]], covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council. Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished. The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (''bestuurscommissies''). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.

===Metropolitan area===
"Amsterdam" is usually understood to refer to the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of [[Durgerdam]], may not be considered part of Amsterdam.

[[Statistics Netherlands]] uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (''Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam'', not to be confused with ''Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam'', a synonym of ''Groot Amsterdam''), Greater Amsterdam (''Groot Amsterdam'', a [[COROP]] region) and the urban region Amsterdam (''Stadsgewest Amsterdam'').<ref name="cbs2013"/> The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the ''Stadsregio Amsterdam'' ('City Region of Amsterdam'). The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of [[Zaanstad]] and [[Wormerland]]. It excludes [[Graft-De Rijp]].

The smallest of these areas is the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam with a population of 802,938 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> The conurbation had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam.<ref name="cbs2013"/> Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities,<ref name="cbs2013"/> and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of [[Zaanstad]]. The largest area by population, the [[Amsterdam Metropolitan Area]] (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,33 million.<ref name=dosamsterdam>{{cite web|url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/8187/ |title=Dienst onderzoek & statistiek Amsterdam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614030427/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/8187/ |archivedate=14 June 2013 }}</ref> It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerveer, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area [[Randstad]], with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.<ref name="randstad">{{cite web|title=Population |work=Themes |publisher=City of Amsterdam |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/2008_mutatiestatistiek_stand.xls |format=in Dutch |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the ''Stadsregio Amsterdam'' (City Region of Amsterdam) has a formal governmental status. Its responsibities include regional spatial planning and the metropolitan public transport concessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadsregioamsterdam.nl/algemene-onderdelen/english-information/|title=Stadsregio Amsterdam: English Information|publisher=Stadsregio Amsterdam|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>

===National capital===
{{main|Capital of the Netherlands}}
[[File:King Willem-Alexander, Princess Beatrix en Queen Maxima.jpg|thumb|[[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]], [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Princess Beatrix]], and [[Queen Máxima of the Netherlands|Queen Máxima]] greeting Amsterdammers from the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]] during Willem-Alexanders inauguration in 2013]]
Under the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch Constitution]], Amsterdam is the [[capital of the Netherlands]]. Since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions "Amsterdam" and "capital" in chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in "the capital Amsterdam" ("''de hoofdstad Amsterdam''").<ref name="capital-constitution"/> Previous versions of the constitution only mentioned "the city of Amsterdam" ("''de stad Amsterdam''").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Nederlandse_grondwet |title=Previous versions of the constitution |language=nl |publisher=Nl.wikisource.org |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> For a royal investiture, therefore, the [[States General of the Netherlands]] (the Dutch Parliament) meets for a ceremonial joint session in Amsterdam. The ceremony traditionally takes place at the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] on [[Dam Square]], immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]]. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in [[The Hague]], the city which has historically been the seat of the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch government]], the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy]], and the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Dutch supreme court]]. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.

===Symbols===
{{Main|Coat of arms of Amsterdam|Flag of Amsterdam}}
The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three [[Saltire|St Andrew's crosses]], aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's [[patron saint]] was [[Saint Nicholas]]). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours [[Amstelveen]] and [[Ouder-Amstel]]. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the [[flag of Amsterdam]], flown by the city government, but also as [[civil ensign]] for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]]. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the [[King of the Romans|king's]] crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's [[imperial crown]] when he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph II]], a crown that became the Imperial [[Austrian Crown Jewels|Crown of Austria]]. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Last came the city's official motto: ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' ("Heroic, Determined, Merciful"), bestowed on the city in 1947 by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.

All are operated by municipal public transport operator [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf|GVB]], which also runs the city bus network.

Four fare-free [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf|GVB]] ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ lake]] to the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] of [[Amsterdam-Noord]], and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also privately operated water taxis, a water bus, a [[boat sharing]] operation, electric rental boats (Boaty) and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam's waterways.

Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by [[Connexxion]] and [[Egged (company)|EBS]]. International coach services are provided by [[Eurolines]] from [[Amsterdam Amstel railway station]], [[IDBUS]] from [[Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station]], and [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]] from ''Zuiderzeeweg'' in the east of the city.

Amsterdam is one of the most bicycle-friendly large cities in the world and is a centre of [[bicycle culture]] with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and [[Bicycle stand|bike racks]], and several guarded bike storage garages (''fietsenstalling'') which can be used for a nominal fee. In 2013, there were about 1,200,000 bicycles in Amsterdam outnumbering the amount of citizens in the city.<ref>{{cite web|last=Research and Statistics Division |title=Introduction |work=Traffic and Infrastructure |language=Dutch |publisher=City of Amsterdam |url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/feitenencijfers/24106/ |accessdate=4 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316224718/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl:80/feitenencijfers/24106/ |archivedate=16 March 2008 }}</ref> Theft is widespread – in 2011, about 83,000 bicycles were stolen in Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite web

Amsterdam has two universities: the [[University of Amsterdam]] (Universiteit van Amsterdam), and the [[VU University Amsterdam]] (Vrije Universiteit or "VU"). Other institutions for higher education include an [[art school]] – [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]], a [[Hogeschool|university of applied sciences]] – the [[Hogeschool van Amsterdam]], and the [[Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten]]. Amsterdam's [[International Institute of Social History]] is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning [[social history]], and especially the [[labor history (discipline)|history of the labour movement]]. Amsterdam's [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]], founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world,<ref name="Hortus">{{cite web|url=http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp|title=Hortus Botanicus official website|publisher=2009 de Hortus|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> with many old and rare specimens, among them the [[coffee|coffee plant]] that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.<ref name="he">{{cite web

There are over 200 primary schools in Amsterdam.<ref>{{nl icon}} [https://www.amsterdam.nl/onderwijs-jeugd/basisonderwijs/stedelijk/ Stedelijk Toelatingsbeleid], Municipality of Amsterdam, 2015. Retrieved on 20 July 2015.</ref> Some of these primary schools base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various [[Maria Montessori|Montessori]] schools. The biggest Montessori high school in Amsterdam is the [[Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam]]. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.

Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the [[Vossius Gymnasium]], [[Barlaeus Gymnasium]], St. [[Ignatius Gymnasium]], [[Het 4e Gymnasium]] and the [[Cygnus Gymnasium]] where a classical curriculum including [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.

==Media==
Amsterdam is a prominent centre for national and international media. Some locally based newspapers include ''[[Het Parool]]'', a national daily paper; ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', the largest Dutch daily newspaper; the daily newspapers ''[[Trouw]]'', ''[[De Volkskrant]]'' and ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]''; ''[[De Groene Amsterdammer]]'', a weekly newspaper; the free newspapers ''[[Sp!ts]]'', ''[[Metro (Dutch newspaper)|Metro]]'', and ''[[The Holland Times]]'' (printed in English).

Amsterdam is home to the Dutch second-largest commercial TV group [[SBS Broadcasting Group]], consisting of TV-stations [[SBS 6]], [[Net 5]] and [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]]. However, Amsterdam is not considered 'the media city of the Netherlands'. The town of [[Hilversum]], 30&nbsp;km (19&nbsp;mi) south-east of Amsterdam, has been crowned with this unofficial title. Hilversum is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands. [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Netherlands]], heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, is also based there. Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company NOS, as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial TV production companies.

In 2012, the music video of Far East Movement, 'Live My Life', was filmed in various parts of Amsterdam.

Amsterdam is also featured in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s book 'The Fault in Our Stars,' which has also been made into a film, and part of the film takes place in Amsterdam.

==Housing==
The housing market is heavily regulated. In Amsterdam, 55% of existing housing and 30% of new housing is owned by Housing Associations, which are Government sponsored entities.

[[Squatting|Squat]] properties are common throughout Amsterdam, due to property law strongly favouring tenants. A number of these squats have become well known, such as [[OT301]], [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], Vrankrijk (closed down by city government), and the Binnenpret, and several are now businesses, such as health clubs and licensed restaurants.
