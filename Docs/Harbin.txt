==History==

===Early history===

[[File:Wanyan Aguda.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of Wanyan Aguda in Acheng District]]
Human settlement in Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late [[Stone Age]]. [[Wanyan Aguda]], the founder and first emperor of [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] from 1115 to 1123, was born in the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Wanyan]] tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region.<ref>{{cite book|author1=苏金源|script-title=zh:论完颜阿骨打的政治、经济改革|date=February 1982|publisher=《史学集刊》|archivedate=15 October 2014|language=Chinese}}</ref>  In 1115 CE, Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) [[Huining Prefecture]] in today's [[Acheng District]] of Harbin.<ref name="chinakindnesstour.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinakindnesstour.com/cityguide/Harbin/Attractions/cityguide_2532.shtml |title=The Remains of Huining in Shangjing of Jin Dynasty |publisher=China Kindness Tour|date= |accessdate=2014-10-15}}</ref> After Aguda's death, the new emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Jin|Wanyan Sheng]] ordered to build a new city on uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular [[Bianjing]] ([[Kaifeng]]), although the Jin capital was smaller than its [[Northern Song]] prototype.<ref name=tao28>Tao (1976). Pages 28-32.</ref> Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the empire until the capital was moved to Yanjing (now [[Beijing]]) in 1153 by [[Wanyan Liang]] (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty).<ref name=tao44>Tao, p. 44.</ref> Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157.<ref name=tao44/> Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong ([[Emperor Shizong of Jin|Emperor Shizong]]) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173.<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003190 "A-ch'eng"].

After the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire]], Huining Prefecture was abandoned. Building materials of Huining Prefecture's ruin was later exploited by the Manchus in the 1600s to build their new stronghold in [[Acheng District|Alchuka]]. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 1800s, with only over ten villages and about 30,000 people in today's urban districts of the city by the end of the 19th century.<ref name="Historical Evolution">

The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]: substantially reducing the distance from [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] to [[Vladivostok]] and also linking the new port city of Dalny ([[Dalian]]) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur ([[Lüshun]]).

[[File:Harbin 1940 st.nicolas.jpg|thumb|left|St. Nicolas Orthodox, a [[Russian Orthodox]] church in Harbin, circa 1940, demolished during the [[Cultural Revolution]]]]
During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–5), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Northeastern China. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Harbin|Russian Orthodox]], [[Church of the Intercession in Harbin|Ukrainian Orthodox]], [[Harbin Nangang Christian Church|Lutheran/German Protestant]], and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Harbin|Polish Catholic]] Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.<ref name="Historical Evolution"/>

Rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of [[Manzhouli]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jing-tao|first1=Wang|title=Analysis of the Rat Plague of Northeast China and the Sanitary and Antiepidemic Condition of Yanbian in the Early 20th Century|url=http://www.fabiao.net/content-41-56742-1.html|accessdate=15 October 2014|language=Chinese}}</ref> The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to the spring of 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time.<ref name=JSTOR>{{cite journal|last1=Gamsa|first1=M.|title=The Epidemic of Pneumonic Plague in Manchuria 1910-1911|journal=Past & Present|date=1 February 2006|volume=190|pages=147–183|doi=10.1093/pastj/gtj001}}</ref> This turned out to be the beginning of the large pneumonic plague pandemic of Manchuria and Mongolia which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. [[Wu Lien-teh]] (later the founder of [[Harbin Medical University]]) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in [[Harbin Medical University]] to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine and medical education.<ref>{{cite web|last=Article in Chinese|title=130th memorial of Dr. Wu Lien-teh|url=http://website.hrbmu.edu.cn/view/xywh/article/000543.html|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref>

After the plague epidemic Harbin's population continued to increased sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] census showed its ethnic composition as: [[Russians]]&nbsp;– 34313, Chinese (that is, including [[Han Chinese|Hans]], [[Manchus]] etc.)&nbsp;– 23537, Jews&nbsp;– 5032, [[Poles]]&nbsp;– 2556, Japanese&nbsp;– 696, [[Germans]]&nbsp;– 564, [[Tatars]]&nbsp;– 234, [[Latvians]]&nbsp;– 218, [[Georgians]]&nbsp;– 183, [[Estonians]]&nbsp;– 172, [[Lithuanians]]&nbsp;– 142, [[Armenians]]&nbsp;– 124; there were also [[Crimean Karaites|Karaims]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Bashkirs]], and some Western Europeans. In total, 68549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sinoforum.pl/historia/harbin-najbardziej-polskie-z-chinskich-miast/ |title=Sinoforum&nbsp;– Harbin |publisher=Sinoforum.pl |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16|language=pl}}</ref> Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin.<ref>Bakich, Olga Mikhailovna, "Emigre Identity: The Case of Harbin," ''The South Atlantic Quarterly'', Vol.99, No.1 (2000): 51–73.</ref> By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them were ethnic Russians.<ref name="эхо"/>

After Russia's [[Great October Socialist Revolution]] in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated [[Russian White Guard]]s and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of [[White movement|White Russian]] [[émigré]]s and the largest Russian enclave outside the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="эхо"/> The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals.

When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigrees were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship. 
The Chinese warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]] seized the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] in 1929. Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.<ref>[http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/stalin/lectures/CollectSec.html Collective security]</ref>

Japan invaded [[Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. After the Japanese captured [[Qiqihar]] in the [[Jiangqiao Campaign]], the [[4th Mixed Brigade (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade]] moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.<ref>Matsuzaka, The Making of Japanese Manchuria, 1904–1932.</ref>

With the establishment of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]], the [[pacification of Manchukuo]] began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of [[Unit 731]], who killed people of all ages and ethnicities.

Chinese revolutionaries including [[Zhao Shangzhi]], [[Yang Jingyu]], [[Li Zhaolin]], [[Zhao Yiman]] continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-[[Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army]] which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP). The army was supported by the [[Comintern]] after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.

Under the Manchukuo régime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet [[Great Purge]] between 1936 and 1938 as "Japanese spies"<ref>These statistics, based on research work by A.

By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.<ref name="Clausen"/>

Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet [[Russian Fascist Party|Russian Fascists]], whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism.<ref name="RFP">Stephan, John J. 1978.

Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably [[Kobe]], which came to have Japan's largest synagogue.

Harbin was among one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the [[Great Leap Forward]] from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union.<ref>Chinese Government’s Official Web Portal (English).

As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the [[Vietnam War]] escalating, [[China]] became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. [[Mao Zedong]] ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the [[Soviet Union]]. During this [[Third Front (China)|Third Front Development]] Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including [[Gansu]], [[Sichuan]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guizhou]], where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's [[National University of Defense Technology]]) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to [[Chongqing]] in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).<ref>{{cite web|title=Japan-China Relations in the 21st Century|url=http://www.keidanren.or.jp/english/policy/2001/006.html|website=Kendairen|publisher=Japan Federation of Economic Organizations|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref>

One of the most famous dishes in [[Northeastern Chinese cuisine]] is [[Guo Bao Rou]], a form of sweet and sour pork. It is a classic dish from Harbin which originated in the early 20th century in Daotai Fu ({{zh|道台府|hp=Dàotái Fǔ|links=no}}).<ref name="Guobaorou">{{cite web|script-title=zh:"锅包肉"来自道台府|url=http://www.hljnews.cn/fou_baoye/2005-10/25/content_884048.htm|work=生活报|publisher=黑龙江新闻网|accessdate=1 March 2014|date=25 October 2005|language=zh}}</ref> It consists of a bite-sized pieces of pork in a [[potato starch]] [[batter (cooking)|batter]], deep-fried until crispy. They are then lightly coated in a variation of a sweet and sour sauce, made from freshly prepared [[syrup]], rice vinegar, sugar, flavoured with ginger, cilantro, sliced carrot and garlic. The Harbin Guobaorou is distinct from that of other areas of China, such as Liaoning, where the sauce may be made using either tomato ketchup or orange juice. Rather the Harbin style is dominated by the honey and ginger flavours and has a clear or honey yellow colour. Originally the taste was fresh and salty. In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.<ref name="Guobaorou"/>
