'''Dance-pop''' is [[dance music|dance]]-oriented [[pop music]] genre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for [[nightclub]]s with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for [[contemporary hit radio]]. Developing from [[post-disco]], [[new wave music|new wave]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/taryn-haight/david-guetta_b_960320.html|title=Interview With David Guetta: Where Pop Music Meets Dance Music|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> [[synthpop]],<ref name="apell423"/> [[electropop]] and [[House music|house]], it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures<ref name=AMDancePop>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/dance-pop-ma0000004548|title=Dance-pop|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|date=30 October 2011}}</ref> which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes.<ref name=AMDancePop/> The genre, on the whole, tends to be [[music producer|producer]]-driven, despite some notable exceptions.<ref name=AMDancePop/>

Dance-pop borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producer, artist and period. Such include [[contemporary R&B]], [[House music|house]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[techno]], [[electropop]], [[new jack swing]], [[funk]], [[synthpop]], and some forms of [[disco]]. Being mostly a mainstream pop-influenced genre, dance-pop's sound was often influenced by the period.

Dance-pop is a popular style and there are several artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable ones include [[Selena Gomez]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Heidi Montag]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Rick Astley]], [[Celine Dion]], [[George Michael]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Information Society (band)|Information Society]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Spice Girls]], [[NSYNC]], [[Christina Aguilera]], Leah Luv, [[Little Mix]] and [[Clean Bandit]].

===1980s===
As the term "disco" started to go out of fashion by the late 1970s to early 1980s, other terms were commonly used to describe disco-based music, such as "post-disco", "club", "dance" or "dance-pop" music.<ref name=AMDancePop/> These genres were, in essence, a more modern variant of disco music known as [[post-disco]], which tended to be more experimental, [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[Music producer|producer]]/[[DJ]]-driven, often using [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

Dance-pop music emerged in the 1980s as a form of dance, or post-disco, which was up-tempo, club-natured, producer-driven and catchy. Dance-pop was more up-tempo and dancey than regular pop, yet more structured and less free-form than dance music, usually combining pop's easy structure and catchy tunes with dance's strong beat and up-tempo nature. Dance-pop music was usually created, composed and produced by record producers who would then hire [[singer]]s to perform the songs.

In the 1980s dance-pop was closely aligned to other up-tempo electronic genres, such as [[Hi-NRG]]. Prominent producers in the 1980s included [[Stock, Aitken and Waterman]], who created Hi-NRG/dance-pop for artists such as [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]] and [[Bananarama]]. During the decade, dance-pop borrowed influences from [[funk]] (e.g. [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Whitney Houston]]), [[new jack swing]] (e.g. [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Paula Abdul]]), and [[contemporary R&B]].

Other prominent dance-pop artists and groups of the 1980s included [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], the [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Mel and Kim]], [[Samantha Fox]], [[Debbie Gibson]], and [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]].

===1990s===
[[File:Kyliecologne2005 feather.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Kylie Minogue]], a popular and successful dance-pop artist of the late-1980s, 1990s, 2000s and early-2010s.]]
By the 1990s, dance-pop had become a major genre in popular music. Several dance-pop groups and artists emerged during the 1990s, such as the [[Spice Girls]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Backstreet Boys]], and [['NSYNC]]. During the early 1990s, dance-pop borrowed influences from [[house music]] (e.g. [[Right Said Fred]]'s "[[I'm Too Sexy]]", [[Taylor Dayne]]'s ''[[Soul Dancing]]'', and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", "[[Rescue Me (Madonna song)|Rescue Me]]" and "[[Deeper and Deeper]]"), as well as [[contemporary R&B]] and [[new jack swing]] (e.g. [[Shanice]]'s "[[I Love Your Smile]]").

By the late 1990s, [[electronic music|electronic]] influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna's critically acclaimed and commercially successful album ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) incorporated [[techno]], [[trance music|trance]] and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing [[electronica]] into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, [[Cher]] released a dance-pop song called "[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]" which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, [[Auto-Tune]].

[[Celine Dion]] also released a dance-pop song "[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]" by the end of 1999. It has a moderately slow tempo but an up-beat song. An [[audio processor]] and a form of pitch modification software, it became commonly used as a way to correct pitch, as well as to create a special effect. Ever since the 1990s, Auto-Tune became a common feature of dance-pop music.

===2000s===
At the beginning of the 2000s, dance-pop music was still prominent, and highly electronic in style, influenced by genres such as trance, house, techno and [[electro (music)|electro]]. Nonetheless, as R&B and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] became extremely popular from the early part of the decade onwards, dance-pop often borrowed a lot of its influences from [[urban contemporary|urban]] music. Dance-pop stars from the 1980s and 1990s such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Janet Jackson and [[Kylie Minogue]] continued to achieve success at the beginning of the decade. Whilst a lot of dance-pop at the time was R&B-influenced, many records started to return to their [[disco]] roots; Kylie Minogue's albums such as ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'' (2000) and ''[[Fever (Kylie Minogue album)|Fever]]'' (2001) contained influences of disco music, or a new 21st-century version of the genre known as [[Nu-disco]]; hit singles such as "[[Spinning Around]]" (2000) and "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" (2001) also contained disco traces.<ref name=AMDancePop/> In Madonna's case, her album ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' (2000) contained elements of [[Euro disco]], especially the successful [[Music (Madonna song)|eponymous lead single]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-songs-of-the-aughts-20110617/madonna-music-19691231 |title=100 Best Songs of the 2000s: Madonna, 'Music' |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>

Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-to-latter part of the decade when dance-pop music returned greatly to its disco roots; this can be seen with Madonna's album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005), which borrowed strong influences from the genre, especially from 1970s artists and bands such as [[ABBA]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Donna Summer]]. Britney Spears' album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007) contained influences of Euro disco.

The mid-to-late 2000s saw the arrival of several new dance-pop artists, including [[Rihanna]], [[Kesha]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Katy Perry]]. This period in time also saw dance-pop's return to its more electronic roots aside from its disco ones, with strong influences of synthpop and [[electropop]]; Rihanna's singles in the dance-pop genre, including "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]" and "[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]", contained electronic influences, the former of which has elements of house music,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/rihannadontstop.htm |first=Bill |last=Lamb |title=Rihanna - Don't Stop the Music |website=Top 40 / Pop |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> the latter electropop; Lady Gaga's singles "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" were also heavily influenced by synthpop and electropop; Kesha's debut single, "[[Tik Tok]]", was also highly electronic in style and employed a [[video game music|video game]] beat. Katy Perry's "[[Hot N Cold (song)|Hot N Cold]]" (2008), "[[California Gurls (song)|California Gurls]]" (2010), and "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]" (2010), which were major commercial hits, also showcased influences of electropop and house music.

===2010s===
<!--AVOID adding more people here, there are multiple examples and Wikipedia is not going to add them all-->The 2010s so far have, similarly to the late 2000s, seen strong electronic influences present within dance-pop and also heavy emphasis on bass-heavy drum beats. Dance-pop artists such as Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Kesha, Christina Aguilera, [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], and Rihanna remain very popular, and several new recording artists within the genre have or are starting to emerge. Country-pop artist [[Taylor Swift]]'s albums ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012) and ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) both contain more of a pop-influenced sound which features production by dance-pop producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. Ariana Grande's [[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]] was a big hit in 2014.
