'''Association Sportive Nancy-Lorraine''' ({{IPA-fr|a.sɔ.sja.sjɔ̃ spɔrtɪv nɑ̃si-lɔʁɛn}}, commonly known as '''AS Nancy-Lorraine''', '''AS Nancy''', '''ASNL''', or simply '''Nancy''') is a [[Football in France|French association football]] club based in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], Lorraine. The club was founded in 1967 and currently plays in [[Ligue 2]], the second level of [[Football in France|French football]]. Nancy plays its home matches at the [[Stade Marcel Picot]] in [[Tomblaine]], a [[Communes of France|commune]] located in the [[Arrondissement of Nancy]].

Nancy was founded as the successor to [[FC Nancy]], which collapsed in 1965. The club has spent its entire life playing in either [[Ligue 1]] or Ligue 2. Nancy has never won the first division, but has won the second division on five occasions. Nancy's biggest achievement came in 1978 when the club won the [[Coupe de France]] defeating [[OGC Nice|Nice]] in [[1978 Coupe de France Final|the final]]. The club has also won the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] in [[2005–06 Coupe de la Ligue|2006]]. Nancy is presided over by [[Jacques Rousselot]]. Rousselot serves as a vice-president of the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF) and is also a member of the federation's Federal Council.<ref>{{cite news |title=Domenech perd un nouveau soutien |url=http://www.canalplus.fr/cid301645-domenech-perd-un-nouveau-soutien.html |publisher=[[Canal Plus]]|date= 17 December 2009|accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

One of the club's most notable players is [[Michel Platini]], the current president of [[UEFA]]. Platini began his career at the club in 1972, playing eight seasons with Nancy. He scored the only goal in the aforementioned Coupe de France final and won two [[France Football|French Player of the Year]] awards whilst playing with the club. Platini also established himself as a [[France national football team|French international]] while at the club and went on to achieve numerous team and individual accolades after his departure from Nancy. He is considered to be, arguably, the club's greatest player ever and, upon entering the section of the club's official website showing Nancy's greats, a picture of a young Platini is displayed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tous les anciens joueurs de l'ASNL |url=http://www.asnl.net/145/club_histoire_joueurs |publisher=AS Nancy |date=  |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|FC Nancy}}
Prior to the creation of AS Nancy, the city of Nancy was given host to football by [[FC Nancy]] and ''US Frontière''. FC Nancy was formed in 1901, while ''US Frontière'' was founded in 1910. Both clubs were a part of the ''Ligue de Lorraine''. ''US Frontière'' dissolved in 1935, while FC Nancy continued to play football through the professional transition. The club achieved very little during its 64 years of existence only winning the second division twice in 1946 and 1958. FC Nancy did reach the final of the [[Coupe de France]] in 1953 and 1962, however, on both appearances, the club lost to [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]], respectively. In 1965, with the club enduring financial difficulties during the [[1963–64 French Division 2|1963–64 season]], mainly due to the club being abandoned by the city's municipality and its supporters according to its president, Nancy folded shortly before of the new season.

[[File:Supporter asnl.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Supporters in the kop of Nancy]]

The idea of a new club in the city was thought of by Claude Cuny in the spring of 1964. Cuny had previously worked with FC Nancy, but left the club prior to its destruction. Cuny is considered one of the leaders of French football mainly because of his innovative ideas and strategies. After forming Nancy, he created the first youth academy of French football. Prior to the club beginning its life as a football club, Cuny devised a strategy to immerse the club into the city's public. First, he sent out over 18,000 letters and petitions to draw interest to the team. Once the public gained notice, Cuny organised friendly matches to raise funds for the club. After accruing enough money, Cuny sought to turned the club professional, and, despite several setbacks, on 16 June 1967, Nancy were granted professional status and inserted into [[Ligue 2|Division 2]], the second level of French football. The club's first manager was [[René Pleimelding]], a former French international who played for FC Nancy. Nancy, subsequently, recruited several former FC Nancy players such as [[Antoine Redin]], as well as players from the [[Lorraine (region)|region]] such as Michel Lanini, Gérard Braun and Roger Formica.

[[File:Michel Platini 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|[[Michel Platini]] spent eight seasons with the club.]]

In Nancy's [[1967–68 French Division 2|inaugural season of football]], the club finished tenth in the league table and reached the Round of 16 in the [[Coupe de France]]. Two seasons later, the club earned promotion to Division 1 and finished in 13th place in [[1970–71 French Division 1|its first season in the league]]. In 1972, [[Michel Platini]] arrived at the club, initially with the club's reserve team. His first full season as a player came in the 1974–75 season whilst the club was playing in the second division, having suffered relegation from Division the previous season. The season was a success for both club and player: Nancy achieved its first major honour winning Division 2, while Platini appeared in 32 league matches and scored 17 goals. In the ensuing three seasons in Division 1, Nancy, led by Platini, [[Jean-Michel Moutier]], [[Carlos Curbelo (footballer)|Carlos Curbelo]], [[Francisco Rubio|Paco Rubio]] and [[Philippe Jeannol]], finished in the top ten. Platini won the [[France Football|French Player of the Year]] award in two of those seasons. In 1978, Nancy achieved its highest honour to date after winning the [[Coupe de France]]. In the final, the club faced [[OGC Nice|Nice]] and defeated its southern foes 1–0 with Platini scoring the lone goal. [[President of the French Republic|President]] [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] presented Platini with the trophy to capped off the victory. Nancy's Coupe de France triumph saw the club qualify for [[UEFA|European competition]] for the first time in its short history. The club participated in the [[1978–79 European Cup Winners' Cup|1978–79 edition]] of the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and were eliminated in the second round after losing 4–3 on aggregate to Swiss club [[Servette FC|Servette]]. The club played most of the season without Platini who was injured.

Platini left the club after the season, however most of the club's nucleus remained. In the team's first season without Platini, Nancy finished in 11th place. In the next three seasons, Nancy finished in the top ten. After the 1984 season, Moutier and Rubio became the last of the club's influential players to depart and Nancy suffered a free-fall finishing in the next three seasons. The implosion concluded after the [[1986–87 French Division 1|1986–87 season]] when Nancy finished in 19th place, thus falling back to Division 2. The only ray of sunshine for the club during this declining stint was the [[testimonial match]] held for Platini on 23 May 1988 following the players' club and international retirement. That evening, fans were treated to an exhibition that featured Platini, [[Pelé]] and [[Diego Maradona]].

In the [[1988–89 French Division 2|1988–89 season]], Nancy earned promotion back to the first division. However, the club spent the entire decade rotating between Division 1 and Division 2. The club won two-second division title during this stint and finally earned promotion back to the first division, now called [[Ligue 1]], for the [[2005–06 Ligue 1|2005–06 season]] after winning Ligue 2. In Nancy's first season back in Ligue 1, the club won the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] defeated Nice 2–1 in [[2006 Coupe de la Ligue Final|the final]]. Nancy supporters arrived at the [[Stade de France]] courtesy of 11 special trains, while more than 300 buses and thousands of cars from the city also arrived in Paris. The cup victory allowed Nancy to participate in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] with the club eventually making it to the Round of 32 before losing to [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. The first half of the [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]] for Nancy was the club's best ever start to a season in the top division with 35 points after 19 games and sitting in second place. On 4 November 2007, in a match against [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], the club celebrated its 40th anniversary of existence with a special event involving many of the club's former players, club officials, presidents, and coaches. After a good second half start, Nancy sat in third place on the final match day of the season. However, the club finished one spot short of qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]], losing 3–2 to [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], while fourth-placed [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] defeated [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] 4–3 to claim the spot. Nancy still managed to claim the league's best defence, alongside Nice. The 30 goals conceded equalled the club's record achieved in the 1976–77 season. After managing mid-table performances during the following 4 years at the top-flight, the club got relegated in May 2013, finishing only 2 points behind 17th place [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/classement#sai=81&journee1=1&journee2=38&cat=Gen|title=LFP.fr - Ligue de Football Professionnel - Ligue 1 - Classement officiel, général, domicile ,extérieur, attaque, défense|website=www.lfp.fr|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref>

Following their relegation, the club nearly got promoted back to the first division, finishing 4th and 3 points shy behind [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]] and a spot to the top-flight. Nancy remained a strong candidate for promotion during the entire [[Ligue 2 2014-2015|2014/2015 season]], but ultimately finished 5th, 6 points behind 3th place [[Angers SCO|Angers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/classement#sai=83&journee1=1&journee2=38&cat=Gen|title=LFP.fr - Ligue de Football Professionnel - Ligue 2 - Classement officiel, général, domicile ,extérieur, attaque, défense|website=www.lfp.fr|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref>

The following year, the club still was a strong candidate for promotion. Finally, on 25 April 2016, after 3 years of absence, the club assured promotion to [[Ligue 1]] with 3 games to spare by beating [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]] 1-0 on match day 35. On match day 37, they beat [[Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C.|Evian]] 1-0 to clinch the [[Ligue 2]] title, their fifth second division crown after 1975, 1990, 1998 and 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/rapport/J37|title=LFP.fr - Ligue de Football Professionnel -  Rapport Après-Match - Ligue 2 - 2015/2016 - 37ème journée|website=www.lfp.fr|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref>

AS Nancy is the rival of [[FC Metz|Metz]], a city in Lorraine. The match between the two teams are one of the most dangerous encounters in the French football, often classified at the highest level of risk matches because of clashes between supporters of the two camps. This match is a regional derby for the supremacy of a city.
