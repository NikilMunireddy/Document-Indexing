The burgeoning port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in 1901, has induced continual surges in the city's population.

In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs from New York—[[Augustus Chapman Allen]] and [[John Kirby Allen]]—purchased {{convert|6642|acre|km2}} of land along [[Buffalo Bayou]] with the intent of founding a city.<ref name="Coutinho">{{cite news|title=Brief history of Houston|last=Coutinho|first=Juliana|url=http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol66/13/news/news-index.html|work=[[The Daily Cougar]]|date=September 13, 2000|accessdate=February 6, 2007}}</ref> The Allen brothers decided to name the city after [[Sam Houston]], the popular general at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]],<ref name="Coutinho"/> who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but slave dealers were in Houston. Thousands of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] [[African American]]s lived near the city before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860, 49% of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands; they also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.

Houston was granted incorporation on June 5, 1837, with [[James Sanders Holman|James S. Holman]] becoming its first mayor.<ref name=HouHTO/> In the same year, Houston became the county seat of Harrisburg County (now Harris County) and the temporary capital of the [[Republic of Texas]].<ref name = "SHQa4">{{cite journal

By 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton.<ref name="SHQa4" /> Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. During the [[American Civil War]], Houston served as a headquarters for General [[John B.

By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.

In 1900, after Galveston was struck by a devastating [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|hurricane]], efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated.<ref>[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/governors/rising/sayers-galv.html J.H.W.

When [[United States home front during World War II|World War II]] started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war.<ref name="shipchannel">{{cite web

Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.<ref>"Race, Roosevelt, and Wartime Production: Fair Employment in World War II Labor Markets", William J.

In 1945, the M.D. Anderson Foundation formed the [[Texas Medical Center]]. After the war, Houston's economy reverted to being primarily port-driven. In 1948, the city annexed several unincorporated areas, more than doubling its size. Houston proper began to spread across the region.<ref name=HouHTO/><ref>{{cite web

In 1950, the availability of air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to Houston, where wages were lower than the North; this resulted in an economic boom and produced a key shift in the city's economy toward the energy sector.<ref>[http://www.oldhouseweb.com/stories/Detailed/725.shtml "How Air Conditioning Changed America"], ''The Old House Web'', Retrieved on April 4, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.hgs.org/en/articles/printview.asp?26 "A Short History"], ''Houston Geological Auxiliary'', Retrieved on April 4, 2007</ref> [[File:Ashburn's Houston City Map.jpg|thumb|Ashburn's Houston City Map ({{circa|1956}})]]

During the late 1970s, Houston had a population boom as people from the [[Rust Belt]] states moved to Texas in large numbers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.texasalmanac.com/culture/groups/polish.html | title=Polish-Texans | work=Texas Almanac 2004–2005 | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}</ref> The new residents came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry, created as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]]. With the increase in professional jobs, Houston has become a destination for many college-educated persons, including African Americans in a reverse [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from northern areas.

One wave of the population boom ended abruptly in the mid-1980s, as oil prices fell precipitously. The space industry also suffered in 1986 after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] disintegrated shortly after launch. A cutback in some activities existed for a period. In the late 1980s, the city's economy suffered from the nationwide recession. After the early 1990s recession, Houston made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and health care/biotechnology, and reduced its dependence on the petroleum industry. Since the increase of oil prices in the 2000s, the petroleum industry has again increased its share of the local economy.

In 1997, Houstonians elected [[Lee P. Brown]] as the city's first African American mayor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=937&category=politicalMakers | title=Lee P.

===Geology===
Underpinning Houston's land surface are [[Consolidation (geology)|unconsolidated]] clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. These [[sediment]]s consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.<ref>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hch07 Harris County].

No significant historically recorded earthquakes have occurred in Houston, but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past, nor occurring in the future. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070715065340/http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/eq/faq/tx.htm Texas Earthquakes], ''University of Texas Institute for Geophysics'', July 2001.

Houston's climate is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid&nbsp;subtropical]] (''Cfa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification system]]), typical of the [[Deep South|lower South]]. While not located in "[[Tornado Alley]]", like much of the rest of Texas, spring [[Supercell|supercell thunderstorms]] sometimes bring tornadoes to the area. Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast during most of the year, which bring heat and moisture from the nearby Gulf of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web

===Cityscape===
{{further|Geographic areas of Houston|List of Houston neighborhoods}}
Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the [[Ward (politics)|ward]] system of representation. The ward designation is the progenitor of the 11 current-day geographically oriented [[Houston City Council]] districts. Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate&nbsp;610 Loop]]. The inside encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that antedate World War II. More recently, high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop. The city's outlying areas, suburbs, and enclaves are located outside of the loop. [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|Beltway 8]] encircles the city another {{convert|5|mi|km}} farther out.

Though Houston is the largest city in the United States without formal [[zoning]] regulations, it has developed similarly to other [[Sun Belt]] cities because the city's land use regulations and [[Covenant (law)#In a legal context|legal covenants]] have played a similar role.<ref name=nytzoning>{{cite news | title = FOCUS: Houston; A Fresh Approach To Zoning | work=New York Times | accessdate = March 27, 2009 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/realestate/focus-houston-a-fresh-approach-to-zoning.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print | first=Robert | last=Reinhold | date=August 17, 1986

Though some<ref name=nozoning/> have blamed the city's low density, [[urban sprawl]], and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the [[United States housing bubble|2008 real estate crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Lack of zoning has paid off for Houston|work=chron.com, Houston Chronicle|date= May 27, 2008|accessdate=March 27, 2009|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/steffy/5804649.html}}</ref> The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Healthiest Housing Markets for 2009 – Local Markets, Construction, Home Prices | work=Builder Magazine | date = February 27, 2009 | accessdate = March 4, 2009 | url = http://www.builderonline.com/local-markets/the-healthiest-housing-markets-for-2009.aspx?page=15}}</ref>

Voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Consequently, rather than a single central business district as the center of the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to [[Downtown Houston|downtown]] which include [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]], [[Texas Medical Center|Texas&nbsp;Medical&nbsp;Center]], [[Midtown, Houston, Texas|Midtown]], [[Greenway Plaza|Greenway&nbsp;Plaza]], [[Memorial City]], [[Houston Energy Corridor|Energy Corridor]], [[Westchase, Houston, Texas|Westchase]], and [[Greenspoint, Houston, Texas|Greenspoint]].

Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the [[Uptown Houston|Uptown District]] boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate&nbsp;610 West.

Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston's success to the ability of the region's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes. Furthermore, Jankowski stated that "more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated, expanded or started new businesses in Houston" between 2008 and 2010, and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low.<ref name="One" /> Also in 2013, Houston again appeared on ''Forbes''' list of Best Places for Business and Careers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Places For Business and Careers – Forbes|url=http://www.forbes.com/best-places-for-business/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>{{clear}}

The primary network-affiliated television stations are [[KPRC-TV]] ([[NBC]]), [[KHOU-TV]] ([[CBS]]), [[KTRK-TV]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[KRIV (TV)|KRIV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), [[KIAH]] ([[The CW]]), and [[KTXH]] ([[MyNetworkTV]]). KTRK-TV, KRIV and KTXH operate as [[owned-and-operated station]]s of their networks.

The Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area is served by one public television station and two public radio stations. [[KUHT]] (''HoustonPBS'') is a [[Public Broadcast Service|PBS]] member station and is the first public television station in the United&nbsp;States.  Houston Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises two [[NPR]] member stations: [[KUHF]] (''KUHF News'') and [[KUHA]] (''Classical 91.7''). KUHF is news/talk radio and KUHA is a classical music station.  The [[University of Houston System|University of Houston&nbsp;System]] owns and holds broadcasting licenses to KUHT, KUHF, and KUHA.  The stations broadcast from the Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting, located on the campus of the [[University of Houston]].

Houston is served by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. The Hearst Corporation, which owns and operates the ''Houston Chronicle'', bought the assets of the ''[[Houston Post]]''—its long-time rival and main competition—when ''Houston Post'' ceased operations in 1995. The ''Houston Post'' was owned by the family of former Lieutenant Governor [[Bill Hobby]] of Houston. The only other major publication to serve the city is the ''[[Houston Press]]''—a free alternative weekly with a weekly readership of more than 300,000.<ref name="About">{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/about/|title=Houston Press: About Us|publisher=Houston Press |accessdate=January 26, 2007}}</ref>

Employing more than 73,600 people, institutions at the medical center include 13 hospitals and two specialty institutions, two medical schools, four nursing schools, and schools of dentistry, public health, pharmacy, and virtually all health-related careers. It is where one of the first—and still the largest—air emergency service, [[Memorial Hermann Life Flight|Life Flight]], was created, and a very successful inter-institutional transplant program was developed. More heart surgeries are performed at the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Texas Medical Center |work=www.visithoustontexas.com |url=http://www.visithoustontexas.com/media/statistics/Houston_Stats_Texas_Medical_Center |accessdate=February 6, 2007}}</ref>

The innermost loop is [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]], which encircles downtown, the medical center, and many core neighborhoods with around a {{convert|8|mi|km|0|sing=on}} diameter. [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|Beltway&nbsp;8]] and its freeway core, the Sam Houston Tollway, form the middle loop at a diameter of roughly {{convert|23|mi|km|0}}. A proposed highway project, [[Texas State Highway 99|State Highway&nbsp;99]] (Grand Parkway), will form a third loop outside of Houston, totaling 180 miles in length and making an almost-complete circumference, with the exception of crossing the ship channel. As of June 2014, two of eleven segments of State Highway 99 have been completed to the west of Houston, and three northern segments totaling 38 miles.  In addition to the Sam Houston Tollway loop mentioned above, the Harris County Toll Road Authority currently operates four spoke tollways: The Katy Managed Lanes of Interstate 10, the Hardy Toll Road, the Westpark Tollway, and the Fort Bend Parkway Extension.  Other spoke roads either planned or under construction include [[U.S. Route 90 in Texas|Crosby&nbsp;Freeway]], and the future [[Texas State Highway 35|Alvin Freeway]].

Houston's freeway system is monitored by [[Houston TranStar]]—a partnership of four government agencies that are responsible for providing transportation and [[emergency management]] services to the [[Greater Houston|region]].<ref>[http://www.houstontranstar.org/about_transtar/ About Houston TranStar].
