The '''Detroit Tigers''' are a [[professional baseball]] team based in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], [[United States]]. The Tigers compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League Central|Central]] division in the [[American League]] (AL). One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in {{baseball year|1901}}. They are the oldest continuous one-name, one-city franchise in the AL. The Tigers have won four [[World Series]] championships (1935, 1945, 1968, and 1984), 11 [[List of American League pennant winners|AL pennants]] (1907, 1908, 1909, 1934, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1968, 1984, 2006, and 2012), and four AL Central division championships (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). The Tigers also won division titles in 1972, 1984 and 1987 while members of the [[American League East|AL East]]. The team currently plays its home games at [[Comerica Park]] in [[Downtown Detroit]].

The Tigers constructed [[Bennett Park (Detroit)|Bennett Park]] at the corner of [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|Michigan Avenue]] and Trumbull Avenue in [[Corktown, Detroit|Corktown]] (just west of Downtown Detroit) and began playing there in [[1901 in baseball|1901]]. In [[1912 in baseball|1912]], the team moved into Navin Field, which was built on the same location. It was expanded in 1938 and renamed Briggs Stadium. It was renamed [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[1961 in baseball|1961]] and the Tigers played there until moving to [[Comerica Park]] in 2000.

==Franchise history==
{{main|History of the Detroit Tigers}}

{{recentism|section|date=February 2011}}
The club is a charter member of the [[American League]], one of four clubs (with the [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Cleveland Indians]]) still located in its original city. It was established as a charter member in 1901.

===American League: 1901–present===
The Tigers played their first game as a major league team at home against the [[1901 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] on April 25, 1901, with an estimated 10,000 fans at Bennett Park.<ref>Richard Bak, ''A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium'', 1998, pp.&nbsp;73–74</ref> After entering the ninth inning behind 13–4, the team staged a dramatic comeback to win 14–13. The team finished third in the eight-team league.

11 years later, an elegant stadium was constructed on the site of Bennett Park and named Navin Field for owner [[Frank Navin]]. In 1938, it was improved and named Briggs Stadium (for then-owner [[Walter Briggs, Sr.]], who had purchased the team in 1935), and was subsequently renamed "Tiger Stadium" in 1961. Tiger Stadium was used by the Tigers until the end of the 1999 season. Since 2000, they have played in [[Comerica Park]].

===The Tigers===
[[Image:Tiger Stadium exterior April 2008 - Detroit Michigan.jpg|thumb|[[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], home of the Detroit Tigers from 1912–1999 at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull in the [[Corktown, Detroit|Corktown]] district of Detroit.]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Detroit Tigers Primary (1908 - 1915).png|100px|thumb|right|Detroit Tigers logo from 1908 to 1915]] -->There are various legends about how the Tigers got their [[nickname]]. One involves the orange stripes they wore on their black stockings. Tigers manager [[George Stallings]] took credit for the name; however, the name appeared in newspapers before Stallings was manager. Another legend concerns a sportswriter equating the 1901 team's opening day victory with the ferocity of his alma mater, the [[Princeton Tigers]].

Richard Bak, in his 1998 book, ''A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium'', pp.&nbsp;46–49, explains that the name originated from the Detroit Light Guard military unit, who were known as "The Tigers". They had played significant roles in certain [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battles and in the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]]. The baseball team was still informally called both "Wolverines" and "Tigers" in the news. The earliest known use of the name "Tigers" in the media was in the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' on April 16, 1895. Upon entry into the majors, the ballclub sought and received formal permission from the Light Guard to use its [[trademark]]. From that day forth, the team has been officially called the ''Tigers''.

===The Cobb era (1905–26)===
[[Image:Ty-Cobb-1913-NPC-detail-2.jpeg|thumb|[[Ty Cobb]] in 1913.]]
In [[1905 Major League Baseball season|1905]], the team acquired 18-year-old [[Ty Cobb]], a fearless player with a mean streak, who came to be regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. The addition of Cobb to an already talented team that included [[Sam Crawford]], [[Hughie Jennings]], [[William Edward Donovan|Bill Donovan]] and [[George Mullin (baseball)|George Mullin]] quickly yielded results, as the Tigers won their first American League pennant in 1907. Jennings was the team's manager from 1907 to 1920.

====1907 American League Champions====
{{Main|1907 Detroit Tigers season}}
Behind the hitting of outfielders Ty Cobb (.350) and [[Sam Crawford]] (.323), and the pitching of [[Bill Donovan]] and [[Ed Killian]] (25 wins each), the Tigers went 92–58 to win the AL pennant by 1.5 games over the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. They moved on to their first World Series appearance in the team's seventh year of existence.

The Tigers lost in the [[1907 World Series]] against the [[1907 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]]. Game 1 ended in a rare 3–3 tie, called due to darkness after 12 innings. The Tigers scored only three runs in the succeeding four games, never scoring more than one run in a game, and lost the Series, 4 games to none.

====1908 American League Champions====
{{Main|1908 Detroit Tigers season}}
Due to a scheduling quirk that included the league's decision to not make up certain games, the 90–63 Tigers won the AL by just a half-game over the 90–64 [[Cleveland Naps]]. Cobb hit .324, while Sam Crawford hit .311 with 7 home runs, which was enough to lead the league in the [[Dead-ball era|"dead ball" era]].

The [[1908 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]], however, would deny Detroit the title again in the [[1908 World Series]], holding the Tigers to a .209 batting average for the series, which the Cubs won in five games.

====1909 American League Champions====
{{Main|1909 Detroit Tigers season}}
Detroit posted a 98–54 season, winning the AL pennant by 3.5 games over the Athletics. Ty Cobb won the batting triple crown in 1909, hitting .377 with 9 home runs (all inside-the-park) and 107 RBIs. He also led the league with 76 stolen bases. [[George Mullin (baseball)|George Mullin]] was the pitching hero, going 29–8 with a 2.22 ERA, while fellow pitcher [[Ed Willett]] went 21–10.  Mullin's 11–0 start in 1909 was a Tiger record for 104 years, finally being broken by [[Max Scherzer]]'s 13–0 start in [[2013 Detroit Tigers season|2013]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/recap/MLB_20130628_DET@TB |title=Scherzer remains unbeaten, beats Rays to improve to 12-0 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=June 28, 2013 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref>

It was hoped that a new opponent in the [[1909 World Series|1909 Series]], the [[1909 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], would yield different results. The Tigers performed better in the Fall Classic, taking Pittsburgh to seven games, but they were blown out 8–0 in the decisive game at Bennett Park.<ref>{{cite web | title = World Series Game 7 Played on Saturday, October 16, 1909 (D) at Bennett Park | publisher = [[Retrosheet]] | url = http://retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B10160DET1909.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-12 }}</ref>

====1910–14====
The Tigers dropped to third place in the American League in 1910 with an 86-68 record. They posted 89 wins in 1911 to finish second, but were still well behind a powerhouse [[Philadelphia Athletics]] team that won 101 games. The team sunk to a dismal sixth place in both the 1912 and 1913 seasons. A bright spot in [[1912 Detroit Tigers season|1912]] was [[George Mullin (baseball)|George Mullin]] pitching the franchise's first [[no-hitter]] in a 7–0 win over the [[St. Louis Browns]] on July 4, his 32nd birthday.

1912 also saw a bizarre incident on May 18. Ty Cobb had gone into the stands in a May 15 game to attack a fan that was abusing him, and was suspended. The Tigers protested the suspension by fielding a team of replacement players and some coaches, and wound up surrendering 24 runs on 26 hits.

Cobb, for his part, was sensational in this five-year stretch, posting batting averages of .383, .420, .409, .390 and .368, winning the AL batting title every year.

====1915====
{{Main|1915 Detroit Tigers season}}
In [[1915 Major League Baseball season|1915]], the Tigers won a then-club record 100 games but narrowly lost the American League pennant to the [[1915 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] who won 101 games. The 1915 Tigers were led by an outfield consisting of Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, and [[Bobby Veach]] that finished #1, #2, and #3 in RBIs and total bases. Cobb also set a stolen base record with 96 steals in 1915 that stood until 1962, when it was broken by [[Maury Wills]]. Baseball historian [[Bill James]] has ranked the 1915 Tigers outfield as the greatest in the history of major league baseball. The only team in Tigers' history with a better winning percentage than the 1915 squad was the 1934 team that lost the World Series to the [[1915 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]].

====1916–20====
The Tigers dropped to third place in 1916 with an 87-67 record, and would remain mired in the middle of the AL standings the rest of the decade, never winning more than 80 games. In the late teens and into the 20s, Cobb continued to be the marquee player, though he was pushed by budding star outfielder [[Harry Heilmann]], who went on to hit .342 for his career.

Hughie Jennings left the Tigers after the 1920 season, having accumulated 1,131 wins as a manager.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/jennihu01.shtml Hughie Jennings Managerial Record at baseball-reference.com] Retrieved 14 February 2014.</ref>  This stood as a Tiger record until 1992, when it was broken by [[Sparky Anderson]]. Cobb himself took over [[baseball manager|managerial]] duties in 1921, but during his six years at the helm, the Tigers topped out at 86 wins and never won a pennant.

====1921====
{{Main|1921 Detroit Tigers season}}
In [[1921 Major League Baseball season|1921]], the Tigers amassed 1,724 hits and a team batting average of .316—the highest team hit total and batting average in American League history. (''The Elias Book of Baseball Records'', 2008, p.&nbsp;88) That year, outfielders [[Harry Heilmann]] and Ty Cobb finished #1 and #2 in the American League batting race with batting averages of .394 and .389. As early proof of the baseball adage that good pitching beats good hitting, the downfall of the 1921 Tigers was the absence of good pitching. The team ERA was 4.40, and they allowed nine or more runs 28 times. Without pitching to support the offense, the 1921 Tigers finished in sixth place in the American League at 71-82, 27 games behind the [[1921 New York Yankees season|Yankees]].

On August 19, 1921, Cobb collected his 3,000th career hit off [[Elmer Myers]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Aged 34 at the time, he is still the youngest player to reach that milestone, also reaching it in the fewest at-bats (8,093).<ref name=SportingNews08061999>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/exhibits/online_exhibits/3000_hit_club/cobb_ty.htm |title=The 3000 Hit Club: Ty Cobb |accessdate=2007-02-10 |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070209031106/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/exhibits/online_exhibits/3000_hit_club/cobb_ty.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-09}}</ref><ref name=HallofFameCobb3000>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/172730.html |date=August 6, 1999 |title=Inside the numbers: 3,000 hits |accessdate=2007-02-10 |publisher=[[Sporting News]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20050211195538/http://www.sportingnews.com:80/archives/sports2000/numbers/172730.html |archivedate=February 11, 2005 }}</ref>

====1922–26====
The Tigers continued to field good teams during Ty Cobb's tenure as player-manager, finishing as high as second in [[1923 Detroit Tigers season|1923]], but lack of quality pitching kept them from winning a pennant. Harry Heilmann hit .403 in 1923, becoming the last AL player to top .400 until [[Ted Williams]] hit .406 in 1941. In the [[1925 Detroit Tigers season|1925]] season, the 38-year-old Cobb nearly won his 12th batting title (or 13th depending on the source).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_most_times.shtml |title=Most Times Leading League |accessdate=2007-03-21 |publisher=Sports Reference, Inc }}</ref> But he was again edged out by teammate Heilmann, who collected six hits in a season-ending doubleheader to finish at .393 to Cobb's .389.

Cobb announced his retirement in November, 1926 after 22 seasons as a Tiger, though he would return to play two more seasons with the [[Philadelphia Athletics]].

===The Tigers break through (1927–40)===
[[File:Hank Greenberg 1937 cropped.jpg|thumb |Hall of Famer [[Hank Greenberg]]]]

====1927–33====
Though the Tigers struggled with mediocre records in the seven years following Cobb's departure, they were building a solid foundation, adding slugging first baseman [[Hank Greenberg]] and pitchers [[Tommy Bridges]] and [[Schoolboy Rowe]] to a lineup that already included consistent [[Charlie Gehringer]], "The Mechanical Man", at second base.

In [[1927 Detroit Tigers season|1927]], Harry Heilmann flirted with a .400 batting average all year, eventually finishing at .398 and winning his fourth AL batting title.

Following the 1933 season, the Tigers added perhaps the final piece of the puzzle, acquiring catcher "Black Mike" [[Mickey Cochrane]] from the Philadelphia Athletics to serve as player-manager.

====1934 American League Champions====
{{Main|1934 Detroit Tigers season}}
The Tigers won the 1934 AL Pennant with a 101–53 record, at the time a team record for wins, and still the best win percentage (.656) in team history. The Tigers infield (Hank Greenberg and Charlie Gehringer, along with shortstop [[Billy Rogell]] and third baseman [[Marv Owen]]) accumulated 769 hits during the season, with Gehringer (214 hits, .356 average) leading the way. Schoolboy Rowe led a strong pitching staff, winning 16 straight decisions at one point of the season and finishing with a 24–8 record.

The Tigers would fall in the [[1934 World Series]] in seven games to the "[[Gashouse Gang]]" [[1934 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]]. After winning a tight battle in Game 5 with a 3–1 decision over [[Dizzy Dean]], Detroit took a 3–2 series lead, but would lose the next two games at Navin Field (Tiger Stadium). For the second time in a World Series Game 7, Detroit folded. St. Louis scored seven times in the third inning off starter [[Elden Auker]] and a pair of relievers, while Dizzy Dean baffled the Tiger hitters en route to an 11–0 victory. The final game was marred by an ugly incident. After spiking Tiger third baseman Marv Owen in the sixth inning, the Cardinals' [[Joe Medwick|Joe "Ducky" Medwick]] had to be removed from the game for his own safety by [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] after being pelted with fruit and garbage from angry fans in the large temporary bleacher section in left field.

====1935 World Series Champions====
{{Main|1935 Detroit Tigers season}}
The Tigers 1935 lineup featured four future Hall of Famers ([[Hank Greenberg]], [[Mickey Cochrane]], [[Goose Goslin]] and [[Charlie Gehringer]]). Though they didn't challenge the 1934 team's 101 wins, their 93–58 record was good enough to give them the AL pennant by three games over the New York Yankees. Hank Greenberg was named AL MVP after hitting .328 and leading the league in home runs (36), extra-base hits (98) and RBIs (170). Incredibly, Greenberg's RBI total was 51 higher than the next closest player ([[Lou Gehrig]], with 119). The Tigers also got strong contributions from Charlie Gehringer (.330), Mickey Cochrane (.319) and starting pitchers [[Tommy Bridges]] (21–10) and [[Elden Auker]] (18–7).

The Tigers finally won their first [[1935 World Series|World Series]], defeating the [[1935 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]], 4 games to 2. Game 6 concluded with Goslin's dramatic walk-off RBI single, scoring Cochrane for a 4–3 victory.

After team owner [[Frank Navin]] died during the 1935 season, auto body manufacturing magnate and plumbing fixture manufacturer [[Walter Briggs, Sr.]] took control of the team.

====1936–39====
Despite being forecast to win the American League title again in [[1936 Detroit Tigers season|1936]]<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/396409901.html?dids=396409901:396409901&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Apr+12%2C+1936&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Detroit+Tigers+and+Chicago+Cubs+Picked+to+Repeat+Major+League+Victories&pqatl=google Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs Picked to Repeat Major League Victories], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 12, 1936</ref> the Tigers fell to a distant second place behind the [[New York Yankees]] both that season and in 1937. In 1938 and 1939, the team fell to fourth place with identical 84-70 records each year. [[Hank Greenberg]] nevertheless provided some excitement for Tiger fans in [[1938 Detroit Tigers season|1938]] by challenging the single-season home run record held by [[Babe Ruth]] (60). Hank went into the season's final weekend against the [[Cleveland Indians]] with 58 home runs, tied with [[Jimmie Foxx]] for the most by a right-handed batter, but he failed to homer on Saturday or Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/greenha01.php |title=Hank Greenberg Facts from |publisher=The Baseball Page.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref>

At the close of the 1938 season, the Tigers presciently held out doubts about a pennant in 1939, but figured that 1940 would be their year.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uMYLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tFQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2621,2121213&dq=detroit-tigers-are-figuring-on-a-pennant Detroit Tigers Point to Pennant in 1940], Sid Feder, ''The Evening Independent'', St. Petersburg, Florida, September 29, 1938</ref>

====1940 American League Champions====
{{Main|1940 Detroit Tigers season}}
In a tight three-team race, the 90–64 Tigers won the 1940 AL pennant by one game over the [[Cleveland Indians]] and two games over the [[New York Yankees]]. Prior to the season, first baseman Hank Greenberg was persuaded to move to left field to make room for slugging first baseman [[Rudy York]]. The move proved successful. York hit .316 with 33 home runs and 134 RBIs. Greenberg batted .340 and slammed 41 home runs while driving in 150. Hank won his second AL MVP award, becoming the first major leaguer to win the award at two different fielding positions. Charlie Gehringer, now 37, batted .313 while collecting 101 walks and scoring 108 runs.

[[Bobo Newsom]] was the ace of the Tiger pitching staff in 1940, going 21–5 with a 2.83 ERA. An unlikely hero on the mound this season was 30-year-old rookie [[Floyd Giebell]]. Making just his third major league start on September 27, Giebell was called upon to pitch the pennant-clinching game against the legendary [[Bob Feller]] of the Indians. Feller surrendered just three hits, one being a 2-run homer by Rudy York, while Giebell blanked the Tribe for a 2–0 victory.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802057,00.html | work=Time | title=Sport: Vegetable Plate | date=October 7, 1940 | accessdate=April 20, 2010}}</ref>

The Tigers lost the [[1940 World Series]] to the [[1940 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in seven games. Despite a heroic effort by Bobo Newsom, the Tigers came up short in the deciding game, losing 2–1. Newsom's father had died in a Cincinnati hotel room after watching his son win Game 1. An inspired Newsom won Game 5 and pitched Game 7 on just one day's rest. This was the third time the Tigers had lost a World Series in a deciding seventh game.

===The war years (1941–45)===
With Hank Greenberg serving in World War II for all or parts of the 1941–44 seasons, the Tigers struggled to recapture the glory of 1940. They finished no higher than fifth place in 1941-43, but did manage a second-place finish in [[1944 Detroit Tigers season|1944]], largely on the strength of pitchers [[Hal Newhouser]] and [[Dizzy Trout]], who won 29 and 27 games respectively. Newhouser, who was 29-9 with a 2.22 ERA, won the first of his two consecutive [[American League Most Valuable Player|AL MVP]] awards this season. The Tigers were in first place as late as September 18, but would finish one game behind the [[St. Louis Browns]] for the AL Pennant.

====1945 World Series Champions====
{{Main|1945 Detroit Tigers season}}
With the end of World War II and the timely return of Hank Greenberg and others from the military, the 88–65 Tigers took the 1945 American League pennant by just 1.5 games over the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]]. Hal Newhouser became the first pitcher in the history of the American League to win the MVP Award in two consecutive seasons.<ref>''Great Baseball Feats, Facts and Figures'', 2008 Edition, p. 153, David Nemec and Scott Flatow, A Signet Book, Penguin Group, New York, ISBN 978-0-451-22363-0</ref> "Prince Hal" won the [[pitching triple crown]], leading the AL in wins (25, against nine losses), ERA (1.81) and strikeouts (212).

With Newhouser, [[Virgil Trucks]] and Dizzy Trout on the mound and Greenberg leading the Tiger bats, Detroit responded in a World Series Game 7 for the first time, staking Newhouser to a 5–0 lead before he threw a pitch en route to a 9–3 victory over the [[1945 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]]. Because many baseball stars had not yet returned from the military, some baseball scholars have deemed the [[1945 World Series|'45 Series]] to be among the worst-played contests in Series history. For example, prior to the Series, Chicago sportswriter [[Warren Brown (sportswriter)|Warren Brown]] was asked who he liked, and he answered, "I don't think either one of them can win it!"<ref>Brown, Warren. ''The Chicago Cubs'', 1946</ref> But the Cubs had no answer to Greenberg, who hit the Tigers' only two home runs of the Series and drove in seven, and the Series went Detroit's way.

===A long drought (1946–67)===

====1946–50====
After their 1945 Series win, the Tigers continued to have winning records for the remainder of the decade, finishing second in the AL three times but never winning the pennant.  The [[1950 Detroit Tigers season|1950 season]] was particularly frustrating, as the Tigers posted a 95-59 record for a .617 winning percentage, the fourth best in team history at the time. But they finished that season three games behind a strong [[New York Yankees]] team that went on to sweep the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in the World Series.

During the 1946 season, the Tigers acquired [[George Kell]], a third baseman who was a 10-time all-star and future Hall of Famer. He batted over .300 in eight straight seasons (1946–53), and finished with a career .306 mark. Kell won a batting title in a very close race with [[Ted Williams]] in [[1949 Detroit Tigers season|1949]], going 2-for-3 on the last day of the season to edge out the Red Sox slugger, .3429 to .3427.

====1951–60====
Over the next 10 years, the Tigers sank to the middle and lower ranks of the American League. The team had only three winning records over this span and never finished higher than fourth place. The last-place [[1952 Detroit Tigers season|1952 team]] went 50-104 (.325), which was the worst season in Tigers history until the [[2003 Detroit Tigers season|2003 team]] lost 119 games. Despite the dismal season, starter [[Virgil Trucks]] threw two no-hitters in 1952, only the third time in major league history that a pitcher had accomplished that feat.<ref>''Great Baseball Feats, Facts and Figures'', 2008 Edition, p. 139, David Nemec and Scott Flatow, A Signet Book, Penguin Group, New York, ISBN 978-0-451-22363-0</ref> Also, team owner Walter Briggs, Sr. died in 1952.  His son [[Walter Briggs, Jr.]] inherited the team, but he was forced to sell it in 1956 to broadcast media owners [[John Fetzer]] and [[Fred Knorr]].

Notwithstanding Detroit's fall in the standings, the decade saw the debut of outfielder [[Al Kaline]] in 1953. One of the few Major League players who never played a day in the minor leagues, he would hit over .300 nine times in his career. He also made 15 All-Star teams, won 10 Gold Gloves, and featured one of the league's best arms in right field. In 1955, the 20-year-old Kaline hit .340 to become the youngest-ever batting champion in major league history.<ref name=kalinebio>{{sabrbio1|a141b60c|Al Kaline|Nick Waddell|14 October 2013}}</ref>

[[1958 Detroit Tigers season|1958]] saw the Tigers become the 15th of the then 16 MLB teams to field an [[African-American]] player. In the Tigers' case, it was an Afro-Caribbean player, [[Ozzie Virgil, Sr.]] who finally broke the team's color barrier. Only the [[Boston Red Sox]] trailed the Tigers in [[baseball color line|integrating their roster]].

====1961====
{{Main|1961 Detroit Tigers season}}
As the American League expanded from 8 to 10 teams, Detroit began its slow ascent back to success with an outstanding [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961]] campaign. The Tigers won 101 games, a whopping 30-game improvement over the 71-83 [[1960 Detroit Tigers season|1960 team]], but still finished eight games behind the [[1961 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. This marked one of the few times in major league history that a team failed to reach the postseason despite winning 100 or more games, though it had happened once before to the Tigers (1915). First baseman [[Norm Cash]] had the best batting average in the American League, a remarkably high .361, while teammate Al Kaline finished second. Cash never hit over .286 before or after the '61 season, and would later say of the accomplishment: "It was a freak. Even at the time, I realized that."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_9_60/ai_76928886 |title=Former Tiger Norm Cash |work= Baseball Digest|accessdate=2008-08-07 | first=Bill | last=Dow | year=2001}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> Cash's plate heroics, which also included 41 home runs and 132 RBI, might have earned him MVP honors that season were it not for New York's [[Roger Maris]] bashing a record 61 homers the same year. Cash also drew 124 walks that season for a league-leading .487 on-base percentage.

The 1961 club featured two nonwhite starters, [[Jake Wood (baseball)|Jake Wood]] and [[Bill Bruton]], and later in the 1960s, black players such as [[Willie Horton (baseball)|Willie Horton]], [[Earl Wilson (baseball)|Earl Wilson]], and [[Gates Brown]] would contribute to Detroit's rise in the standings.

====1962–66====
As a strong nucleus developed, Detroit repeatedly posted winning records throughout the 1960s. Pitchers [[Mickey Lolich]] and [[Denny McLain]] entered the rotation during the middle of the decade, with outfielders Willie Horton (1963), [[Mickey Stanley]] (1964) and [[Jim Northrup (baseball)|Jim Northrup]] (1964) also coming aboard at this time.

The team managed a third-place finish during a bizarre [[1966 Major League Baseball season|1966 season]], in which manager [[Chuck Dressen]] and acting manager [[Bob Swift]] were both forced to resign their posts because of health problems.  Thereafter, [[Frank Skaff]] took over the managerial reins until the end of the season.  Both Dressen and Swift died during the year&nbsp;– Dressen in August because of a [[kidney infection]], Swift in October due to cancer. Skaff was replaced by [[Mayo Smith]] in 1967, perhaps the last step before World Series contention.

====1967====
{{Main|1967 Detroit Tigers season}}
Indeed, in [[1967 Major League Baseball season|1967]] the Tigers were involved in one of the closest pennant races in history. Because of rainouts, the Tigers were forced to play back-to-back doubleheaders against the [[1967 California Angels season|California Angels]] over the final two days of the season. They needed to sweep the doubleheader on the last day of the season to force a [[one-game playoff]] with the [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. The Tigers won the first game but lost the second, giving the Red Sox the flag with no playoff. Detroit finished the season at 91–71, a single game behind Boston. Starter [[Earl Wilson (baseball)|Earl Wilson]], acquired the previous season from the Red Sox, led the Tigers with 22 wins and would form a strong 1–2–3 combination with Denny McLain and Mickey Lolich over the next few years.

===1968–72===

====Glory in '68 (1968 World Series Champions)====
{{Main|1968 Detroit Tigers season}}
The Tigers finally returned to the World Series in [[1968 Major League Baseball season|1968]]. The team grabbed first place from the [[1968 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] on May 10 and would not relinquish the position, clinching the pennant on September 17 and finishing with a 103–59 record. In a year that was marked by dominant pitching, starter [[Denny McLain]] went 31–6 (with a 1.96 ERA), the first time a pitcher had won 30 or more games in a season since the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]' [[Dizzy Dean]] accomplished the feat in 1934; no pitcher has accomplished it since. McLain was unanimously voted American League [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] and [[Cy Young Award]] winner for his efforts.

=====1968 World Series=====
{{main|1968 World Series}}

In the 1968 World Series, the Tigers met the defending World Series champion [[1968 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], led by starter [[Bob Gibson]] (who had posted a modern-era record 1.12 [[earned run average|ERA]] during the regular season) and speedy outfielder [[Lou Brock]]. This was the first time the Tigers and Cardinals had met in the World Series since 1934, when as it was said, they were choked by the [[Gashouse Gang]]. The series was predicated with a bold decision by manager Mayo Smith to play center fielder [[Mickey Stanley]] at shortstop, replacing the slick fielding but weak hitting of [[Ray Oyler]]. Stanley had never played shortstop before, but was a gold glover in the outfield and an excellent athlete. Smith started him at short for the final nine games of the regular season and all seven World Series games, with Oyler only appearing as a late-inning defensive replacement. This allowed Smith to play an outfield of [[Willie Horton (baseball)|Willie Horton]], [[Jim Northrup (baseball)|Jim Northrup]] and [[Al Kaline]] in every Series game.

In Game 1, Gibson completely shut down the Detroit lineup, striking out 17 batters, still a World Series record, en route to an easy 4–0 win. However, due in no small part to pitcher [[Mickey Lolich]]'s victories in Games 2 and 5, the Tigers climbed back into the Series. Many fans believe the turning point in the Series came in the fifth inning of Game 5, with the Tigers down three games to one, and trailing in the game, 3–2. Left fielder Willie Horton made a perfect throw to home plate to nail Lou Brock (who tried to score from second base standing up), as catcher [[Bill Freehan]] blocked the plate with his foot. The Tigers came back with three runs in the seventh to win that game, 5–3, and stay alive in the Series. The Cardinals would not threaten to score the rest of this game, and scored only two more meaningless runs over the remainder of the series. In Game 6, McLain ensured a Game 7 by notching his only win of the Series, a 13–1 blowout, despite pitching on only two days' rest.

In Game 7 at [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], Lolich, also pitching on two days' rest, faced Gibson. Both men pitched brilliantly, putting zeros up on the scoreboard for much of the game. In the bottom of the sixth inning, the Cardinals looked primed to take the lead as Lou Brock singled to lead off the inning, only to be promptly picked off first base by Lolich. One out later, [[Curt Flood]] followed with another single, and was also picked off first by Lolich. In the top of the seventh, an exhausted Gibson finally cracked, giving up two-out singles to [[Norm Cash]] and Willie Horton. Jim Northrup then struck the decisive blow, lashing a triple to center field over the head of Flood, who appeared to misjudge how hard the ball was hit. That scored both Cash and Horton; Northrup himself was then brought home by a Bill Freehan double. Detroit added an insurance run in the ninth. A solo home run by [[Mike Shannon]] was all the Cardinals could muster against Lolich as the Tigers took the game, 4–1, and the Series, 4–3. For his three victories that propelled the Tigers to the World championship, Lolich was named the [[World Series MVP Award|World Series Most Valuable Player]]. Through 2013, Lolich is the last player to have three complete-game victories in a single World Series.<ref>[http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/070f71e4 Mickey Lolich] Holmes, Dan at sabr.org, retrieved 4 November 2013.</ref> Also, at the time, Detroit was only the third team ever to come back from being down 3 games to 1 and win a World Series title.  The others were the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates (defeated Washington Senators) and the 1958 New York Yankees (defeated Milwaukee Braves).  Since the advent of divisional baseball in 1969 there have been quite a few post-season 3-1 comebacks.

====1969–71====

[[1969 Major League Baseball season|1969]] saw further expansion as both leagues realigned into two divisions of six teams, and the Tigers were placed in the [[American League East]]. That year, [[1969 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit]] failed to defend its '68 title, despite Denny McLain having another outstanding season with a 24-9 campaign, earning him his second straight Cy Young Award (co-winner with Baltimore's [[Mike Cuellar]]). The Tigers' 90 wins placed them a distant second in the division to a very strong [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles team]], which had won 109 games.

McLain, suspended three times in [[1970 Detroit Tigers season|1970]], was only 3-5 that season and was traded after the season was done. Mayo Smith was also let go after a disappointing fourth-place finish in [[1970 Major League Baseball season|1970]], to be replaced by [[Billy Martin]]. In a playing career that was primarily spent with the [[New York Yankees]], Martin played his final games with the [[Minnesota Twins]] and stayed in that organization after his retirement. He managed the Twins to an AL West Division title in [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|1969]], but was fired after that season due to rocky relationships with his players which included a legendary fight with pitcher [[Dave Boswell (baseball)|Dave Boswell]] in an alley behind Detroit's Lindell AC sports bar.<ref>Dow, Bill. "Remembering Detroit's Original Sports Bar: The Lindell AC." [http://blog.detroitathletic.com/2009/07/27/remembering-detroit%E2%80%99s-original-sports-bar-the-lindell-ac/]</ref> He would spend the 1970 season out of baseball.

After the 1970 regular season, Denny McLain was part of a seven-player deal with the [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] in what would turn out to be a heist for Detroit. The Tigers acquired pitcher [[Joe Coleman (1970s pitcher)|Joe Coleman]], shortstop [[Eddie Brinkman]] and third baseman [[Aurelio Rodríguez]]. Coleman paid immediate dividends for Detroit, winning 20 games in [[1971 Detroit Tigers season|1971]], while McLain went 10-22 for the Senators and was out of baseball by age 29.

Martin's [[1971 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] posted 91 wins in [[1971 Major League Baseball season|1971]], but again had to settle for a second-place finish behind the Orioles, who won 101 games to take their third straight AL East Division crown. The season was highlighted by Mickey Lolich's 308 strikeouts, which led the AL and is still the Detroit Tigers single-season record as of 2015.  Lolich also won 25 games and posted a 2.92 ERA while throwing an incredible 376 innings and completing 29 of his 45 starts.

====1972 AL East Champions====
{{Main|1972 Detroit Tigers season}}
The Tigers post-1970 acquisitions (Joe Coleman, Eddie Brinkman and Aurelio Rodríguez) all played critical roles in [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972]], when the Tigers captured their first AL East division title. Oddities of the schedule due to an early-season strike allowed the 86-70 Tigers to win the division by just ½ game, just as they had won the pennant in 1908. Brinkman was named Tiger of the Year by the Detroit Baseball Writers, despite a .203 batting average, as he committed just 7 errors in 728 chances (.990 fielding percentage) and had a 72-game errorless streak during the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/history/awards.jsp |title=Tigers Awards &#124; tigers.com: History |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}</ref> Mickey Lolich was his steady self for the Tigers, winning 22 games with a sparkling 2.50 ERA, while Coleman won 19 and had a 2.80 ERA. Starter [[Woodie Fryman]], acquired on August 2, was the final piece of the puzzle as he went 10–3 over the last two months of the regular season and posted a minuscule 2.06 ERA. Fryman was also the winning pitcher in the division-clinching game against the [[Boston Red Sox]], a 3-1 victory on October 3.

=====1972 ALCS=====
{{main|1972 American League Championship Series}}

In the 1972 American League Championship Series, Detroit faced the American League West division champion [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]], who had become steadily competitive ever since the 1969 realignment. In Game 1 of the ALCS in Oakland, [[Mickey Lolich]], the hero of '68, took the hill and allowed just one run over nine innings. The Athletics' ace, [[Catfish Hunter]], matched Lolich, surrendering only a solo home run to [[Norm Cash]], and the game went into extra innings. [[Al Kaline]] hit a solo homer to break a 1–1 tie in the top of the 11th inning, only to be charged with a throwing error on [[Gonzalo Marquez]]'s game-tying single in the bottom half of the frame that allowed [[Gene Tenace]] to score the winning run. [[Blue Moon Odom]] shut down Detroit 5–0 in Game 2. The end of Game 2 was marred by an ugly incident in which Tiger reliever [[Lerrin Lagrow]] hit A's shortstop and leadoff hitter [[Bert Campaneris]] on the ankle with a pitch. An angered Campaneris flung the bat at Lagrow, and Lagrow ducked just in time for the bat to sail over his head. Both benches cleared, and though no punches were thrown, both Lagrow and Campaneris were suspended for the remainder of the series. It was widely thought (and years later confirmed by Lagrow) that Martin had ordered the pitch that hit Campaneris, who had three hits, two stolen bases and two runs scored in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://launiusr.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/was-billy-martin-the-most-%E2%80%9Cbad-ass%E2%80%9D-baseball-manager-of-them-all/ |title=Wordpress, Oct. 8, 2010 |publisher=Launiusr.wordpress.com |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2013-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131012151700/http://launiusr.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/was-billy-martin-the-most-%e2%80%9cbad-ass%e2%80%9d-baseball-manager-of-them-all/ |archivedate=October 12, 2013 }}</ref>

As the series shifted to Detroit, the Tigers caught their stride. [[Joe Coleman (1970s pitcher)|Joe Coleman]] held the A's scoreless on seven hits in Game 3, striking out 14 batters in a 3–0 Tiger victory. Game 4 was another pitchers' duel between Hunter and Lolich, resulting again in a 1-1 tie at the end of nine innings. Oakland scored two runs in the top of the 10th and put the Tigers down to their last three outs. Detroit pushed two runs across the plate to tie the game before Jim Northrup came through in the clutch again. His single off [[Dave Hamilton (baseball)|Dave Hamilton]] scored [[Gates Brown]] to give the Tigers a 4-3 win and even the series at two games apiece.

A first-inning run on an RBI ground out from [[Bill Freehan]], set up by a [[Gene Tenace]] passed ball that allowed [[Dick McAuliffe]] to reach third, gave Detroit an early lead in the deciding fifth and final game in Detroit. [[Reggie Jackson]]'s steal of home in the second inning tied it up, though Jackson was injured in a collision with Freehan and had to leave the game. Tenace's two-out single to left field plated [[George Hendrick]] to give Oakland a 2–1 lead in the fourth inning. The run was controversial to many Tiger fans, as Hendrick was ruled safe at first base two batters prior to the Tenace hit. Hendrick appeared to be out by two steps on a grounder to short, but umpire John Rice ruled that Norm Cash pulled his foot off first base. Replays and photos, however, show that Cash did not pull his foot.<ref name=northrupbio>{{sabrbio1|7d747d5d|Jim Northrup|Jim Sargent|3 May 2010}}</ref> Thanks to that play and four innings of scoreless relief from [[Vida Blue]], the A's took the American League pennant and a spot in the [[1972 World Series|World Series]].

===A slow decline (1973–78)===
The [[1973 Detroit Tigers season|1973 season]] saw the Tigers drop to third place in the division, with an 85-77 record. Joe Coleman posted another 23 wins, but the other Tiger starters had subpar seasons. Willie Horton hit .316, but injuries limited him to just 111 games. Jim Northrup posted the best batting average of his career (.307) but was inexplicably limited to part-time duty (119 games played), which Northrup attributed to an ongoing feud with Billy Martin that had actually started in the 1972 ALCS. Northrup even proclaimed to the press that Martin "took the fun out of the game."<ref name=northrupbio/> Martin did not survive the 1973 season as manager. He was fired that September after ordering his pitchers to throw [[spitball]]s (and telling the press that he did so) in protest of opposing [[Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[Gaylord Perry]], whom Martin was convinced was doing the same. Base coach [[Joe Schultz]] served as interim manager for the final 28 games of the season.

A bright spot for the Tigers in 1973 was relief pitcher [[John Hiller]], who marked his first full season since suffering a heart attack in 1971 by collecting a league-leading 38 saves and posting a brilliant 1.44 ERA. Hiller's saves total would stand as a Tiger record until [[2000 Detroit Tigers season|2000]], when it was broken by [[Todd Jones]]' 42 saves. (Jones' record would later be broken by [[José Valverde]]'s 49 saves in 2011.)

The Tigers spent the remainder of the 1970s in the middle or lower ranks of the AL East. In [[1974 Major League Baseball season|1974]], [[Ralph Houk]], who managed the dominant Yankee teams of the early 1960s, was named manager of the Tigers. "The Major" served in that capacity for five full seasons, through the end of the [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978 season]]. The roster of players who played under Houk were mostly aging veterans from the 1960s, whose performance had slipped from their peak years. The Tigers did not have a winning season from 1974 to 1977, and their 57 wins in the [[1975 Detroit Tigers season|1975 season]] was the team's lowest since [[1952 Detroit Tigers season|1952]]. Perhaps the biggest signal of decline for the Tigers was the retirement of Kaline following the 1974 season, after he notched his [[3,000 hit club|3,000th career hit]]. Kaline finished with 3,007 hits and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1980.

====1976: The Year of The Bird====
{{Main|1976 Detroit Tigers season}}
Tiger fans were provided a glimmer of hope when 21-year-old rookie [[Mark Fidrych]] made his debut in [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976]]. Fidrych, known as "The Bird", was a colorful character known for talking to the baseball and other eccentricities. During a game against the [[1976 New York Yankees season|Yankees]], [[Graig Nettles]] responded to Fidrych's antics by talking to his bat. After making an out, he later lamented that his Japanese-made bat didn't understand him. Fidrych entered the All-Star break at 9-2 with a 1.78 ERA, and was the starting pitcher for the American League in the [[1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star Game]] played that year in [[Veterans Stadium|Philadelphia]] to celebrate the American [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]]. He finished the season with a record of 19–9 and an American League-leading [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 2.34. Fidrych, the AL Rookie of the Year, was one of the few bright spots that year with the Tigers finishing next to last in the AL East in 1976.

[[Aurelio Rodríguez]] won the [[Gold Glove Award]] for 1976 at third base, snapping a 16-season streak in which Hall of Famer [[Brooks Robinson]] had won every award at the position.

====1977–78====
Injuries to his knee, and later his arm, drastically limited Fidrych's appearances in 1977–78. Perhaps more important, however, was the talent coming up through the Tigers farm system at the time. [[Jack Morris]], [[Lance Parrish]], [[Alan Trammell]] and [[Lou Whitaker]] all made their Tiger debuts in 1977, and would help the team to 88 wins in [[1978 Detroit Tigers season|1978]], the only winning season under Houk.

===The "Bless You Boys" era (1979–87)===
Houk's immediate successor as Tiger manager in [[1979 Detroit Tigers season|1979]] was [[Les Moss]], but Moss would only last until June of that year. From June 14, 1979 until the end of the 1995 season, the team was managed by [[Sparky Anderson|George "Sparky" Anderson]], one of baseball's winningest managers and owner of two [[World Series ring]]s as manager of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] during their peak as [[The Big Red Machine]]. When Anderson joined the Tigers in 1979 and assessed the team's young talent, he boldly predicted that it would be a pennant winner within 5 years.<ref>"One of a Kind." Retrospective article about Anderson in ''Sports Illustrated'', June 28, 1993.</ref>

Acerbic sports anchor [[Al Ackerman]] of Detroit's [[WXYZ-TV]] (and later [[WDIV-TV]]) initiated the phrase "Bless You Boys" whenever the Tigers would win a game—sarcastically at first, because the team still wasn't winning enough to be respectable. But the Tigers became steadily competitive, with winning records in each of Anderson's first four full seasons (1980–83), and Ackerman's phrase would take on a new meaning in 1984.

====The Roar Of 84: 1984 World Series Champions====
{{Main|1984 Detroit Tigers season}}
As in 1968, the Tigers' next World Series season would be preceded by a disappointing second-place finish, as the [[1983 Detroit Tigers season|1983 Tigers]] won 92 games to finish six games behind the Baltimore Orioles in the AL East.

The first major news of the 1984 season actually came in late 1983, when broadcasting magnate [[John Fetzer]], who had owned the club since 1957, sold the team to [[Domino's Pizza]] founder and CEO [[Tom Monaghan]].<ref>Bak, Richard. ''A Place for Summer'', 1998, p.&nbsp;332.</ref> The sale of the franchise caught everyone by surprise, as the negotiations culminating in the sale of the franchise were conducted in total secrecy. There were no rumors or even speculation that Fetzer had put the franchise up for sale.

The 1984 team got off to a 9-0 start highlighted by [[Jack Morris]] tossing a nationally-televised [[no-hitter]] against [[1984 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago]] in the fourth game of the season. They stayed hot for most of the year, posting a 35-5 record over their first forty games and cruising to a franchise-record 104 victories. The Tigers led the division from opening day until the end of the regular season and finished a staggering 15 games ahead of the second-place [[1984 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]]. Closer [[Willie Hernández]], acquired from the 1983 NL champion [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in the offseason, won both the AL Cy Young and AL Most Valuable Player awards, a rarity for a relief pitcher.

=====1984 ALCS=====
{{main|1984 American League Championship Series}}

The Tigers faced the [[1984 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] in the American League Championship Series, which would prove to be no contest, not surprising given the fact the Royals won 20 fewer games during the season. In Game 1, Alan Trammell, [[Lance Parrish]] and [[Larry Herndon]] went deep to crush the Royals 8–1 at Royals Stadium (now [[Kauffman Stadium]]). In Game 2, the Tigers scored twice in the 11th inning when [[Johnny Grubb]] doubled off Royals closer [[Dan Quisenberry]] en route to a 5–3 victory. The Tigers completed the sweep at Tiger Stadium in Game 3. [[Marty Castillo]]'s third-inning RBI fielder's choice would be all the help Detroit would need. [[Milt Wilcox]] outdueled [[Charlie Leibrandt]], and after Hernandez got [[Darryl Motley]] to pop out to preserve the 1–0 win, the Tigers were returning to the World Series.

=====1984 World Series=====
{{main|1984 World Series}}

In the [[1984 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], a San Diego rally from 2–0 down prevented a fifth Cubs-Tigers series and meant the Tigers would open the [[1984 World Series]] against the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] in Trammell's hometown.

In Game 1, [[Larry Herndon]] hit a two-run home run that gave the Tigers a 3–2 lead. Morris pitched a complete game with 2 runs on 8 hits, and Detroit drew first blood. The Padres evened the series the next night despite pitcher [[Ed Whitson]] being chased after pitching ⅔ of an inning and giving up three runs on five Tiger hits. Tiger starter [[Dan Petry]] exited the game after {{frac|4|1|3}} innings when [[Kurt Bevacqua]]'s three-run homer gave San Diego a 5–3 lead they would hold onto.

When the series shifted to the Motor City, the Tigers took command. In Game 3, a two-out rally in the second inning, highlighted by Marty Castillo's 2-run homer, led to four runs and the yanking of Padre starter [[Tim Lollar]] after {{frac|1|2|3}} innings. The Padres, plagued by poor starting pitching throughout the series, never recovered and lost 5–2. [[Eric Show]] continued the parade of bad outings in Game 4, getting bounced after {{frac|2|2|3}} innings upon giving up home runs to Series MVP Trammell in his first two at-bats. Trammell's homers held up with the help of another Morris complete game, and the Tigers' 4–2 win gave them a commanding lead in the series.

In Game 5, Gibson's two-run shot in the first inning would be the beginning of another early end for the Padres' starter [[Mark Thurmond]]. Though the Padres would pull back even at 3–3, chasing [[Dan Petry]] in the fourth inning in the process, the Tigers retook the lead on a [[Rusty Kuntz]] sacrifice fly (actually a pop-out to retreating second baseman [[Alan Wiggins]] that the speedy Gibson was able to score on), and doubled it on a solo [[home run|homer]] by Parrish.

A "Sounds of the Game" video was made during the Series by MLB Productions and played on TV a number of times since then. [[Kirk Gibson]] came to bat in the eighth inning with runners on second and third and the Tigers clinging to a 5–4 lead. Padres manager [[Dick Williams]] was shown in the dugout flashing four fingers (ordering an intentional walk), before San Diego reliever [[Goose Gossage]] summoned him to the mound. Anderson was seen and heard yelling to Gibson, "He don't want to walk you!", and making a swing-the-bat gesture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmukTdo-WuY |title=YouTube video of Kirk Gibson's 1984 World Series Game 5 home run, Sparky Anderson mic'd |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2012-09-18 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> As Anderson had suspected, Gossage threw a 1–0 fastball on the inside corner, and Gibson was ready. He launched a hard smash into Tiger Stadium's right field upper deck, effectively clinching the game and the series.

[[Aurelio López]] pitched {{frac|2|1|3}} innings of relief without putting a runner on base for the win. Despite allowing a rare run in the top of the 8th inning, Willie Hernández got the save as [[Tony Gwynn]] flew out to [[Larry Herndon]] to end the game, sending Detroit into a wild victory celebration.

The Tigers led their division wire-to-wire, from opening day and every day thereafter, culminating in the World Series championship. This had not been done in the major leagues since the [[1955 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1955 Brooklyn Dodgers]]. With the win Sparky Anderson became the first manager to win the World Series in both leagues.

====1987 AL East Champions====
{{Main|1987 Detroit Tigers season}}
After a pair of third-place finishes in 1985 and 1986, the 1987 Tigers faced lowered expectations&nbsp;– which seemed to be confirmed by an 11–19 start to the season. However, the team hit its stride thereafter and gradually gained ground on its AL East rivals, eventually finishing with the best record in the Majors (98–64). This charge was fueled in part by the acquisition of pitcher [[Doyle Alexander]] from the [[Atlanta Braves]] in exchange for minor league pitcher [[John Smoltz]]. Alexander started 11 games for the Tigers, posting a 9–0 record and a 1.53 ERA. Smoltz, a [[Lansing, Michigan]] native, went on to have a long and productive career, mostly with the Braves, winning the [[Cy Young Award]] in 1996, and ultimately being inducted in to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2015. The Tigers won the division this year but possibly gave up some of their future. Despite the Tigers great season, they entered September neck-and-neck with the [[1987 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]]. The two teams would square off in seven hard-fought games during the final two weeks of the season. All seven games were decided by one run, and in the first six of the seven games, the winning run was scored in the final inning of play. At [[Exhibition Stadium]], the Tigers [[List of baseball jargon (D)#drop|dropped]] three in a row to the Blue Jays before winning a dramatic extra-inning showdown.

The Tigers entered the final week of the 1987 season 3.5 games behind. After a series against the [[1987 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]], the Tigers returned home trailing by a game and swept the Blue Jays. Detroit clinched the division in a 1–0 victory over Toronto in front of 51,005 fans at Tiger Stadium on Sunday afternoon, October 4. [[Frank Tanana]] went all nine innings for the complete game shutout, and outfielder [[Larry Herndon]] gave the Tigers their lone run on a second-inning home run. Detroit finished the season two games ahead of Toronto.

In what would prove to be their last postseason appearance until 2006, the Tigers were upset in the [[1987 American League Championship Series]] by the 85–77 [[1987 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] (who in turn won the World Series that year) four games to one. The Twins clinched the Series in Game 5 at Tiger Stadium, 9–5.

===A new approach (1988–95)===
Despite their 1987 division title victory, the [[1988 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] proved unable to build on their success. The team lost Kirk Gibson to free agency in the offseason, but still spent much of [[1988 Major League Baseball season|1988]] in first place in the AL East. A late-season slump left the team in second at 88–74, one game behind division-winning Boston.

[[Image:Arlington Stadium 1992 - 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Tigers playing against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] during a 1992 away game at Arlington Stadium.]]

In [[1989 Major League Baseball season|1989]], the [[1989 Detroit Tigers season|team]] collapsed to a 59–103 record, worst in the majors. The franchise then attempted to rebuild using a power-hitting approach, with sluggers [[Cecil Fielder]], [[Rob Deer]] and [[Mickey Tettleton]] joining Trammell and Whitaker in the lineup (fitting for the team with the most 200+ home run seasons in baseball history).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_hr7.shtml |title=Home Run Records by a Team During a Single Season |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> In [[1990 Major League Baseball season|1990]], Fielder led the American League with 51 home runs (becoming the first player to hit 50 since [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]] in 1977, and the first AL player since [[Roger Maris]] and [[Mickey Mantle]] in 1961), and finished second in the voting for AL Most Valuable Player. He hit 44 home runs and collected 132 RBI in [[1991 Major League Baseball season|1991]], again finishing second in the AL MVP balloting, and would hit at least 28 HR in each of the next four seasons. Behind the hitting of Fielder and others, the Tigers improved by 20 wins in 1990 (79-83), and posted a winning record in 1991 (84–78). However, the team lacked quality pitching, despite [[Bill Gullickson]]'s 20 wins in 1991, and its core of key players began to age, setting the franchise up for decline. Their minor league system was largely barren of talent as well, producing only a few everyday players ([[Travis Fryman]], [[Bobby Higginson]]) during the 1990s.  Adding insult to injury, the Tigers and radio station [[WJR]] announced in December, 1990, that they were not renewing the contract of long-time Hall of Fame play-by-play announcer [[Ernie Harwell]], and that the 1991 season would be Harwell's last with the team. The announcement was met with resounding protests from fans, both in Michigan and around the baseball world.

[[1992 Detroit Tigers season|1992]] saw the Tigers win only 75 games, with Fielder being one of the few bright spots as he won the AL RBI title for a third straight season (124). But late in the season, Sparky Anderson won his 1,132nd game as a Tiger manager, passing [[Hughie Jennings]] for the most all-time wins in franchise history. Following the 1992 season, the franchise was sold to [[Mike Ilitch]], the President and CEO of [[Little Caesars]] Pizza who also owns the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Ilitch made it one of his first priorities to re-hire Ernie Harwell. The team also responded with an 85-77 season in [[1993 Detroit Tigers season|1993]], but it would be their last winning season for a number of years.

On October 2, 1995, manager Sparky Anderson chose to not only end his career with the Tigers, but retire from baseball altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Sparky_Anderson_1934&page=chronology |title=Sparky Anderson Chronology from |publisher=The Baseball Library |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

===Randy Smith era (1996–2002)===
From 1994 to 2005, the Tigers did not post a winning record. This is by far the longest sub-.500 stretch in franchise history; prior to this, the team had not gone more than four consecutive seasons without a winning record. In fact, the only team in the majors to have a longer stretch without a winning season during this time is the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], which did not have a winning record in the years spanning 1993 to 2012. The Tigers' best record over this span was 79–83, recorded in 1997 and 2000. In 1996, the Tigers lost a then-team record 109 games, under new general manager [[Randy Smith (baseball)|Randy Smith]], who served the team from 1996 to 2002.

In 1998, the Tigers moved from the American League's Eastern Division, where they had been since divisions were created in 1969, to the Central Division, as part of a realignment necessitated by the addition of the expansion [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]. The Tigers were not an original member of the Central, which had been created in 1994.

[[Image:ComericaParkWEntrance.jpg|thumb|The entrance sign of Comerica Park]]
In 2000, the team left [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], then tied with [[Fenway Park]] as the oldest active baseball stadium, in favor of the new [[Comerica Park]]. This capped an argument among Detroiters, lasting more than a decade, about whether or not a new stadium was needed to keep the club competitive.

Soon after it [[First game at Comerica Park|opened]], Comerica Park drew criticism for its deep dimensions, which made it difficult to hit home runs; the distance to left-center field (395&nbsp;ft), in particular, was seen as unfair to hitters. This led to the nickname "Comerica National Park."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050613&content_id=1087996&vkey=allstar2005&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Comerica Park fair to hitters, pitchers &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |date=2013-05-24 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> The team made a successful bid to bring in slugger [[Juan Gonzalez (baseball)|Juan Gonzalez]] from the Texas Rangers for the inaugural 2000 season at Comerica Park. Gonzalez hit a meager (for him) 22 home runs that season, and many cited Comerica Park's dimensions as a major reason he turned down multi-millions to re-sign with the club in 2001. In 2003, the franchise largely quieted the criticism by moving in the left-center fence to {{convert|370|ft|m}}, taking the flagpole in that area out of play, a feature carried over from Tiger Stadium. In 2005, the team moved the bullpens to the vacant area beyond the left-field fence and filled the previous location with seats.

In late 2001, [[Dave Dombrowski]], former general manager of the [[1997 World Series]] champion [[1997 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]], was hired as team president. In 2002, the [[2002 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] started the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|season]] 0–6, prompting Dombrowski to fire the unpopular Smith, as well as manager [[Phil Garner]]. Dombrowski then took over as general manager and named bench coach [[Luis Pujols]] to finish the season as interim manager. The team finished 55–106. After the season was over, Pujols was let go.

===Most losses in American League history (2003)===
{{Main|2003 Detroit Tigers season}}
Dombrowski hired popular former shortstop [[Alan Trammell]] to manage the team in [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003]]. With fellow '84 teammates [[Kirk Gibson]] and [[Lance Parrish]] on the coaching staff, the rebuilding process began. In 2003, still playing with mostly players Smith had drafted or acquired, the Tigers shattered their 1996 mark for team futility by losing [[List of worst MLB season records|an American League-record 119 games]]. This eclipsed the previous AL record of 117 losses set by the [[1916 Philadelphia Athletics season|1916 Philadelphia Athletics]], and was just .030 ahead of the 1916 A's .235 win percentage.<ref name="BaseballGraphs.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballgraphs.com/teams/tigers.html |title=2003 Detroit Tigers Baseball Graphs Review |accessdate=2008-09-26 |publisher=BaseballGraphs.com }}</ref> On August 30, 2003, the Tigers' defeat at the hands of the [[2003 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] caused them to join the [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 New York Mets]] (who were a first year expansion club) as the only modern MLB teams to lose 100 games before September. They avoided tying the 1962 Mets' modern MLB record of 120 losses only by winning five of their last six games of the season, including three out of four against the [[2003 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] who had already clinched the [[American League Central|Central Division]], and were resting their stars.

[[Mike Maroth]] went 9–21 for the 2003 Tigers and became the first pitcher to lose 20 games in more than 20 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/friv/20gameLosers.shtml |title=Pitchers With 20 or More Losses in a Season |accessdate=2008-09-26 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref> Tigers' pitchers Maroth, [[Jeremy Bonderman]] (6–19), and [[Nate Cornejo]] (6–17) were #1, #2, and #3 in the major leagues in losses for 2003—the only time in major league history that one team has had the top three losers.

While the 2003 Tigers rank as the third worst team in major league history based on loss total, they fare slightly better based on winning percentage. Their .265 win percentage was the majors' sixth-worst since 1900. The Tigers went 43–119 that season, 47 games behind division-winner Minnesota. {{Further|List of worst MLB season records#Table of worst teams}}

===Rebuilding the franchise (2004–06)===
Although the 2003 season was a complete morass, Dombrowski gave Trammell a chance to finish the remaining two years of his contract over the 2004 and 2005 seasons. Under Dombrowski, the Tigers demonstrated a willingness to sign marquee free agents. In [[2004 Major League Baseball season|2004]], the team signed or traded for several talented but high-risk veterans, such as [[Fernando Viña]], [[Iván Rodríguez]], [[Ugueth Urbina]], [[Rondell White]] and [[Carlos Guillén]], and the gamble paid off. The 2004 Tigers finished 72–90, a 29-game improvement over the previous season, and the largest improvement in the American League since Baltimore's 33-game improvement from 1988 to 1989. However, the team was still sub-.500.

Prior to the 2005 season, the Tigers spent a large sum for two prized free agents, [[Magglio Ordóñez]] and [[Troy Percival]]. On June 8, 2005, the Tigers traded pitcher [[Ugueth Urbina]] and infielder [[Ramón Martínez (infielder)|Ramón Martínez]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for [[Plácido Polanco]] (and later signed him for 4 years). The Tigers stayed on the fringes of contention for the American League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] for the first four months of the season, but then faded badly, finishing 71–91. The collapse was perceived as being due both to injuries and to a lack of player unity; Rodriguez in particular was disgruntled, taking a leave of absence during the season to deal with a difficult divorce. Trammell, though popular with the fans, took part of the blame for the poor clubhouse atmosphere and lack of continued improvement, and he was fired at the end of the season.

A highlight of the 2005 campaign was Detroit's hosting of the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], its first since 1971. In the [[Home run derby#2005|Home Run Derby]], Rodriguez finished second, losing to the Phillies' [[Bobby Abreu]].

In October 2005, [[Jim Leyland]], who managed Dombrowski's 1997 World Series–winning [[Florida Marlins|Marlins]] club, replaced Trammell as manager; two months later, in response to Troy Percival's '05 arm problems, closer [[Todd Jones]], who had spent five seasons in Detroit (1997–2001), signed a two-year deal to return to the Tigers. Veteran left-hander [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]] also joined the Tigers from Texas in late 2005. These offseason additions set the stage for the resurgence of "Tiger Fever" in Detroit and its environs the following year.

====The return of the Tigers: 2006 American League Champions====
{{Main|2006 Detroit Tigers season}}
After years of futility, the 2006 season showed signs of hope. The impressive rookie campaigns of eventual American League Rookie of the Year [[Justin Verlander]], centerfielder [[Curtis Granderson]], and flamethrowing relief pitcher [[Joel Zumaya]], coupled with a well-publicized early-season tirade by Leyland, helped the team explode and quickly rise to the top of the [[AL Central]]. The team reached a high point when they were 40 games over .500, but a second half swoon started to raise questions about the team's staying power. On August 27, a 7–1 victory over the [[2006 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] gave the Tigers their 82nd victory and their first winning season since 1993. On September 24, the Tigers beat the [[2006 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 11–4 to clinch their first playoff berth since [[1987 Major League Baseball season|1987]]. A division title seemed inevitable. All that was required was one win in the final five games of the season, which included three games against the Royals, whom the Tigers had manhandled much of the season. However, the Tigers lost all five games to finish 95–67, and the division title went to the 96–66 [[2006 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. The Tigers were the AL wild card winner, the first time a team from the AL Central had won the honor.

The playoffs saw the Tigers beat the heavily favored [[2006 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] 3 games to 1 in the [[2006 American League Division Series|ALDS]] and sweep the [[2006 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[2006 American League Championship Series|2006 ALCS]], thanks to a walk-off home run in Game 4 by right fielder Magglio Ordóñez. They advanced to the [[2006 World Series|World Series]], where they lost to the underdog [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in five games.

===Falling short (2007–2010)===
[[File:Tigers opening day2 2007.jpg|right|thumb|Tigers opening day 2007; view from section 324]]

The Tigers would field competitive teams over the next four years, but struggles in the second half of all four years kept them from repeating their 2006 playoff appearance.

====2007====
{{Main|2007 Detroit Tigers season}}

In 2007, the Tigers returned 22 of 25 players from their 2006 World Series roster, and traded for outfielder [[Gary Sheffield]], who had been a part of the 1997 Marlins World Series team managed by Jim Leyland. In addition to acquisitions, Dombrowski developed a productive farm system. [[Justin Verlander]] and [[Joel Zumaya]], the most notable rookie contributors to the 2006 team, were followed by [[Andrew Miller (baseball)|Andrew Miller]], who was drafted in 2006 and called up early in the 2007 campaign, and minor-leaguer [[Cameron Maybin]], an athletic five-tool outfielder ranked #6 in [[Baseball America]]'s 2007 Top-100 Prospects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/features/263445.html |title=2007 Top 100 Prospects |publisher=Baseballamerica.com |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> The Tigers suffered from injuries in the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]], especially to their pitching staff. [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]] did not start until late June because of surgery to remove a blood-clot in his throwing arm. Other pitchers who were injured included [[Tim Byrdak]], [[Fernando Rodney]], [[Jair Jurrjens]] and [[Joel Zumaya]].

On June 12, Justin Verlander threw the Tigers' first no-hitter since 1984 (Jack Morris) and the first in Comerica Park history, in a 4-0 win over the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. The Tigers had the best record in baseball in mid-July, but lost a few players to injuries and started to play poorly in the second half and fade from contention. This pattern of good starts followed by a poor second half would be repeated over the next three seasons. The Tigers gave up their division lead to the Cleveland Indians in early September and were officially eliminated from playoff competition on September 26, 2007, when the New York Yankees clinched a wild card berth. The Tigers, at 88-74, finished second in the AL Central.

====2008====
{{Main|2008 Detroit Tigers season}}
[[File:Justin Verlander 2008.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Justin Verlander]], June 2008]]
Going into the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]], the franchise traded for prominent talent in [[Edgar Rentería]] (from the [[Atlanta Braves]]) and [[Miguel Cabrera]] and [[Dontrelle Willis]] (from the [[Florida Marlins]]). However, the Tigers (who now boasted the second-highest team payroll in the majors at over $138 million)<ref>{{cite web|author=Fox Sports |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/7978102/2008-MLB-team-payrolls |title=Fox Sports on MSN: 2008 MLB team payrolls |work=[[Fox Sports]] |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> began the regular season by losing seven straight games. The Tigers climbed back, and at the midway point of the season, they were 42–40. In the end, the team finished miserably, slumping to a 74–88 record. Justin Verlander finished with his worst season as a pro, as he went 11–17 with a 4.84 ERA. The Tigers also lost closer [[Todd Jones]] to retirement on September 25, 2008. Despite the disappointing season, the team set an attendance record in 2008, drawing 3,202,654 customers to Comerica Park.

====2009====
{{Main|2009 Detroit Tigers season}}

The Tigers started 2009 very hot, quickly gaining the lead in the AL Central and keeping it for much of the year. This was fueled primarily by the combination of pitching and defense.

The Tigers acquired starter [[Edwin Jackson]] from the 2008 AL Champion [[Tampa Bay Rays]], and called up rookie and former #1 draft pick [[Rick Porcello]]. Jackson was outstanding in the first half, making his first All-Star team, while Porcello was solid most of the year, posting a 14–9 record with a 3.96 ERA and displaying grit and maturity beyond his 20 years of age. Tigers ace [[Justin Verlander]] bounced back from an off 2008 to win 19 games. He posted a 3.45 ERA and led the AL in strikeouts (269) to finish third in the AL Cy Young balloting. [[Fernando Rodney]] assumed the closer role in spring training, replacing the retired [[Todd Jones]]. Rodney responded with 37 saves in 38 tries, while [[Bobby Seay]], [[Brandon Lyon]] and young [[Ryan Perry]] shored up the middle relief that plagued the team in 2007–08.

Despite the improvements, the Tigers again found themselves struggling to hold a lead in the AL Central during the second half of the season, and in particular, the final month. The offense they were known for in recent years slumped badly and was unable to support strong outings by the pitching staff. The team entered September with a 7-game lead on its AL Central rivals, but wound up tied with the [[2009 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] at 86 wins by the final day of the regular season. The season ended on October 6 with a 6–5 loss in 12 innings to the Twins in the [[2009 American League Central tie-breaker game|tie-breaker game]], leaving the Tigers with an 86–77 record. The Tigers spent 146 days of the 2009 season in first place, but became the first team in Major League history to lose a three-game lead with four games left to play.<ref>{{cite web|last=Matuszewski |first=Erik |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&sid=az7vYlJIT_Hg |title=Tigers Face Historic Collapse in Baseball Tiebreaker With Twins |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>

====2010====
{{Main|2010 Detroit Tigers season}}
[[File:Alex Avila 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Alex Avila]], March 2010]]
Entering 2010, the Tigers parted ways with [[Curtis Granderson]] and [[Edwin Jackson]] as part of a three-way trade with the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]; in return they picked up outfield prospect [[Austin Jackson]] and pitchers [[Phil Coke]], [[Max Scherzer]] and [[Daniel Schlereth]]. Austin Jackson made the Tigers opening day roster, and was American League Rookie of the Month for April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100504&content_id=9785236&vkey=news_det&fext=.jsp&c_id=det |title=Jackson is AL Rookie of Month for April |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |date=2013-05-24 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> 2010 also saw the debut of [[Brennan Boesch]], who was named the AL Rookie of the Month for May and June.<ref>[http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100602&content_id=10723482&vkey=news_det&fext=.jsp&c_id=det Boesch named AL's top rookie for May] ''[[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'' June 2, 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100706&content_id=11988334&notebook_id=11994052&vkey=notebook_det&fext=.jsp&c_id=det |title=Boesch is AL Rookie of the Month for June |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]]|date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

At the All-Star break, the Tigers were a half-game out of first place in the AL Central, behind the [[2010 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. But a slow start after the break and injuries to three key players sent the Tigers into yet another second-half tailspin. The Tigers finished the season in third place with an 81–81 record, 13 games back of the division-winning [[2010 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. While playing outstanding baseball at home, the Tigers were just 29–52 on the road. Only the [[Seattle Mariners]] had fewer road wins than the Tigers among American League teams.

Among the 2010 season highlights were Miguel Cabrera hitting .328 with 38 home runs and an AL-best 126 RBI, earning the American League [[Silver Slugger Award]] at first base<ref>{{cite web |url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101111&content_id=16072650&vkey=news_det&fext=.jsp&c_id=det |title=Cabrera wins third Silver Slugger, first in Detroit |author= |date=November 11, 2010 |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> and finishing second in the AL MVP race (earning 5 of 28 first-place votes).<ref>{{cite web|author=CBSSports.com wire reports |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/story/14342684/rangers-hamilton-wins-al-mvp-award |title="Rangers' Hamilton wins AL MVP award."

Justin Verlander enjoyed another strong season (18–9 record, 3.37 ERA, 219 strikeouts).

=====The near-perfect game=====
{{Main|Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game}}

On June 2, 2010, [[Armando Galarraga]] was pitching a perfect game against the [[Cleveland Indians]] with 2 outs in the top of the ninth inning when first base umpire [[Jim Joyce]] made a controversial call, ruling [[Jason Donald (baseball)|Jason Donald]] safe at first. Video replay showed he was out. A tearful Joyce later said "I just cost that kid a perfect game. I thought he beat the throw. I was convinced he beat the throw, until I saw the replay."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2010/jun/02/bc-bba-indians-tigers3rd-ld-writethru/?news&nation-world |title=Blown call costs Galarraga perfect game in 9th |author= |date= |work=[[The Victoria Advocate]] |publisher= |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}</ref> Later Galarraga told reporters Joyce apologized to him directly and gave him a hug. The next day, with Joyce umpiring home plate, Galarraga brought out the Tigers lineup card and the two hugged again. Despite large fan support for overturning the call, commissioner [[Bud Selig]] let the call stand, but said he would look into expanding [[instant replay in baseball|instant replay]] for the future.

===2011: First AL Central Championship===
{{main|2011 Detroit Tigers season}}
The Tigers returned much of their roster from 2010, while adding catcher/DH [[Víctor Martínez (baseball)|Victor Martinez]], relief pitcher [[Joaquín Benoit]] and starting pitcher [[Brad Penny]]. The Tigers sent five players to the 2011 All-Star Game.  Catcher [[Alex Avila]] was voted in as a starter, while Justin Verlander, [[José Valverde]] and [[Miguel Cabrera]] were added as reserves. (Verlander was unavailable to play in the game due to the scheduling of his regular-season starts.) Shortstop [[Jhonny Peralta]] was later added to the All-Star team when the Yankees' [[Derek Jeter]] was unable to play due to injury.

On May 7, Justin Verlander took a perfect game against the [[2011 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] into the 8th inning. After a walk to [[J. P. Arencibia]], Verlander coaxed a double-play grounder and went on to the 9th inning to complete his second career [[no-hitter]] by facing the minimum 27 batters. It was the seventh no-hitter in Tigers history.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2011/05/justin_verlander_gets_second_n.html Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander tosses second career no-hitter in win over Blue Jays] MLive.com May 7, 2011</ref> On August 27, Verlander defeated the [[2011 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]], 6–4, to become the first Tiger since [[Bill Gullickson]] in 1991 to win 20 games in a season.  Verlander also became the first major league pitcher since [[Curt Schilling]] in 2002 to reach 20 wins before the end of August.<ref>{{cite web|author=CBSSports.com wire reports |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/recap/MLB_20110827_DET@MIN |title=wire reports, August 27, 2011 |work=[[CBS Sports]]|date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

In May, the Tigers were as many as eight games back of the first-place [[2011 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], but slowly pulled back to near-even by the All-Star break. As a three-way battle for the division title developed between the Tigers, Indians, and [[2011 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]], the Tigers put together an 18–10 record in August to begin to pull away.

==Rivalries and fan base==
The Tigers' [[Major League Baseball rivalries|rivalries]] with other baseball franchises have changed throughout the years, with no one rivalry standing out. The most notable of them are with [[Midwestern United States|regional]] neighbors [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Chicago White Sox]], and these are notable for brawls and division races between them.

The others are with nearby teams such as the [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Minnesota Twins]] and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]&nbsp;– the latter a holdover from when the Tigers competed in the [[American League East|AL East]]. There are numerous Tigers fans throughout the state of [[Michigan]], northwestern [[Ohio]], [[Chicago]], southwestern [[Ontario]], as well as a small fan base in and around the [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] area, due in part to Detroit's proximity to these regions as well as the presence of the Tigers' [[Double-A (baseball)|AA]] affiliate [[Erie SeaWolves]] in northwestern Pennsylvania. The Detroit Tigers have their [[Triple A (baseball)|AAA]] affiliate [[Toledo Mud Hens]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]] in addition to their AA affiliate in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].  The cities of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Sarnia]], Ontario, have large fanbases of loyal Tigers fans. The Detroit Tigers continue to develop a strong and long line of baseball fans in Ontario; the majority of baseball fans in southwestern Ontario are considered Tigers loyalists.

Some are rivalries for first place during the regular season, with all American League teams until {{mlby|1969}}, with American League East teams from 1969 to {{mlby|1997}}, and with [[American League Central]] teams from {{mlby|1998}} until the present. Finally, some are rivalries with [[National League]] teams the Tigers have faced repeatedly in the [[World Series]], such as the [[Chicago Cubs]] (four times) and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (three times). Had the Cubs beaten the [[San Diego Padres]] in the [[1984 National League Championship Series|1984 NLCS]], they would have faced the Tigers for a fifth time in the World Series.

The [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], whom the Tigers faced in the [[1909 World Series]], is the team's "natural rival" in [[interleague play]]. It has become a popular rivalry for fans of both teams, due to Tigers ex-manager [[Jim Leyland]] having managed the Pirates from 1986–1996 (his two immediate successors in Pittsburgh, [[Gene Lamont]] and [[Lloyd McClendon]], served on Leyland's staff with the Tigers), the close proximity of Detroit to [[Pittsburgh]], and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] rivalry between the [[Detroit Red Wings]] (who, like the Tigers, are owned by [[Mike Ilitch]]) and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].

The Cleveland Indians have the [[Ohio Cup]] against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], but prefer the rivalry within the American League Central division with the Detroit Tigers or, as the fans and [[Tom Hamilton (broadcaster)|Tom Hamilton]] like to call them, "Motown Kitty Cats". The rivalry with the Indians came to a head when the Tigers played the Indians at [[Progressive Field]] in [[Cleveland]] on August 7, 2013, with the teams 1-2 in the [[American League Central|AL Central]] standings. Many Tigers fans who made the short trip to Cleveland started several "Let's go Tigers!" chants while the game was tied in the 9th inning. Irritated that their rivals were "taking over" their home stadium, many Indians fans decided to combat the chant with a "Detroit's bankrupt!" chant, in reference to the [[Detroit bankruptcy|city's 2013 bankruptcy]]. Footage of the game from [[SportsTime Ohio]] that had the chants clearly audible quickly went [[Viral video|viral]], with many baseball fans on [[social media]] criticizing the Indians fans for the chant due to the circumstances of [[Decline of Detroit|Detroit's financial situation]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Brookbank, Kimberlee Rohrer |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/sports/baseball/indians/video-indians-fans-detroits-bankrupt-chant-goes-viral |title=VIDEO: Indians fans' 'Detroit's bankrupt' chant goes viral |publisher=Newsnet5.com |date=2013-08-09 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> The Tigers ended up defeating the Indians 6-5 in 14 innings.<ref>{{cite news|author=AP |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2013/08/08/prince-fielder-detroit-tigers-cleveland-indians/2630465/ |title=Tigers outlast Indians in 14 innings |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

==Rally cry==
During the 1968 season, the team was cheered on by the phrase, "Go Get 'Em Tigers", which was made popular by a song of the same name written and recorded by [[Artie Fields]].<ref>http://m.mlb.com/news/article/1718667/</ref> The previous year, "Sock It To 'Em, Tigers!" was also popular in the city as the Tigers' close pennant race with Boston coincided with the release of the single "Sock It To Me, Baby!" by [[Mitch Ryder|Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels]].

During the 1984 World Championship Run, the team was cheered on to the well known cry, "''Bless You Boys,''" a phrase coined (in sarcasm) by Al Ackerman, a Detroit sports anchor legend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/history/bless_you_boys.jsp |title=Bless You Boys: A Celebration of the '84 Tigers |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

For the 2006 season, with the team going into July with the best record in baseball, the phrase "''Restore the Roar''" (a phrase first introduced in 1990 by then-[[Detroit Lions]] Head Coach [[Wayne Fontes]]) began to catch on, referring to the fact that the Tigers had not had a winning season since 1993 and seem to be returning to their former glory. Another 2006 phrase found in several Detroit commercials was "Who's your Tiger?" A popular rally cry for the [[Detroit Pistons]] has also been adapted for the Tigers, resulting in "Deee-troit Base-ball!"

A second rally cry also caught on in the Tigers' dugout in 2006. In a June game versus the [[New York Yankees]], Tigers pitcher [[Nate Robertson]] was featured on FSN Detroit's "Sounds of the Game", in which the TV station will mic a player on the bench or a coach. To appease the fans, Nate began to stuff [[Big League Chew]] bubble gum into his mouth, hoping to spark a late-inning rally. The trend caught on, with [[Jeremy Bonderman]], [[Zach Miner]] and [[Justin Verlander]] all chewing from time to time. The Tigers came back to tie the game, and the phrase "''It's Gum Time''" became the new "Rally-cap" for all of Tigertown.

Additionally, the chant of a local man, the late James Earl Van Horn,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/sports/james-van-horn-carved-out-niche-tigers-style |title=Known for 'Eat 'em up Tigers' shouts, James Van Horn carved out niche, Tigers style |date=July 27, 2013 |first=David |last=Solano |work=[[WXYZ-TV]] (ABC affiliate) }}</ref> who patrolled the streets around Comerica Park yelling out "Eat 'Em Up Tigers! Eat 'Em Up!", has begun to make its way into the park. The chant originated in 1968 when the Tigers won their third World Series, "Eat 'em Up" referring to the St. Louis Cardinals. People have even been seen wearing James Van Horn's homemade shirts with the cheer written on the back as far away as [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eatemupdetroit.com/James.html |title=Eat Em Up Detroit |publisher=Eat Em Up Detroit |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

During the 2006 playoffs the phrase "Team of Destiny" appeared on several homemade signs, and became a rallying cry for the post season. The signs featured the "Olde English" ([[blackletter]]) "D" in place of the standard "D" in destiny.

In 2009, the team used the phrase "Always a Tiger" as its slogan. This slogan remained in effect for 2010, even though the team lost many key players in the offseason. With the deaths of [[George Kell]], [[Mark Fidrych]], [[Ernie Harwell]] and [[Sparky Anderson]], the slogan has new appreciation, for players and personalities of the team's history.

In 2011, the slogan was switched back to Who's Your Tiger?

==Uniforms and logos==

{{See also|Major League Baseball#MLB uniforms}}

The Tigers have worn essentially the same home [[baseball uniform|uniform]] since 1934&nbsp;— solid white [[Jersey (sport)|jersey]] with navy blue [[piping (sewing)|piping]] down the front and an Old English "D" on the left chest, white pants, navy blue [[baseball cap|hat]] with a white letter D in the [[blackletter]] or ''textur''/''textualis'' typeface associated with [[Middle English|Middle]] and [[Early Modern English]] and popularly referred to as "Old English" even though it was not used for [[Old English|that language]]. When the Tigers are the visiting team, the D on their hats is orange and the word "DETROIT" appears across the shirt. A version of the team's blackletter D was first seen on Tigers uniforms in 1904, after using a simple block D in 1903. The blackletter D appeared frequently after that until being established in 1934.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2006-10-22-tigers-emblem_x.htm] USAToday.com, "Tigers' historic D emblematic of pride"</ref> In 1960, the Tigers changed their uniform to read "Tigers", but the change only lasted one season before the traditional uniform was reinstated.

In 1995, the Tigers introduced an [[Third jersey|alternate jersey]], solid navy blue with the team's alternate [[logo]] (a tiger stepping through the "D") on the chest. It was worn a few times and then abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Lukas |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070823 |title=ESPN.com: UniWatch, "One and done" |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-08-23 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>

The Tigers use slightly different versions of the initial logo on the cap and jersey.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/061023] ESPN.com Page 2 UniWatch, "The cap that killed the Cardinals?"</ref>

The Tigers changed their logo from the Old English "D" to the current cap logo.

'''Unique Characteristics of Tigers Uniform:'''
* The Tigers are the only team in Major League Baseball to have a color on their [[road (sports)|road]] uniforms that is not on their home uniforms (orange).<ref>{{cite web|last=Gagnier|first=Sean|title=It's time to change the Detroit Tigers' road uniforms|url=http://blog.detroitathletic.com/2012/07/02/its-time-to-change-the-tigers-uniforms/|publisher=Detroit Athletic Co.|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref>
* The Tigers are the only MLB team that does not wear [[batting practice]] jerseys during [[spring training]], instead electing to wear their normal uniforms in lieu of the colored tops that most teams wear for batting practice.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* The Tigers' uniforms have more belt loops than those of any other team, owing to the fact that their uniform pants do not feature the wide "tunnel" loops that appear on most baseball pants.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

* [[Ty Cobb]] is honored by his name on the wall at Comerica Park. Cobb played in an era where numbers were not worn on jerseys.<ref>See [[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers#Similar honors]].</ref>
* [[Ernie Harwell]] spent 42 years (in two stints) calling Tigers games on the radio.
*[[Al Kaline]] was also a TV color commentator for the Tigers from 1975–2002.
* Though their numbers are not officially retired, the names of [[Harry Heilmann]], [[Heinie Manush]], [[Hughie Jennings]], [[Sam Crawford]], [[Mickey Cochrane]] and [[George Kell]] are displayed at [[Comerica Park]] to honor their contributions to the Tiger organization. They also have all entered the Baseball Hall of Fame as Detroit Tigers, and their plaques in the Hall show them wearing the Tiger cap.
* [[Jackie Robinson]]'s number '''42''' was retired throughout [[Major League Baseball]] in 1997.

Players with retired numbers (and Ty Cobb) also have statues of themselves that sit behind their names, which are painted on the left-center field wall.

''National Avenue'', which runs behind the third-base stands at the Tigers' previous home [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], was renamed ''Cochrane Avenue'' for [[Mickey Cochrane]]. ''Cherry Street'', which runs behind the left-field stands at Tiger Stadium, was renamed ''Kaline Drive'' for Al Kaline.

While Cochrane was honored in 2000, the ceremony honoring Cochrane and Kell did not include the retirement of Cochrane's number '''3'''; the number 3 has not been retired for [[Dick McAuliffe]] or [[Alan Trammell]] either, although number '''3''' has only been issued three times since Trammell retired as a player after the 1996 season: to Trammell himself when he managed the Tigers from 2003–2005, [[Gary Sheffield]] (after Trammell approved of it from 2007 until he was released prior to the 2009 seasons). Sheffield had previously worn the numbers 1, 5, 10, and 11.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://beck.mlblogs.com/beck/2006/11/trammell_on_she.html |title=Beck's Blog: Trammell on Sheffield wearing No. 3 |publisher=Beck.mlblogs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> Presently the number is being worn by [[Ian Kinsler]], who was acquired after the 2013 season in a trade with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Prince Fielder]]. Similarly, the number '''1''' was last worn by [[Lou Whitaker]] in 1995, the year Whitaker retired as a player. It was not reissued again until [[2013 Detroit Tigers season|2013]], when mid-season acquisition [[José Iglesias (baseball)|José Iglesias]] requested it. The number '''47''', last worn by [[Jack Morris]], has also not been retired, but has not been issued since 1990, Morris' last year with the Tigers.
