==History==
In 1956, the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) was formed by Australia's major record companies.<ref name="AARM"/> It was replaced in 1983 by the Australian Recording Industry Association, which was established by the six major record companies operating in Australia, [[EMI]] (now part of [[Universal Music Group]]), [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], CBS (now known as [[Sony Music]]), RCA (now part of Sony Music), WEA (now known as [[Warner Music Group]]) and [[Polygram]] (now known as Universal). It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members. By 1997, the six major labels provided 90% of all recordings made in Australia.<ref name="AARM"/> ARIA is administered by a Board of Directors comprising senior executives from record companies, both large and small. As of October 2010, the directors were Denis Handlin ([[chairperson|chair]], CEO of Sony Music), George Ash (Universal Music), Mark Poston (EMI), Sebastian Chase (MGM Distribution), David Vodica (Rubber Records/Music) and Tony Harlow (WAR).<ref name="BoD"/>

Australian TV [[pop music]] show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' presented its own annual awards ceremony, [[Australian pop music awards#1981–1986: Countdown Music and Video Awards|''Countdown'' Music and Video Awards]], which was co-produced by Carolyn James (a.k.a. Carolyn Bailey) during 1981–1984 in collaboration with ARIA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wam.asn.au/wamifest05-media.htm |title=WAM Scene |publisher=Western Australia Music Industry Association Incorporated |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-12-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080720003842/http://www.wam.asn.au/wamifest05-media.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://countdown.interactive.net.au/the_show.asp |title=The ''Countdown'' Story |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-12-10 }}</ref><ref name="Quirks">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-quirks-that-made-it-work/2006/08/04/1154198331689.html |title=The quirks that made it work |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2008-12-10 }}</ref> ARIA provided peer voting for some awards, while ''Countdown'' provided coupons in the related ''Countdown Magazine'' for viewers to vote for populist awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.countdownmemories.com/magazines/pdfs/1986_01.pdf|title=''Countdown Magazine''|date=January 1986|format=PDF|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> At the 1985 ''Countdown'' awards ceremony, held on 14 April 1986, fans of [[INXS]] and [[Uncanny X-Men (band)|Uncanny X-Men]] scuffled during the broadcast and as a result ARIA decided to hold their own awards.<ref name="Quirks"/>

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) announced its own legal action against [[Kazaa]], alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two Sharman Networks executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.

In 2006, ARIA formed sponsorship deals with [[Motorola]] and [[Nova (radio network)|Nova]] and changed the appearance and conduct of the charting. Motorola took naming-rights sponsorship seeing the charts referred to in the media as the Motorola ARIA Charts. ARIA, have commented that as part of the same marketing printed charts would be reintroduced into media retailing shops and their website would be redesigned. As part of the deal Nova began broadcasting the charted singles in reverse order on a Sunday afternoon show before it was released on the ARIA charts website.

==ARIA Charts==
{{main|ARIA Charts}}
The '''ARIA Charts''' is the main Australian music sales charts, issued weekly by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The charts are a record of the highest selling [[Single (music)|singles]] and [[album]]s in various genres. All charts are compiled from data of both physical and digital sales from retailers in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-howare-chartsprepared.htm|title=How are the ARIA Charts prepared each week?|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>

==ARIA Awards==

===ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards===
The '''ARIA No.&nbsp;1 Chart Awards''' were established in 2002 to recognise Australian recording artists, who reached number one on the ARIA albums, singles and music DVDs charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIANo.1ChartAwards1July2005.htm|title=ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards (1 July 2005)|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>

===ARIA Music Awards===
{{main|ARIA Music Awards}}
The '''ARIA Music Awards''' is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] industry. The event has been held annually since 1987; it encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards known as the '''ARIA Awards''', as well as the Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Lifetime Achievement Awards and the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] (held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011).

==Criticisms==
Like most recording industry associations, ARIA has been criticised for fighting [[copyright infringement]] matters aggressively, although in Australia this has largely taken the form of aggressive advertising campaigns particularly in cinemas directly preceding movies. This criticism is stauncher in Australia due to the absence of an equivalent [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] or state crimes acts which clearly establish copyright infringement as a crime.
<!-- This is not entirely correct, as Australia does have an amendment act to the copyright act which covers digital intellectual property, someone with exact knowledge of this should add information regarding it -->

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) took legal action against [[Kazaa]], alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two [[Sharman Networks]] executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.

The ARIA charts have also been criticised as an easily manipulated market tool abused by aggressively marketed pop acts. "Gold" and "Platinum" ARIA awards are based on units shipped to retail outlets, not on how many of those units are sold to customers. A lukewarm album or single release can achieve Gold or Platinum status by flooding the market with copies, and if 99% are returned to the manufacturer that in no way affects the status of the award.

ARIA has been criticised by former ''[[Australian Idol]]'' judge and record producer [[Ian Dickson (music mogul)|Ian Dickson]] for a perceived intolerance of ''Australian Idol'' contestants, and a lack of nomination in the [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Bernard | last=Zuel | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/will-idol-graduates-ever-get-any-respect/2007/09/05/1188783289280.html?page=fullpage | title=Scarlet letters | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=2007-09-06 }}</ref>
