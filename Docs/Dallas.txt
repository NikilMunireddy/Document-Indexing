'''Dallas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|l|ə|s}}) is a major city in the [[Texas|state of Texas]] and is the largest urban center of the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|fourth most populous metropolitan area]] in the [[United States]]. The city proper ranks [[List of United States cities by population|ninth in the U.S.]] and [[List of cities in Texas by population|third in Texas]] after [[Houston]] and [[San Antonio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasalmanac.com/facts/ |title=Texas Almanac &#124; Texas State Historical Association &#124; Facts, Profile & Rank |publisher=TexasAlmanac.com |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/uscities_100.html |title=Largest 100 US cities |publisher=City Mayors |date=May 17, 2012 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref> The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]], of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the city are located in [[Collin County, Texas|Collin]], [[Denton County, Texas|Denton]], [[Kaufman County, Texas|Kaufman]], and [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall]] counties. According to the [[2010 United States Census]], the city had a population of 1,197,816. The [[United States Census Bureau]]'s estimate for the city's population increased to 1,300,092, {{As of|2016|lc=y}}.<ref name="2016 Pop Estimate"/>

The city is the largest economic center of the 12-county [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington]] metropolitan area (commonly referred to as DFW), which had a population of 7,102,796 as of July 1, 2015, representing growth in excess of 676,000 people since the 2010 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2015/index.html|title=Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX MSA Population|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref> In 2014, the metropolitan economy surpassed Washington, DC to become the fifth largest in the United States, with a 2014 real GDP over $504 billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Real GDP|url=http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1&acrdn=2#reqid=70&step=10&isuri=1&7003=200&7035=-1&7004=naics&7005=-1&7006=19100&7036=-1&7001=2200&7002=2&7090=70&7007=2014&7093=levels|publisher=US Dept of Commerce|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}</ref>  In 2013, the metropolitan area led the nation with the largest year-over-year increase in employment and advanced to become the fourth-largest employment center in the nation (behind [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]]) with more than three million non-farm jobs.<ref>{{cite web|title=DFW Area Employment Oct. 2013|url=http://www.bls.gov/ro6/fax/dfw_ces.htm|publisher=US Dept of Labor|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref> As of April 2016, the metropolitan job count has increased to 3,498,200 jobs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dallas-Plano-Irving Employment|url=http://www.tracer2.com/admin/uploadedpublications/1717_dallasmsa.pdf|publisher=Texas Workforce Commission|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ft.

See also [[Trinity River (Texas)]].</ref> Dallas and nearby [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] were developed due to the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to cotton, cattle, and later oil in North and [[East Texas]]. The construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] reinforced Dallas' prominence as a transportation hub with four major interstate highways converging in the city, and a fifth interstate loop around it. Dallas developed as a strong industrial and financial center, and a major [[inland port]], due to the convergence of major railroad lines, interstate highways, and the construction of [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]], one of the largest and [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest airports]] in the world.<ref name="handbook_dallas">{{Handbook of Texas |id=hdd01 |name=DALLAS, TX |author=Jackie McElhaney and Michael V.

Preceded by thousands of years of varying [[indigenous cultures]], the [[Caddo]] [[Native Americans of the United States|people]] inhabited the Dallas area before Spanish colonists claimed the territory of Texas in the 18th century as a part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. Later, France also [[French colonial empires|claimed the area]] but never established much settlement.

In 1819, the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] between the United States and Spain defined the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] as the northern boundary of [[New Spain]], officially placing the future location of Dallas well within Spanish territory.<ref name="bolton">{{cite book | last = Bolton | first = Herbert E. | authorlink = Herbert Eugene Bolton | title = Athanase de Mezieres and the Louisiana-Texas Frontier 1768–1780 | publisher=Arthur H Clark Company | year = 1914 | location = Cleveland}}</ref> The area remained under Spanish rule until 1821, when Mexico declared independence from Spain, and the area was considered part of the Mexican state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. In 1836, the [[Republic of Texas]], with majority Anglo-American settlers, gained independence from Mexico to become a distinct nation.<ref name="handbook_republic_of_texas">{{Handbook of Texas|id=mzr02|name=Republic of Texas|author=Joseph Milton Nance|retrieved=September 25, 2006}}</ref>

In 1839, [[Warren Angus Ferris]] surveyed the area around present-day Dallas. [[John Neely Bryan]] established a permanent settlement near the Trinity River named Dallas in 1841. The Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845 and [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] was established the following year. Dallas was formally incorporated as a city on February 2, 1856.

With construction of railroads, Dallas became a business and trading center, and was booming by the end of the 19th century. It became an industrial city, attracting workers from Texas, the South and the Midwest. The [[Praetorian Building]] of 15 stories, built in 1909, was the first [[skyscraper]] west of the Mississippi and the tallest building in Texas for some time. It marked the prominence of Dallas as a city. A racetrack for Thoroughbreds was built and their owners established the Dallas Jockey Club. Trotters raced at a track in [[Fort Worth]], where a similar Drivers Club was based. The rapid expansion of population increased competition for jobs and housing.

In 1921, the Mexican president Álvaro Obregón along with the former revolutionary general visited downtown Dallas' Mexican Park in [[Little Mexico]], the small park was located on the corner of Akard and Caruth Street, site of the current Fairmount Hotel.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Villasana|first1=Sol|title=Dallas's Little Mexico|publisher=Arcadia|isbn=978-0-7385-7979-5|page=71}}</ref> The small neighborhood of [[Little Mexico]] was home to the Hispanic population that had come to Dallas due to factors like the American Dream, better living conditions or the [[Mexican Revolution]].

On November 22, 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on Elm Street while his motorcade passed through [[Dealey Plaza]] in downtown Dallas. The upper two floors of the building from which [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] shot Kennedy, the [[Texas School Book Depository]], have been converted into a historical museum covering the former president's life and accomplishments.

==Geography==
Dallas is the [[county seat]] of [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]]. Portions of the city extend into neighboring [[Collin County, Texas|Collin]], [[Denton County, Texas|Denton]], [[Kaufman County, Texas|Kaufman]], and [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall]] counties. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of {{convert|999.3|km2|disp=flip}}, {{convert|881.9|km2|disp=flip}} of it being land and {{convert|117.4|km2|disp=flip}} of it (11.75%) water.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Dallas city, Texas| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> Dallas makes up one-fifth of the much larger urbanized area known as the [[Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex]], in which one quarter of all Texans live.

Further east, in the southeast quadrant of the city, is the large neighborhood of [[Pleasant Grove, Dallas|Pleasant Grove]]. Once an independent city, it is a collection of mostly lower-income residential areas stretching to [[Seagoville, Texas|Seagoville]] in the southeast. Though a city neighborhood, Pleasant Grove is surrounded by undeveloped land on all sides. Swampland and wetlands separating it from South Dallas will in the future be part of the [[Great Trinity Forest]],<ref name="The Great Trinity Forest-Dallas">{{cite web | title=The Great Trinity Forest-Dallas | work=The Great Trinity Forest | publisher=City of Dallas Trinity River Corridor Project

Dallas is surrounded by many suburbs; three [[enclave]]s are within the city boundaries—[[Cockrell Hill, Texas|Cockrell Hill]], [[Highland Park, Texas|Highland Park]], and [[University Park, Texas|University Park]].

===Topography===
{{Main|Geology of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex}}
Dallas and its surrounding area are mostly flat; the city itself lies at elevations ranging from {{convert|450|to|550|ft|m|0}}. The western edge of the Austin Chalk Formation, a [[limestone]] [[escarpment]] (also known as the "White Rock Escarpment"), rises {{convert|230|ft|m|0}} and runs roughly north-south through Dallas County. South of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], the uplift is particularly noticeable in the neighborhoods of [[Oak Cliff]] and the adjacent cities of [[Cockrell Hill, Texas|Cockrell Hill]], [[Cedar Hill, Texas|Cedar Hill]], Mesquite, [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]], and [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. Marked variations in terrain are also found in cities immediately to the west in [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]] surrounding [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], as well as along [[Turtle Creek (Dallas County, Texas)|Turtle Creek]] north of Downtown.

[[File:Dallas Arboretum Seasons.jpg|thumb|400px|right|[[Dallas Arboretum]]]]
Dallas, like many other cities, was founded along a river. The city was founded at the location of a "white rock crossing" of the Trinity River, where it was easier for wagons to cross the river in the days before ferries or bridges. The [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], though not usefully navigable, is the major waterway through the city. Its path through Dallas is paralleled by [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] along the [[Stemmons Corridor]], then south alongside the western portion of [[Downtown Dallas|Downtown]] and past [[south Dallas]] and [[Pleasant Grove, Dallas|Pleasant Grove]], where the river is paralleled by [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|Interstate 45]] until it exits the city and heads southeast towards [[Houston]]. The river is flanked on both sides by {{convert|50|ft|m|0}} tall earthen [[levee]]s to protect the city from frequent floods.<ref>{{cite web| author=John N.

Since it was rerouted in the late 1920s, the river has been little more than a drainage ditch within a floodplain for several miles above and below downtown Dallas, with a more normal course further upstream and downstream, but as Dallas began shifting towards postindustrial society, public outcry about the lack of aesthetic and recreational use of the river ultimately gave way to the [[Trinity River Project]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Discover The Trinity-Dallas | work=Discover The Trinity | publisher=Discoverthetrinity.org | accessdate=September 12, 2009 | url=http://www.discoverthetrinity.org/ }}</ref> which was begun in the early 2000s and is scheduled to be completed in the 2010s. If the project materializes fully, it promises improvements to the riverfront in the form of man-made lakes, new park facilities and trails, and transportation upgrades.

The project area will reach for over {{convert|20|mi|km}} in length within the city, while the overall geographical land area addressed by the Land Use Plan is approximately {{convert|44000|acre|km2}} in size—about 20% of the land area in Dallas.
Green space along the river will encompass approximately {{convert|10000|acre|km2}}, making it one of the largest and diverse urban parks in the world.<ref>{{cite web| author=Trinity River Corridor Project Management Office|title = Trinity River Corridor Project Frequently Asked Questions|url =http://www.trinityrivercorridor.org/html/faqs.html | accessdate =October 19, 2006}}</ref>

[[White Rock Lake]], a reservoir constructed at the beginning of the 20th century, is Dallas' other significant water feature. The lake and surrounding park is a popular destination for boaters, rowers, joggers, and bikers, as well as visitors seeking peaceful respite from the city at the {{convert|66|acre|m2|-3|sing=on}} [[Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden]], located on the lake's eastern shore. [[White Rock Creek]] feeds into White Rock Lake, and then exits on to the Trinity River southeast of downtown Dallas. Trails along White Rock Creek are part of the extensive Dallas County Trails System.

[[Bachman Lake]], just northwest of [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field Airport]], is a smaller lake also popularly used for recreation. Northeast of the city is [[Lake Ray Hubbard]], a vast {{convert|22745|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} reservoir located in an extension of Dallas surrounded by the suburbs of [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], [[Rowlett, Texas|Rowlett]], [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]], and [[Sunnyvale, Texas|Sunnyvale]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Bobby Farquhar and Mark McDonald | title = Lake Ray Hubbard | url = http://www.rtis.com/reg/lakes/rayhubba.htm | work=Set the Hook Guide to Lone Star Lakes and Lunkers | accessdate =August 5, 2009}}</ref> To the west of the city is [[Mountain Creek Lake]], once home to the [[Naval Air Station Dallas]] ([[Hensley Field]]) and a number of defense aircraft manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web | title = NAS Dallas / Hensley Field | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/dallas.htm | accessdate =August 5, 2009 | publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref> [[North Lake (Dallas County, Texas)|North Lake]], a small body of water in an extension of the city limits surrounded by [[Irving, Texas|Irving]] and [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]], initially served as a water source for a nearby power plant but is now being targeted for redevelopment as a recreational lake due to its proximity to [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]], a plan that the lake's neighboring cities oppose.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Aasen |first=Eric |publication-date=May 18, 2005 |title=Foes say North Lake development a threat to lifestyle | periodical=Dallas Morning News |place=Coppell |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Dallas}}
[[File:Kidd Springs Park 2.jpg|thumb|Spring in an [[Oak Cliff]] park|269x269px]]
Dallas has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''), though it is located in a region that also tends to receive warm, dry winds from the north and west in the summer, bringing temperatures to the {{convert|100|°F|0}} mark about 20 days annually, the majority in August, and [[heat indices]] easily breaking {{convert|110|°F|0}}. When only temperature itself is accounted for, the north central Texas region where Dallas is located is one of the hottest in the United States during the summer months, usually trailing only the [[Mojave Desert]] basin of [[Arizona]], southern [[Nevada]], and [[Southern California|southeastern]] California. Dewpoints in the summer range from {{convert|66.5|to|67.6|°F|0}}.<ref name="NOAA Online"/>

Winters in Dallas are generally mild to warm, with a normal daily average temperature in January of {{convert|47.0|°F|1}} with sharp swings in temperature as strong cold fronts known as "[[Texas Norther|Blue Norther]]s" pass through the Dallas region, forcing daytime highs below the {{convert|50|°F|0}} mark for several days at a time and often between days with high temperatures above {{convert|80|°F|0}}. Snow accumulation is seen in the city in about 70% of winter seasons, and snowfall generally occurs 1–2 days out of the year for a seasonal average of {{convert|1.5|in|cm}}. Some areas in the region, however, receive more than that, while other areas receive negligible snowfall or none at all.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/CLIMO/dfw/normals/dfwann.html DFW Climate]. Retrieved on March 26, 2006. {{wayback|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/CLIMO/dfw/normals/dfwann.html |date=20150814062906 }}</ref>
[[File:Craddock Park.jpg|left|thumb|265x265px|Craddock Park in [[Oak Lawn, Dallas|Oak Lawn]]]]
A few times each winter in Dallas, warm and humid air from the south will override cold, dry air, resulting in [[freezing rain]] or ice and causing disruptions in the city if the roads and highways become slick. Temperatures reaching {{convert|70|°F|0}} on average occur on at least 4 days each winter month. Dallas averages 26 annual nights at or below freezing,<ref name="NOAA Online">{{cite web|url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=fwd|title = NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate = November 30, 2012}}</ref> with the winter of 1999–2000 holding the all-time record as having the fewest freezing nights, with 14. During this same span of 15 years,{{specify|date=August 2013}} the temperature in the region has only twice dropped below {{convert|15|°F|°C|0}}, though it will generally fall below {{convert|20|°F|0}} in most (67%) years.<ref name="NOAA Online"/> In sum, extremes and variations in winter weather are more readily seen in Dallas and Texas as a whole than along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, due to the state's location in the interior of the North American continent. The lack of any mountainous terrain to the north leaves it open to the sweep of Arctic weather systems.

[[File:SMU - Blanton Snow.jpg|thumb|[[Jack S. Blanton|Laura Lee Blanton Building]] at [[Southern Methodist University]] covered in snow|266x266px]]
Spring and autumn bring pleasant weather to the area. Vibrant [[wildflower]]s (such as the [[bluebonnet (plant)|bluebonnet]], [[Castilleja|Indian paintbrush]] and other [[flora (plants)|flora]]) bloom in spring and are planted around the highways throughout Texas.<ref>[http://www.dot.state.tx.us/ TXDOT] – [http://www.dot.state.tx.us/travel/flora_conditions.htm Wildflower and Fall Foliage]</ref> Springtime weather can be [[severe weather|quite volatile]], but temperatures themselves are mild. The weather in Dallas is also generally pleasant from late September to early December and on many winter days. Autumn often brings more storms and tornado threat, but usually fewer and less severe than in spring.

Each spring, cold fronts moving south from the North will collide with warm, humid air streaming in from the [[Gulf Coast]], leading to severe [[thunderstorm]]s with [[lightning]], torrents of rain, [[hail]], and occasionally, [[tornado]]es. Over time, tornadoes have probably been the biggest natural threat to the city, as it is located near the heart of [[Tornado Alley]].

The [[USDA|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] places Dallas in [[USDA plant hardiness zone|Plant Hardiness Zone 8a]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-texas-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php |title=Texas USDA Hardiness Zone Map |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Ramon|last=Jordan |url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/hzm-sm1.html |title=Plant Hardiness Zone Map: South-Midwest US |publisher=Usna.usda.gov |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref> However, mild winter temperatures in the past 15 to 20 years have encouraged the horticulture of some cold-sensitive plants such as ''[[Washingtonia filifera]]'' and ''[[Washingtonia robusta]]'' [[palm tree|palms]]. According to the [[American Lung Association]], Dallas has the 12th highest air pollution among U.S. cities, ranking it behind Los Angeles and [[Houston]].<ref>[http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLUK9O0E&b=50752#graph6 Lungusa.com].

Dallas is a major destination for Mexican immigrants. The southwestern portion of the city, particularly [[Oak Cliff]] is chiefly inhabited by Hispanic residents. The southeastern portion of the city [[Pleasant Grove, Dallas, Texas|Pleasant Grove]] is chiefly inhabited by black and Hispanic residents, while the [[South Dallas|southern portion]] of the city is predominantly black. The West and East sides of the city are predominantly Hispanic; [[Garland]] also has a large Spanish speaking population.

The Dallas-Fort-Worth Metroplex has an estimated 70,000 Russian-speakers, mostly immigrants from the former [[Soviet Bloc]]. Included in this population are Russians, Russian Jews, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Moldavians, Uzbek, Kirghiz, and others. The Russian-speaking population of Dallas has continued to grow in the sector of “American husbands-Russian wives”. Russian DFW has its own newspaper [http://DallasTelegraph.com The Dallas Telegraph].

About half of Dallas's population was born outside of Texas. Many residents have migrated to the city from other parts of the country, particularly the [[Midwest]], [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], and California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellodallas.com/Social.cfm |title=Dallas Texas Social and demographic information |publisher=Hellodallas.com |date=December 30, 2004 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100628081816/http://www.hellodallas.com/Social.cfm |archivedate=June 28, 2010 }}</ref>

[[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Baptist]], and Presbyterian churches are prominent in many neighborhoods and anchor two of the city's major private universities ([[Southern Methodist University]] and [[Dallas Baptist University]]). Dallas is also home to two evangelical seminaries, the [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] and [[Criswell College]] and many Bible schools including [[Christ For The Nations Institute]].

The Christian creationist apologetics group [[Institute for Creation Research]] is headquartered in Dallas.

Dallas is called "Prison Ministry Capital of the World" by prison ministry community. It is a home for [[International Network of Prison Ministries]], Coalition of Prison Evangelists, Bill Glass Champions for Life, for more than 30 years to Chaplain Ray's [http://chaplainray.com/ International Prison Ministry], and for more than [http://prisonministry.net/app/Mins/event/showCity/country/United%20States/state/Texas/city/Dallas.html 60 other prison ministries].

The Catholic Church is also a significant organization in the Dallas area and operates the [[University of Dallas]], a liberal-arts university in the Dallas suburb of Irving.

Furthermore, a large [[Muslim community]] exists in the north and northeastern portions of Dallas, as well as in the northern Dallas suburbs. The oldest mosque in Texas is located in Denton, about {{convert|40|mi}} north of Downtown Dallas. The oldest mosque in Dallas is Masjid Al-Islam located just south of Downtown Dallas.

Dallas also has a large Buddhist community. Immigrants from [[Thailand]], Laos, [[Cambodia]], Vietnam, [[Nepal]], Tibet, Japan, China, Taiwan, and [[Sri Lanka]] have all contributed to the Buddhist population, which is concentrated in the northern suburbs of [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], [[Plano, Texas|Plano]] and [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]].

For the atheist, agnostic, nonbeliever and strictly spiritual individuals, there is "The Winter SolstiCelebration". After 15 years, this celebration has become a minor Dallas cultural tradition for the "spiritual but not religious" people of North Texas.

In its beginnings, Dallas relied on farming, neighboring [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]'s [[Fort Worth Stockyards|Stockyards]], and its prime location on Native American trade routes to sustain itself. Dallas' key to growth came in 1873 with the building of multiple [[Rail road|rail]] lines through the city. As Dallas grew and technology developed, cotton became its boon and by 1900 Dallas was the largest inland cotton market in the world, becoming a leader in [[cotton gin]] machinery manufacturing. By the early 1900s Dallas was a hub for economic activity all over the Southern United States and was selected in 1914 as the seat of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Eleventh Federal Reserve District]]. By 1925 Texas churned out more than ⅓ of the nation's cotton crop, with 31% of Texas cotton produced within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} [[radius]] of Dallas. In the 1930s petroleum was discovered east of Dallas near [[Kilgore, Texas]]. Dallas' proximity to the discovery put it immediately at the center of the nation's petroleum market. Petroleum discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], and [[Oklahoma]] in the following years further solidified Dallas' position as the hub of the market.<ref name="paynechapV">{{cite book|last=Payne |first=Darwin |title= Dallas, an illustrated history |year=1982 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Woodland Hills, California |isbn= 0-89781-034-1 |pages=189–221 |chapter= Chapter VII: The Emergence of "Big D"}}</ref>

The end of World War II left Dallas seeded with a nexus of communications, engineering, and production talent by companies such as Collins Radio Corporation. Decades later, the telecommunications and information revolutions still drive a large portion of the local economy. The city is sometimes referred to as the heart of "[[Silicon Prairie]]" because of a high concentration of telecommunications companies in the region, the epicenter of which lies along the ''[[Telecom Corridor]]'' located in [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], a northern suburb of Dallas. The Corridor is home to more than 5,700 companies<ref>[http://www.telecomcorridor.com/ Telecom Corridor website].

In the 1980s Dallas was a real estate hotbed, with the increasing metropolitan population bringing with it a demand for new housing and office space. Several of [[Downtown Dallas]]' largest buildings are the fruit of this boom, but over-speculation, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and an oil bust brought the 80's building boom to an end for Dallas as well as its city sister Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth.  However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses as well as the construction of new office and residential towers.  The opening of Klyde Warren Park, built across Woodall Rodgers Freeway seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District so that both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas.

The residential real estate market in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]] has not only been resilient but has once again returned to a boom status. Dallas and the greater metro have been leading the nation in apartment construction and net leasing with rents reaching all time highs.  Single family home sales, whether pre-owned or new construction, along with home price appreciation are leading the nation.<ref name="Economic Snapshot">{{cite web|title=DFW Apartment Boom Hits Region|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2015/07/01/dfw-apartment-boom-hits-region-with-all-time.html|publisher=Dallas Business Journal|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Dallas Residential Real Estate">{{cite web|title=Dallas Area Home Price Growth Dwarfs National Gains|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/business/residential-real-estate/20150630-dallas-area-home-price-growth-dwarfs-national-gains.ece|publisher=Dallas Morning News|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>

A sudden drop in the price of oil, starting in mid-2014 and accelerating throughout 2015, has not affected Dallas and its greater metro due to the highly diversified nature of its economy.  Dallas, and the DFW metro, continue to see strong demand for housing, apartment and office leasing, shopping center space, warehouse and industrial space with overall job growth remaining very robust.  Oil dependent cities and regions have felt significant effects from the downturn but Dallas growth has continued unabated, strengthening in 2015.  Significant national headquarters relocations to the area (as exemplified by Toyota's decision to leave California and establish its new North American headquarters in the Dallas region) coupled with significant expansions of regional offices for a variety of corporations and along with company relocations to downtown Dallas are helping drive the current boom in the Dallas economy.

Dallas has many hospitals and a number of medical research facilities within its city limits. One major research center is the Dallas Medical District with the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas|UT Southwestern Medical Center]] in the [[Stemmons Corridor]], along with the affiliated [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School|UT Southwestern Medical School]]. The health care complex includes within its bounds [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]], [[Children's Medical Center (Dallas)|Children's Medical Center]], William P. Clements University Hospital (formerly St. Paul University Hospital), and the Zale Lipshy University Hospital.

Dallas also has a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] hospital in the southern portion of the city, the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The center is home to a [[Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy]] (CMOP), part of an initiative by the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide mail-order prescriptions to veterans using computerization at strategic locations throughout the United States.

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transportation in Dallas}}

Like many other major cities in the United States, the primary mode of local transportation in Dallas is the automobile, though efforts have been made to increase the availability of alternative modes of transportation, including the construction of light rail lines, biking and walking paths, wide sidewalks, a trolley system, and buses.[[Walk Score]] ranked Dallas the twenty third most walkable of fifty largest cities in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

====Highways====
[[File:High Five.jpg|thumb|alt=High Five Interchange in Dallas.|The [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]] and I-635 interchange, commonly known as the [[High Five Interchange]].|333x333px]]

Dallas is at the confluence of four major [[interstate highway system|interstate highways]]—Interstates [[Interstate 20 (Texas)|20]], [[Interstate 30 (Texas)|30]], [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|35E]], and [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|45]]. The Dallas area freeway system is set up in the popular [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke]] system, shaped much like a wagon wheel. Starting from the center of the city, a small freeway loop surrounds Downtown, followed by the [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|Interstate 635]] loop about {{convert|10|mi|0}} outside Downtown, and ultimately the tolled [[President George Bush Turnpike]]. Inside these freeway loops are other [[boulevard]]- and [[parkway]]-style loops, including [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Loop 12]] and [[Belt Line Road (Texas)|Belt Line Road]]. Another beltway around the city upwards of {{convert|45|mi|km|0}} from Downtown is under plan in Collin County.

Radiating out of Downtown Dallas' freeway loop are the spokes of the area's highway system—Interstates 30, 35E, and 45, [[U.S. Highway 75 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 75]], [[U.S. Highway 175 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 175]], [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|State Spur 366]], the [[Dallas North Tollway]], [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway 114]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Texas|U.S. Highway 80]], and [[U.S. Highway 67 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 67]]. Other major highways around the city include [[Texas State Highway 183|State Highway 183]] and [[Texas State Highway Spur 408|State Spur 408]].

The recently completed interchange at the intersection of Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ([[Interstate 635 (Texas)|Interstate 635]]) and [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]] (U.S. Highway 75) contains 5 stacks and is aptly called the [[High Five Interchange]]. It is currently one of the few 5-level interchange in Dallas and is one of the largest freeway interchanges in the United States.

[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) is the Dallas-area public transportation authority, providing rail, buses and [[HOV]] lanes to commuters. DART began operating the first [[light rail]] system in Texas in 1996 and is now the largest operator of light rail in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irvingblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/12/dart-becomes-nations-largest-l.html |title=DART becomes nation’s largest light rail system today &#124; Irving Blog |publisher=Irvingblog.dallasnews.com |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref> Today, the system is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|seventh-busiest]] light rail system in the country with approximately 55 stations on 72 miles of light rail, and 10 stations on 35 miles of commuter rail.<ref>[http://dart.org/about/expansion/otherprojects.asp].

The {{DART R}} travels through [[Oak Cliff]], [[South Dallas]], [[downtown Dallas|Downtown]], [[Uptown Dallas|Uptown]], [[North Dallas]], [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]] and [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], while the {{DART B}} goes through Oak Cliff, Downtown, Uptown, [[East Dallas]], [[Lake Highlands]], and [[Garland, Texas|Garland]]. The {{DART R|style=nl}} and {{DART B|style=nl}} lines are conjoined between [[8th & Corinth Station]] in Oak Cliff through [[Mockingbird Station]] in [[North Dallas]]. The two lines service [[Cityplace Station]], the only subway station in the Southwest.

The Orange Line initially operated as a peak-service line providing extra capacity on portions of the Green and Red Lines ([[Bachman Station]] on the Green Line, through the Downtown transit mall, to [[Parker Road Station]] on the Red Line making a "U"-shape). However, the first stage of the Orange Line is complete, extending its west end from Bachman to [[Belt Line Station]] in Irving.[[File:St. Paul Station September 2015 6.jpg|left|thumb|310x310px|DART train in [[Downtown Dallas|Downtown]].]]The second and final phase was scheduled to open in August 2014 and will provide [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]] with rail service.
