'''Crewe Alexandra Football Club''' is a professional [[association football]] club based in the town of [[Crewe]], [[Cheshire]], England. Nicknamed The Railwaymen because of the town's [[Crewe Works|links with the rail industry]], they play at [[Gresty Road]]. The team compete in [[Football League Two|League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]].

The club was formed in 1877 and named after [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]].<ref>"1877 – A Football Club is formed in Crewe, as a separate organisation from the successful Crewe Cricket Club. They take the name 'Alexandra' after Princess Alexandra": from [http://www.crewealex.net/news/article/potted-history-255195.aspx the club's official website]</ref><ref>Seddon, Peter (2004), ''Football Talk: The language and folklore of the world's greatest game'', Chrysalis Books, London (ISBN 1861056834), p.174.</ref> They were founding members of the [[Football League Second Division]] in 1892, but only lasted four years in the League. Since re-entering the competition in 1921, they have mostly remained in the lower divisions. Crewe's only major honour is the [[Football League Trophy]] which they won in [[2013 Football League Trophy Final|2013]]. They have also won several minor trophies, including the [[Cheshire Premier Cup]] and the [[Cheshire Senior Cup]].

In recent decades, the club has been associated with manager [[Dario Gradi]] whose 24-year tenure between 1983 and 2007 made him the longest-serving manager in English football; he had a further two-year spell in the role from 2009 to 2011. Gradi is known for focusing on [[youth system|youth development]] and promoting attractive, technical football. Notable players brought through the Crewe youth system include former internationals [[Rob Jones (footballer born 1971)|Rob Jones]], [[Neil Lennon]], [[Danny Murphy (footballer born 1977)|Danny Murphy]], [[Seth Johnson]] and [[Dean Ashton]]. Other notable players to have made their name at Crewe in that time include [[Geoff Thomas (footballer born 1964)|Geoff Thomas]], [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] and [[Robbie Savage]].

==History==
===Early years (1877–1921)===
Crewe Alexandra were formed in 1877 as Crewe Football Club, separate from the successful Crewe Cricket Club. They were based at the [[Alexandra Recreation Ground]] and played their first match against North Staffs that same year, a match that ended 1–1. In 1883, Crewe Alexandra's first match in the [[FA Cup]] was against Scottish club [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] of Glasgow, losing 10–0.<ref>{{cite news|title=English Challenge Cup. Queen's Park (Glasgow) v. Crewe|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000250/18831008/056/0004|accessdate=5 February 2015|work=Sheffield Daily Telegraph|date=8 October 1883|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}</ref> In [[FA Cup 1887–88|1888]], the club reached the [[FA Cup semi-finals]], defeating [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] en route, before going out to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. Crewe were one of the founding members of the Second Division in 1892, having previously been members of the [[Football Alliance]], but lost their league status in 1896 after only four seasons. The club left the Alexandra Recreation Ground shortly before the end of the [[1895–96 Football League|1895–96 season]], and after playing at a number of different venues, including in nearby [[Sandbach]], they moved to the first Gresty Road ground in 1897. In 1906 the current [[Gresty Road]] ground was rebuilt to the west of the original site.<ref name=UD>Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p62, ISBN 0954783042</ref>

===1921–1983===
[[File:CreweAlexandraFC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of table positions of Crewe Alexandra in the Football League.]]Crewe rejoined the Football League in 1921, during which season a record crowd of 15,102 packed into [[Gresty Road]] to watch Crewe entertain local rivals [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], a game The Potters won 2–0. Crewe earned their first honours by winning the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1936 and 1937, before being barred from entering (not least since they were not in [[Wales]]). In 1936, Herbert Swindells scored his 100th League goal for Crewe Alexandra. He went on to score 126&nbsp;goals for the club, a record that still stands today.

1955 saw Crewe embark on a sequence where they did not win away from home for 56 matches. The dismal run ended with a 1–0 win at [[Southport F.C.|Southport]]. One of Crewe's most famous matches took place against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] in the [[FA Cup]]. A new record attendance of 20,000 saw lowly Crewe hold Spurs to a 2–2 draw. [[Bert Llewellyn]] and [[Merfyn Jones (footballer)|Merfyn Jones]] scored for the Railwaymen. Tottenham convincingly won the replay 13–2, which remains a record defeat for the club. Llewellyn and Nev Coleman scored for Crewe.

1961 saw Crewe's most notable win in their history, [[Jimmy McGuigan]]'s side defeated [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 2–1 in the FA Cup at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. That particular Chelsea side contained the former Crewe player [[Frank Blunstone]] as well as [[Jimmy Greaves]], [[Peter Bonetti]] and [[Terry Venables]]. The Crewe goals were scored by Billy Stark and [[Barrie Wheatley]]. Spurs won by a more modest 5–1 in the Fourth Round. In 1963, Crewe gained promotion for the first time in their history with a 1–0 win over [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]]. [[Frank Lord]] became the local hero, scoring the only goal in front a crowd of 9,807. Lord also holds the record for most hat-tricks for the club, eight during his time at Gresty Road.

In the 1964–1965 season, [[Terry Harkin]] scored a record 35 league goals for Crewe. 1977 saw [[Tommy Lowry]] play his record-breaking 475th and last game for the Railwaymen. 1979 would see manager Warwick Rimmer's most notable signing when [[Bruce Grobbelaar]] joined Crewe and played his first match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. During the season he scored from the penalty spot against [[York City F.C.|York City]] and kept eight clean-sheets in his 24 matches played. In the same year the club went a record 15 matches without winning at Gresty Road.

The period from the 1950s to the early 1980s was generally not a successful time for the club, and few would have argued with [[Michael Palin]]'s comment, in the 1979 [[BBC]] ''Great Railway Journeys of the World'' documentary when, in a shot over Gresty Road filmed from the roof of the adjacent Rail House he described Crewe as "like those other [[railway town]]s, [[Swindon]] and [[Doncaster]], possessed of a football team which is perpetually propping up the bottom of the Fourth Division". Indeed, between 1894 and 1982, Crewe finished in last place in the Football League eight times, more than any other league club.

Crewe's fans were the first to sing the famous football song "[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]" (with lyrics that do not quite match the [[Rodgers and Hart]] original).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Features/2011/March/Blue-Moon-significance|title=Blue Moon, the significance of the song to Man City fans – Manchester City FC|work=Manchester City FC}}</ref> The song was a response to the gloomy days at Gresty Road during the mid-1900s, and reflects the colour of the Alex away strip, which only the more steadfast and determined fans would travel to see. The song has since been sung by fans of Manchester City, although their rendition was highlighting the colour of their strips as opposed to simply copying Crewe's supporters which has been a trending ideology amongst Crewe followers.

===Gradi era (1983–2007)===
In June 1983, Crewe appointed [[Milan]]-born [[Dario Gradi]] as manager. At that time, Crewe had again just avoided being voted out of the Football League. Gradi quickly gained a reputation for developing young talent, allowing [[Steve Walters (footballer)|Steve Walters]] to become the youngest ever player to pull on a Crewe shirt: aged just 16 years and 119 days he played against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on 6 May. Gradi's efforts paid off in 1989 when Crewe won promotion to the Third Division. They went back down two years later, but were promoted again in 1994. In the same year, [[Neil Lennon]] became the first Crewe Alexandra player to gain an International cap for 60 years when he was selected to play for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. Gradi then led his charges to Division One in 1997, after victory over [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in the Division Two [[1997 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-off final]], and kept his team there until 2002, despite a club income on which many more lowly clubs could not survive. Meanwhile, Gradi celebrated his 1,000th game in charge of Crewe on 20 November 2001&nbsp;– an away fixture at Carrow Road, the home of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].

After one season in the [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] the club were promoted back to Division One at the end of the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03]] season, having finished in second place; the first time the club had finished in the top two of any division, and the club prepared for life in Division 1.

Although managing to retain their place in the Division 1 in the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] season, at the start of the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]] season they were rated one of the likeliest teams to be relegated from the newly renamed 'Championship'. In the event, they put in a good showing in the first half of the season; comfortably in the top half of the table, but after selling [[Dean Ashton]] to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] for a record £3 million in the January 2005 transfer window, Crewe failed to win any more games until the final match of the season, when they defeated [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] 2–1 and narrowly escaped relegation on goal difference. The following year they were not so fortunate. Despite a good run towards the end of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06 season]], they were relegated to League 1.

Crewe were named the "Most Admired Club" in the 2006 Football League Awards, sponsored by ''The League Paper'' and ''[[FourFourTwo|FourFourTwo Magazine]]''.<ref>''Crewe Delighted With Award'' [http://www.crewealex.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10414~798054,00.html CreweAlex.premiumtv.co.uk]. Retrieved 4 July 2006</ref>

====Player development====
During Gradi's tenure the club gained a reputation for its [[Youth system|youth policy]], and earned official status as an FA Youth Academy. By concentrating on developing its own players the club remained profitable (a rarity in lower division football at the time) by selling them on after they have gained experience with Crewe. The Academy is known to stress technical excellence, which accords with Gradi's aim to have his sides play attractive, passing football.

Players who passed through the ranks at Crewe include the England international players [[Geoff Thomas (footballer born 1964)|Geoff Thomas]] and [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]], Welsh international [[Robbie Savage]], and Northern Ireland internationals [[Neil Lennon]] and [[Steve Jones (footballer born 1976)|Steve Jones]] (Platt was the most successful, totalling more than £20 million in transfers and captaining the England team). All these were youngsters signed from other clubs, but Gradi also had considerable success in nurturing Crewe's own trainees&nbsp;– most notably full England internationals [[Rob Jones (footballer born 1971)|Rob Jones]], [[Danny Murphy (footballer born 1977)|Danny Murphy]], [[Seth Johnson]] and [[Dean Ashton]] and Wales international [[David Vaughan (footballer)|David Vaughan]].

In 2004 the BBC's ''Football Focus'' asked fans of all professional football clubs in England and Scotland to vote for their cult hero. For Crewe, Seth Johnson won with 59% of the vote; Danny Murphy came second with 33%, and [[Craig Hignett]] third with 8%.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/football_focus/4099295.stm Crewe's Cult Heroes]. Accessed 5 March 2014.</ref>

===2007–2009===
By the summer of 2007, Gradi was the longest-serving manager in English league football; he had completed 24 years in sole charge of the club, although assistant manager Neil Baker took temporary charge between 22 September and 17 October 2003 while Gradi underwent heart surgery (Crewe only managed one point while Baker was in charge). On 20 April 2007 Crewe Alexandra announced that, from 1 July 2007, Gradi would take up a new role as the club's Technical Director while gradually allowing newly appointed first-team coach [[Steve Holland (football)|Steve Holland]] control of the team.

Holland's first season in this role, [[2007-08 in English football|2007–08]], was a disappointment as the club narrowly avoided relegation after finishing 20th with 50 points.<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080406153716/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_2/table/default.stm|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_2/table/default.stm|title=Coca-Cola Football League One: Table|work=BBC News|archivedate=6 April 2008|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref> That summer Holland spent half a million pounds on new signings, including [[Calvin Zola]], [[Anthony Elding]] and goalkeepers [[Steve Collis]] and [[Adam Legzdins]], while striker [[Nicky Maynard]] joined [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] for a club record fee of £2.25 million. However, despite a positive pre-season, including a win over Premiership club [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], Crewe took only nine points from their first 16 games.

Following pressure from fans, the board relieved Steve Holland of his duties as first team coach in November 2008, and re-appointed Gradi as [[caretaker manager]]. Gradi's first game back in charge was a 3–0 defeat at home to local rivals [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. On 24 December 2008 the [[Iceland]]ic former manager of local rivals Stoke City, [[Guðjón Þórðarson|Gudjon Thordarson]], was appointed as Holland's successor, though Gradi remained in charge of the team for a further six days before resuming his Technical Director role. Thordarson's first game in charge was a 2–2 draw away at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the [[FA Cup]] 3rd round, but although Thordarson received the Manager of the Month award for February, the team suffered a poor end-of-season run, not winning for 10 games, and were relegated to [[League Two]]. On 18 June 2009, [[Steve Davis (footballer born 1965)|Steve Davis]] was appointed Assistant Manager to [[Guðjón Þórðarson|Gudjon Thordarson]]. Davis left his role as manager of [[Nantwich Town F.C.|Nantwich Town]], where he spent five successful years, gaining two promotions. Davis replaced former assistant Neil Baker, who was moved to a new scouting role within the club.

===Return of Dario Gradi (2009–2011)===
On 2 October 2009, after nine months in charge, Thordarson was sacked after a run of poor results.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crewe_alexandra/8286658.stm Thordarson sacked as Crewe boss] BBC Sport; 2 October 2009</ref> Dario Gradi was reinstated as caretaker manager in time for the following day's match against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]]. Despite lingering close to the playoff places for the majority of the season, another run of poor form saw the club finish in 18th place, only five places above the relegation zone. Gradi responded to this disappointment by refusing to take the team on a pre-season tour, stating that he "doesn't want to reward the players for what happened this season".

The club finished 10th in League Two in [[2010–11 Crewe Alexandra F.C. season|their 2010–11 season]] and also ended up with the League 2 golden boot winner: [[Clayton Donaldson]] scored 29 goals, but moved to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in July 2011.

On 10 November 2011, the club announced that Dario Gradi had stepped down as manager and would return to his previous role as Director of Football focusing on youth development.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15675372.stm Dario Gradi steps down as Crewe Alexandra manager] BBC Sport; 10 October 2011</ref>

===Seasons 2011–2016===
[[Steve Davis (footballer born 1965)|Steve Davis]] was appointed manager, and led the team to a 16-match unbeaten run in early 2012 up to 7th position, earning the club a play-off place.<ref>Alex secure play-offs spot, ''[http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide3/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer_league_1_and_2/12/05/05/manual_183552.html&TEAMHD=nationwide3&BID=422 Sporting Life]'' (retrieved: 6 May 2012)</ref>
Crewe defeated [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in the semi-final with a 1–0 win at home in the first leg and a 2–2 draw at Roots Hall, extending the unbeaten run to a club-record 18 matches<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18109180 | work=BBC News | title=Go and finish the job, says Crewe Alexandra boss Steve Davis. | date=17 May 2012}}</ref> and securing a play-off final against [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] at Wembley on 27 May 2012 which they won 2–0 and earned promotion.

Before the 2012–2013 season started, Crewe sold [[Nick Powell]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and on transfer deadline day (31 August 2012) captain [[Ashley Westwood (footballer born 1990)|Ashley Westwood]] was sold to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. However, with new players coming into the first team, Crewe won the [[Football League Trophy]], beating Southend United 2–0 in [[2013 Football League Trophy Final|the final]] at Wembley in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Osborne|first=Chris|title=Crewe 2 – Southend 0|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21986344|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref> The team finished 13th in League One, ending the season by fielding a team whose starting 11 were all Crewe Academy graduates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crewe 2–0 Walsall|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22229034|accessdate=29 April 2013|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=27 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Ged|title=Crewe Alexandra: Dario Gradi's academy dream set to come true|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22278754|accessdate=29 April 2013|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=24 April 2013}}</ref>

On 22 February 2014, for 33 minutes of a match at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], two brothers played on opposite sides against each other – Crewe's [[Harry Davis (footballer born 1991)|Harry Davis]] and [[Joe Davis (footballer born 1993)|Joe Davis]] of Port Vale – while their father, Steve Davis, was manager of one of the teams (Crewe Alexandra).<ref name=family>{{cite web|title=Port Vale v Crewe: Steve Davis plays down family pride|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26273859|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=Vale1Alex3>{{cite web|title=Port Vale 1 Crewe Alexandra 3|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26202284|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref>

On 3 May 2014 Crewe ensured their place in League One with a 2–1 home victory over [[Preston North End]] ending the 2013/14 Season in 19th place four points above relegation. Although the season had not been successful for the first team, the Under-21s won the [[2013–14 Professional U21 Development League#League 2|Professional Development League Two]] title with a 1–0 win over [[QPR]] on 30 April 2014; [[Max Clayton]] scored the goal.<ref name=U21DL>{{cite web|title=Crewe Alexandra crowned Professional Development League Two champions|url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/news/article/300414-u21s-match-report-qpr-0-crewe-1-april-30th-2014-1520474.aspx|work=QPR|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref> The under-18s were runners-up in their [[2013–14 Professional U18 Development League|Development League]].

Crewe started the 2014–15 season poorly, accumulating just four points from the first 11 League games. Some sustained runs of better results pulled the club out of the relegation places, but, needing a home draw against Bradford City to secure safety, Crewe lost 0–1 and had to rely on favourable results elsewhere to ensure League One football for another year, finishing two points above the bottom four in 20th position.<ref name=Bradford>{{cite web|title=Crewe 0 – 1 Bradford|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32471095|website=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>

The following season started in a similar pattern, with the team winning just two of their first 15 league games, and crashing out of the FA Cup in the first round, defeated at Gresty Road by non-league [[Eastleigh F.C.|Eastleigh]],<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34685303 Crewe 0–1 Eastleigh], BBC Sport, 7 November 2015.

[[Image:Gresty Road, Crewe.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=Photograph|[[Gresty Road]]]]

Until 1896 Crewe played at the [[Alexandra Recreation Ground]], located just to the north of the modern-day [[Gresty Road]]. After playing at a variety of venues in 1896 and 1897, including in nearby [[Sandbach]], the club returned to the same area of Crewe to play at the first Gresty Road ground, located to the south-east of the original stadium. In 1906 the ground was demolished to make way for some new railway lines, and a new [[Gresty Road]] stadium was built on a site directly to the west.<ref name=UD/><ref>Smith & Smith, p13</ref>

The ground is composed of four stands:
*'''The Air Products Stand''' (formerly the Railtrack Stand, before a change in sponsors), built in 2000 at a cost of £5.2 million. It accommodates 6,809 spectators, together with the club's office accommodation.

*'''The Wulvern Housing Stand''', also known as the Railway End, accommodates 682 spectators.
*'''The Whitby Morrison Ice Cream Van Stand''', formerly the Pop Side, accommodates 1,680 away spectators.{{Clear}}

Close encounters between the two clubs since 2010 have resulted in violence and arrests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/news/local-news/police-arrest-15-football-fans-5611108|title=Police arrest 15 football fans as rival supporters clash at Crewe Alexandra v Port Vale match|author=Belinda Ryan|date=19 January 2011|work=crewechronicle}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-12201606|title=Football fans charged after Crewe and Port Vale match|date=16 January 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/13-arrests-following-Port-Vale-Crewe-Alex-game/story-20167780-detail/story.html|title=13 arrests made following Port Vale and Crewe Alex game|work=Stoke Sentinel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/arrests-yobs-mar-derby/story-12483792-detail/story.html|title=Trouble at derby – Stoke Sentinel|work=Stoke Sentinel}}</ref> On 22 February 2014, Crewe beat Vale 3–1, at [[Vale Park]] and there was trouble before, during and after the game, with several arrests made, flares thrown on the pitch,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Trouble-flared-Port-Vale-Crewe-Alex-derby-match/story-20688104-detail/story.html|title=Trouble flared at Port Vale and Crewe Alex derby match|work=Stoke Sentinel}}</ref> and a scuffle between rival supporters in the executive boxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Vale-Crewe-Alex-fans-clash-executive-boxes-derby/story-20684768-detail/story.html|title=Port Vale and Crewe Alex fans clash in executive boxes at derby match|work=Stoke Sentinel}}</ref> The first meeting of the 2014/15 season saw Crewe beat Port Vale 2–1; again trouble flared with Cheshire Police confirming five arrests were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Police-make-arrests-Crewe-Vale-derby/story-22921151-detail/story.html|title=Police make five arrests at Crewe-Vale derby|work=Stoke Sentinel}}</ref> The sides met again in January 2015, at Vale Park.
