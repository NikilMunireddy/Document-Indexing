The '''Conservative Party''', officially the '''Conservative and Unionist Party''', is a [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is the [[Majority government|majority party]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], having won 330 of the 650 seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Election results: Conservatives win majority - BBC News|url = http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32633099|accessdate = 2015-05-08}}</ref> Between [[55th Parliament of the United Kingdom|2010-15]], it was the largest single party with 304 [[Members of Parliament]] and governed in coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats]]. It is the largest party in [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] with [[Political make-up of local councils in the United Kingdom|8,296 councillors]].<ref name="Keith Edkins" />

The Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory Party]]—giving rise to the Conservatives' colloquial name of '''Tories'''—and was one of two dominant parties in the 19th century, along with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. In the 1920s, the Liberal vote greatly diminished and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] became the Conservatives' main rivals. Conservative Prime Ministers led governments for 57 years of the 20th century, including [[Winston Churchill]] (1940–45, 1951–55) and [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979–90).  Thatcher's tenure led to wide-ranging [[Economic liberalization|economic liberalisation]] and saw the Conservatives become the most [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] of the three major parties.

The Conservatives are the joint-second largest British party in the [[European Parliament]], with twenty [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/vote2014/eu-uk-results|title=Vote 2014 Election Results for the EU Parliament UK regions - BBC News|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and sit with the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR) [[Political groups of the European Parliament|parliamentary group]]. The party is a member of the [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists]] (AECR) [[European political party|Europarty]] and the [[International Democrat Union]] (IDU).

The party is the second-largest in the [[Scottish Parliament]] and third-largest in the [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]]. The Conservatives were formerly allied to the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) in [[Northern Ireland]] but there is now a separate [[Northern Ireland Conservatives|Northern Ireland Conservative]] party similar to the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Conservative Party|Scottish]] Conservative parties.<ref>Walker, Stephen (14 June 2012).

{{Main|History of the Conservative Party|Leaders of the Conservative Party}}

===Pittites===
The Conservative Party traces its origins to a faction, rooted in the 18th-century [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]], that coalesced around [[William Pitt the Younger]] (Prime Minister of Great Britain 1783–1801 and 1804–1806). They were known as "Independent Whigs", "Friends of Mr Pitt", or "Pittites". After Pitt's death the term "Tory" came into use. This was an allusion to the [[British Tory party|Tories]], a political grouping that had existed from 1678, but which had no organisational continuity with the Pittite party. From about 1812 on the name "Tory" was commonly used for the newer party.<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) p. 9</ref>

The term "Conservative" was suggested as a title for the party by a magazine article by J. Wilson Croker in the ''Quarterly Review'' in 1830. The name immediately caught on and was officially adopted under the aegis of [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] around 1834. Peel is acknowledged as the founder of the Conservative Party, which he created with the announcement of the [[Tamworth Manifesto]].  The term "Conservative Party" rather than Tory was the dominant usage by 1845.<ref>Ivor Bulmer-Thomas,  ''The Growth of the British Party System Volume I: 1640–1923'' (1965) pp 66–81</ref><ref>David Paterson, ''Liberalism and Conservatism, 1846–1905'' (2001) p 5</ref>

===Conservatives and Unionists (1867–1965)===
[[Image:Churchill V sign HU 55521.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]], twice Prime Minister of the<br> United Kingdom.]]
The widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]]. In 1886 the party formed an alliance with [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]] (later the 8th [[Dukes of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]) and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s new [[Liberal Unionist Party]] and, under the statesmen [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906]] when it split over the issue of [[tariff reform|free trade]]. In 1912, the Liberal Unionists merged with the Conservative party. In Ireland, the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] had been formed in 1891 which merged anti-Home Rule Unionists into one political movement. Its MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster, and in essence formed the Irish wing of the party until 1922.

===First World War===
The Conservatives served with the Liberals in an all-party coalition government during World War I, and the coalition continued under the Liberal prime minister [[David Lloyd George]] (with half of the Liberals) until 1922. Keohane finds that the Conservatives were bitterly divided before 1914, especially on the issue of Irish Unionism and the experience of three consecutive election losses. However the war pulled the party together, allowing it to emphasise patriotism as it found new leadership and worked out its positions on the Irish question, socialism, electoral reform, and the issue of intervention in the economy. The fresh emphasis on anti-Socialism was its response to the growing strength of the Labour Party. When electoral reform was an issue it worked to protect its base in rural England.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nigel|last=Keohane|title=The Party of Patriotism: The Conservative Party and the First World War|publisher=Ashgate|year=2010}}</ref> It aggressively sought women voters in the 1920s, often relying on patriotic themes.<ref>{{cite journal |first=David|last=Jarvis |title=Mrs. Maggs and Betty: The Conservative Appeal to Women Voters in the 1920s|journal=Twentieth-Century British History|year=1992|volume=5|issue=2|pages=129–152}}</ref>

[[File:Socialism Would Mean.jpg|left|thumb|upright|1929 poster attacking the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]]]

===1920–1945===
In 1922, [[Bonar Law]] and [[Stanley Baldwin]] led the break-up of the coalition and the Conservatives governed until 1923, when a minority Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald came to power. The Conservatives regained power in 1924 and remained in power for the full five-year term. They were defeated in 1929 as a minority Labour government took office. In 1931, following the collapse of the Labour minority government, it entered another coalition, which was dominated by the Conservatives with some support from fractions of both the Liberals and Labour party (National Labour and Liberal Nationals).<ref name="Vernon Bogdanor, Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution">{{cite book|first=Vernon|last=Bogdanor|title=Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> In May 1940 a more balanced coalition was formed,<ref name="Vernon Bogdanor, Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution" /> the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], which, under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]], saw the United Kingdom through World War II. However, the party lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] to the resurgent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

===1945–1963===
{{main|Postwar Britain}}

====Popular dissatisfaction====
In the late 1940s the Conservative Party exploited and incited growing public anger at [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], scarcity, controls, austerity, and omnipresent government bureaucracy. They used the dissatisfaction with the socialist and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and build a political comeback that won the 1951 general election. Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during the war.<ref>Zweiniger-Bargileowska, Ina. "Rationing, austerity and the Conservative party recovery after 1945." ''Historical Journal'' (1994) 37#1 pp. 173–97.</ref>

====Modernising the party====
In 1947 the party published its [[Industrial Charter]] which marked its acceptance of the "[[post-war consensus]]" on the [[mixed economy]] and [[labour rights]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kynaston, David |year=2007 |title=Austerity Britain: 1945–1951 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-7475-7985-4 |pages=238–241}}</ref> [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell Fyfe]] chaired a committee into Conservative Party organisation that resulted in the Maxwell Fyfe Report (1948–49). The report shifted the balance of electoral funding from the candidate to the party, with the intention of broadening the [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of MPs. In practice, it may have had the effect of lending more power to [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] parties and making candidates more uniform.<ref>Dutton, D. J. (2004). "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33301 Fyfe, David Patrick Maxwell, Earl of Kilmuir (1900–1967)]", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press. Retrieved 4 August 2007 {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

The success of the Conservative party in reorganising itself was validated by its victory in the 1951 election. Churchill, the party leader, brought in a Party Chairman to modernise the creaking institution. [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]] was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946–55, he rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates, and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Lord Woolton emphasized a rhetoric that characterised the opponents as "Socialist" rather than "Labour". The libertarian influence of Professor [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s 1944 best-seller ''Road to Serfdom'' was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.<ref>Blake, Robert. ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) pp. 260–264.</ref>

With a narrow win in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]], Churchill was back. Although he was aging rapidly, he had national and global prestige. Apart from rationing, which was ended, most of the welfare state enacted by Labour were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the "post-war consensus" that would later be [[satire|satirised]] as [[Butskellism]], and which lasted until the 1970s.<ref>Toye, Richard. "From 'Consensus' to 'Common Ground': The Rhetoric of the Postwar Settlement and its Collapse," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (2013) 48#1 pp 3–23.</ref><ref>''The Economist'', 'Mr Butskell's Dilemma', 13 February 1954.</ref> The Conservatives were conciliatory toward unions, but they did de-nationalise the steel and road haulage industries in 1953.<ref>{{cite book |author=Morgan, Kenneth O. |title=Britain Since 1945: The People's Peace: The People's Peace |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tKwGaWWKzNAC&pg=PA114 |year=2001|publisher= Oxford UP |pages=114–5}}</ref> During the Conservatives’ 13 years in office, pensions went up by 49% in real terms, sickness and unemployment benefits by 76% in real terms, and supplementary benefits by 46% in real terms. However, family allowances fell by 15% in real terms during that period.<ref>The Labour Party in Crisis by Paul Whiteley</ref>

The Party won in [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]] with ever larger majorities. Conservative prime ministers Churchill, [[Anthony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]] promoted relatively liberal trade regulations and less state involvement throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. They oversaw a period of economic prosperity, with Macmillan proclaiming during the 1959 general election that Britain had 'never had it so good'.

In 1958, [[Geoffrey Howe]] co-authored the report ''A Giant's Strength'' published by the [[Inns of Court]] Conservative Association. The report argued that the unions had become too powerful and that their legal privileges ought to be curtailed. [[Ian Macleod]] discouraged the authors from publicising the report. Macmillan believed that trade union votes had contributed towards the 1951 and 1955 victories and thought that it "would be inexpedient to adopt any policy involving legislation which would alienate this support".<ref>{{cite book | author=Kynaston, David |year=2013 |title=Modernity Britain: Opening the Box 1957–1959 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-74758893-1 |page=158}}</ref>

Macmillan's bid to join the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] in early 1963 was blocked by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The period saw the decline of the UK as a prominent world leader, with the loss of practically the entire empire and a laggard economy.

===Edward Heath===
[[File:Heathdod.JPG|160px|thumbnail|left|[[Edward Heath]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1970-1974)]]
[[Edward Heath]]'s 1970–74 government was known for taking the UK into the EEC, although the right-wing of the party objected to his failure to control the trade unions at a time when a declining British industry saw many strikes, as well as a [[1973-75 recession|recession]] which started in 1973 and lasted for two years.

Since accession to the EU, British membership has been a source of heated debate within the Conservative party.

Heath had come to power in [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|June 1970]] and the last possible date for the next general election was not until mid-1975.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393297.stm|work=BBC News|title=1970: Heath's surprise victory|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> However a general election was held in [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]] in a bid to win public support during a [[Three-day week|national emergency]] caused by the miners' strike. However, Heath's attempt to win a second term in power at this "snap" election failed, as a deadlock result [[hung parliament|left no party with an overall majority]]. The Conservatives had more votes than Labour, who had four more seats. Heath resigned within days, after failing to gain [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] support in order to form a coalition government, paving the way for [[Harold Wilson]] and Labour to return to power as a minority government. Heath's hopes of returning to power later in the year were ended when Labour won the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 election]] with an overall majority of three seats.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393307.stm|work=BBC News|title=1974&nbsp;Oct&nbsp;: Wilson makes it four|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

===Margaret Thatcher===
[[File:Margaret Thatcher cropped2.png|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]],<ref>Image provided by the Margaret Thatcher Foundation</ref> Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1979–1990).]]
Loss of power weakened Heath's control over the party and [[Margaret Thatcher]] deposed him in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|1975 leadership election]]. The UK in the 1970s had seen sustained high [[inflation]] rates, which were above 20% at the time of the leadership election, subsequently falling to below 10%; unemployment had risen, and over the winter of 1978–79 there was a series of strikes known as the "[[Winter of Discontent]]".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393311.stm |work=BBC News|title=1979: Thatcher wins Tory landslide | date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> Thatcher led her party to victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] with a manifesto which concentrated on the party's philosophy rather than presenting a 'shopping list' of policies.<ref>[[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, "The British General Election of 1979", Macmillan, 1979, p. 154.</ref>

As prime minister, Thatcher focused on establishing a political ideology that became known as the "[[New Right]]" or [[Thatcherism]], based on social and economic ideas from the United States. Thatcher believed that too much social-democratic-oriented government policy was leading to a long-term decline in the British economy. As a result, her government pursued a programme of [[economic liberalism]], adopting a free-market approach to public services based on the sale of publicly owned industries and utilities, as well as a reduction in trade union power. She held the belief that the existing trend of Unions was bringing economic progress to a standstill by enforcing "wildcat" strikes, keeping wages artificially high and forcing unprofitable industries to stay open.

Thatcher led the Conservatives to two further election victories with landslide majorities in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]]. She was greatly admired by her supporters for her leadership in the [[Falklands War]] of 1982—which coincided with a dramatic boost in her popularity—and for policies such as giving the right to council house tenants to buy their council house at a discount on market value. She was also deeply unpopular in certain sections of society due to unemployment, which reached its highest level since the 1930s, peaking at over 3&nbsp;million following her economic reforms, and her response to the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike]].

The period of unpopularity of the Conservatives in the early 1980s coincided with a crisis in the Labour Party which now formed the opposition. The [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) was formed in 1981 and consisted of more than 20 breakaway Labour MPs, who quickly formed the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] with the Liberal Party. By the turn of 1982, the SDP-Liberal Alliance was ahead of the Conservatives in the [[opinion poll]]s, but victory in the [[Falklands war]] in June that year, along with the recovering British economy, saw the Conservatives returning quickly to the top of the opinion polls and winning the 1983 general election with a landslide majority, due to a split opposition vote.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" />

Thatcher now faced, arguably, her most serious rival yet after the 1983 election, when [[Michael Foot]] resigned as Labour leader and was succeeded by [[Neil Kinnock]]. With a new leader at the helm, Labour were clearly determined to topple the Conservatives at the next election and for virtually the entirety of Thatcher's second government it was looking a very serious possibility, as the lead in the opinion polls constantly saw a change in leadership from the Conservatives to Labour, with the Alliance occasionally scraping into first place.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|work=BBC News|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|date=29 September 2009|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

By the time of the election in June 1987 the economy was stronger, with lower inflation and falling unemployment and Thatcher secured her third successive election victory with a second, though smaller, landslide majority.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393315.stm|work=BBC News|title=1987: Thatcher's third victory|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

The introduction of the [[Community Charge]] (known by its opponents as the ''[[Poll tax (United Kingdom)|poll tax]]'') in 1989 is often cited as contributing to her political downfall. The summer of 1989 saw her fall behind Neil Kinnock's Labour in the opinion polls for the first time since 1986, and her party's fall in popularity continued into 1990. By the second half of that year, opinion polls were showing that Labour had a lead of up to 16 points over the Conservatives and they faced a tough 18&nbsp;months ahead of them if they were to prevent Kinnock's ambition to be prime minister from being realised. At the same time, the economy was sliding into [[Early 1990s recession|another recession]].<ref name="autogenerated2" />

Internal party tensions led to a leadership challenge by the Conservative MP [[Michael Heseltine]]; and, after months of speculation about her future as prime minister, she resigned on 28 November 1990, making way for a new Conservative leader more likely to win the next general election in the interests of party unity.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/22/newsid_2549000/2549189.stm |work=BBC News |title=On This Day 1990: Thatcher quits as prime minister |date=22 November 1990 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

===John Major===
[[File:John Major 1996.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Major]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1990–1997]]
[[John Major]] won the party leadership contest on 27 November 1990, and his appointment led to an almost automatic boost in Conservative fortunes. A MORI poll six days before Mrs Thatcher's resignation had shown the Conservatives to be 11 points behind Labour, but within two months the Conservatives had returned to the top of the opinion polls with a slim lead.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

An election had to be held within the next 18&nbsp;months and the UK economy was sliding into [[Early 1990s|recession]], but 1991 was a year of electoral uncertainty as the Conservatives and Labour regularly swapped places at the top of the opinion polls, and Major resisted Neil Kinnock's numerous calls for an immediate election.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

The [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|election]] was finally held on 9 April 1992 and the Conservatives won, even though the economy was still in recession and most of the polls had predicted either a Labour win or a hung parliament. Major's vigorous campaigning, notably his claim that the UK would have higher prices and higher taxes under a Labour government, was seen to have been crucial in his election win (in which he became the first - and as of 2015, only - prime minister to attract 14,000,000 votes in a general election), as was a high profile campaign by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper against Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who resigned in the aftermath of the election to be succeeded by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. The Party also touched upon the issue of immigration, claiming that under Labour, immigration would rise hugely.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm|work=BBC News|title=1992: Tories win again against odds|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

The UK economy was deep in recession by this stage and remained so until the end of the year. The [[pound sterling]] was forced out of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] on 16 September 1992, a day thereafter referred to as ''[[Black Wednesday]]''.

Soon after approximately one million householders faced re-possession of their homes during a recession that saw a sharp rise in unemployment, taking it close to 3,000,000. The party subsequently lost much of its reputation for good financial stewardship although the end of the recession was declared in April 1993<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm|work=BBC News|title=1993: Recession over&nbsp;— it's official|date=26 April 1993|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> bringing economic recovery and a rise in employment.

[[File:Rail modal share.png|thumb|Rail modal share (rail's share of total travel) 1952–2014<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482670/tsgb0101.xls |title=Rail modal share 1952-2014}}</ref>]]
From 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]]. Its [[impact of the privatisation of British Rail|success is hotly debated]], with a large increase in passenger numbers and investment in the network balanced by worries about the level of subsidy.

The party was plagued by internal division and infighting, mainly over the issue over policy towards the European Union. The party's eurosceptic wing, represented by MPs such as [[John Redwood]], opposed further EU integration, whilst the party's pro-European wing, represented by those such as Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Kenneth Clarke]], was broadly supportive. The issue of the creation of a single currency also inflamed tensions, and these would continue to dog the party until the early 2000s (decade). These divisions gave off an impression of a divided party, which had lost touch with the voters.

Major also had to survive a leadership challenge in 1995 by the Secretary of State for Wales, the aforementioned John Redwood. He survived, but Redwood received 89 votes from MPs, as well as the backing of the ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper, which described the choice as being between "Redwood or Deadwood". This further undermined Major's influence in the Party.<ref>The Conservative Party-From Thatcher to Cameron</ref>

The Conservative government was also increasingly accused in the media of "[[Political scandals in the United Kingdom|sleaze]]". Their support reached its lowest ebb in late 1994, after the death of Labour Party leader John Smith and the election of [[Tony Blair]] as his successor, when Labour had up to 60% of the vote in opinion polls and had a lead of some 30 points ahead of the Conservatives. The Labour lead was gradually narrowed over the next two years, as the Conservatives gained some credit for the strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment. But as the 1997 general election loomed, despite their high profile [[New Labour, New Danger]] campaign, it was still looking certain that Labour would win.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

An effective opposition campaign by the Labour Party culminated in a landslide defeat for the Conservatives in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] that was Labour's largest ever parliamentary victory. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] election left the Conservative Party with MPs in just England, all remaining seats in Scotland and Wales having been lost and not a single seat having been gained anywhere.

===Back in opposition: William Hague===
[[John Major]] resigned as party leader after the Conservatives were voted out of power and was succeeded by [[William Hague]]. Though Hague was a strong debater, a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup poll]] for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' found that two-thirds of voters regarded him as "a bit of a wally",<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/1162569.stm |title=Poll monitor: Labour looks hard to beat |accessdate=20 April 2007 |first=David |last=Cowling |date=9 February 2001 |work=BBC News}}</ref> for headlines such as his claim that he drank 14&nbsp;pints (8 litres, 1.75 gallons) of beer in a single day in his youth. He was also criticised for attending the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] and for wearing a [[baseball cap]] in public in what were seen as poor attempts to appeal to younger voters.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2823679.stm |title=Trying to be 'down with the kids' |accessdate=20 April 2007 |date=7 March 2003 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Shortly before the 2001 election, Hague was much maligned for a speech in which he predicted that a re-elected Labour government would turn the UK into a "foreign land".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1200842.stm |title=Tory critics round on Hague |accessdate=20 April 2007|date=5 March 2001| work=BBC News}}</ref> The BBC also reported that the Conservative peer [[John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Warwick|Lord Taylor]] criticised Hague for not removing the whip from [[John Townend]], a Conservative MP, after the latter made a speech in which he said the British were becoming "a mongrel race", although Hague did reject Townend's views.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1298786.stm |title=Tory peer attacks Hague over race |accessdate=20 April 2007 |date=27 April 2001 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

The [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 election]] resulted in a net gain of just one seat for the Conservative Party, just months after the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests of September 2000]] had seen the Conservatives briefly take a narrow lead over Labour in the opinion polls.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

Having privately set himself a target of 209 seats, matching Labour's performance in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]]&nbsp;— a target which he missed by 43 &nbsp;— [[William Hague]] resigned soon after.

===Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard===
[[Iain Duncan Smith]] (2001–2003) (often known as IDS and by satirists as "the quiet man") is a strong [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]], but the issue did not define Duncan Smith's leadership, though during his tenure Europe ceased to be an issue of division in the party as it united behind calls for a referendum on the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Union Constitution]].

However, before he could lead the party in a general election Duncan Smith lost the vote on a [[motion of no confidence]] by MPs who felt that the party would not be returned to government under his leadership. This was despite the Conservative support equalling that of Labour in the months leading up to his departure from the leadership.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

[[Michael Howard]] then stood for the leadership unopposed on 6 November [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2003|2003]].

Under Howard in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], the Conservative Party increased their total vote share by around 0.7% (up to 32.4%) and&nbsp;– more significantly&nbsp;– their number of parliamentary seats by 33 (up to 198 seats). This gain accompanied a larger fall in the Labour vote, and the election reduced Labour's majority from 167 to 68 and its share of the vote to 35.2%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpolitical.info/2005.htm
|title=2005 General election results summary|work=UK Political Info|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref> The campaign, based on the slogan ''"Are you thinking what we're thinking?"'', was designed by Australian pollster [[Lynton Crosby]]. The day after the election, on 6 May, Howard announced that he did not feel it was right to continue as leader after defeat in the general election, also saying that he would be too old to lead the party into another campaign and would therefore step down after allowing time for the party to amend its leadership election rules.

===David Cameron (in opposition and in government)===
[[File:David Cameron official.jpg|thumb|David Cameron|thumb|upright|[[David Cameron]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (2010–present).]]

[[David Cameron]] won the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|2005 leadership election]]. Cameron beat his closest rival, [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], by a margin of more than two to one, taking 134,446 votes to 64,398. He then announced his intention to reform and realign the Conservatives, saying they needed to change the way they looked, felt, thought and behaved, advocating a more centre-right stance as opposed to their recent staunchly right-wing platform.<ref name="Cameron-speech">{{cite news |url= http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/06/toryleadership2005.conservatives3 |title= Full text of David Cameron's victory speech |accessdate=20 April 2007 |date=12 June 2005 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> Although Cameron's views are probably to the left of the party membership and he has sought to make the Conservative brand more attractive to young, socially liberal voters,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8131792.stm |work=BBC News |title=Minister in Tory homophobia claim |first=Brian |last=Wheeler |date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}</ref> he has also expressed his admiration for [[Margaret Thatcher]], describing himself as a "big fan of Thatcher's", though he questions whether that makes him a "Thatcherite". For most of 2006 and the first half of 2007, polls showed leads over Labour for the Conservatives.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/voting-intention/labcon-forced-choice/| title = Conservative or Labour preference ("forced choice")| accessdate =20 April 2007| work=UK Polling Report| publisher=YouGov}}</ref>

Polls became more volatile in the summer of 2007 with the accession of [[Gordon Brown]] as Prime Minister, although polls gave the Conservatives a lead after October of that year and, by May 2008, with the UK's economy sliding into [[Great Recession|its first recession since 1992]], and a week after local council elections, a [[YouGov]] poll commissioned by [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'' newspaper]] was published giving the Conservative Party a 26-point lead over Labour, its largest lead since 1968.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1142543.ece |title= Labour at its lowest ebb |accessdate=10 May 2008 |date=9 May 2008 |work=The Sun |location=London}}</ref> The Conservatives gained control of the London [[Mayor of London|mayoralty]] for the first time in May 2008 after [[Boris Johnson]] defeated the Labour incumbent, [[Ken Livingstone]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=144004 |title= Boris is the new Mayor of London |date=3 May 2008 |publisher=Conservative Party |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080506110344/http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=144004 |archivedate= 6 May 2008}}</ref>

The Conservative lead in the opinion polls had been almost unbroken for nearly three years when Britain finally went to the polls on 6 May 2010, though since the turn of 2010 most polls had shown the Conservative lead as less than 10 points wide. The election ended in a [[hung parliament]] with the Conservatives having the most seats (306) but being 20 seats short of an overall majority. Following the resignation of Gordon Brown as prime minister and Labour Party leader five days afterwards, David Cameron was named as the country's new prime minister and the Conservatives entered government in a coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats]] – the first postwar [[coalition government]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/ |publisher=BBC News |title= Election 2010 results |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>

In May 2014 the Conservatives were defeated in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|European parliamentary elections]] coming in third behind the [[UK Independence Party]] and Labour. UKIP ended with 24 MEPs, Labour 20, and the Conservatives 19. The result was described by UKIP leader [[Nigel Farage]] as "disastrous" for Cameron, and the leaders of the other main parties.<ref name="UKIP">{{cite news|title=European voters now calling for less EU|url=http://www.theuknews.com/index.php/sid/222314307/scat/b8de8e630faf3631/ht/European-voters-now-calling-for-less-EU|accessdate=27 May 2014|publisher=''The UK News''}}</ref>

In September 2014 the Unionist side, championed by Labour as well as by the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats, won in the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish Independence referendum]] by 55% No to 45% Yes on the question "Should Scotland be an independent country". This can be seen as a victory for [[British Unionism]], a core part of traditional Conservative ideology, and also for David Cameron as the incumbent Prime Minister.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the Conservatives won a majority of seats in the Commons and formed a single-party government under David Cameron. The party increased its national vote share, becoming the first incumbent party to do so since 1900. The result was unexpected and exceeded even the party leadership's expectations, as most polls had predicted a hung parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11591281/conservative-government-live.html|title=Election 2015: Ed Miliband resigns as Conservatives win stunning majority - LIVE|date=8 May 2015|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32633099|title=Election results: Conservatives win majority|date=8 May 2015|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> This was also the first general election since 1992 in which the Conservatives had won an overall majority, although the vote share of 36.9% was lower than the previous four Conservative majority governments under Thatcher and Major.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/db4d60b2-f574-11e4-bc6d-00144feab7de.html#axzz4ACNy4msM | title=It is 1992 all over again for David Cameron’s Conservatives | publisher=[[The Nikkei|Nikkei]] | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=8 May 2015 | accessdate=31 May 2016 | author=Parker, George}}</ref>

==Policies==

===Economic policy===
The party's reputation for economic stewardship was dealt a blow by [[Black Wednesday]] in 1992, in which billions of pounds were spent in an effort to keep the pound within the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) system at an overvalued rate. Combined with the recession of the early 1990s 'Black Wednesday' allowed [[Tony Blair]] and then-[[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] to promise greater economic competence.

One concrete economic policy of recent years has been opposition to the [[Euro|European single currency]]. Anticipating the growing [[Euroscepticism]] within his party, [[John Major]] negotiated a British opt-out from the single currency in the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]], although several members of Major's cabinet, such as [[Kenneth Clarke]], were personally supportive of EMU participation. Following Major's resignation after the 1997 defeat, each of the four subsequent Conservative leaders, including [[David Cameron]], have positioned the party firmly against the adoption of the [[euro]]. This policy is broadly popular with the British electorate.

Following Labour's victory in the 1997 general election, the Conservative Party opposed Labour's decision to grant the [[Bank of England]] independent control of interest rates—on the grounds that it would be a prelude to the abolition of the [[pound sterling]] and acceptance of the European single currency, and also expressed concern over the removal of monetary policy from democratic control. However, Bank independence was popular amongst the financial community as it helped to keep inflation low.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_economy/404098.stm| title = Business: The Economy – Labour's economic record| accessdate =20 April 2007|date=26 July 1999| work=BBC News}}</ref> The Conservatives accepted Labour's policy in early 2000.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/629601.stm |title= Portillo springs surprise U-turns |accessdate=20 April 2007 |date=3 February 2000 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

The Conservative Party under [[David Cameron]] has redirected its stance on taxation, still committed to the general principle of reducing direct taxation whilst arguing that the country needs a "dynamic and competitive economy", with the proceeds of any growth shared between both "tax reduction and extra public investment".

In the wake of the [[Great Recession|Great Recession of 2008–9]], the Conservatives had not ruled out raising taxes, but since coming to power, the 50% top rate of [[UK income tax|income tax]] was dropped to 45% in 2013.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17455373</ref> They have said how they would prefer to cut [[national insurance]] than lower the top rate further. Furthermore, they have reduced [[government spending]], and have [[:wiktionary:ringfence|ringfenced]] only [[Department of International Development|international aid]], the [[National Health Service|NHS]] and education.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22363650</ref> Details of the cuts to government spending under the Conservative–Liberal coalition can be found in the following article: [[United Kingdom government austerity programme]].

===Social policy===
[[Image:ScarboroughConservativeClub.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] Conservative Club.]]

In recent years, 'modernisers' in the party have claimed that the association between [[social conservatism]] and the Conservatives (manifest in policies such as tax incentives for married couples, the removal of the link between pensions and earnings, and criticism of public financial support for those who do not work) have played a role in the electoral decline of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade). Since 1997, a debate has continued within the party between 'modernisers' such as [[Alan Duncan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanduncan.org.uk/about |title=Biography – Rt Hon Alan Duncan MP |publisher=Alan Duncan |date=27 May 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> who believe that the Conservatives should modify their public stances on social issues, and 'traditionalists' such as [[Liam Fox]] <ref>{{cite news |author=Spencer, Clare  |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/seealso/2011/10/daily_view_liam_foxs_fate.html |title=Daily View: Liam Fox's fate |work=BBC blog |date=October 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/uk/news/article_1668909.php/PROFILE-Liam-Fox-Colourful-politician-with-traditionalist-agenda |title=PROFILE: Liam Fox: Colourful politician with traditionalist agenda |work=Monsters and Critics |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> and [[Owen Paterson]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/12/owen-paterson-is-conhome-readers-one-to-watch-picksof2012.html |title=Owen Paterson is ConHome readers' One To Watch in 2013 The Tory Diary |publisher=Conservative home |date=30 December 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Montgomerie, Tim |url= http://standpointmag.co.uk/underrated-november-12-owen-paterson-tim-montgomerie-climate-change-lord-stern |title=Underrated: Owen Paterson |work=Stand Point |date=November 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> who believe that the party should remain faithful to its traditional conservative platform.

Iain Duncan Smith, however, remains influential.

===Foreign policy===

For much of the 20th century, the Conservative party took a broadly [[Atlanticist]] stance in relations with the United States, favouring close ties with the United States and similarly aligned nations such as Canada, Australia and Japan. The Conservatives have generally favoured a diverse range of international alliances, ranging from the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Close US-British relations have been an element of Conservative foreign policy since World War II. Winston Churchill during his 1951–1955 post-war premiership built up a strong relationship with the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower Administration]] in the United States. Harold Macmillan demonstrated a similarly close relationship with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administration of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Though the US–British relationship in foreign affairs has often been termed a '[[Special Relationship]]', a term coined by [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]], this has often been observed most clearly where leaders in each country are of a similar political stripe. The former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher built a close relationship with the American President [[Ronald Reagan]] in his opposition to the former Soviet Union, but [[John Major]] was less successful in his personal contacts with [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Out of power and perceived as largely irrelevant by American politicians, Conservative leaders Hague, Duncan-Smith, and Howard each struggled to forge personal relationships with presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]]. However, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] 2008 presidential candidate, [[John McCain]], spoke at the 2006 Conservative Party Conference.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/martin_kettle/2006/08/david_camerons_special_relatio.html| title = David Cameron's special relationship| accessdate =20 April 2007| first=Martin |last=Kettle |authorlink=Martin Kettle|date=29 August 2006|work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref>

[[David Cameron]] had sought to distance himself from former US President Bush and his [[neoconservative]] foreign policy, calling for a "rebalancing" of US-UK ties<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/11/conservatives.uk1 |title= Cameron: I'm no neo-con |accessdate=20 April 2007 |first=Matthew |last=Tempest |date=11 September 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> and met [[Barack Obama]] during his 2008 European tour. Despite traditional links between the UK Conservatives and US [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and between Labour and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], London Mayor [[Boris Johnson]], a Conservative, endorsed Obama in the 2008 election.

Beyond relations with the United States, the Commonwealth and the EU, the Conservative Party has generally supported a pro free-trade foreign policy within the mainstream of international affairs. The degree to which Conservative Governments have supported [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] or non-interventionist presidents in the US has often varied with the personal relations between a US President and the British Prime Minister.

===Defence===

====Afghanistan====
Since the [[11 September attacks|terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001]], the Conservative party has supported the coalition military action in [[Afghanistan]]. The Conservative Party believes that success in Afghanistan is defined in terms of the Afghans achieving the capability to maintain their own internal and external security.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2009/09/Liam_Fox_If_Afghanistan_will_be_lost_it_will_be_lost_at_home.aspx| title= If Afghanistan will be lost, it will be lost at home |last=Fox |first= Liam| date= 28 September 2009| accessdate=28 September 2009 |publisher=Conservative Party}}</ref> They have repeatedly criticised the former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] for failing to equip British Forces adequately in the earlier days on the campaign—especially highlighting the shortage of helicopters for British Forces resulting from Gordon Brown's £1.4bn cut to the helicopter budget in 2004.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2009/12/Liam_Fox_Armed_Forces_pay_for_Labours_incompetence.aspx| last=Fox|first=Liam| title= Armed Forces pay for Labour's incompetence| date= 15 December 2009 |publisher=Conservative Party}}</ref>

====Strategic Defence and Security Review====

The Conservative Party believes that in the 21st century defence and security are interlinked. They have pledged to break away from holding a traditional [[Strategic Defence Review]] and have committed to carrying out a more comprehensive [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Strategic Defence and Security Review]] (SDSR) immediately upon coming into office. This review will include both defence and homeland security related matters. The Labour Government last conducted a review in 1998. To prevent a long gap in the future they have also pledged to hold regular defence reviews every 4–5&nbsp;years, and if necessary will put this requirement into legislation. Party officials claim that the SDSR will be a major improvement, and will ensure that Britain maintains generic and flexible capability to adapt to any changing threats. It will be a cross-departmental review that will begin with foreign policy priorities and will bring together all the levers of domestic national security policy with overseas interests and defence priorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2009/09/Liam_Fox_If_Afghanistan_will_be_lost_it_will_be_lost_at_home.aspx |title=The Strategic Defence and Security Review: A Conservative View of Defence and Future Challenges |publisher=Royal United Services Institute |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>

As well as an SDSR, the Conservative Party pledged in 2010 to undertake a fundamental and far reaching review of the procurement process and how defence equipment is provided in Britain. They have pledged to reform the procurement process, compile a Green Paper on Sovereignty Capability, and publish another Defence Industrial Strategy following on from the Defence Industrial Strategy in 2005. The Conservative Party has said that there will be four aims for British defence procurement: to provide the best possible equipment at the best possible price; to streamline the procurement process to ensure the speedy delivery of equipment to the front line; to support our industry jobs at home by increasing defence exports; to provide defence procurement that underpins strategic relationships abroad and; to provide predictability to the defence industry.

The Conservative Party also pledged to increase Britain's share of the global defence market as Government policy.

====Europe and NATO====

The Conservative Party aims to build enhanced bilateral defence relations with key European partners and believes that it is in Britain's national interest to cooperate fully with all its European neighbours. They have pledged to ensure that any EU military capability must supplement and not supplant British national defence and [[NATO]], and that it is not in the British interest to hand over security to any supranational body.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web| url= http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2010/02/Liam_Fox_EU_should_only_act_when_NATO_cannot.aspx| title= The EU should only act when NATO cannot| date= 11 February 2010 |last=Fox |first=Liam |accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref>

The Conservatives see it as a priority to encourage all members of the European Union to do more in terms of a commitment to European security at home and abroad.

Regarding the defence role of the European Union, the Conservatives pledged to re-examine some of Britain's EU Defence commitments to determine their practicality and utility; specifically, to reassess UK participation provisions like Permanent Structured Cooperation, the [[European Defence Agency]] and EU Battlegroups to determine if there is any value in Britain's participation.

The Conservative Party upholds the view that NATO should remain the most important security alliance for United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2010/02/Liam_Fox_EU_should_only_act_when_NATO_cannot.aspx| title = Liam Fox: The EU should only act when NATO cannot| date= 11 February 2010| accessdate =20 April 2007 |publisher=Conservative Party}}</ref> They believe that NATO, which has been the cornerstone of British security for the past 60&nbsp;years, should continue to have primacy on all issues relating to Europe's defence, and pledged in 2010 to make NATO reform a key strategic priority.

They have also called on the so-called fighting/funding gap to be changed and have called on the creation of a fairer funding mechanism for NATO's expeditionary operations. As well as this, the Conservatives believe that there is scope for expanding NATO's Article V to include new 21st Century threats such as energy and cyber security.

====Nuclear weapons====
The 2010 manifesto said the Conservatives will maintain Britain's continuous at sea, independent, submarine based strategic nuclear deterrent based on the [[Trident nuclear programme|Trident missile system]].<ref name="autogenerated1" />

===Health policy===
In 1945, the Conservatives first declared support for universal healthcare.<ref>[http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/con45.htm British Conservative Party election manifesto, 1945 [Archive&#93;]. Politicsresources.net (22 October 2012).</ref> Since entering office in 2010, they have introduced the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Act]], constituting the biggest reformation that the NHS has ever undertaken. However, there has been much criticism and protest about the 2010 government's actions on the NHS, focussing on budget cuts and privatisation of services. After a 2013 [[Trades union|union]] protest said by police to have been one of the largest protests seen in Manchester, the general secretary of the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) said that austerity was having a devastating effect, with 21,000 NHS jobs lost over the previous three months alone, and that "The NHS is one of Britain's finest achievements and we will not allow ministers to destroy, through cuts and privatisation, what has taken generations to build." The Department of Health responded that there was "absolutely no government policy to privatise NHS services".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-24286582|title=50,000 march in NHS cuts protest in Manchester|work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Drug policies===
Views on drug legality and policing vary greatly within the conservative party. Some Conservative politicians such as [[Alan Duncan]] take the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] approach that individual freedom and economic freedom of industry and trade should be respected. Other Conservative politicians, despite being [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]], are in favour of full [[Prohibition of drugs|prohibition of the ownership and trade of many drugs]]. Other Conservatives are in the middle ground, favouring stances such as looser regulation and [[Drug liberalization#Drug decriminalization|decriminalisation]] of some drugs. Legalisation of [[Medical cannabis|cannabis for medical uses]] is favoured by some Conservative politicians, including [[Boris Johnson]].<ref>Johnson, Boris (24 April 2008). [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1902743/Boris-Johnson-Legalise-cannabis-for-pain-relief.html "Legalise cannabis for pain relief"]. ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London).</ref>

===Education policy===
In education, the Conservatives have pledged to review the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], and introduce the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education#English Baccalaureate|English Baccalaureate]]. The restoration of discipline was also highlighted, as they want it to be easier for pupils to be searched for contraband items, the granting of anonymity to teachers accused by pupils, and the banning of expelled pupils being returned to schools via appeal panels.

In Higher education, the Conservatives have increased tuition fees to £9,000 per year, however have ensured that this will not be paid by anyone until they are earning over £21,000, and that those who ''[[:wiktionary:fail|fail]]'' their studies, will not pay anything at all. The Scottish Conservatives also support the re-introduction of tuition fees in Scotland.

===Jobs and welfare policy===
One of the Conservatives' key policy areas of 2010, was to reduce the number of people in the UK claiming state benefits, and increase the number of people in the workforce. They have stated that all those in the UK claiming [[incapacity benefit]], will face a review of their cases. Until 1999, Conservatives opposed the creation of the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|National Minimum Wage]], citing that they believed it would cost jobs, and businesses would be reticent to start business in the UK from fear of high labour costs.<ref>[http://www.general-election-2010.co.uk/is-the-national-minimum-wage-safe-under-a-conservative-government-poll.html Is the National Minimum Wage Safe Under a Conservative Government Poll?]. General-election-2010.co.uk (5 May 2011).</ref> However the party have since pledged support and in the [[July 2015 United Kingdom budget|July 2015 Budget]], Chancellor George Osborne announced a national living wage of £9/hour, to be introduced by 2020, for those aged 25 and over.<ref name=measures>{{cite web|title=Budget 2015: Osborne commits to national living wage|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33437115|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=8 July 2015}}</ref> They support, and have implemented, the restoration of the link between pensions and earnings, and seek to raise retirement age from 65 to 66.

===Energy/climate change policy===
[[David Cameron]] brought several '[[Green conservatism|green]]' issues to the forefront of his 2010 campaign. These included proposals designed to impose a tax on workplace car parking spaces, a halt to airport growth, a tax on cars with exceptionally poor petrol mileage, and restrictions on car advertising. Many of these policies were implemented in the Coalition - including the 'Green Deal'<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml;jsessionid=ND2RNWDNYBJL3QFIQMGCFFOAVCBQUIV0?xml=/earth/2007/09/14/eacameron114.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=David Cameron pledges radical green shake-up |date=14 September 2007}}</ref>

===Justice and crime policy===
In 2010, the Conservatives campaigned with the conviction to cut the perceived bureaucracy of the modern police force and pledged greater legal protection to people convicted of defending themselves against intruders. They also supported the creation of a UK Bill of Rights to replace the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], but this was vetoed by their coalition partners the [[Liberal Democrats]]. Some Conservatives, particularly within the socially conservative [[Cornerstone Group]], support the re-introduction of the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]]; although the majority of party members oppose it.

===European Union policy===
No subject has proved more divisive in the Conservative Party in recent history than the role of the United Kingdom within the European Union. Though the principal architect of the UK's entry into the [[European Communities]] (which became the European Union) was Conservative Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], and both [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]] favoured some form of European union, the bulk of contemporary Conservative opinion is opposed to closer economic and particularly political union with the EU. This is a noticeable shift in British politics, as in the 1960s and 1970s the Conservatives were more pro-Europe than the Labour Party. Divisions on Europe came to the fore under the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979–1990) and were cited by several ministers resigning, including [[Geoffrey Howe]], the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], whose resignation triggered [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|the challenge that ended Thatcher's leadership]]. Under Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]] (1990–1997), the slow process of integration within the EU forced party tensions to the surface. A core of [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] MPs under Major used the small Conservative majority in Parliament to oppose Government policy on the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. By doing so they undermined Major's ability to govern.

In recent years the Conservative Party has become more clearly Eurosceptic, as the Labour Government has found itself unwilling to make a positive case for further integration, and Eurosceptic or pro-withdrawal parties such as the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] have made showings in UK elections. But under current EU practices, the degree to which a Conservative Government could implement policy change regarding the EU would depend directly on the willingness of other EU member states to agree to such policies.

In 2009 the Conservative Party actively campaigned against the [[Lisbon Treaty]], which it believes would give away too much sovereignty to Brussels. [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] stated that, should the Treaty be in force by the time of an incoming Conservative government, he would "not let matters rest there".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7470078.stm |work=BBC News |title=Cameron's Britain: Euro-doubts |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2010 |first=Mark |last=Mardell}}</ref> However, on 14 June 2009 the shadow Business Secretary, [[Kenneth Clarke]], said in an interview to the [[BBC]] that the Conservative party would not reopen negotiations on the Lisbon Treaty if the Irish backed it in a new referendum,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8099510.stm |work=BBC News |title= Clarke's treaty pledge sparks row |accessdate=14 June 2009 |date=14 June 2009}}</ref> which they did on 2 October 2009.

The Conservative Party pledged an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union after a renegotiation, the referendum will occur on the 23rd of June 2016.

===Union policy===
The Conservatives staunchly support the maintenance of the United Kingdom, and oppose the independence of any of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]]: [[English independence|England]], [[Scottish independence|Scotland]], [[Welsh independence|Wales]] or [[Irish republicanism|Northern Ireland]] from it. They have had a mixed history on support for [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish]], [[Welsh devolution|Welsh]] and [[Devolution for Northern Ireland|Northern Irish devolution]].

In 1968, [[Edward Heath]] issued his '[[Declaration of Perth|Perth declaration]]', in support of a Scottish assembly, in the wake of growing nationalism. However, the cause went unanswered during his turbulent premiership, and under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]]'s leadership, the Conservatives vehemently opposed devolution, and campaigned against it in the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|1997 devolution referendum]]. Following the [[Scottish Parliament]]'s establishment in 1999, they have vowed to support its continued existence, and along with Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they supported the [[Scotland Bill (2011)]], granting further devolution of power. They campaigned alongside Labour and the Liberal Democrats against full Scottish Independence in the 2014 [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish Independence referendum]].

In Wales, the Conservatives campaigned against devolution in the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 1997|1997 referendum]], however likewise as with Scotland, they have vowed to maintain the [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]]'s continued existence, and in 2011 supported the further devolution of power.

In Northern Ireland, the Conservatives suspended the parliament in 1973 in the wake of the growing [[The Troubles|Troubles]], and made unsuccessful attempts to re-establish it in the same year, and in 1982. They supported the [[Belfast Agreement]] negotiated by the Blair government in 1998, and in 2009, negotiated an electoral pact with the declining [[Ulster Unionist Party]], whom it had previously been allied to before 1973.

The party opposed Labour's attempts to [[Northern England devolution referendums, 2004|devolve power to the northern regions of England]] in 2004. They declared support for a commission into the [[West Lothian Question]], as to whether or not only English MPs should be able to vote on issues solely affecting English matters following the Scottish Independence Referendum.

===The British Constitution===
Traditionally the Conservative Party have been defenders of Britain's unwritten constitution and system of government. The party opposed many of [[Tony Blair]]'s reforms, such as the removal of the hereditary peers,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/216872.stm |title=Blair attacks hereditary peers |work=BBC News |date=18 November 1998 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> the incorporation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into British law, and the 2009 creation of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], a function formerly [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|carried out by the House of Lords]]. Until 2001 most members of the party were against an elected [[House of Lords]]; however opinion was later split, shown in the vote on the [[House of Lords Reform Bill 2012]], when 80 backbenchers voted for an 80% elected upper chamber, and 110 did not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/parliament/2012/07/80-tory-backbenchers-voted-for-lords-reform-last-night-110-did-not-.html |title=80 Tory backbenchers voted for Lords reform last night. 110 did not. Tory MPs |publisher=Conservative home |date=11 July 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> There was also a split on whether to introduce a British Bill of Rights which would replace the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]; David Cameron expressed support, but Ken Clarke described it as "xenophobic and legal nonsense".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5120894.stm |title=UK &#124; UK Politics &#124; Clarke slams Cameron rights plan |work=BBC News |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>

In the organisation of the Conservative Party, [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] associations dominate the election of party leaders and the selection of local candidates (although some associations have organised [[open primary|open]] [[Conservative Party (UK) parliamentary primaries|parliamentary primaries]]), while the [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters]] (CCHQ) leads [[Political funding in the United Kingdom|financing]], organisation of elections and drafting of policy. The leader of the [[1922 Committee|parliamentary party]] forms policy in consultation with his cabinet and administration. This decentralised structure is unusual.<ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants= Conservative and Unionist Central Office v.

The [[Conservative Party Board]] is the party's ultimate [[decision making]] body, responsible for all operational matters (including fundraising, membership and candidates) and is made up of representatives from each (voluntary, political and professional) section of the Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_the_Board.aspx |publisher=Conservative Party |title=members of the Board}}</ref> The Party Board meets about once a month and works closely with CCHQ, elected representatives and the voluntary membership mainly through a number of management sub-committees (such as membership, candidates and conferences).

=== Membership ===
The Conservative Party has a membership of paid-up supporters, which, {{As of|2014|September|lc=y}}, is 150,000.<ref name="Conservative Party membership has risen">{{cite news |last=Wallace |first=Mark |date=28 September 2014 |title=Conservative Party membership has risen to 149,800 – up 11.7 per cent |url=http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2014/09/conference-survey-and-membership-figures.html |newspaper=[[ConservativeHome]] |location= |accessdate=16 January 2015 }}</ref>  Membership peaked in the mid-1950s at approximately 3 million, before declining steadily through the second half of the 20th century.<ref name="hoclibrary">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05125.pdf|format=pdf|date=3 December 2012|first=Feargal|last=McGuinness|title=Membership of UK political parties|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref> Despite an initial boost shortly after [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|David Cameron's election as leader]] in December 2005, membership resumed its decline in 2006 to a lower level than when he was elected.

From April 2013 people could join [[Team2015]] without being Party members, and take part in political campaigning for the party in the 2015 general election.

===Conservative Future===
{{main|Conservative Future}}
The Conservative Party maintains a [[youth wing]] for members under 30 called [[Conservative Future]].  Conservative Future is the largest such youth wing in the United Kingdom, with approximately 20,000 members.<ref name="The restrained children">{{Cite news |title=The restrained children of Cameron |author=Rowenna Davis |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 October 2009 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/06/toryconference-conservatives }}</ref>  It has branches at both universities and at parliamentary constituency level.  This reflects Conservative Future's origin as a merger of the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]], [[Conservative Collegiate Forum]], and the [[National Association of Conservative Graduates]], brought about in 1998.  Young members in Scotland belong to an independent organisation, called [[Conservative Future Scotland]].

===Funding===
In the first decade of the 21st century, half the party's funding came from a cluster of just fifty "donor groups", and a third of it from only fifteen.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Crone, Stephen |author2=Wilks-Heeg, Stuart |date=20 December 2010 |title=Just 50 'donor groups' have supplied over half of the Conservative party's declared donation income in the last decade, a fact disguised by legal 'fame avoidance' techniques |url= http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/6272 |publisher=[[London School of Economics|British Politics and Policy blog at LSE]] |accessdate=10 July 2013}}</ref> In the year after the 2010 general election, half the Tories' funding came from the financial sector.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Syal, Rajeev |author2=Treanor, Jill |author3=Mathiason, Nick |date=30 September 2011 |title= City's influence over Conservatives laid bare by research into donations |url= http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/30/city-conservatives-donations |work=[[The Guardian]] |location= London |accessdate=10 July 2013}}</ref>

In 2004, according to accounts filed with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], the party had an income of about £20&nbsp;million and expenditures of about £26&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/ConservativeCentralOffice_17969-13291__E__N__S__W__.PDF |title=Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 |accessdate=20 April 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=The Conservative and Unionist Central Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909225456/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/ConservativeCentralOffice_17969-13291__E__N__S__W__.PDF |archivedate=9 September 2008 }}</ref><!--2010 statements are posted on the Electoral Commission website -->

===International organisations===
The Conservative Party is affiliated to — and plays a leading part in — a number of international organisations.  As a global level, the Conservatives are a member of the [[International Democrat Union]], which unites centre-right parties and its European subdivision, the [[European Democrat Union]].

As a European level, the Conservatives are members of the [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists]] (AECR), which unites centre-right parties in opposition to a federal [[European Union]].  In the European Parliament, the Conservative Party's MEPs sit in the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR) group, which is affiliated to the AECR.  Party leader David Cameron pushed the foundation of the ECR, which was launched in 2009, along with the Czech [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] and the Polish [[Law and Justice]], before which the Conservative Party's MEPs sat in the [[European Democrats]], which had become a subgroup of the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party]] in the 1990s.  Since the [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 European election]], the ECR group has been the third-largest group, with the largest members being the Conservatives (nineteen MEPs), Law and Justice (eighteen MEPs), the [[Alternative for Germany]] (seven MEPs), and the [[Danish People's Party]] and [[New Flemish Alliance]] (four MEPs each).

As of June 2009, Cameron required a further four partners apart from the Polish and Czech supports to qualify for official [[Political groups of the European Parliament|fraction]] status in the parliament; the rules state that a caucus needs at least 25 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from at least seven of the 27 [[EU member states]].<ref name="guardian_03062009">{{cite news|last=Traynor|first=Ian| title=Anti-gay, climate change deniers: meet David Cameron's new friends|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 June 2009|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/02/david-cameron-alliance-polish-nationalists|accessdate=2 June 2009|location=London}}</ref> In forming the caucus, Cameron is reportedly breaking with two decades of co-operation by the UK's Conservative Party with the mainstream European Christian Democrats and conservatives in the European parliament, the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) on the grounds that it is dominated by European [[federalism|federalists]] and supporters of the [[Lisbon treaty]], which is opposed by the Tories.<ref name="guardian_03062009" /> EPP leader [[Wilfried Martens]], former [[prime minister of Belgium]], stated "Cameron's campaign has been to take his party back to the centre in every policy area with one major exception: Europe. [...] I can't understand his tactics. [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]] will never accept his Euroscepticism."<ref name="guardian_03062009" />

==Party factions==
The Conservative Party has a variety of internal factions or ideologies, including<ref>{{cite news|title=Only 12% of Tory MPs choose Cameronism as political philosophy |first=Andrew |last=Sparrow |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 December 2009|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2009/dec/17/12-tory-mps-name-cameronism-philosophy|location=London}}</ref> [[Cameronism]],<ref name="new identity">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4446864.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - UK Politics - Cameron: Tories need new identity|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14115047 |title=Introducing Cameronism |work=BBC News |date=11 July 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> [[One-nation conservatism]], [[Cornerstone Group|Social conservatism]], [[Thatcherism]], [[British neoconservatism|Neoconservatism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gees.org/documentos/Documen-783.pdf |title=Document 783 |publisher=GEES |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/03/david-cameron-neoconservative-cabinet|title=The siren song of the neocons in David Cameron's cabinet|author=Richard Seymour|work=the Guardian}}</ref> [[Euroscepticism#Terminology|Hard euroscepticism]],<ref name="whitaker">{{cite news |title=Where There is Discord, Can They Bring Harmony?

===One-nation Conservatives===
[[One-nation conservatism]] was the party's dominant ideology in the 20th century until the rise of [[Thatcherism]] in the 1970s, and included in its ranks Conservative Prime Ministers such as [[Stanley Baldwin]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Edward Heath]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Garner |first2=Richard N. |last2=Kelly |title=British political parties today |year=1998 |page=66}}</ref> The name itself comes from a famous phrase of Disraeli. The basis of One-Nation Conservatism is a belief in social cohesion, and its adherents support social institutions that maintain harmony between different interest groups, classes, and—more recently—different races or religions. These institutions have typically included the [[welfare state]], the [[BBC]], and local government. Some are also supporters of the European Union, perhaps stemming from an extension of the cohesion principle to the international level, though others are strongly against the EU (such as [[Peter Tapsell (UK politician)|Sir Peter Tapsell]]). Prominent One Nation Conservatives in the contemporary party include [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]] and [[Damian Green]]; they are often associated with the [[Tory Reform Group]] and the [[Bow Group]]. One Nation Conservatives often invoke [[Edmund Burke]] and his emphasis on [[civil society]] ("little platoons") as the foundations of society, as well as his opposition to radical politics of all types.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Mark |last1=Garnett |first2=Philip |last2=Lynch |title=The Conservatives in crisis: the Tories after 1997 |year=1994 |page=194}}</ref> Ideologically, One Nation Conservatism identifies itself with a broad [[liberal conservative]] stance. The 'Red Tory' theory of [[Phillip Blond]] is a strand of the 'One Nation' school of thought. Prominent 'Red Tories' include [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Eric Pickles]] in the Cabinet and [[Jesse Norman]] on the backbenches.<ref>Politics Review, April 2013</ref>

===Free-market Conservatives===
The second main grouping in the Conservative party is the "free-market wing" of [[economic liberalism|economic liberals]] who achieved dominance after the election of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1975. Their goal was to reduce the role of the government in the economy and to this end they supported cuts in direct taxation, the [[privatisation]] of [[Nationalization|nationalised]] industries and a reduction in the size and scope of the welfare state. Supporters of the "free-market wing" have been labelled as "[[Thatcherites]]". The group has disparate views of social policy: Thatcher herself was [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] and a practising [[Anglican]] but the free-market wing in the Conservative Party harbour a range of social opinions from the [[civil libertarian]] views of [[Michael Portillo]], [[Daniel Hannan]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Despite Appearances Conservatism Remains the Dominant Ideology |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/category/libertarianism/page/3/ |newspaper=[[The American Conservative]] |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] to the [[traditional conservatism]] of former party leaders [[William Hague]] and [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. The Thatcherite wing is also associated with the concept of a "classless society."<ref>{{cite book |first=Tim |last=Bale |authorlink=Tim Bale |title=The Conservative Party: From Thatcher to Cameron |year=2011 |page=145}}</ref>

Most free-marketeers are also [[Eurosceptic]], perceiving most EU regulations as interference in the free market and/or a threat to British sovereignty. EU centralisation also conflicts with the localist ideals that have grown in prominence within the party in recent years. Rare Thatcherite Europhiles include [[Leon Brittan, Baron Brittan of Spennithorne|Leon Brittan]]. Many take inspiration from Thatcher's Bruges speech in 1988, in which she declared that "we have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only to see them reimposed at a European level". A number of free-market Conservatives have signed the [[Better Off Out]] pledge to leave the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betteroffout.net/supporters/ |title=Supporters |publisher=Better Off Out |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> Thatcherites and [[economic liberals]] in the party also tend to be [[Atlanticism|Atlanticist]], identifying strongly with the founding principles of the United States. This was demonstrated with the close friendship between Margaret Thatcher and US President [[Ronald Reagan]].

Thatcher herself claimed philosophical inspiration from the works of Burke and [[Friedrich Hayek]] for her defence of liberal economics. Groups associated with this tradition include the [[No Turning Back (political group)|No Turning Back]] Group and [[Conservative Way Forward]], whilst [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Sir Keith Joseph]] are usually cited as early influences in the movement.<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric J. |last=Evans |title=Thatcher and Thatcherism |year=2004 |pages=6, 72}}</ref>

===Traditionalist Conservatives===
This [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] right-wing grouping is currently associated with the [[Cornerstone Group]] (or Faith, Family, Flag), and is the third main tradition within the Conservative Party. The name stems from its support for three British social institutions (though the Church is an English institution): the [[Church of England]], the [[unitary state|unitary British state]] and the family. To this end, they emphasise the country's [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] heritage, oppose any transfer of power away from the United Kingdom—either downwards to the nations and regions or upwards to the European Union—and seek to place greater emphasis on traditional family structures to repair what they see as a broken society in the UK. They are strong advocates of marriage and believe the Conservative Party should back the institution with tax breaks and have opposed Labour's alleged assault on both traditional family structures and fatherhood. Most oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24&nbsp;week abortion limit. Some members in the past have expressed support for capital punishment. Prominent MPs from this wing of the party include [[Andrew Rosindell]], [[Nadine Dorries]] and [[Edward Leigh]]—the latter a prominent Roman Catholic, notable in a faction marked out by its support for the established Church of England. The conservative English philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] is a representative of the intellectual wing of the Cornerstone group: his writings rarely touch on economics and instead focus on conservative perspectives concerning political, social, cultural and moral issues.

===Relationships between the factions===
Sometimes two groupings have united to oppose the third. Both Thatcherite and Traditionalist Conservatives rebelled over Europe (and in particular Maastricht) during [[John Major]]'s premiership; and Traditionalist and One Nation MPs united to inflict Margaret Thatcher's only major defeat in Parliament, over Sunday trading.

Not all Conservative MPs can be easily placed within one of the above groupings. For example, John Major was the ostensibly "Thatcherite" candidate during the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|1990 leadership election]], but he consistently promoted One-Nation Conservatives to the higher reaches of his cabinet during his time as Prime Minister. These included [[Kenneth Clarke]] as Chancellor of the Exchequer and [[Michael Heseltine]] as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page2384.html |title=Mr Major's Third Cabinet |publisher=John Major |date=25 September 1992 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>
