The '''Atlantic Coast Conference''' ('''ACC''') is a collegiate [[List of NCAA conferences|athletic conference]] in the [[United States of America]] in which its fifteen member universities compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA)'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], with its [[College football|football]] teams competing in the  [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally.

ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. Also, the conference enjoys extensive media coverage. The ACC was one of the six collegiate [[power conferences]], which had automatic qualifying for their football champion into the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS). With the advent of the [[College Football Playoff]] in 2014, the ACC is one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an "access bowl", the successors to the BCS.

Founded in 1953 in [[Sedgefield, North Carolina]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Depression Kept Sedgefield from Intended Course|last=Schlosser|first=Jim|work=[[News & Record]]|date=June 28, 1998|page=A1}}</ref> by seven universities located in the [[South Atlantic States]], the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, 2005, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the [[University of Notre Dame]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[Syracuse University]]. In 2012, the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the [[Big Ten Conference]]. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the [[University of Louisville]] as a full member, replacing Maryland.<ref name="Atlantic Coast Conference">{{cite web|title=ACC Extends Formal Invitation for Membership to the University of Louisville|url=http://www.theacc.com/genrel/112812aaa.html|publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference|date=Nov 28, 2012|accessdate=Nov 28, 2012}}</ref>

ACC member universities represent a range of well-regarded private and public universities of various enrollment sizes, all of which participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Consortium whose purpose is to "enrich the educational missions, especially the undergraduate student experiences, of member universities".

==History==
[[File:Atlantic Coast Conference Map 2014.png|300px|right|thumb|Locations of Atlantic Coast Conference member institutions as of July 1, 2014. Louisville joined on July 1, 2014, replacing Maryland, which left for the Big Ten Conference.]]

===1950s–1990s===
Seven universities in the [[South Atlantic States]] were charter members of the ACC: [[Clemson University|Clemson]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina State]], [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]]. Previously members of the [[Southern Conference]], they left partially due to that league's ban on post-season football play. After drafting a set of bylaws for the creation of a new league, the seven withdrew from the Southern Conference at the spring meeting on the morning of May 8, 1953. The bylaws were ratified on June 14, 1953, and the ACC was created, becoming the second conference formed by schools collectively withdrawing from the SoCon, after the [[Southeastern Conference]]. On December 4, 1953, officials convened in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], and admitted [[University of Virginia|Virginia]], a SoCon charter member that had been independent since 1937, into the conference.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the ACC|url=http://www.theacc.com/this-is/acc-this-is.html|publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference|accessdate=February 3, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65Bl9Updo|archivedate=February 3, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>

In 1960, the ACC implemented a minimum SAT score for incoming student-athletes of 750, the first conference to do so. This minimum was raised to 800 in 1964, but was ultimately struck down by a federal court in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|title=ACC Basketball|url=http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/author_interview?title_id=2207|publisher=UNC Press|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref>
  
In 1971, South Carolina left the ACC to become an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]]. The ACC operated with seven members until the addition of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] from the [[Metro Conference]] on April 3, 1978. The total number of member schools reached nine with the addition of [[Florida State University|Florida State]], also formerly from the Metro Conference, on July 1, 1991. The additions of those schools marked the first expansions of the conference footprint since 1953, though both schools were still located with the rest of the ACC schools in the South Atlantic States.

===2000–present===
The ACC added three members from the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] during the [[2005 NCAA football realignment|2005 conference realignment]]: [[University of Miami|Miami]] and [[Virginia Tech]] joined on July 1, 2004, and [[Boston College]] joined on July 1, 2005, as the league's twelfth member and the first from the Northeast. The expansion was controversial, as [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], and [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] (and, initially, Virginia Tech) filed lawsuits against the ACC, Miami, and Boston College for conspiring to weaken the Big East Conference.

The ACC Hall of Champions opened on March 2, 2011, next to the Greensboro Coliseum arena, making the ACC the second college sports conference to have a [[hall of fame]] after the [[Southern Conference]] (SoCon).<ref>{{cite web|title=ACC Hall of Champions Debuts|date=March 2, 2011|publisher=Source Interlink Magazines, LLC|work=SlamOnline.com|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/college-hs/college/2011/03/acc-hall-of-champions-debuts/|accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref><ref>The [[Southern Conference Hall of Fame]] opened in 2009. {{cite news|title=Southern Conference Announces Inaugural Hall of Fame Class|publisher=Southern Conference|date=2009-01-28|accessdate=2009-01-28|url=http://www.soconsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4000&ATCLID=3655202}}</ref>

On September 17, 2011, Big East Conference members Syracuse University and the University of Pittsburgh both tendered formal written applications to the ACC to join its ranks.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thamel|first=Pete|title=Big East Exit Is Said to Begin for Syracuse and Pittsburgh|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/sports/big-east-exit-is-said-to-begin-for-syracuse-and-pittsburgh.html|accessdate=September 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61m0oQz3S|archivedate=September 17, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> The two schools were accepted into the conference the following day, once again expanding the conference footprint like previous expansions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clarke|first=Liz|title=ACC expands to 14 with addition of Syracuse, Pittsburgh|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/acc-expands-to-14-with-addition-of-syracuse-pittsburgh/2011/09/18/gIQAL4aOcK_story.html|accessdate=September 18, 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 18, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61naZMrU0|archivedate=September 18, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> Because the Big East intended to hold Pitt and Syracuse to the 27-month notice period required by league bylaws, the most likely entry date into the ACC (barring negotiations) was July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=John|title=Big East to force Pitt, Syracuse to stay until 2014|url=http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/09/20/big-east-to-force-pitt-syracuse-to-stay-until-2014/related/|work=College Football Talk|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=September 26, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61zndMVvG|archivedate=September 26, 2011|date=September 20, 2011}}</ref> However, on July 16, 2012, the Big East and Syracuse came to an agreement that allowed Syracuse to leave the Big East on July 1, 2013.<ref name="SU Leaves Big East in 2013">{{cite web|title=SU, BIG EAST Reach Agreement for Orange to Move to ACC in 2013|url=http://suathletics.com/news/2012/7/16/GEN_0716123244.aspx|publisher=Syracuse Athletics|accessdate=16 July 2012|date=16 July 2012}}</ref> Two days later, the Big East and Pittsburgh reached an identical agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/235709/big-east-conference-university-of-pittsburgh-reach-agreement-on-pittsburgh-depa.aspx|title=BIG EAST Conference, University of Pittsburgh Reach Agreement on Pittsburgh Departure From The BIG EAST|publisher=}}</ref>

On September 12, 2012, Notre Dame agreed to join the ACC in all sports except football and hockey as the conference's first-ever member in the [[Midwestern United States]].

On November 19, 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the [[Big Ten Conference]] effective in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=Prewitt|first=Alex|title=Maryland moving to Big Ten|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/terrapins-insider/wp/2012/11/19/maryland-approves-move-to-big-ten-reports-say/|accessdate=2012-11-19|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 19, 2012}}</ref> The following week, the Big East's University of Louisville accepted the ACC's invitation to become a full member, replacing Maryland effective July 1, 2014.<ref name="Atlantic Coast Conference"/>

The ACC's presidents announced on April 22, 2013, that all 15 schools that will be members of the conference in 2014–15 had signed a grant of media rights, effective immediately and running through the 2026–27 school year, coinciding with the duration of the conference's current TV deal with [[ESPN]]. This move essentially prevents the ACC from being a target for other conferences seeking to expand—under the grant, if a school leaves the conference during the contract period, all revenue derived from that school's media rights for home games would belong to the ACC and not the school.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9200081/acc-media-rights-deal-lock-schools-okd-presidents |title=Media deal OK'd to solidify ACC |first=Brett |last=McMurphy |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> The move also leaves the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] as the only one of the so-called "Power Five" FBS conferences without a grant of rights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/acc/post/_/id/54697/you-want-stability-look-at-the-acc |title=You want stability?

==Member schools==

===Current members===
The ACC has fifteen members. For two of the 25 ACC-administered sports, baseball and football, schools are assigned to one of two seven-team divisions named the Atlantic Division and the Coastal Division. One member, Notre Dame, plays baseball in the Atlantic Division but does not compete in ACC football, instead competing as a [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|football independent]] while playing a rotating selection of five ACC football teams per season. Syracuse does not field a varsity baseball team, but competes in the Atlantic Division for football.

On July 1, 2014, Maryland departed for the [[Big Ten Conference]] as Louisville joined from the [[American Athletic Conference]] (formerly, the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]]). In 1971, South Carolina left the ACC to become [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]], later joining the [[Metro Conference]] in 1983 and moving to its current home, the [[Southeastern Conference]], in 1991.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Notre Dame sponsors football as an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]]. Although Notre Dame has a commitment to play five games per year against ACC football teams, it does not participate in the ACC football standings and thus is not eligible for the ACC football championship. Notre Dame does, however, have access to the ACC's bowl lineup aside from the Orange Bowl, to which it has its own arrangement for access.

^ Miami participates in diving only. For the purposes of this chart, Miami men's diving is counted as sponsoring half of the sport of men's swimming & diving.

The ACC has won the College World Series twice: by the [[Virginia Cavaliers]] in 2015 and by Wake Forest in 1955. However, conference schools have won six times, including four titles by Miami before joining the ACC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia's 4-2 Win Over Vandy Gives ACC 1st Title Since 1955|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/virginias-win-vandy-acc-1st-title-1955-32013910|website=ABC News|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>  Member schools have appeared in the [[College World Series]] a combined total of 88 times. In 2013, the ACC was ranked as the top baseball conference by [[Ratings Percentage Index]] (RPI) and has consistently ranked among the top three conference by that measure over the past five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://WarrenNolan.com/baseball/2013/conferencerpi|title=Conference RPI|publisher=WarrenNolan.com|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref> In 2013, eight ACC teams, plus future ACC member Louisville, were selected to play in the [[2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament]], with North Carolina, NC State, and Louisville advancing to the College World Series.

ACC Baseball is divided into two divisions, the Atlantic Division and the Coastal Division, that parallel the divisions of ACC football except for the fact that Syracuse is the only ACC school that does not field a baseball team and Notre Dame is assigned to the Atlantic Division. Louisville replaced Maryland in the Atlantic Division beginning with the 2015 season.

{{See also|ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Women's Basketball Tournament|List of Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball regular season champions|ACC–Big Ten Challenge}}

===History===
Historically, the ACC has been considered one of the most successful conferences in men's basketball. The early roots of ACC basketball began primarily thanks to two men: [[Everett Case]] and [[Frank McGuire]].

Case had been a successful high school coach in [[Indiana]] who accepted the head coaching job at North Carolina State at a time that the school's athletic department had decided to focus on competing in football on a level with Duke, then a national power in college football. Case's North Carolina State teams dominated the early years of the ACC with a modern, fast-paced style of play. He became the fastest college basketball coach to reach many "games won" milestones.

Case eventually became known as ''The Father of ACC Basketball.'' Despite his success on the court, he may have been even a better promoter off-the-court. Case realized the need to sell his program and university. That is why he organized the funding and construction of [[Reynolds Coliseum]]  as the new home court for his team. At the time, Reynolds Coliseum was the largest on-campus arena in the South, and it was therefore used as the host site for many Southern Conference Tournaments, ACC Tournaments, and the ''[[Dixie Classic (basketball tournament)|Dixie Classic]]'', an annual event involving the four ACC teams from North Carolina as well as four other prominent programs from across the nation. The Dixie Classic brought in large revenues for all schools involved and soon became one of the premier sporting events in the [[Southern United States|South]].

Partly to counter Case's personality, as well as the dominant success of his program, North Carolina convinced [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]] head coach Frank McGuire to come to Chapel Hill in 1952. McGuire knew that largely due to Case's influence, basketball was now the major high school athletic event of the region, unlike football in the South. He not only tapped the growing market of high school talent in North Carolina, but also brought several recruits from his home territory in New York City as well. Case and McGuire literally ''invented'' a rivalry. Both men realized the benefits created through a rivalry between them. It brought more national attention to both of their programs and increased fan support on both sides. For this reason, they often exchanged verbal jabs at each other in public, while maintaining a secret working relationship in private.

After State was slapped with crippling NCAA sanctions before the 1956-57 season, McGuire's North Carolina team stepped into the breach and delivered the ACC its first national championship. During the Tar Heels' championship run, entrepreneur from Greensboro named Castleman D. Chesley noticed the popularity that it generated. He hastily cobbled together a five-station television network to broadcast the Final Four. That network began broadcasting regular season ACC games the following season—the ancestor of today's television package from [[Raycom Sports]]. From that point on, ACC basketball gained large popularity.

The ACC has been the home of many prominent basketball coaches besides Case and McGuire, including [[Terry Holland]] and [[Tony Bennett (basketball)|Tony Bennett]] of Virginia; [[Vic Bubas]] and [[Mike Krzyzewski]] of Duke; [[Press Maravich]], [[Norm Sloan]] and [[Jim Valvano]] of North Carolina State; [[Dean Smith]] and [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] of North Carolina; [[Bones McKinney]] of Wake Forest; [[Lefty Driesell]] and [[Gary Williams]] of Maryland; [[Bobby Cremins]] of Georgia Tech; [[Jim Boeheim]] of Syracuse; and [[Rick Pitino]] of Louisville.

Historically, the ACC has been dominated by the four teams from [[Tobacco Road]] in North Carolina—North Carolina, Duke, North Carolina State and Wake Forest. Between them, they have won 50 tournament titles. They have also won or shared 59 regular season titles, including all but four since 1981. However, the past several years have seen the rise of the Tony Bennett led Virginia Cavaliers, who became the first ACC team besides Duke or North Carolina to solely win back to back regular season titles since 1974, winning the regular season titles in 2014 and 2015, along with winning the ACC Tournament Championship in 2014. Tony Bennett also became the first ACC men's basketball coach to win 16 or more conference games in back to back seasons in the history of ACC men's basketball.

===Tournament as championship===
Possibly Case's most lasting contribution is the [[ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], which was first played in 1954 and decides the winner of the ACC title. The ACC is unique in that it is the only Division I college basketball conference that does not officially recognize a regular season champion. This started when only one school per conference made the NCAA tournament. The ACC representative was determined by conference tournament rather than the regular season result. Therefore, the league eliminated the regular season title in 1961, choosing to recognize only the winner of the ACC tournament as conference champion. Fans and media do claim a regular-season title for the team that finishes first, and the NCAA recognizes a regular-season title winner in order to maintain its system of choosing [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] and NCAA tournament berths based on regular season placement.<ref>{{cite web|title=March Madness Swells as NCAA Pumps Up NIT Tournament|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aMw7OarRcGLI&refer=us|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2013-03-21|date=2006-03-14}}</ref> For the ACC, the unofficial crowning of a regular season champion is insignificant as a 1975 NCAA rule change allowed more than one team per conference to earn a bid to the NCAA Tournament. As a result, the team finishing atop the ACC regular-season standings has invariably been invited to the NCAA Tournament even if it did not win the ACC Tournament. Even so, any claim to a regular season "title" remains unofficial and carries no reward other than top seed in the ACC tournament.

===Present-day schedule===
For 53 years, the ACC employed a double round-robin schedule in the regular season, in which each team played the others twice a season. With the expansion to 12 teams by the 2005–2006 season, the ACC schedule could no longer accommodate this format. In the new scheduling format that was agreed to, each team was assigned two permanent partners and nine rotating partners over a three-year period.<ref>The Triangle teams' original partners, which have since been varied (for example, Duke's original partners were North Carolina and Maryland and, as reflected in the table in the body of the article, are now North Carolina and Wake Forest) can be found here:  http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/acc/2005-02-25-12-team-schedule_x.htm</ref>  Teams played their permanent partners in a home-and-away series each year. The rotating partners were split into three groups: three teams played in a home-and-away series, three teams played at home, and three teams played on the road. The rotating partner groups were rotated so that a team would play each permanent partner six times, and each rotating partner four times, over a three-year period.

Since 1999, the ACC in cooperation with the [[Big Ten Conference]] has held the [[ACC–Big Ten Challenge]] each season, which is a series of regular-season games pitting ACC and Big Ten teams against each other. Each team typically plays one Challenge game each season, except for a few teams from the larger conference that are left out due to unequal conference sizes. The first [[ACC–Big Ten Women's Challenge]] was played in 2007, and has the same format as the men's Challenge.

For the 2012–13 season, the 12-team in-conference schedule expanded to 18. Originally for the 2013-14 season, the expanded 14-team, 18-game schedule was to consist of a home and away game with a "primary partner" while the remaining conference opponents would have rotated in groups of three: one year both home and away, one year at home only, and one year away only.<ref>{{cite web|title=ACC Announces Future Regular-Season Scheduling Formats|url=http://www.theacc.com/genrel/020312aaa.html|publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference|accessdate=2012-02-07|date=2012-02-03}}</ref> However, when Notre Dame was also added for the 2013-14 season, the now 15-team, 18-game schedule was modified so each school played two "Partners" home and away annually, two home and away, five home, and the other five away.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/blog/_/name/katz_andy/id/8460836/acc-gets-right-new-scheduling-format-men-college-basketball |title=Expanding ACC sets primary partners |first=Andy |last=Katz |authorlink=Andy Katz |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=October 4, 2012 |accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref> In 2013-14, after 1 year at 18 games, women's basketball went back to a 16-game schedule where each team only plays 2 teams twice, rotating opponents each year over seven years and has no permanent partners.

The table below lists each school's permanent men's basketball only scheduling partners after expansion in 2013 and the replacement of Maryland by Louisville in 2014.

===National championships and Final Fours===
Over the course of its existence, ACC schools have captured 13 NCAA men's basketball championships while members of the conference. [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] has won five, [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] has won five, [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State]] has won two, and [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]] has won one. Four more national titles were won by current ACC members while in other conferences—three by 2014 arrival [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] and one by 2013 arrival [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]]. Seven of the 12 pre-2013 members have advanced to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Final Four|Final Four]] at least once while members of the ACC. Another pre-2013 member, [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]], made the Final Four once before joining the ACC. All three schools that entered the ACC in 2013, as well as Louisville, advanced to the Final Four at least once before joining the conference. In addition North Carolina, Notre Dame, Pitt, and Syracuse were awarded [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] national championships for seasons predating the beginning of the NCAA basketball championship in 1939.

In women's basketball, ACC members have won two national championships while in the conference, [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]] in 1994 and [[Maryland Terrapins women's basketball|Maryland]] in 2006. [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball|Notre Dame]], which joined in 2013, won the national title in 2001. In 2006, Duke, Maryland, and North Carolina all advanced to the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]], the first time a conference placed three teams in the women's Final Four. Both finalists were from the ACC, with Maryland defeating Duke for the title.

==Football==
{{See also|List of Atlantic Coast Conference football champions|ACC Championship Game}}

The ACC is considered to be one of the [[Power Five conferences]], all of which receive automatic placement of their football champions into one of the six major bowl games. Seven of its members claim [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|football national championships]] in their history, with two having won the now-defunct Bowl Championship Series (BCS) during its existence between 1998 and 2014. Five of its members are among the top 25 of college football's all-time winningest programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/misc/div_ia_wins.php|title=Division I-A All-Time Wins|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref>

===Divisions===
In 2005, the ACC began divisional play in football. Division leaders compete in a playoff game to determine the ACC championship. The inaugural Championship Game was played on December 3, 2005, in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], at the venue then known as [[EverBank Field|Alltel Stadium]], in which Florida State defeated Virginia Tech to capture its 12th championship since it joined the league in 1992. Notre Dame began playing several ACC teams each year in 2014, but is not considered a football member and is not eligible to play in the ACC Championship Game.<ref name="notredame">{{cite web|title=Notre Dame sets ACC schedule for 2014-16|author=Chip Patterson|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=April 28, 2014|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/24381940/notre-dame-sets-acc-schedule-for-2014-16}}</ref>

The ACC was the only NCAA Division I conference whose divisions were not divided geographically (North/South, East/West)<ref>[http://espn.go.com/college-football/standings NCAA College Football Standings] Accessed March 3, 2010</ref> until the [[Big Ten Conference#Divisions|Big Ten]] announced its division names as "Leaders" and "Legends" after the 2010 regular season.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/12/big-ten-division-names-legends-and-leaders.html | title=Big Ten division names: Legends and Leaders | first=Teddy | last=Greenstein | newspaper=Chicago Breaking Sports | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=December 13, 2010 | accessdate=December 13, 2010}}</ref> The Big Ten changed to geographic divisions ("East" and "West") when Maryland and [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Rutgers]] joined that conference in 2014, and the [[Mountain West Conference]], which split into football divisions in 2013, uses "Mountain" and "West" for its division names, with all of the Mountain Division teams in the [[Mountain Time Zone]] and all of the West Division teams except football-only member [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Hawaii]] in the [[Pacific Time Zone]], which means that the ACC is once again the only Division I conference with non-geographic divisions.

The previous division structure led to each team playing the following games:
* Five games within its division (one against each opponent)
* One game against a designated ''permanent rival'' from the other division (not necessarily the school's closest traditional rival, even within the conference); this is similar to the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] setup
* Two rotating games (one home, one away) against teams in the other division
* Four out-of-conference games.

On February 3, 2012, the ACC announced a new regular-season scheduling format which added Syracuse to the Atlantic Division and Pittsburgh to the Coastal Division. These new teams were paired as cross-divisional rivals. This change took effect when Pitt and Syracuse joined the conference in July 2013. On October 3, 2012, it was announced that the extra in-division game would result in one fewer cross-division game.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8456886/acc-keep-8-game-league-football-schedule | title=ACC sticks with 8-game schedule | date=October 2, 2012 | publisher=espn | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>

The current division structure leads to each team playing the following games:
* Six games within its division (three home, three away, one against each opponent)
* One game against a designated ''permanent rival'' from the other division (not necessarily the school's closest traditional rival, even within the conference); this is similar to the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] setup
* One rotating game against a team in the other division
* Four out-of-conference games. (Beginning with the 2014 season, one of the four OOC games will be against Notre Dame every two to three years, as Notre Dame will play against five ACC opponents in non-conference games each season.)

Starting with the 2017 season, ACC members will be required to play at least one non-conference game each season against a team in the "Power 5" conferences. Games against Notre Dame also meet the requirement. In January 2015, the conference announced that games against another [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|FBS independent]], [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]], would also count toward the requirement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/12247690/acc-count-games-byu-cougars-nonleague-power-5-opponent |title=ACC: BYU to count as Power 5 team |first=Brett |last=McMurphy |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=January 29, 2015 |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> ACC teams can also meet the requirement by scheduling one another in non-conference games; the first example of this was also announced in January 2015, when North Carolina and Wake Forest announced that they would play a home-and-home non-conference series in 2019 and 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/12230742/acc-rivals-north-carolina-tar-heels-wake-forest-demon-deacons-agree-nonconference-series |title=UNC, Wake agree to non-ACC series |first=Andrea |last=Adelson |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=January 26, 2015 |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref>

In the table below, each column represents one division. Each team's designated permanent rival is listed in the same row in the opposing column.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.theacc.com/genrel/101804aaa.html | title=ACC Unveils Future League Seal, Divisional Names | date=October 18, 2004 | publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference | accessdate=October 18, 2009}}</ref> Alignments reflect those in place since Louisville joined the ACC in 2014.

===Bowl games===
Within the [[College Football Playoff]], the [[Orange Bowl]] serves as the home of the ACC champion against Notre Dame or another team from the SEC or Big Ten. If the conference's champion is selected for the CFP, another ACC team will be chosen in their place.

The other bowls pick ACC teams in the order set by agreements between the conference and the bowls.

Beginning in 2014, Notre Dame is eligible for selection as the ACC's representative to any of its contracted bowl games. The ACC's bowl selection will no longer be bound by the rigidity of a "one-win rule" but will have a general list of criteria to emphasize regionality and quality matchups on the field. A one-win rule does apply to Notre Dame's participation in the ACC Bowl structure. Notre Dame is now eligible for ACC Bowl selection beginning with the Citrus Bowl and continuing through the league's bowl selections. However, Notre Dame must be within one win of the ACC available team which has the best overall record, in order to be chosen. In other words, if an ACC team was 9-3, a 7-5 Notre Dame team could not be chosen in its place. Notre Dame would have to be 8-4 to be chosen over a 9-3 league team.

===National championships===
Although the NCAA does not determine an official [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champion]] for Division I FBS football, several ACC members claim national championships awarded by various "major selectors" of national championships as recognized in the official ''NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records''.<ref name="full list">{{cite book | url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2011/FBS.pdf | title=2011 NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records | pages=70–75 | publisher=The National Collegiate Athletic Association | date=August 2011 | location=Indianapolis, IN | accessdate=2011-10-17}}</ref> Since 1936 and 1950 respectively, these include what are now the most pervasive and influential selectors, the [[Associated Press]] poll and [[Coaches Poll]]. In addition, from 1998 to 2013 the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) used a mathematical formula to match the top two teams at the end of the season. The winner of the BCS was contractually awarded the Coaches' Poll national championship and its [[AFCA National Championship Trophy]] as well as the [[MacArthur Trophy]] from the [[National Football Foundation]]. Maryland won one championship as a member of the ACC in 1953.

==Soccer==
In men's soccer, [[Virginia Cavaliers men's soccer|Virginia]] has won 7 NCAA titles, and more since 1990 than any other university in the country. The ACC overall has won 16 national championships, including 16 of the 31 seasons between 1984 and 2014. Seven by Virginia and the remaining nine by ''Maryland (3 times)'', Clemson (twice), North Carolina (twice), Duke, Wake Forest, and Notre Dame.

In women's soccer, [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's soccer|North Carolina]] has won 21 of the 28 NCAA titles since the NCAA crowned its first champion, as well as the only [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] (AIAW) soccer championship in 1981. The Tar Heels have also won 18 of the 22 ACC tournaments. They lost in the final to North Carolina State in 1988 and Virginia in 2004, both times by [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty kicks]]. The 2010 tournament was the first in which they failed to make the championship game, falling to eventual champion Wake Forest in the semi-finals. The 2012 ACC tournament saw North Carolina's first-ever quarterfinal loss, to eventual champion Virginia; however, the Tar Heels went on to win the national title that season. In 2014, Florida State became the first school other than North Carolina to win the national championship as an ACC member.

The members of the ACC also participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Consortium (ACCAC), a consortium that provides a vehicle for inter-institutional academic and administrative collaboration between member universities. Growing out of a conference-wide doctoral student-exchange program that was established in 1999, the ACCAC has expanded its scope into other domestic and international collaborations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/2006/Briefly+in+the+News/briefly%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bnews%2B-%2B3-13-06%2Bncaa%2Bnews.html|title=ACC takes worldwide approach to academic programs|first=Leilana|last=McKindra|newspaper=The NCAA News|date=March 13, 2006|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref>

The stated mission of the ACCAC is to "leverage the athletic associations and identities among the 15 ACC universities in order to enrich the educational missions of member universities." To that end, the collaborative helps organize various academic initiatives, including fellowship and scholarship programs, global research initiatives, leadership conferences, and extensive study abroad programs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-07-14/sports/36903690_1_acc-recruits-north-carolina-state/2|title=ACC's Forward Progress Limited; Expanded Conference Rates Mixed Reviews at 5-Year Mark|first=Steve|last=Yanda|newspaper=The Washington Post|location=Washington, DC|date=July 14, 2008|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref> Funding for its operations, 90% of which is spent on direct student support, is derived from a portion of the income generated by the [[ACC Championship Game|ACC Football Championship Game]] and by supplemental allocations by individual universities and various grants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acciac.org/about-the-acciac/|title=About the ACCIAC|first=David G. |last=Brown|year=2009|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>
