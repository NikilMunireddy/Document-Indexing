'''Hurricane Katrina'''  was the eleventh [[Tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] and fifth hurricane of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It was the [[List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes|costliest]] natural disaster, as well as one of the five [[List of deadliest Atlantic hurricanes|deadliest]] [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]], in the [[history of the United States]]. The storm is currently ranked as the third most intense United States landfalling tropical cyclone, behind only the [[1935 Labor Day hurricane]] and [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969. Overall, at least 1,245&nbsp;people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods, making it the deadliest United States hurricane since the [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane]]. Total property damage was estimated at $108 billion (2005 USD),<ref name="KatrinaTCR">{{cite report|author=Knabb, Richard D|author2=Rhome, Jamie R|author3=Brown, Daniel P|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL122005_Katrina}}|format=PDF|title=Hurricane Katrina: August 23 – 30, 2005|author4=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 8, 2016|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|date=December 20, 2005|type=Tropical Cyclone Report}}</ref> roughly four times the damage wrought by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992.<ref name="andrewtcr">{{cite report|author=Rappaport, Edward N|author2=National Hurricane Center|date=December 10, 1993|accessdate=January 1, 2013|title=Hurricane Andrew: August 16 – 28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1992andrew.html|type=Preliminary Report|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service}}</ref>

Katrina originated over the Bahamas on August&nbsp;23 from the interaction between a [[tropical wave]] and the remnants of [[Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten]]. Early the following day, the new depression intensified into Tropical Storm Katrina. The cyclone headed generally westward toward [[Florida]] and strengthened into a hurricane only two hours before making landfall [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]] on August&nbsp;25. After very briefly weakening to a tropical storm, Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August&nbsp;26 and began to [[Rapid deepening|rapidly deepen]]. The storm strengthened to a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 5|Category 5]] hurricane over the warm waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but weakened before making its second landfall as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 3|Category 3]] hurricane on August 29 in southeast Louisiana.

Katrina caused severe destruction along the Gulf coast from central Florida to Texas, much of it due to the [[storm surge]] and [[levee]] failure. Severe property damage occurred in coastal areas, such as [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Mississippi|Mississippi beachfront towns]]; over 90 percent of these were flooded. Boats and casino barges rammed buildings, pushing cars and houses inland; water reached {{convert|6|-|12|mi|km|0}} from the beach.

Over fifty breaches in [[New Orleans]]'s hurricane surge protection are the cause of the majority of the death and destruction during Katrina on August 29, 2005. Eventually 80% of the city and large tracts of neighboring [[list of parishes of Louisiana|parishes]] became flooded, and the floodwaters lingered for weeks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Plyer|first=Allison|title=Facts for Features: Katrina Impact|publisher=The Data Center|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=2016-02-22|url= http://www.datacenterresearch.org/data-resources/katrina/facts-for-impact/}}</ref> At least 1,400 died directly due to levee failure. All of the major studies concluded that the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE), the designers and builders of the levee system as mandated by the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]], is responsible. This is mainly due to a decision to use shorter steel sheet pilings in an effort to save money.<ref>{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Campbell|title=Decade after Katrina pointing finger more firmly at Army Corps|publisher=New York Times|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=2015-10-31|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/us/decade-after-katrina-pointing-finger-more-firmly-at-army-corps.html?_r=3}}</ref> In January 2008, Judge [[Stanwood Duval]], U.S. District Court, ruled that despite the corps role in the flooding, the agency<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nossiter|first=Adam|title=In Court Ruling on Floods, More Pain for New Orleans|publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/us/01corps.html?_r=2&ref=us|date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}</ref> could not be held financially liable because of [[sovereign immunity]] in the [[Flood Control Act of 1928]]. Exactly ten years after Katrina, J. David Rogers, lead author of a new report in the official journal of the [[World Water Council]] concluded that the flooding during Katrina "could have been prevented had the corps retained an external review board to double-check its flood-wall designs."<ref>{{cite news|last=Stoltz|first=Mary Helen|title=Flood damage after Katrina could have been prevented, S&T expert says|publisher=Missouri S&T|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=2016-02-22|url= http://news.mst.edu/2015/08/flood-damage-after-katrina-could-have-been-prevented-st-expert-says/}}</ref><ref>http://news.mst.edu/2015/08/flood-damage-after-katrina-could-have-been-prevented-st-expert-says/</ref>

There was also an investigation of the responses from federal, state and local governments, resulting in the resignation of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) director [[Michael D. Brown]], and of [[New Orleans Police Department]] (NOPD) Superintendent [[Eddie Compass]]. Many other government officials were criticized for their responses, especially New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]], Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]], and President [[George W. Bush]]. Several agencies including the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG), [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC), and [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) were commended for their actions. They provided accurate hurricane weather tracking forecasts with sufficient lead time.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/>

==Meteorological history==
{{Main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina}}
{{storm path|Katrina 2005 track.png}}
Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005, as the result of an interaction of a [[tropical wave]] and the remains of [[Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten]]. It strengthened into [[Tropical low|Tropical Storm]] Katrina on the morning of August 24. The tropical storm moved towards Florida, and became a hurricane only two hours before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] between [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]] on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico, and it continued strengthening over open waters. On August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale]], becoming the third [[Tropical cyclone scales#Atlantic and East Pacific|major hurricane]] of the season. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] disrupted the intensification, but caused the storm to nearly double in size.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> The storm [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] after entering the Gulf, growing from a Category 3 hurricane to a Category 5 hurricane in just nine hours. This rapid growth was due to the storm's movement over the "unusually warm" [[sea surface temperature|waters]] of the [[Loop Current]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Leben, Robert |author2=Born, George |author3=Scott, Jim |url=http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html|title=CU-Boulder Researchers Chart Katrina's Growth In Gulf Of Mexico|publisher=''[[University of Colorado at Boulder]]''|date=September 15, 2005|accessdate=2011-05-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301014255/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html|archivedate=March 1, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:NOAA-Hurricane-Katrina-Aug28-05-2145UTC.jpg|thumb|right|Katrina on August 28, nearing the [[Gulf Coast]].]]
Katrina attained Category 5 status on the morning of August 28 and reached its peak strength at 1800 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] that day, with maximum sustained winds of {{convert|175|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} and a minimum central [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of {{convert|902|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] at the time. However, this record was later broken by Hurricane Rita.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> The hurricane subsequently weakened, and Katrina made its second landfall at 1110 UTC on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of {{convert|125|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]]. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward {{convert|120|mi|km}} from the center and the storm's central pressure was {{convert|920|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and [[Breton Sound]], it made its third landfall near the Louisiana–Mississippi border with {{convert|120|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} sustained winds, still at Category 3 intensity. Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than {{convert|150|mi|km}} inland near [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern [[Great Lakes]] region on August 31, when it was absorbed by a [[Surface weather analysis#Cold front|frontal boundary]]. The resulting [[extratropical]] storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected eastern Canada.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast Louisiana as well as coastal Mississippi and Alabama. About 1.2 million residents of the Gulf Coast were covered under a voluntary or mandatory evacuation order.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

====National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)====
On the afternoon of August&nbsp;26, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) realized that Katrina had yet to make the turn toward the Florida Panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the Mississippi coast.<ref name="NHC disc 014">{{cite report|author=Stacy R.

On August 28, Alabama Governor [[Bob Riley]] declared a state of emergency for the approaching Hurricane Katrina. On the same day, he requested President Bush to declare "expedited major disaster declaration" for six counties of south Alabama, which was quickly approved. Three-hundred and fifty national guardsmen were called on duty by August&nbsp;30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=3775450|title=Riley declares state of emergency due to Katrina threat|accessdate=2006-10-08|year=2005|work=|publisher=KATC, WorldNow}}</ref> The state of Mississippi activated its [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] on August&nbsp;26 in preparation for the storm's landfall.

Hurricane Katrina first made landfall between [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida]] on August&nbsp;25. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the [[Miami metropolitan area]], with a peak total of {{convert|16.43|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Perrine, Florida|Perrine]]. As a result, local flooding occurred in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], damaging approximately 100&nbsp;homes. Farther south in the Florida Keys, a [[tornado]] was spawned in [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]] on August&nbsp;26. The tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated $5 million in damage.<ref name="Marathon Tornado">Devenas, Andy "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060624012057/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/Marathon_Report.pdf Marathon Tornado Survey Report]." ''[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office [[Key West, Florida]]'' Retrieved on 2006-06-05.</ref> The rains caused flooding, and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines, leaving 1.45&nbsp;million people without power. Damage in South Florida was estimated at $523 million, mostly as a result of crop damage. Twelve deaths occurred in South Florida, of which three were caused by downed trees in Broward County, three from drowning in Miami-Dade County, three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated with a lack of electricity.

Significant impact was also reported in the [[Florida Panhandle]]. Although Katrina moved ashore in Louisiana and Mississippi, its outer periphery produced a 5.37&nbsp;ft (1.64&nbsp;m) storm surge in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. High waves caused beach erosion and closed nearby roadways. There were five tornadoes in the northwestern portion of the state, though none of them caused significant damage. Throughout the Florida Panhandle, the storm resulted in an estimated $100&nbsp;million in damage. There were two indirect fatalities from Katrina in [[Walton County, Florida|Walton County]] as a result of a traffic accident.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> In the Florida Panhandle, 77,000&nbsp;customers lost power.<ref>Associated Press, "Katrina at a Glance" (August 31, 2005), page 4A, ''Mobile Register'', web: [http://www.al.com/mobileregister/pdf/register083105a.pdf MobileRegister-083105-PDF].</ref> Overall, the hurricane killed 14&nbsp;people and caused at least $623&nbsp;million in damage.

Prior to striking South Florida, Katrina traversed the Bahamas as a tropical storm. However, minimal impact was reported, with only "fresh breezes" on various island.<ref name="wmo">{{cite report|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/FINAL-REPORT-HC-28.pdf |title=RA IV Hurricane Committee Twent-Eight Session|date=2006|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|pages=58|accessdate=January 30, 2015|location=San Juan, Puerto Rico|format=PDF}}</ref> Although Hurricane Katrina stayed well to the north of [[Cuba]], on August 29 it brought tropical-storm force winds and rainfall of over 8&nbsp;in (200&nbsp;mm) to western regions of the island.

===Louisiana===
[[File:PostVeniceLG.jpg|thumb|Flooding in [[Venice, Louisiana]]]]
On August 29, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]], with {{convert|125|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} winds, as a strong Category 3 storm. However, as it had only just weakened from Category 4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large, it is possible that sustained winds of Category 4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern Louisiana. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a very significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in [[Plaquemines Parish]] indicated a storm tide in excess of {{convert|14|ft|m|1}} and a {{convert|12|ft|m|1|adj=on}} storm surge was recorded in [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]]. Hurricane Katrina made final landfall near the mouth of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]], with the eye straddling [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana]], and [[Hancock County, Mississippi]], on the morning of August 29 at about 9:45M CST.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Hurricane Katrina also brought heavy rain to Louisiana, with {{convert|8|-|10|in|mm}} falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state. In the area around [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], the rainfall was even higher, and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15 inches (380&nbsp;mm). As a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of [[Lake Pontchartrain]] rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore, affecting communities from Slidell to [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]]. Several bridges were destroyed, including the [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge]] connecting Slidell to New Orleans.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Almost 900,000 people in Louisiana lost power as a result of Hurricane Katrina.<ref name="Power failures">Staff Writer.

Katrina's storm surge inundated all parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain, including [[St. Tammany]], Tangipahoa, [[St. John the Baptist]], and [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles]] Parishes. St. Tammany Parish received a two-part storm surge.  The first surge came as Lake Pontchartrain rose and the storm blew water from the Gulf of Mexico into the lake. The second came as the eye of Katrina passed, westerly winds pushed water into a bottleneck at the Rigolets Pass, forcing it farther inland. The range of surge levels in eastern St. Tammany Parish is estimated at {{convert|13|-|16|ft|m}}, not including wave action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/katrina_la_overview-n.pdf |title=FEMA: Louisiana Katrina Surge Inundation Map, January 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref>

Hard-hit [[St. Bernard Parish]] was flooded because of breaching of the levees that contained a navigation channel called the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR-GO) and the breach of the 40 Arpent canal levee that was designed and built by the [[Orleans Levee Board]]. The search for the missing was undertaken by the St. Bernard Fire Department because of the assets of the [[United States Coast Guard]] being diverted to New Orleans. In the months after the storm, many of the missing were tracked down by searching flooded homes, tracking credit card records, and visiting homes of family and relatives.<ref>Cannizaro, Steve.

[[File:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|thumb|upright|Flooded I-10/I-610/West End Blvd [[interchange (road)|interchange]] and surrounding area of northwest New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana]]
As the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds. From this the NHC concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of Category 1 or Category 2 strength.

Katrina's storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the [[Flood Control Act of 1965|federally built levee system]] protecting metro New Orleans and the failure of the 40 Arpent Canal levee. Nearly every levee in metro New Orleans was breached as Hurricane Katrina passed just east of the city limits. Failures occurred in New Orleans and surrounding communities, especially St. Bernard Parish.

{{Main|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi}}
[[File:Structural Bridge Damage.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Route 90]]'s Bay St. Louis Bridge on Pass Christian was destroyed as a result of Katrina.]]
The Gulf coast of Mississippi suffered massive damage from the impact of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, leaving 238 people dead, 67 missing, and billions of dollars in damage: bridges, barges, boats, piers, houses and cars were washed inland.<ref name=HBrecov>{{cite web | title =Information Relating to the Federal Appropriations for Katrina Recovery|date = January 6, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-09-27 | author = Haley Babour | publisher = Office of the Governor, Mississippi | url = http://www.governorbarbour.com/Recovery/news/2006/jan/information.html}}</ref>
Katrina traveled up the entire state, and afterwards, all 82 counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance, 47 for full assistance.<ref name=HBrecov/>

After making a brief initial landfall in Louisiana, Katrina had made its final landfall near the state line, and the eyewall passed over the cities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Katrina's powerful right-front quadrant passed over the west and central Mississippi coast, causing a powerful {{convert|27|ft|m|1|adj=on}} storm surge, which penetrated {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} inland in many areas and up to {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} inland along bays and rivers; in some areas, the surge crossed [[Interstate 10]] for several miles.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Hurricane Katrina brought strong winds to Mississippi, which caused significant tree damage throughout the state. The highest unofficial reported wind gust recorded from Katrina was one of {{convert|135|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Poplarville, Mississippi|Poplarville]], in [[Pearl River County, Mississippi|Pearl River County]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

[[File:Hurricane katrina damage gulfport mississippi.jpg|thumb|left|Damage to [[Long Beach, Mississippi]] following Hurricane Katrina]]
The storm also brought heavy rains with {{convert|8|-|10|in|mm}} falling in southwestern Mississippi and rain in excess of 4 inches (100&nbsp;mm) falling throughout the majority of the state. Katrina caused eleven tornadoes in Mississippi on August 29, some of which damaged trees and power lines.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Battered by wind, rain and storm surge, some beachfront neighborhoods were completely leveled. Preliminary estimates by Mississippi officials calculated that 90% of the structures within half a mile of the coastline were completely destroyed,<ref name="CBS Miss">Staff Writer. "[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/01/katrina/main810916.shtml Mississippi Coast Areas Wiped Out]." ''[[CBS News]].'' September 1, 2005.

More than half of the 13 casinos in the state, which were floated on barges to comply with Mississippi land-based gambling laws, were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves.<ref name="CBS Miss"/>

A number of streets and bridges were washed away. On [[U.S. Highway 90]] along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, two major bridges were completely destroyed: the Bay St. Louis–Pass Christian<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> bridge, and the Biloxi–[[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]] bridge. In addition, the eastbound [[Span (architecture)|span]] of the I-10 bridge over the [[Pascagoula River]] estuary was damaged. In the weeks after the storm, with the connectivity of the coastal U.S. Highway 90 shattered, traffic traveling parallel to the coast was reduced first to State Road 11 (parallel to I-10) then to two lanes on the remaining I-10 span when it was opened.

[[File:Pascagoula destroyed condos from Katrina.jpg|thumb|Surge damage in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]]]
All three coastal counties of the state were severely affected by the storm. Katrina's surge was the most extensive, as well as the highest, in the documented history of the United States; large portions of [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison]] and [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson]] counties were inundated by the storm surge, in all three cases affecting most of the populated areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] | title = Mississippi Hurricane Katrina Surge Inundation and Advisory Base Flood Elevation Map Panel Overview |date=November 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 | format = PDF | publisher = FEMA|url = http://www.fema.gov/pdf/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/ms_overview.pdf}}</ref> Surge covered almost the entire lower half of Hancock County, destroying the coastal communities of [[Clermont Harbor, Mississippi|Clermont Harbor]] and Waveland, much of Bay St. Louis, and flowed up the Jourdan River, flooding Diamondhead and [[Kiln, Mississippi|Kiln]]. In Harrison County, [[Pass Christian]] was completely inundated, along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast, which includes the cities of Long Beach and Gulfport; the flooding was more extensive in communities such as D'Iberville, which borders Back Bay. [[Biloxi]], on a peninsula between the Back Bay and the coast, was particularly hard hit, especially the low-lying Point Cadet area. In Jackson County, storm surge flowed up the wide river [[estuary]], with the combined surge and freshwater flooding cutting the county in half. Remarkably, over 90% of Pascagoula, the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, and about {{convert|75|mi|km|-1}} east of Katrina's landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, was flooded from surge at the height of the storm. Other large Jackson County neighborhoods such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Hills were severely damaged with large portions being completely destroyed, and [[St. Martin, Mississippi|St. Martin]] was hard hit; Ocean Springs, [[Moss Point, Mississippi|Moss Point]], Gautier and [[Escatawpa]] also suffered major surge damage.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials also recorded deaths in [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest]], [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds]], [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren]] and [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake]] counties. Over 900,000 people throughout the state experienced power outages.<ref name="Power failures"/>

===Southeast United States===
[[File:KatrinaMobileCourthouseSteps.jpg|thumb|Flood waters come up the steps of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]'s federal courthouse.]]
Although Hurricane Katrina made landfall well to the west, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were both affected by tropical-storm force winds and a storm surge varying from {{convert|12|to(-)|16|ft|m}} around [[Mobile Bay]],<ref name=KatrinaTCR/> with higher waves on top. Sustained winds of {{convert|67|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} were recorded in [[Mobile, Alabama]], and the storm surge there was approximately {{convert|12|ft|m}}.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> The surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along Mobile Bay. Four tornadoes were also reported in Alabama.<ref name=KatrinaTCR/> Ships, oil rigs, boats and fishing [[pier]]s were washed ashore along Mobile Bay: the cargo ship M/V ''Caribbean Clipper'' and many fishing boats were grounded at [[Bayou La Batre]].

An [[Oil platform|oil rig]] under construction along the [[Mobile River]] broke its moorings and floated {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} northwards before striking the Cochrane Bridge just outside Mobile. No significant damage resulted to the bridge and it was soon reopened. The damage on [[Dauphin Island]] was severe, with the surge destroying many houses and cutting a new canal through the western portion of the island. An offshore oil rig also became grounded on the island. As in Mississippi, the storm surge caused significant beach erosion along the Alabama coastline.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> More than 600,000 people lost power in Alabama as a result of Hurricane Katrina and two people died in a traffic accident in the state. Residents in some areas, such as Selma, were without power for several days.<ref name="Power failures"/>
[[File:Katrina Bayou La Batre 2005 boats ashore.jpg|thumb|[[Bayou La Batre]]: cargo ship and fishing boats were grounded]]
Northern and central [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were affected by heavy rains and strong winds from Hurricane Katrina as the storm moved inland, with more than 3 inches (75&nbsp;mm) of rain falling in several areas. At least 18 tornadoes formed in Georgia on August 29, the most on record in that state for one day in August. The most serious of these tornadoes was an F2 tornado which affected [[Heard County, Georgia|Heard County]] and [[Carroll County, Georgia|Carroll County]]. This tornado caused three injuries and one fatality and damaged several houses. The other tornadoes caused significant damages to buildings and agricultural facilities. In addition to the fatality caused by the F2 tornado, there was another fatality in a traffic accident.<ref>Westbrook, Robby; WFO Peachtree City Staff.

Within the United States and as delineated in the [[National Response Plan]], disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communication systems at various levels.<ref name="usgovwh"/>

Some [[disaster recovery]] response to Katrina began before the storm, with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a [[mortuary]] team with refrigerated trucks.

FEMA provided housing assistance (rental assistance, [[FEMA Trailer|trailers]], etc.) to more than 700,000 applicants—families and individuals.

===Criticism of government response===
{{Main|Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina}}
[[File:USNS Comfort.jpg|thumb|upright|[[USNS Comfort|USNS ''Comfort'']] takes on supplies at [[Mayport, Florida]], en route to the Gulf Coast.]]
The criticisms of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina primarily consisted of criticism of [[Administrative incompetence|mismanagement]] and lack of [[leadership]] in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath. More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, and the subsequent state of chaos in the Crescent City.<ref name="thevenot" /> The [[neologism]] ''Katrina[[-gate|gate]]'' was coined to refer to this controversy, and was a runner-up for "2005 word of the year."<ref>Clark, Heather. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060325135124/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1480616 Linguists Vote 'Truthiness' Word of 2005]." ''ABC News.'' January 6, 2006. Retrieved on 2010-04-14.</ref>

Within days of Katrina's August 29 landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the [[Preparations for Hurricane Katrina|preparations]] for and response to the hurricane. Criticism was initially prompted by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders, and of residents who remained stranded by flood waters without [[drinking water|water]], [[food]], or shelter. Deaths from [[thirst]], [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] and [[violence]] days after the storm had passed fueled the criticism, as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the Louisiana Superdome and the New Orleans Civic Center. Some alleged that [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response. For example, during ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'', a benefit concert for victims of the hurricane, rapper [[Kanye West]] veered off script and harshly criticized the government's response to the crisis, stating that "George Bush doesn't care about [[black people]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|title=Kanye West's Torrent of Criticism, Live on NBC|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/03/AR2005090300165.html|work=The Washington Post|date=2005-09-03|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

In accordance with federal law, President George W. Bush directed the [[Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security]], Michael Chertoff, to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated [[Michael D. Brown]], head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region. However, the President and Secretary Chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination. Brown claimed that Governor Blanco resisted their efforts and was unhelpful. Governor Blanco and her staff disputed this.<ref>{{cite news |author1=David Kirkpatrick |author2=Scott Shane | title = Ex-FEMA Chief Tells of Frustration and Chaos | date = September 15, 2005 | accessdate = 2010-05-13|publisher = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/15/national/nationalspecial/15brown.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref> Eight days later, Brown was recalled to Washington and Coast Guard Vice Admiral [[Thad W.

Politicians, activists, pundits, and journalists also directed criticism at the local and state governments headed by Mayor Nagin of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor Blanco. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who could not find any way out of the city.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/>

The destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina raised other, more general public policy issues about [[emergency management]], [[environmental policy]], [[poverty]], and [[unemployment]]. The discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected [[elections]] and [[legislation]] enacted at various [[Executive (government)|levels of government]]. The storm's devastation also prompted a Congressional investigation, which found that FEMA and the Red Cross "did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of Gulf coast victims." Additionally, it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/> An ABC News [[Opinion poll|poll]] conducted on September 2, 2005, showed more blame was being directed at state and local governments (75%) than at the Federal government (67%), with 44% blaming Bush's leadership directly.<ref name="abcnewspoll">Langer, Gary.

Over seventy countries pledged monetary donations or other assistance. Notably, [[Cuba]] and [[Venezuela]] (both considered as hostile to US government interest) were the first countries to offer assistance, pledging over $1 million, several mobile hospitals, water treatment plants, canned food, bottled water, heating oil, 1,100 doctors and 26.4 metric tons of medicine, though this aid was rejected by the U.S. government.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080614224742/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=14771 Venezuela and Cuba offer US aid ]."

During and after the Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, the American Red Cross had opened 1,470 different shelters across and registered 3.8 million overnight stays. None were allowed in New Orleans however. A total of 244,000 Red Cross workers (95% of which were non-paid volunteers) were utilized throughout these three hurricanes. In addition, 346,980 comfort kits (such as toothpaste, soap, washcloths and toys for children) and 205,360 cleanup kits (containing brooms, mops and bleach) were distributed. For mass care, the organization served 68 million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers. The Red Cross also had its Disaster Health services meet 596,810 contacts, and Disaster Mental Health services met 826,590 contacts. Red Cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families. Hurricane Katrina was the first natural disaster in the United States in which the American Red Cross utilized its "Safe and Well" family location website.<ref name="ARC 1 yr">{{cite web | publisher = [[American Red Cross]] | title = A Year of Healing  | date = 2006-09-29 | url = http://www.redcross.org/images/pdfs/Katrina_OneYearReport.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name = "ARC 2005AHS facts">{{cite web | publisher = American Red Cross | title = Hurricane Season 2005: Facts and Figures|date = 2006-09-29 | url = http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/2005/facts.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501000858/http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/2005/facts.html|archivedate=1 May 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In the year following Katrina's strike on the Gulf Coast, The Salvation Army allocated donations of more than $365 million to serve more than 1.7 million people in nearly every state. The organization's immediate response to Hurricane Katrina included more than 5.7 million hot meals and about 8.3 million sandwiches, snacks, and drinks served in and around New Orleans. Its SATERN network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors. Salvation Army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals. As part of the overall effort, Salvation Army officers, employees, and volunteers contributed more than 900,000 hours of service.<ref name="Salvation Army">{{cite web | url = http://www.salvationist.org/intnews.nsf/vw_web_articles/80D873B8CDAC8607802571D9003FDDEF?opendocument | title = Salvation Army Reflects on Largest Disaster Response Ever at One-Year Anniversary of Hurricane Katrina | accessdate = 2010-04-14|date = August 28, 2006 | publisher = [[Salvation Army|The Salvation Army]]}}</ref>

===Analysis of New Orleans levee failures===
{{Main|2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans}}
[[File:Hurricane Katrina Eye viewed from Hurricane Hunter.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the eyewall of Hurricane Katrina taken on August 28, 2005, as seen from a [[NOAA]] [[WP-3D Orion|WP-3D]] [[hurricane hunter]] aircraft before the storm made landfall on the United States [[Gulf Coast]].]]
On April 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General [[Carl Strock]], [[Chief of Engineers]] and Commander of the Corps of Engineers, testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that "We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure."<ref>Staff Writers "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080527010320/http://www.unregisterednews.com/content/view/184/53/ Problems with the design of levees]." ''[[Unregistered News]].'' September 29, 2005. Retrieved on 2010-04-14.</ref>

A June 2007 report released by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] determined that the failures of the levees and floodwalls in New Orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design and construction flaws.<ref name="ASCE HKERP report"/> The [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] is federally mandated in the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]] with responsibility for the responsible for the conception, design and construction of the region's flood-control system. According to report published in August 2015 in the official journal of the [[World Water Council]], the corps misinterpreted the results of a 1985 study and wrongly concluded that sheet piles in the flood walls needed to be driven to depths of only {{convert|17|ft|0}} instead of between {{convert|31|and|46|ft|0}}. That decision saved approximately US$100 million, but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability.<ref>{{cite news | page=707 |author1=J. David Rogers |author2=G.

}}</ref>

Other factors may have contributed to the flooding. According to the authors of Catastrophe in the Making (Island Press, 2009), the straight design and lack of outward flow into the Gulf allowed the [[Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal]] to become "the perfect shortcut for salt-water intrusion" which damaged buffering cypress forests and wetlands which historically had protected New Orleans from storm surge.<ref>{{cite book|page=120|authors=Freudenburg, William R., Robert Gramling|title=Catastrophe in the Making|publisher=Island Press|year=2009|accessdate=2015-10-15|url=https://www.islandpress.org/book/catastrophe-in-the-making|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The Army Corps of Engineers built and maintained the canal. Furthermore, according to storm surge researcher Hassan Mashriqui:

{{quote|"Storm surge pushing across shallow Lake Borgne from the east is constrained by these MRGO levees to the south and, to the north, by the long-standing levees of the Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW). Initially ten or more miles apart, these two channels meet, and when they do, the water building between their levees is squeezed into a single channel – the Funnel – only 260 yards wide, constrained by levees 14 feet to 16 feet high….In concert with the denuded marshes, it could increase the local storm surge hitting the Intracoastal Waterway by 20 percent to 40 percent – a critical and fundamental flaw."<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNroiySUreQC</ref>}}

The Corps of Engineers disputes these causalities.<ref>Warrick, Joby; Grunwald, Michael. "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301200_pf.html Investigators Link Levee Failures to Design Flaws]." ''Washington Post.'' October 24, 2005. Retrieved on 2006-06-05.</ref> Nonetheless, in June 2008, the Army Corps of Engineers New Orleans District submitted a Deep-Draft De-authorization Study of the MRGO  which stated that "an economic evaluation of channel navigation use does not demonstrate a Federal interest in continued operation and maintenance of the channel." Congress ordered the MRGO closed as a direct result.

Many of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of Katrina. In reconstructing them, precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety. For example, in every situation possible, the Corps of Engineers replaced I-walls with T-walls. T-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls.<ref name=Walls>{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Crenson | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/story.asp?story=6589 | title=Levee Repairs to Be Finished By First Day of Hurricane Season | date=2006-02-02 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref>

However, there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements. In February 2008, the Bush administration requested that the state of Louisiana pay about $1.5 billion of an estimated $7.2 billion for Corps of Engineers levee work (in accordance with the principles of local cost sharing required by Congress as early as the [[Flood Control Act of 1928]]), a proposal which angered many Louisiana leaders.<ref name=funding>{{cite news | title=White House Budget for Levee Work Riles Many Louisiana Elected Officials | agency=Associated Press | first=Cain | last=Burdeau | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=10045 | date=2008-02-12 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref>

On May 2, 2008, Louisiana Gov. [[Bobby Jindal]] used a speech to The National Press Club to request that President Bush free up money to complete work on Louisiana's levees. Bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget, but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill, which would pass sooner.<ref name=BushJindal>{{cite web | url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/18539869.html | title =Jindal asks Bush for levee cash | publisher=2theadvocate.com | first=Gerard | last=Shields | date=2008-05-03 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref>

===Media involvement===
{{Main|Media coverage of Hurricane Katrina}}
Many representatives of the [[news media]] reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities. The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when [[Geraldo Rivera]] of [[Fox News]] tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Geraldo Rivera & Shepard Smith Unleashed|url = http://www.spike.com/video-clips/gmidjv/geraldo-rivera-shepard-smith-unleashed|website = Spike.com|accessdate = 2016-01-04|date = 2005-09-05}}</ref> The role of AM radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news, providing emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims. Immediately after Katrina, [[WWL-AM]] was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air. This emergency service, simulcasted on shortwave outlet [[WHRI]], was named "[[United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans|The United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans]]." Their ongoing nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. Announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&zTi=1&sdn=radio&cdn=gadgets&tm=58&f=00&su=p504.1.336.ip_&tt=2&bt=0&bts=0&st=23&zu=http%3A//www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp%3Fvnu_content_id%3D1001052023|title=Local Media Outlets Struggle to Carry On Post Katrina|date=2005-08-31|accessdate=2010-04-14|author1=Katy Bachman |author2=Tony Sanders |publisher=Billboard Radio Monitor}}</ref> The [[cellular phone]] antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months.

The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of [[Website|Internet sites]]—especially [[blogging]] and [[community journalism]]. One example was the effort of ''NOLA.com'', the web affiliate of New Orleans' ''[[The Times-Picayune|Times-Picayune]]''. A group of reporters were awarded the Breaking News [[Pulitzer Prize]],<ref name="Pulitzer BN">{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners — Breaking News Reporting | year= 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Breaking+News+Reporting}}</ref> and shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based ''[[The Sun Herald|Sun Herald]]''.<ref name="Pulitzer PS">{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners — Public Service | year= 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Public+Service}}</ref> The newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on NOLA's blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams—from individuals to the Coast Guard—which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention, and was called a watershed moment in journalism.<ref name="OJR NOLA">{{cite web | author = Mark Glaser | title = NOLA.com blogs and forums help save lives after Katrina | date = September 13, 2005 | publisher = Online Journalism Review | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050913glaser/}}</ref> In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.<ref name="Pulitzer speech">{{cite web | author = [[Paul Steiger]] | title = Remarks at Pulitzer Prize luncheon|date = May 22, 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 | publisher = The Pulitzer Board | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/2006_luncheon_steiger}}</ref>

As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media. On September 9, the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have "zero access" to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans. Immediately following this announcement, CNN filed a [[lawsuit]] and obtained a temporary [[restraining order]] against the ban. The next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.<ref name="Media Ban">Staff Writer.

===Retirement===
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Because of the large death toll and destruction of property along the [[Gulf Coast]], the name Katrina was officially retired on April 6, 2006, by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] at the request of the U.S. government. The name will never again be used for another [[North Atlantic hurricane]]. It was replaced by [[Hurricane Katia|Katia]] on List III of the [[Atlantic hurricane naming lists]], which was used in the [[2011 Atlantic hurricane season]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2607.htm|title = Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma "Retired" from List of Storm Names|accessdate = August 28, 2006|date = April 6, 2006|publisher = NOAA}}</ref>

=== Studies concerning post-Katrina victims ===
An article published in the ''Community Mental Health Journal'' from January 2016 revealed information about a recent study on the psychosocial needs of Hurricane Katrina evacuees that temporarily resided in Dallas, Texas. More than one-fourth of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). About one-third of the individuals received a referral to mental health services for meeting symptom criteria for incident MDD and PTSD.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Richard V.|last2=Polatin|first2=Peter B.|last3=Hogan|first3=David|last4=Downs|first4=Dana L.|last5=North|first5=Carol S.|date=2016-01-01|title=Needs Assessment of Hurricane Katrina Evacuees Residing Temporarily in Dallas|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26507550|journal=Community Mental Health Journal|volume=52|issue=1|pages=18–24|doi=10.1007/s10597-015-9938-5|issn=1573-2789|pmid=26507550}}</ref>

In a study published in ''[[Maternal and Child Health Journal]]'', five-to seven years after the disaster, 308 New Orleans pregnant women were interviewed about their exposure to Katrina. Researchers found that there were associations between experiencing damage during Katrina and birthweight, thus researchers concluded that natural disasters may have long-term effects on pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, it was concluded that women who are most vulnerable to disaster may be more vulnerable to poor pregnancy outcome.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harville|first=Emily W.|last2=Giarratano|first2=Gloria|last3=Savage|first3=Jane|last4=Barcelona de Mendoza|first4=Veronica|last5=Zotkiewicz|first5=TrezMarie|date=2015-11-01|title=Birth Outcomes in a Disaster Recovery Environment: New Orleans Women After Katrina|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122255|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|volume=19|issue=11|pages=2512–2522|doi=10.1007/s10995-015-1772-4|issn=1573-6628|pmc=4596760|pmid=26122255}}</ref>

From a September 2015 journal of ''Current Psychology'', a study examined the attitudes of older, long-term residents of Baton Rouge, Louisiana toward displaced newcomers to their community.

The Technical Report includes:
* locations of possible new levees to be built
