===2000–2002===
He turned professional in 2000. In 2001, he finished in the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] top 50 for the first time. He finished 2002 as the No. 1 Argentine and South American for the first time in his career, winning two [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] titles and reaching the [[Wimbledon championships|Wimbledon]] final, where he beat [[David Sánchez (tennis)|David Sánchez]], [[Paul-Henri Mathieu]], [[George Bastl]], [[Wayne Arthurs (tennis)|Wayne Arthurs]], [[Nicolás Lapentti]] and [[Xavier Malisse]] before losing to [[Lleyton Hewitt]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===2003–2004===
Nalbandian did not reach another Wimbledon final in 2003, as he was knocked out in the round of 16 by [[Tim Henman]]. He did however have an impressive run at the U.S. Open, taking out both of the Wimbledon finalists 20th seed [[Mark Philippoussis]] and second seed [[Roger Federer]] on the way to a semifinal matchup with [[Andy Roddick]]. It was the second time in less than a month that he had met Roddick in a high-stakes match, having lost to him in the final of the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] a few weeks earlier. Nalbandian started strongly, taking a two sets to love lead, and held a match point in the third-set tiebreak. There was a little bit of controversy during the match, when a fan yelled "out" at 7–7 in the tiebreak, causing Nalbandian to mishit his following shot when he thought the linesman was the one who called it. Roddick took the point and eventually prevailed in the tiebreak.<ref>{{cite av media|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7uqwh932kI|title=YouTube|publisher=}}</ref> Ultimately, he was unable to finish the match off and eventually lost 6–7, 3–6, 7–6, 6–1, 6–3. He finished 2003 ranked No. 8 in the world. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2004, Nalbandian achieved his best result at the French Open reaching the semifinals, losing to eventual champion [[Gastón Gaudio]]. Although he did not win any titles in 2004, he did finish runner-up at both the [[2004 Rome Masters|Rome Masters]] and the [[2004 Madrid Masters|Madrid Masters]], where he was completely overpowered and outclassed by [[Carlos Moyá]] and [[Marat Safin]] respectively. He broke into the top 5 for the first time in his career in August and finished 2004 ranked as the World No. 9 player.

===2005===
In 2005, Nalbandian advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open. He also won the [[Tennis Masters Cup]], becoming only the second Argentine tennis player in history (after [[Guillermo Vilas]] in 1974) to win the year-end tournament. Having replaced [[Andy Roddick]], {{Clarify|date=June 2014}} he won two of his three group matches (to Federer, [[Ivan Ljubičić]], and [[Guillermo Coria]]). In the semifinals, he defeated Russian [[Nikolay Davydenko]], and in the final, he beat World No. 1 [[Roger Federer]] in a fifth-set tiebreak. Nalbandian became the first player to win the cup without previously attaining a Grand Slam or Masters Series title. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===2006===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2014}}
In January 2006, Nalbandian beat [[Fabrice Santoro]] of France, 7–5, 6–0, 6–0, in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, becoming, at the time, only the second active player (along with Roger Federer) to have reached the semifinals of each Grand Slam tournament. He lost in the semifinals to [[Marcos Baghdatis]] in a hard-fought five-set match, despite holding a two-set-to-love advantage and four games to two in the final set. In May, he won the Estoril Open Tournament in Portugal for the second time, being one of only three men to achieve this accomplishment (Carlos Costa, 1992 and 1994; and Thomas Muster, 1995 and 1996). One month later, Nalbandian reached his second French Open semifinal. It was the only time in his career that he reached two Grand Slam semifinals in one calendar year. He played Federer and started strongly, winning the first set 6–3 and going 3–0 up in the second set. At 5–2 down in the third set, Nalbandian decided to retire from the match due to stomach injury. At Wimbledon, Nalbandian was beaten in the third round, where he lost to [[Fernando Verdasco]] in straight sets. At the US Open, Nalbandian was beaten in the second round by [[Marat Safin]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Nalbandian then competed in the [[Davis Cup]] semifinal tie against [[Australian Davis Cup Team|Australia]]. David easily won against [[Mark Philippoussis]], 6–4, 6–3, 6–3, to give Argentina a 1–0 lead. Argentina went on to win 5–0 to reach the Davis Cup final. Later in the year, Nalbandian reached semifinals at the Masters Series Madrid and the Masters Cup, where he lost to [[Roger Federer]] and [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]], respectively. Despite winning both of his single rubbers in the Davis Cup final against Safin and [[Nikolay Davydenko]], Nalbandian could not stop the Russian Davis Cup team. Argentina went on to lose 3–2. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===2007===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2014}}
2007 saw Nalbandian drop out of the world's top 20 for the first time since 2003, after losing in the fourth round of the [[2007 French Open]] to [[Nikolay Davydenko]]. Nalbandian suffered various abdominal injuries, a back injury, and a leg injury during the year.
He fell to no. 26 in the world, until his season changed after winning the [[2007 Madrid Masters]]. He won the tournament by defeating second seed [[Rafael Nadal]], third seed [[Novak Djoković]], and top seed Federer in consecutive rounds, becoming the third player after [[Boris Becker]] and Djoković to defeat the world's top three players in a single tournament. He defeated Nadal, 6–1, 6–2, in the quarterfinals. His good form carried him to his second top-3 win of the tournament, defeating Djoković in the semifinals. He stunned Federer in the final, 1–6, 6–3, 6–3, and reached the doubles semifinals with [[Guillermo Cañas]] in the tournament, before losing to top-seeded brothers [[Bob Bryan|Bob]] and [[Mike Bryan]] in the semifinals. After the tournament, his singles ranking moved up from no. 25 on the tour to No. 18.

He played at the [[2007 Paris Masters]] and again defeated Federer in the third round, 6–4, 7–6. He beat [[David Ferrer]] in the quarterfinals in a closely fought match, 7–6, 6–7, 6–2. After beating [[Richard Gasquet]], 6–2, 6–4 in the semifinals, Nalbandian won his second straight [[ATP Masters Series]] title over [[Rafael Nadal]], 6–4, 6–0, thus, becoming the first player to win the Madrid and Paris Masters back to back since former world no. 1, [[Marat Safin]] in 2004. This win allowed him  to move back into the world's top 10 at No. 9. After the Paris Masters, Nalbandian became the first player to defeat No. 1 and No. 2 players in consecutive tournaments and win them. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===2008===
[[File:David Nalbandian at the 2008 BNP Paribas Masters2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|David Nalbandian attempting to defend his title at the [[2008 BNP Paribas Masters]]]]
Nalbandian began his 2008 season back in the top 10. However, at the Australian Open, he failed to reach the quarterfinals, suffering a 6–1, 6–2, 6–3, loss to the 22nd seed [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] in the third round. On 24 February 2008, he won the Copa Telmex in Buenos Aires, beating [[José Acasuso]], 3–6, 7–6, 6–4, in the final. With that win, he moved to World No. 8. The following week, He arrived at the [[Abierto Mexicano Telcel]] in [[Acapulco]], Mexico and cruised all the way to the finals, along the way defeating [[Boris Pašanski]], [[Santiago Ventura Bertomeu|Santiago Ventura]], [[Potito Starace]], and [[Luis Horna]], beating them all in straight sets, but then lost in the final, to Spaniard [[Nicolás Almagro]], 1–6, 6–7. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

He entered his first ATP Masters Series tournament of the year at the [[2008 Pacific Life Open]], and received a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] in the first round because of his seventh seeding. In the second round, he defeated [[Ernests Gulbis]] 6–4, 4–6, 7–6, and then came back to beat [[Radek Štěpánek]] 7–6, 0–6, 7–6. In the fourth round, he avenged his defeat by beating [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]], to whom he lost earlier in the year at the Australian Open, 6–2, 6–2. He lost, however, in the quarterfinals against [[Mardy Fish]] 3–6, 7–6, 6–7, in a very close match. He lost at the [[2008 Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo Masters]] to eventual finalist Federer, 7–5, 2–6, 2–6. In Barcelona, he was the third seed, but was eliminated by [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] in the third round. At the [[2008 Rome Masters]], he fell in his opening match to Almagro, 4–6, 5–7. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

After being two sets up and seemingly in control, he lost the next three to hand Chardy the win 6–3, 6–4, 2–6, 1–6, 2–6. He also suffered early exits from both [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] and the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], losing in the second round and third round, respectively. His indoor season, however, was a success, as he won his ninth career title at the [[2008 Stockholm Open]], defeating [[Robin Söderling]] 6–2, 5–7, 6–3, in the finals. He was defending champion at the [[2008 Madrid Masters|Madrid Masters]], but was quickly eliminated by fellow Argentine [[Juan Martín del Potro]] in the third round. He then entered both the [[2008 Davidoff Swiss Indoors|Davidoff Swiss Indoors]] and the [[2008 BNP Paribas Masters|BNP Paribas Masters]], where he was once again the defending champion. He did not win either of these tournaments, but found himself in the finals of both. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

To end the year, he participated in the [[2008 Davis Cup]] and was up on an opening match against [[David Ferrer]]. Despite a victory, he ended up on the losing team against Spain in the [[Davis Cup]] finals in Argentina (The Argentine team lost 1–3). He made some offensive comments in the press against Spain, the Spanish tennis team, and [[Rafael Nadal]]. It was rumoured<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.aol.com/articulos/_a/nadal-thrilled-with-spains-davis-cup-win/n20081123180809990001|title=Latino News, Entertainment, Style and Culture - HuffPost Latino Voices|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref> that he and [[Agustín Calleri]] were involved in a fight after they lost their doubles rubber. Nalbandian denied this.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7746953.stm|work=BBC News|title=Nalbandian denies Davis Cup row|date=24 November 2008}}</ref> He was fined $10,000 for leaving the stadium after his and Calleri's defeat in doubles to Spaniards [[Fernando Verdasco]] and [[Feliciano López]], and for his refusal to appear at a subsequent press conference to comment on the Argentine team's setback. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Nalbandian withdrew from the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|2012 US Open]] due to a strained muscle in his chest, one day before his scheduled first round match against compatriot and [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009]] champion [[Juan Martín del Potro]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/news/20120828/david-nalbandian-withdraws-us-open/ David Nalbandian pulls out of U.S. Open], sportsillustrated.cnn.com; accessed 7 June 2014.</ref>

===2013===
After the quarterfinal win over France in the [[2013 Davis Cup World Group|Davis Cup]], where he played doubles, he was forced to undergo an operation on his right shoulder, sidelining him for much of the 2013 season.<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/news/146596.aspx "Nalbandian undergoes shoulder operation"], DavisCup.com, 3 May 2013.</ref> On October 1, he announced his retirement.

==Playing style==
Nalbandian was an all-court player and a very clean ball striker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.open-tennis.com/nalbandian.html|title=US Open (tennis)|publisher=}}</ref> He used powerfully struck, sharply accurate groundstrokes which had very low error-percentage. He had a decent, but not particularly dominating service game compared to top 20 players. His signature play was the wide drive that swings out of court on both sides, low and spinning. He could take high balls on the backhand and forehand side and return them with acute angles and low trajectories and used these skills with great tactical intelligence.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/141838-does-david-nalbandian-have-the-key-to-beating-rafa-nadal Does David Nalbandian have the key to beating Rafael Nadal?"], bleacherreport.com; accessed 7 June 2014.</ref>

His ground game was complemented by his anticipation, speed and ability to end points at the net. Nalbandian's trademark shot is his double-handed backhand down-the-line, which was often regarded as the best double-handed backhand on the men`s tour. He often used it to set up a point, by either hitting a clean winner or forcing a weak return from the opponent. Nalbandian is also known to be one of the game's best returners. He was consistently able to knock balls back deep on the baseline time and time again to effectively set up the point or rip return winners off second serves, but he also had the ability to block it back deep when returning a more effective serve. He also used a "chip-and-charge" technique against the opponents' serves to surprise them.<ref>[http://www.sportingo.com/tennis/a10629_secret-david-nalbandians-indoor-brilliance "The secret of David Nalbandian's indoor brilliance"], sportingo.com; accessed 7 June 2014.</ref>
