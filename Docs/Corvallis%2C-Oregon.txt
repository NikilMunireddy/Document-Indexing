==History==
===Establishment===

In October 1845, [[Joseph C. Avery]] arrived in Oregon from the east.<ref name=Fagan422>David D. Fagan, [https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfBentonCountyOregon ''History of Benton County, Oregon: Including... a Full Political History, ...Incidents of Pioneer Life, and Biographical Sketches of Early and Prominent Citizens...''] Portland, OR: A.G. Walling, Printer, 1885; pg. 422. Note that a clear typographical error in the original source has Avery's date of arrival as "October 1846" but beginning of his residence in "June 1846."</ref> Avery took out a land claim at the mouth of [[Marys River (Oregon)|Marys River]] where it flows into the [[Willamette River]] and in June 1846 took up residence there in a log cabin hastily constructed to hold what seemed a potentially lucrative claim.<ref name=Fagan422 /> Avery's primitive 1846 dwelling was the first home within the boundaries of today's Corvallis and his land claim included the southern section of the contemporary city.<ref name=Fagan423>Fagan, ''History of Benton County, Oregon,'' pg. 423.</ref>

Avery was quickly joined by other settlers along the banks of the Willamette River, including a 640-acre claim directly to his north taken in September 1846 by [[William F. Dixon]].<ref name=Fagan423 /> The discovery of gold in California in 1848 temporarily stalled development of a township, with Avery leaving his Oregon claim to try his hand at mining in the fall of that year.<ref name=Fagan423 /> His stay would prove to be brief and in January 1849 Avery returned to Oregon with a small stock of provisions with a view to opening a store.<ref name=Fagan423 />

During the year 1849, Avery opened his store at the site, [[platted]] the land, and surveyed a town site on his land claim, naming the community '''Marysville'''.<ref name=Oregon>Howard M. Corning, ''Dictionary of Oregon History.'' Portland: Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956.</ref> It is possible that the city was named after early settler Mary Lloyd, but now the name is thought to be derived from French fur trappers' naming of [[Marys Peak]] after the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].<ref>[http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2007/02/17/news/community/2loc07_munford.txt Corvallis Gazette Times: Archived Articles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In the summer of 1851 Joseph Avery and William Dixon each granted back-to-back 40 acre land parcels from their land holdings for the establishment of a county seat.<ref name=Fagan424>Fagan, ''History of Benton County, Oregon,'' pg. 424.</ref> Avery's holding lay to the south and Dixon's to the north, with the [[Benton County Courthouse (Oregon)|Benton Country Courthouse]] marking the approximate line of demarcation between these two land parcels.<ref name=Fagan424 />

===Name change===

In December 1853 the 5th [[Oregon Territorial Legislature]] met in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], where a petition was presented seeking to change the name of that city to either "Thurston" or "Valena."<ref name=Carey662>Charles H. Carey, ''A General History of Oregon Prior to 1861: In Two Volumes: Volume II: To the Civil War.'' Portland, OR: Metropolitan Press, 1936; pg. 662.</ref> At the same time, another petition was presented seeking to change the name of Salem to "Corvallis," from the [[Latin]] meaning "heart of the valley," while a third resolution was presented to the upper house seeking the change the name of Marysville to Corvallis.<ref name=Carey662 /> 

A heated debate followed, with the name ultimately awarded to Marysville in an act passed on December 20, 1853.<ref name=Carey662 /> By way of rationale, it was successfully argued that the name "Marysville" duplicated the moniker of [[Marysville, California|a town in California]] located on the same stagecoach route and that a name change was thus necessary to avoid confusion.<ref>Fagan, ''History of Benton County, Oregon,'' pg. 425.</ref>

===Incorporation===

A faction within the deeply divided legislature sought to make Corvallis the capital of the [[Oregon Territory]], and in December 1855 the 6th Territorial Legislature initially convened there before returning to Salem later that month — the town which would eventually be selected as the permanent seat of state government.<ref name=Oregon/>

Corvallis was incorporated as a city on January 29, 1857.<ref>[http://www.corvallis150.org/birthdayguide.pdf corvallis150.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===19th Century growth===

Nineteenth-century Corvallis saw a three-year boom beginning in 1889, which began with the establishment of a privately owned [[electrical plant]] by L.L. Hurd.<ref name=Martin>Bruce Martin, "Bushrod Washington Wilson," ''Oregon Historical Quarterly,'' vol. 39, no. 3 (Sept. 1938), pp. 283-284.</ref> A flurry of publicity and public and private investment followed, including construction of a grand county courthouse, planning and first construction of a new street railway, construction of a new flour mill along the river between Monroe and Jackson Avenues, and construction of the [[Julian Hotel|Hotel Corvallis]], today known as the Julian Hotel.<ref name=Martin />

In addition a carriage factory was launched in the city and the town's streets were improved, while the size of the city was twice enlarged through annexation.<ref name=Martin /> Bonds were issued for a city-owned water works, a sewer system, and for public ownership of the electric plant.<ref name=Martin /> A publicity campaign was launched to attempt to expand the tax base through new construction for new arrivals.<ref name=Martin /> This effort proved mostly unsuccessful, however, and in 1892 normalcy returned, with the city saddled with about $150,000 in bonded debt.<ref name=Martin />

==Geography==
Corvallis is at an elevation of {{convert|235|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Situated midway in the [[Willamette Valley]], Corvallis is about {{convert|46|mi|km}} east of [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]] and the Oregon Coast, {{convert|85|mi|km}} south of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of the state capital, Salem, {{convert|10|mi|km}} southwest of [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]], about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]] at its closest point, and {{convert|48|mi|km}} north of [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]/[[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]]. [[Oregon Route 99W]], a secondary north–south route, also runs through Corvallis. U.S. Route 20 (which leads to Newport) and Oregon Route 34 (which leads to [[Waldport, Oregon|Waldport]] about {{convert|56|mi|km}} to the west) both secondary East-West routes run through Corvallis from the Oregon Coast. Corvallis is at [[river mile]] 131–32 of the Willamette River.<ref>Willamette River Recreation Guide. 2007. Extension Service, Oregon State University. [http://www.oregon.gov/osmb/library/docs/willametteriverguidepdf.pdf Available online] from the state government of Oregon.</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|14.30|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|14.13|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.17|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name ="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref>

==Climate==

Like the rest of the Willamette Valley, Corvallis falls within the dry-summer subtropical climate zone, also referred to as cool-summer Mediterranean ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''[[Mediterranean climate|Csb]]''). Temperatures are mild year round, with warm, dry sunny summers and mild, wet winters with persistent overcast skies. Spring and fall are also moist seasons with varied cloudiness, and light rain falling for extended periods. 

Winter snow is rare, but occasionally does fall, and amounts can range between a dusting and a few inches that does not persist on the ground for more than a day. The northwest hills will often experience more snow. During the mid-winter months after extended periods of rain, thick persistent fogs can form, sometimes lasting the entire day. This can severely reduce visibility to as low as {{convert|20|ft|m}}. The fog will often persist until a new storm system enters the area. This fog could be seen as a type of [[tule fog]].

Rainfall total within the town itself is surprisingly variable. This is due to Corvallis lying right on the eastern edge of the [[Oregon Coast Range]], with a small portion of the town inside of the range. Rainfall amounts can range from an average of {{convert|66.40|in|cm}} per year <ref>[http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N44W123+2300+351877C Oregon USA Weather History and Climate Data]</ref> in the far northwest hills, compared to {{convert|43.66|in|cm}} per year at [[Oregon State University]]{{citation needed|reason=Rainfall data is likely from OSU's Hyslop Field Station, not the main campus. The same site cited for NW hills rainfall has data from Hyslop, but none from campus|date=October 2014}} which is located in the center of Corvallis. 

Because of its close proximity to the coastal range, Corvallis can experience slightly cooler temperatures, particularly in the hills, than the rest of the Willamette Valley. The average annual low temperature is 4 degrees less than that of Portland just {{convert|85|mi|km}} to the north. Despite this, temperatures dropping far below freezing are still a rare event.

===Religion===
In 1903, [[Franz Edmund Creffield]], commonly known as Edmund Creffield (c. 1870–1906), a German-American religious leader who called himself Joshua, founded a movement in Corvallis which became known locally as the "Holy Rollers".

Corvallis lies in the middle of the [[Unchurched Belt]]. A 2003 study, released once every 10 years, listed Benton County (of which Corvallis makes up the majority of the population) as the least religious county per capita in the United States.  Only 1 in 4 people indicated that they were affiliated with one of the 149 religious groups the study identified. The study indicated that some of the disparity, however, may be attributed to the popularity of less common religions (ones not included as an option in the study) in the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite web

==Transportation==

===Bus===

Long-distance bus service is provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]]. It stops at the Greyhound station in downtown Corvallis (station ID: CVI.)

Local bus service is provided by Corvallis Transit System (CTS). In January 2011, the Corvallis City Council approved an additional fee on monthly water utility bills allowing all CTS bus service to become fareless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/corvallis-transit-system-drops-bus-fares/article_e6ae31e0-2e8e-11e0-9a07-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Corvallis Transit System drops bus fares|author=Nancy Raskauskas|publisher=[[Corvallis Gazette-Times]]|date=2011-02-01|accessdate=2015-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corvallisoregon.gov/index.aspx?page=175|title=Bus Fares / Fareless|author=|publisher=Corvallis Transit System|date=2015|accessdate=2015-08-02}}</ref> The system runs a total of eight daytime routes Monday through Saturday, covering most of the city and converging at a Downtown Transit Center. Additional commuter routes also run in the early morning and late afternoon on weekdays, and mid-morning and mid-afternoon on Saturdays.  When Oregon State University is in session CTS also runs the "Beaver Bus," a set of late-night routes running Thursday through Saturday.

Two other short-distance inter-city buses, the Linn-Benton Loop (to Albany) and the Philomath Connection, also stop at the Downtown Transit Center.

From 2010 to 2011, CTS has seen a 37.87% increase in ridership, partially as a result of going fareless and "the rising cost of fuel for individual vehicles and the desire for residents to choose more sustainable options for commuting to work, school and other activities"<ref>[http://archive.ci.corvallis.or.us/0/doc/332193/Electronic.aspx pg. 3]</ref> According to [[Tim Bates]] the Corvallis Transit System and Philomath Connection, had 3,621,387 passenger miles traveled and 85,647 gallons of fuel consumed in Fiscal Year 2011, a period that covers July 1, 2010 - June 30, 2011.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This means that riders in Fiscal Year 2011 got 42.28 [[passenger miles per gallon]].

[[File:Corvallis Fire & Rescue logo.png|thumb|right]]

The city's water system contains two water treatment plants, nine processed water reservoirs, one raw water reservoir, and some {{convert|210|mi|km}} of pipe.  The system can process up to about {{convert|19|e6USgal|m3}} of water per day.<ref name="wateroverview">{{cite web| url = http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=398&Itemid=353| title = Water Utility | publisher = City of Corvallis Public Works| accessdate = 2009-01-26}}</ref>

The Rock Creek treatment plant processes water from sources in the {{convert|10000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Rock Creek Municipal Watershed near Marys Peak.  The three sources are surface streams which are all tributaries of the Marys River.

The H.D. Taylor treatment plant obtains water from the Willamette River, and has been expanded at least four times since it was first constructed in 1949.  Its output varies seasonally according to demand, producing from {{convert|2|to|16|e6USgal|m3}} per day,<ref name="wateroverview"/> though it has a capacity of {{convert|21|e6USgal|m3}} per day.<ref name="waterdetail"/>
