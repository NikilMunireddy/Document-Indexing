Armenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage.

Under the [[Bagratuni dynasty]], the [[Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]] was restored in the 9th century. Declining due to the wars against the Byzantines, the kingdom fell in 1045 and Armenia was soon after invaded by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]]. An Armenian principality and later a kingdom [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]] was located on the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] between the 11th and 14th centuries.

Between the 16th century and 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of [[Eastern Armenia]] and [[Western Armenia]] came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Persian Empire|Iranian]] empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the [[Russian Empire]], while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule. During [[World War I]], Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the [[Armenian Genocide]]. In 1918, after the [[Russian Revolution]], all non-Russian countries declared their independence from the Russian empire, leading to the establishment of the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], and in 1922 became a founding member of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], into full [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union republics]]. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Armenia}}
The native [[Armenian language|Armenian]] name for the country is ''{{lang|hy-Latn|[[wikt:Հայք|Hayk’]]}}''. The name in the [[Middle Ages]] was extended to ''[[wikt:Հայաստան|Hayastan]]'', by addition of the [[Persian language|Persian]] suffix ''[[-stan]]'' (place).

The name has traditionally been derived from [[Hayk]] ({{lang|hy|Հայկ}}), the legendary patriarch of the [[Armenians]] and a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]], who, according to the 5th-century AD author [[Moses of Chorene]], defeated the [[List of Kings of Babylon|Babylonian king]] Bel in [[3rd millennium BC|2492&nbsp;BC]] and established his nation in the [[Ararat, Armenia|Ararat]] region.<ref>Razmik Panossian, The Armenians: From Kings And Priests to Merchants And Commissars, [[Columbia University Press]] (2006), ISBN 978-0-231-13926-7, p. 106.</ref> The further origin of the name is uncertain. It is also further postulated<ref>Rafael Ishkhanyan, "Illustrated History of Armenia," Yerevan, 1989</ref><ref name="Bauer">Elisabeth Bauer. ''Armenia: Past and Present'' (1981), p. 49</ref> that the name ''Hay'' comes from one of the two confederated, Hittite vassal states—the [[Hayasa|Ḫayaša]]-Azzi (1600–1200 BC).

The [[exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Armenia'' is attested in the [[Old Persian]] [[Behistun Inscription]] (515 BC) as ''[[wikt:𐎠𐎼𐎷𐎡𐎴#Old Persian|Armina]]'' ([[File:Old Persian a.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian ra.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian mi.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian i.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian na.png|30x20pxpx]]). The [[ancient Greek]] terms {{lang|grc|[[wikt:Ἀρμενία|Ἀρμενία]]}} (''Armenía'') and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:Ἀρμένιος|Ἀρμένιοι]]}} (''Arménioi'', "Armenians") are first mentioned by [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (c. 550 BC – c. 476 BC).<ref>

Armenia lies in the highlands surrounding the mountains of [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]. There is evidence of an early civilization in Armenia in the [[Bronze Age]] and earlier, dating to about 4000 BC.

Several bronze-era states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the [[History of the Hittites|Hittite Empire]] (at the height of its power), [[Mitanni]] (South-Western historical Armenia), and [[Hayasa-Azzi]] (1500–1200&nbsp;BC). The [[Nairi|Nairi people]] (12th to 9th centuries BC) and the [[Urartu|Kingdom of Urartu]] (1000–600&nbsp;BC) successively established their sovereignty over the [[Armenian Highland]]. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the [[Armenians|Armenian people]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Vahan|last=Kurkjian|title=History of Armenia|location=Michigan|publisher=[[Armenian General Benevolent Union]]|year=1958|edition=1964|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/home.html|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=[[Armenian Encyclopedia|Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]|pages=v. 12|location=Yerevan|publisher=Armenian Encyclopedia|year=1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Artak|last=Movsisyan|title=Sacred Highland: Armenia in the spiritual conception of the Near East|publisher=Yerevan|year=2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Martiros|last=Kavoukjian|title=The Genesis of Armenian People|publisher=Montreal|year=1982|authorlink=Martiros Kavoukjian}}</ref> A large cuneiform lapidary inscription found in [[Yerevan]] established that the modern capital of Armenia was founded in the summer of 782&nbsp;BC by King [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti I]]. Yerevan is the world's oldest city to have documented the exact date of its foundation.

During the late 6th century BC, the [[Satrapy of Armenia|first geographical entity that was called Armenia]] by neighboring populations was established under the [[Orontid Dynasty]] within the [[Achaemenid Empire]], as part of the latters' territories. The kingdom became fully sovereign from the sphere of influence of the [[Seleucid Empire]] in 190 BC under King [[Artaxias I]] and begun the rule of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]]. Armenia reached its height between 95 and 66&nbsp;BC under [[Tigranes the Great]], becoming the most powerful kingdom of its time east of the [[Roman Republic]].

In the next centuries, Armenia was in the [[Persian Empire]]'s sphere of influence during the reign of [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]], the founder of the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia]], which itself was a branch of the eponymous [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]]. Throughout its history, the kingdom of Armenia enjoyed both periods of independence and periods of autonomy subject to contemporary empires.

Religion in ancient Armenia was historically related to a set of beliefs which, in Persia, led to the emergence of [[Zoroastrianism]]. It particularly focused on the worship of [[Mithras|Mihr]] (Avestan [[Mithras|Mithra]]) and also included a pantheon of native Aryan gods, such as [[Aramazd]], [[Vahagn]], [[Anahit]], and [[Astghik]]. The country used the solar [[Hayk]] [[Armenian calendar]], which consisted of 12 months.

Christianity spread into the country as early as AD 40. King [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] (238–314) made Christianity the [[state religion]] in 301,<ref name="CIA">{{cite web |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]|title=The World Factbook: Armenia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html|accessdate=2007-11-15| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20071114000914/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html| archivedate= 14 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="almanac">{{cite book |last=Brunner|first=Borgna|title=Time Almanac with Information Please 2007|page=685|isbn=978-1-933405-49-0 |year=2006 |publisher=Time Home Entertainment |location=New York}}</ref> partly, in defiance of the [[Sassanids]], it seems,<ref name="books.google.nl">Mary Boyce.

After the fall of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian kingdom]] in 428, most of Armenia was incorporated as a [[Marzpanate Period|marzpanate]] within the Sassanid Empire.

After the [[Marzpanate Period|Marzpanate period]] (428–636), Armenia emerged as the [[Emirate of Armenia]], an autonomous principality within the Arabic Empire, reuniting Armenian lands previously taken by the [[Byzantine Empire]] as well. The principality was ruled by the Prince of Armenia, and recognized by the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]. It was part of the administrative division/emirate ''[[Arminiya]]'' created by the Arabs, which also included parts of Georgia and [[Caucasian Albania]], and had its center in the Armenian city, [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]. The [[Principality of Armenia]] lasted until 884, when it regained its independence from the weakened Arab Empire under King [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot I]] Bagratuni.

The re-emergent Armenian kingdom was ruled by the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] and lasted until 1045. In time, several areas of the Bagratid Armenia separated as independent kingdoms and principalities such as the Kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]] ruled by the House of [[Artsruni]] in the south, Kingdom of [[Syunik Region|Syunik]] in the east, or [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] on the territory of modern [[Nagorno Karabakh]], while still recognizing the supremacy of the Bagratid kings.

[[File:Cilician Armenia-en.svg|250px|thumb|The [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], 1198–1375.]]
In 1045, the Byzantine Empire conquered Bagratid Armenia. Soon, the other Armenian states fell under Byzantine control as well. The Byzantine rule was short lived, as in 1071 [[Seljuk Turks]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered Armenia at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], establishing the Seljuk Empire.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holt |first=Peter Malcolm |last2=Lambton |first2=Ann Katharine Swynford |last3=Lewis |first3=Bernard |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Cambridge History of Islam |year=1977 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=231–232 |url= |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> To escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative, [[Gagik II of Armenia|Gagik II]], King of [[Ani]], an Armenian named [[Ruben I, Prince of Armenia|Roupen]], went with some of his countrymen into the gorges of the [[Taurus Mountains]] and then into [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] of [[Cilicia]]. The Byzantine governor of the palace gave them shelter where the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] was eventually established on 6 January 1198 under King [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Leo I]], a descendant of Prince Roupen.

Cilicia was a strong ally of the European Crusaders, and saw itself as a bastion of Christendom in the East. Cilicia's significance in Armenian history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church, the spiritual leader of the Armenian people, to the region.

The Seljuk Empire soon started to collapse. In the early 12th century, Armenian princes of the [[Zakarid]] [[Nobility|noble family]] drove out the Seljuk Turks and established a semi-independent Armenian principality in Northern and Eastern Armenia, known as [[Zakarid Armenia]], which lasted under the patronage of the [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgian Kingdom]]. The noble family of [[Orbelian Dynasty|Orbelians]] shared control with the Zakarids in various parts of the country, especially in [[Syunik Region|Syunik]] and [[Vayots Dzor]], while the Armenian family of [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan|Hasan-Jalalians]] controlled provinces of [[Artsakh]] and [[Utik]] as the [[Kingdom of Artsakh]].

The Mongolian invasions were soon followed by those of other Central Asian tribes such as the [[Kara Koyunlu]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Ag Qoyunlu|Ak Koyunlu]], which continued from the 13th century until the 15th century. After incessant invasions, each bringing destruction to the country, with time Armenia became weakened.

While Western Armenia still remained under Ottoman rule, the Armenians were granted considerable autonomy within their own enclaves and lived in relative harmony with other groups in the empire (including the ruling Turks). However, as Christians under a strict Muslim [[social structure|social system]], Armenians faced pervasive discrimination. When they began pushing for more rights within the Ottoman Empire, Sultan [[‘Abdu’l-Hamid II]], in response, organized state-sponsored massacres against the Armenians between 1894 and 1896, resulting in an estimated death toll of 80,000 to 300,000 people. The [[Hamidian massacres]], as they came to be known, gave Hamid international infamy as the "Red Sultan" or "Bloody Sultan."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Minahan|first1=James|title=The complete guide to national symbols and emblems|date=2010|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=0313344973|page=310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfrWCQAAQBAJ}}</ref>

During the 1890s, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], commonly known as ''Dashnaktsutyun'', became active within the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending Armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire. Dashnaktsutyun members also formed ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance. The Dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a "free, independent and unified" Armenia, although they sometimes set aside this goal in favor of a more realistic approach, such as advocating autonomy.

The Ottoman Empire began to collapse, and in 1908, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] overthrew the government of Sultan Hamid. In April 1909, the [[Adana massacre]] occurred in the [[Adana Vilayet]] of the Ottoman Empire resulting in the deaths of as many as 20,000–30,000 Armenians. The Armenians living in the empire hoped that the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] would change their second-class status. [[Armenian reform package]] (1914) was presented as a solution by appointing an [[Inspector General|inspector general]] over Armenian issues.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirakosian|first=J.

===World War I and the Armenian Genocide===
{{Main|Armenian Genocide}}
[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Genocide]] victims in 1915]]
When World War I broke out leading to confrontation between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]] and [[Persian Campaign]]s, the new government in [[Istanbul]] began to look on the Armenians with distrust and suspicion. This was because the [[Imperial Russian Army]] contained a contingent of [[Armenian volunteer units|Armenian volunteers]]. On 24 April 1915, [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|Armenian intellectuals were arrested by Ottoman authorities]] and, with the [[Tehcir Law]] (29 May 1915), eventually a large proportion of Armenians living in [[Anatolia]] perished in what has become known as the [[Armenian Genocide]].

The genocide was implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on [[death march]]es leading to the [[Syrian desert]]. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.<ref>{{Citation|first1=Hans-Lukas|last1=Kieser|first2=Dominik J.|last2=Schaller|language=German|title=Der Völkermord an den Armeniern und die Shoah|trans_title=The Armenian genocide and the Shoah|publisher=Chronos|year=2002|isbn=3-0340-0561-X|page=114}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Armenia: The Survival of A Nation | first = Christopher J. | last = Walker | publisher = Croom Helm | place = London | year = 1980 | pages = 200–3}}</ref> There was local [[Armenian resistance during the Armenian Genocide|Armenian resistance]] in the region, developed against the activities of the Ottoman Empire. The events of 1915 to 1917 are regarded by Armenians and the vast majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings, or genocide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/gen_bib1.html|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20060823094409/http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/gen_bib1.html|archivedate=2006-08-23 |title=Extensive bibliography by University of Michigan on the Armenian Genocide |publisher=Umd.umich.edu |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>

===First Republic of Armenia===
{{Main|First Republic of Armenia}}
[[File:Government building of the first Rep. of Armenia (1918-1920), Yerevan.jpg|thumb|The Government house of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] (1918–1920)]]
Although the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] of Imperial forces commanded by [[Nikolai Yudenich]] and Armenians in volunteer units and Armenian militia led by [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]] succeeded in gaining most of Ottoman Armenia during World War I, their gains were lost with the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution of 1917]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} At the time, Russian-controlled [[Eastern Armenia]], Georgia, and [[Azerbaijan]] attempted to bond together in the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. This federation, however, lasted from only February to May 1918, when all three parties decided to dissolve it. As a result, the Dashnaktsutyun government of Eastern Armenia declared its independence on 28 May as the [[First Republic of Armenia]] under the leadership of [[Aram Manukian]].

The First Republic's short-lived independence was fraught with war, [[territorial dispute]]s, and a mass influx of refugees from Ottoman Armenia, bringing with them disease and starvation. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], appalled by the actions of the Ottoman government, sought to help the newly founded Armenian state through relief funds and other forms of support.

At the end of the war, the victorious powers sought to divide up the Ottoman Empire. Signed between the [[Allies of World War I|Allied and Associated Powers]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] at [[Sèvres]] on 10 August 1920, the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] promised to maintain the existence of the Armenian republic and to attach the former territories of Ottoman Armenia to it. Because the new borders of Armenia were to be drawn by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Ottoman Armenia was also referred to as "[[Wilsonian Armenia]]." In addition, just days prior, on 5 August 1920, [[Mihran Damadian]] of the Armenian National Union, the de facto Armenian administration in Cilicia, declared the independence of [[Cilicia]] as an Armenian autonomous republic under French protectorate.<ref>Hovannisian, Richard, and Simon Payaslian. Armenian Cilicia. Costa Mesa: Mazda Publishers, Inc., 2008. 483. Print.</ref>

There was even consideration of possibly making Armenia a mandate under the protection of the United States. The treaty, however, was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], and never came into effect. The movement used the treaty as the occasion to declare itself the rightful [[Politics of Turkey|government of Turkey]], replacing the monarchy based in [[Istanbul]] with a republic based in [[Ankara]].
[[File:11thRedArmyYerevan.jpg|right|thumb|Advance of the [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th Red Army]] into the city of Yerevan]]
In 1920, Turkish nationalist forces invaded the fledgling Armenian republic from the east. Turkish forces under the command of [[Kâzım Karabekir|Kazım Karabekir]] captured Armenian territories that Russia had annexed in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War]] and occupied the old city of Alexandropol (present-day [[Gyumri]]). The violent conflict finally concluded with the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on 2 December 1920. The treaty forced Armenia to disarm most of its [[Armed forces|military forces]], cede all former Ottoman territory granted to it by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], and to give up all the "Wilsonian Armenia" granted to it at the Sèvres treaty. Simultaneously, the [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet Eleventh Army]], under the command of [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze]], invaded Armenia at Karavansarai (present-day [[Ijevan]]) on 29 November. By 4 December, Ordzhonikidze's forces entered Yerevan and the short-lived Armenian republic collapsed.

After the fall of the republic, the [[February Uprising]] soon took place in 1921, and led to the establishment of the [[Republic of Mountainous Armenia]] by Armenian forces under command of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] on April 26, which fought off both Soviet and Turkish intrusions in the Zangezur region of southern Armenia. After Soviet agreements to include the [[Syunik Province]] in Armenia's borders, the rebellion ended and the Red Army took control of the region on July 13.

The TSFSR existed from 1922 to 1936, when it was divided up into three separate entities ([[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]], and [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]]). Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule. They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule. After the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]] took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians.<ref>Ronald G. Suny, James Nichol, Darrell L. Slider. <u>Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia</u>. Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]. 1995. p.17 and following</ref>

Armenia was not the scene of any battles in World War II. An estimated 500,000 Armenians (nearly a third of the population) served in the military during the war, and 175,000 died.<ref>C. Mouradian, ''L'Armenie sovietique'', pp. 278–9</ref>

Fears decreased when Stalin died in 1953 and [[Nikita Khrushchev|Nikita Khruschev]] emerged as the Soviet Union's new leader. Soon, life in Soviet Armenia began to see rapid improvement. The church, which suffered greatly under Stalin, was revived when [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Vazgen I]] assumed the duties of his office in 1955. In 1967, a memorial to the victims of the Armenian Genocide was built at the [[Tsitsernakaberd]] hill above the [[Hrazdan]] [[Canyon|gorge]] in [[Yerevan]]. This occurred after [[1965 Yerevan demonstrations|mass demonstrations]] took place on the tragic event's fiftieth anniversary in 1965.

During the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] era of the 1980s, with the reforms of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], Armenians began to demand better environmental care for their country, opposing the pollution that Soviet-built factories brought. Tensions also developed between Soviet Azerbaijan and its autonomous district of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a majority-Armenian region separated by Stalin from Armenia in 1923. About 484,000 [[Armenians in Azerbaijan|Armenians]] lived in Azerbaijan in 1970.<ref>"[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Azerbaijan+Soviet+Socialist+Republic Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]". The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979).</ref> The Armenians of Karabakh demanded unification with Soviet Armenia. Peaceful protests in Yerevan supporting the Karabakh Armenians were met with [[Sumgait pogrom|anti-Armenian pogroms]] in the Azerbaijani city of [[Sumgait]]. Compounding Armenia's problems was a [[1988 Armenian earthquake|devastating earthquake]] in 1988 with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.2.<ref>Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2004 – Page 74 by Imogen Gladman, [[Taylor and Francis|Taylor & Francis]] Group</ref>

Gorbachev's inability to alleviate any of Armenia's problems created disillusionment among the Armenians and fed a growing hunger for independence. In May 1990, the New [[Armenian Army]] (NAA) was established, serving as a defence force separate from the Soviet [[Red Army]]. Clashes soon broke out between the NAA and [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs|Soviet Internal Security Forces]] (MVD) troops based in Yerevan when Armenians decided to commemorate the establishment of the 1918 First Republic of Armenia. The violence resulted in the deaths of five Armenians killed in a shootout with the MVD at the railway station. Witnesses there claimed that the MVD used excessive force and that they had instigated the fighting.

Further firefights between Armenian militiamen and Soviet troops occurred in [[Nubarashen|Sovetashen]], near the capital and resulted in the deaths of over 26 people, mostly Armenians. The [[pogrom of Armenians in Baku]] in January 1990 forced almost all of the 200,000 Armenians in the Azerbaijani capital [[Baku]] to flee to Armenia.<ref>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/rights/articles/pp021603.shtml Notes from Baku: Black January].

===Restoration of independence===
{{main|History of Armenia#Independent Armenia (1991-today)}}
[[File:NKR war.JPG|right|thumb|Armenian soldiers during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]]]
On 23 August 1990, Armenia declared independence, becoming the first non-Baltic republic to secede from the Soviet Union. When, in 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved, Armenia's independence was officially recognized. [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] was popularly elected the first President of the newly independent Republic of Armenia on 16 October 1991. He had risen to prominence by leading the [[Karabakh movement]] for the unification of the Armenian-populated [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].<ref name="Croissant"/>

Ter-Petrosyan led Armenia alongside Defense Minister [[Vazgen Sargsyan]] through the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] with neighboring Azerbaijan. The initial post-Soviet years were marred by economic difficulties, which had their roots early in the Karabakh conflict when the [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Azerbaijani Popular Front]] managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a railway and air [[blockade]] against Armenia. This move effectively crippled Armenia's economy as 85% of its cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic.<ref name="Croissant">{{cite book

The Karabakh war ended after a Russian-brokered [[Ceasefire|cease-fire]] was put in place in 1994.

{{Main|Geography of Armenia}}

[[File:Armenien topo.jpg|thumb|250px|Armenia's topography is mountainous and volcanic.]]
[[File:Armenia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|250px|Armenia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Armenia is [[landlocked country|landlocked]] in the [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasus]]. Located between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s, Armenia is bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. Armenia lies between latitudes [[38th parallel north|38°]] and [[42nd parallel north|42° N]], and meridians [[43rd meridian east|43°]] and [[47th meridian east|47° E]].

===Topography===
The Republic of Armenia, covering an area of {{convert|29743|km2|sqmi|0}}, is located in the north-east of the [[Armenian Highland]]. The terrain is mostly mountainous, with fast flowing rivers and few forests. The climate is highland [[Continental climate|continental]], which means that Armenia is subjected to hot summers and cold winters. The land rises to {{convert|4,090|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]] at [[Mount Aragats]], and no point is below {{convert|390|m|ft|0}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Geographic Characteristic of The Republic of Armenia|work=Marzes of the Republic of Armenia in Figures, 2002–2006|publisher=National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/article/marz_07_e_2.pdf|year=2007|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

[[Mount Ararat]], which was historically part of Armenia, is the highest mountain in the region.

===Environment===
Armenia has established a Ministry of Nature Protection and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid-waste disposal, whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities. [[Waste management in Armenia]] is underdeveloped, as no waste sorting or recycling takes place at Armenia's 60 landfills.

Despite the availability of abundant renewable energy sources in Armenia (especially [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] and [[wind power]]), the Armenian Government is working toward building a new [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant at Metsamor]] near [[Yerevan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.am/events/statements/eng/?id=21 |title=Address by President Serzh Sargsyan to the People of Armenia and the National Assembly on 2 October 2008 |publisher=President.am |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20101209222114/http://www.president.am:80/events/statements/eng/?id=21 |archivedate=9 December 2010 }}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Armenia}}

The climate in Armenia is markedly continental. Summers are dry and sunny, lasting from June to mid-September. The temperature fluctuates between {{convert|22|and|36|C|F}}. However, the low humidity level mitigates the effect of high temperatures. Evening breezes blowing down the mountains provide a welcome refreshing and cooling effect. Springs are short, while autumns are long. Autumns are known for their vibrant and colorful foliage.

Winters are quite cold with plenty of snow, with temperatures ranging between {{convert|-10|and|-5|°C|°F}}. [[Winter sport]]s enthusiasts enjoy skiing down the hills of [[Tsakhkadzor]], located thirty minutes outside Yerevan. [[Lake Sevan]], nestled up in the Armenian highlands, is the second largest lake in the world relative to its altitude, at {{convert|1900|m|ft|0}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]].

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Armenia|Politics of Armenia}}

[[File:Parliament Yerevan building.jpg|thumb|The [[National Assembly (Armenia)|National Assembly]] in [[Yerevan]].]]
[[Politics of Armenia]] takes place in a framework of a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. According to the [[Constitution of Armenia]], the President is the [[head of state]] and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament.

The [[unicameral parliament]] (also called the [[National Assembly of Armenia|Azgayin Zhoghov]] or ''[[National Assembly of Armenia|National Assembly]]'') is controlled by a coalition of four political parties: the conservative [[Republican Party of Armenia|Republican party]], the [[Prosperous Armenia]] party, the [[Rule of Law (Armenia)|rule of law]] party and the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]. The main [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition party]] is [[Raffi Hovannisian]]'s [[Heritage (Armenia)|Heritage]] party, which favors eventual Armenian membership in the European Union and [[NATO]].

The Armenian government's stated aim is to build a Western-style [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] as the basis of its form of government. It has universal suffrage above the age of eighteen.

International observers of [[Council of Europe]] and [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and [[election|presidential elections]] and constitutional referendum since 1995, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the [[Electoral Affairs Commission|Electoral Commission]], and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. [[Freedom House]] categorized Armenia in its 2008 report as a "Semi-consolidated Authoritarian Regime" (along with [[Moldova]], Kosovo, [[Kyrgyzstan]], and Russia) and ranked Armenia 20th among 29 nations in [[Transition country|transition]], with a Democracy Score of 5.21 out of 7 (7 represents the lowest democratic progress).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nations in Transit 2008|url=http://www.freedomhouse.hu/images/fdh_galleries/NIT2008/02_tables.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005952/http://www.freedomhouse.hu/images/fdh_galleries/NIT2008/02_tables.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-25|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=1 March 2014|format=PDF}}</ref>

Since 1999, Freedom House's Democracy Score for Armenia has been steadily on the decline (from 4.79 to 5.21).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nations in Transit 2008: Armenia |url=http://www.freedomhouse.hu/images/fdh_galleries/NIT2008/NT-Armenia-final.pdf |publisher=Freedom House |accessdate=2008-06-26 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080819200109/http://www.freedomhouse.hu/images/fdh_galleries/NIT2008/NT-Armenia-final.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2008 }}</ref> Furthermore, Freedom House ranked Armenia as "[[Freedom in the World (report)|partly free]]" in its 2007 report, though it did not categorise Armenia as an "electoral democracy", indicating an absence of relatively free and competitive elections.<ref>{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2007 |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/press_release/fiw07_charts.pdf |publisher=Freedom House |accessdate=2007-02-20 |format=PDF| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070218184359/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/press_release/fiw07_charts.pdf| archivedate= 18 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, significant progress seems to have been made and the [[Armenian presidential election, 2008|2008 Armenian presidential election]] was hailed as largely democratic by [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] and Western monitors.<ref>{{cite news

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Armenia|Armenia and the European Union|Armenia–Turkey relations}}
[[File:Moscow, embassy of Armenia (2).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Embassy of Armenia in Moscow]]]]

Armenia presently maintains good relations with almost every country in the world, with two major exceptions being its immediate neighbours, Turkey and Azerbaijan. Tensions were running high between Armenians and Azerbaijanis during the final years of the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] dominated the region's politics throughout the 1990s.<ref name="CFR-9148">{{cite web|title=Nagorno-Karabakh: The Crisis in the Caucasus |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9148/ |accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> The border between the two rival countries remains closed up to this day, and a permanent solution for the conflict has not been reached despite the mediation provided by organisations such as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]].

Armenia is a member of more than 40 international organisations, including the United Nations; the [[Council of Europe]]; the [[Asian Development Bank]]; the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]; the [[World Trade Organization]]; [[World Customs Organization]]; the [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]]; and [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]]. It is a member of the [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation|CSTO]] military alliance, and also participates in NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] programme.

Turkey also has a long history of poor relations with Armenia over its refusal to acknowledge the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize the Republic of Armenia (the 3rd republic) after its independence from the USSR in 1991. Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries due to Turkey's refusal to establish them for numerous reasons. During the Nagorno-Karabakh War and citing it as the reason, Turkey illegally closed its land border with Armenia in 1993. It has not lifted its blockade despite pressure from the powerful Turkish business lobby interested in Armenian markets.<ref name="CFR-9148"/>

On 10 October 2009, Armenia and Turkey signed protocols on normalisation of relationships, which set a timetable for restoring diplomatic ties and reopening their joint border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091010/ts_nm/us_turkey_armenia_9 |title=Armenia and Turkey sign peace deal |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20091014080048/http://news.yahoo.com:80/s/nm/20091010/ts_nm/us_turkey_armenia_9 |archivedate=14 October 2009 }}</ref> The ratification of those had to be made in the national parliaments. In Armenia it passed through the required by legislation approval of the Constitutional Court and was sent to the parliament for the final ratification. The President had made multiple public announcements, both in Armenia and abroad, that as the leader of the political majority of Armenia he assured the ratification of the protocols if Turkey also ratified them. Despite this, the process stopped, as Turkey continuously added more preconditions to its ratification and also "delayed it beyond any reasonable time-period".

Due to its position between two unfriendly neighbours, Armenia has close security ties with Russia. At the request of the Armenian government, Russia maintains a [[Russian 102nd Military Base|military base]] in the northwestern Armenian city of [[Gyumri]]<ref name="Armenia-base">{{cite news

Because of the blockades by Azerbaijan and Turkey, Armenia continues to maintain solid relations with its southern neighbor Iran especially in the economic sector. Economic projects such a gas pipeline going from Iran to Armenia are in time being developed.

The [[Armenian Army]], [[Armenian Air Force|Air Force]], [[Armenian Air Force|Air Defence]], and [[Armenian Border Guard|Border Guard]] comprise the four branches of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia. The Armenian military was formed after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–91)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 and with the establishment of the Ministry of Defence in 1992. The [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] of the military is the [[President of Armenia]], [[Serzh Sargsyan]]. [[Ministry (collective executive)|The Ministry]] of Defence is in charge of political leadership, currently headed by [[Colonel general|Colonel General]] [[Seyran Ohanyan]], while military command remains in the hands of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]], headed by the Chief of Staff, who is currently Colonel General [[Yuri Khatchaturov]].

Active forces now number about 81,000 soldiers, with an additional [[Military reserve force|reserve]] of 32,000 troops. Armenian border guards are in charge of patrolling the country's borders with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], while Russian troops continue to monitor its borders with [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. In the case of an attack, Armenia is able to mobilise every able-bodied man between the age of 15 and 59, with military preparedness.

The [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of military equipment, was ratified by the Armenian parliament in July 1992. In March 1993, Armenia signed the multilateral [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], which calls for the eventual elimination of chemical weapons. Armenia acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapons state in July 1993.

Armenia is member of [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation]] (CSTO) along with [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It participates in NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] (PiP) program and is in a NATO organisation called [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC). Armenia has engaged in a peacekeeping mission in [[Kosovo]] as part of non-NATO [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] troops under Greek command.<ref>{{cite web |title=KFOR Contingent: Armenia |url=http://www.nato.int/kfor/structur/nations/armenia.htm |publisher=Official Web Site of the Kosovo Force |date=23 March 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Armenia also had 46 members of its military [[peacekeeping|peacekeeping forces]] as a part of the [[International Security Assistance Force|Coalition Forces]] in [[Iraq War]] until October 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Last shift of Armenian peacekeepers in Iraq returns home |url=http://www.mil.am/eng/index.php?page=2&p=0&id=633&y=2008&m=10&d=29 |publisher=Ministry of Defence |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Administrative divisions of Armenia}}
{{Armenia Labelled Map|float=right}}
[[File:Գեղարդ.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Geghard]] monastery, [[Kotayk Province]].]]
Armenia is divided into ten [[Administrative divisions of Armenia|provinces]] (''marzer'', singular ''marz''), with the city (''kaghak'') of [[Yerevan]] ({{lang|hy|Երևան}}) having special administrative status as the country's capital. The chief executive in each of the ten provinces is the ''marzpet'' (''marz'' governor), appointed by the government of Armenia. In Yerevan, the chief executive is the mayor, appointed by the president.

Within each province are [[List of municipalities of Armenia|communities]] (''hamaynkner'', singular ''hamaynk''). Each community is self-governing and consists of one or more settlements (''bnakavayrer'', singular ''bnakavayr''). Settlements are classified as either towns (''kaghakner'', singular ''kaghak'') or villages (''gyugher'', singular ''gyugh''). {{As of|2007}}, Armenia includes 915 communities, of which 49 are considered urban and 866 are considered rural. The capital, Yerevan, also has the status of a community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regional Administration Bodies |url=http://www.gov.am/en/regions/ |publisher=The Government of the Republic of Armenia |accessdate=11 September 2008}}</ref> Additionally, Yerevan is divided into twelve semi-autonomous districts.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Armenia}}

[[File:Tree map export 2009 Armenia.jpeg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Armenia's exports, 2009.]]
The economy relies heavily on investment and support from Armenians abroad.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/19/AR2007101901471.html |title=Armenian Eyes, Ears on US Genocide Vote |work=The Washington Post |date=19 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-07 |first=Avet |last=Demourian}}</ref> Before independence, Armenia's economy was largely industry-based – [[chemical substance|chemicals]], [[electronics]], machinery, [[food processing|processed food]], [[synthetic rubber]], and textile – and highly dependent on outside resources. The republic had developed a modern [[Secondary sector of the economy|industrial sector]], supplying [[machine tool]]s, textiles, and other [[Final goods|manufactured goods]] to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy.<ref name="CIA"/> Recently, the [[Intel Corporation]] agreed to open a research center in Armenia, in addition to other technology companies, signalling the growth of the technology industry in Armenia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/it_telecom/details/51098/ |title=Intel center to open in Armenia |publisher=Panarmenian.Net |date=1990-01-20 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

Agriculture accounted for less than 20% of both [[net material product]] and [[Full employment|total employment]] before the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. After independence, the importance of agriculture in the economy increased markedly, its share at the end of the 1990s rising to more than 30% of GDP and more than 40% of total employment.<ref name=agri>Z. Lerman and A. Mirzakhanian, ''Private Agriculture in Armenia'', Lexington Books, Lanham, MD, 2001.</ref> This increase in the importance of agriculture was attributable to food security needs of the population in the face of uncertainty during the first phases of [[transition economy|transition]] and the collapse of the non-agricultural sectors of the economy in the early 1990s. As the economic situation stabilized and growth resumed, the share of agriculture in GDP dropped to slightly over 20% (2006 data), although the share of agriculture in employment remained more than 40%.<ref name=yb2007>[http://www.armstat.am/en/?nid=179 Statistical Yearbook 2007], Armenia National Statistical Service, Yerevan</ref>

[[File:Mount Ararat and the Yerevan skyline.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Yerevan]] is the economic and cultural centre of Armenia.]]
Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold, and lead. The vast majority of energy is produced with fuel imported from Russia, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant); the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small deposits of coal, gas, and petroleum exist but have not yet been developed.

Like other [[Post-Soviet states|newly independent states]] of the former Soviet Union, Armenia's economy suffers from the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|1988 Spitak earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. The conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved. The closure of Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because Armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable. The GDP fell nearly 60% between 1989 and 1993, but then resumed robust growth.<ref name=agri/> The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993.

Nevertheless, the government was able to make wide-ranging economic reforms that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth. The 1994 cease-fire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has also helped the economy. Armenia has had strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious-stone processing and jewellery making, information and communication technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors of the economy, such as agriculture.

[[File:Overdone house in Yerevan.jpg|thumb|300px|New buildings in the [[Ajapnyak District]] of Yerevan.]]
This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD), and other [[Global financial system|international financial institutions]] (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Loans to Armenia since 1993 exceed $1.1&nbsp;billion. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit and stabilizing the currency; developing private businesses; energy; agriculture; food processing; transportation; the health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone. The government joined the World Trade Organization on 5 February 2003. But one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the Armenian diaspora, which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects. Being a growing democratic state, Armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the Western World.

A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatisation was adopted in 1997, as well as a program of state property privatisation. Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and making strides against corruption. However, unemployment, which currently stands at around 15%, still remains a major problem due to the influx of thousands of refugees from the Karabakh conflict.

Ethnic [[Armenians]] make up 97.9% of the population. [[Yazidi]]s make up 1.3%, and [[Russians]] 0.5%. Other minorities include [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Pontic Greeks]] (here usually called [[Caucasus Greeks]]), [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Georgians]], and [[Belarusians]]. There are also smaller communities of [[Vlachs]], [[Mordvins]], [[Ossetians]], [[Udi people|Udis]], and [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]].

Conversely, Armenia received a large influx of Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan, thus giving Armenia a more homogeneous character.

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Armenia}}
[[Armenian language|Armenian]] is the only official language. Due to its Soviet past, Russian is still widely used in Armenia and could be considered as ''de facto'' second language. According to a 2013 survey, 95% of Armenians said they had some knowledge of Russian (24% advanced, 59% intermediate) compared to 40% who said they knew some English (4% advanced, 16% intermediate and 20% beginner). However, more adults (50%) think that English should be taught in public secondary schools than those who prefer Russian (44%).<ref name="2012 knowledge">{{cite web|title=The South Caucasus Between The EU And The Eurasian Union|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CAD-51-52.pdf|work=Caucasus Analytical Digest #51–52|publisher=Forschungsstelle Osteuropa, Bremen and Center for Security Studies, Zürich|accessdate=3 July 2013|pages=22–23|date=17 June 2013|ISSN=1867-9323}}</ref>

The predominant [[religion in Armenia]] is Christianity. The roots of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]] go back to the 1st century. According to tradition, the Armenian Church was founded by two of Jesus' twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] – [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddaeus]] and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] – who preached Christianity in Armenia between AD 40–60. Because of these two founding apostles, the official name of the Armenian Church is [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

Over 93% of Armenian Christians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church, a form of Oriental (Non-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]]) Orthodoxy, which is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/?id=5211|title=The Armenian Apostolic Church (World Council of Churches)}}</ref> The Armenian Apostolic Church is in communion only with a group of churches within [[Oriental Orthodoxy#Oriental Orthodox Communion|Oriental Orthodoxy]].

The [[Armenian Evangelical Church]] has a very sizable and favorable presence among the life of Armenians with over several thousand members throughout the country. It traces its roots back to 1846 which was under patronage of the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] the aim of which was to train qualified clergy for the Armenian Apostolic Church.

Other Christian denominations practicing faith based on Nicene Creed in Armenia are the Pentecostal branches of Protestant community such as the [[Word of Life (Armenia)|Word of Life]], the [[Armenian Brotherhood Church]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcy.org/ | title=Armenian Brotherhood Church of Yerevan}}</ref> the [[Baptists]] which are known as of the oldest existing denominations in Armenia and were permitted by the authorities of Soviet Union,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armbaplife.am/ |title=Armenian Evangelical Christian Baptist |publisher=Armbaplife.am |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}

Catholics also exist in Armenia, both [[Latin Church|Latin rite]] and [[Armenian rite]] Catholics. The [[Mechitarists]] (also spelled "Mekhitarists" {{lang-hy|Մխիթարեան}}), are a congregation of [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] founded in 1712 by [[Mekhitar of Sebaste]]. They are best known for their series of scholarly publications of ancient [[Armenians|Armenian]] versions of otherwise lost ancient Greek texts.

The [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] denomination is headquartered in [[Bzoummar]], [[Lebanon]].

Armenia is home to a [[Russians in Armenia|Russian]] community of [[Molokan]]s which practice a form of Spiritual Christianity originated from the Russian Orthodox Church.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Christel|title=Christian religion in the Soviet Union : a sociological study|date=1978|publisher=State univ. of New York P.|location=Albany|isbn=0873953274|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSmdHtacha8C}}</ref>

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Armenia}}

In its first years of [[History of Armenia|independence]], Armenia made uneven progress in establishing systems to meet its national requirements in social services.<ref name=loc>Curtis, Glenn E. and Ronald G. Suny. "Education". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/amtoc.html Armenia: A Country Study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (March 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''</ref> Education, held in particular esteem in [[Culture of Armenia|Armenian culture]], changed fastest of the social services, while health and welfare services attempted to maintain the basic state-planned structure of the Soviet era.<ref name=loc/>

A literacy rate of 100% was reported as early as 1960.<ref name=loc/> [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|In the communist era]], Armenian education followed the standard Soviet model of complete state control (from Moscow) of [[curriculum|curricula]] and teaching methods and close integration of education activities with other aspects of society, such as politics, culture, and the economy.<ref name=loc/> As in the Soviet period, primary and secondary education in Armenia is free, and completion of secondary school is compulsory.<ref name=loc/>
[[File:Yerevan State Medical University.JPG|thumb|[[Yerevan State Medical University]] named after [[Mkhitar Heratsi]]]]

In the 1988–89 school year, 301 students per 10,000 population were in specialized secondary or higher education, a figure slightly lower than the Soviet average.<ref name=loc/> In 1989 some 58% of Armenians over age fifteen had completed their secondary education, and 14% had a higher education.<ref name=loc/> In the 1990–91 school year, the estimated 1,307 primary and secondary schools were attended by 608,800 students.<ref name=loc/> Another seventy specialized secondary institutions had 45,900 students, and 68,400 students were enrolled in a total of ten postsecondary institutions that included universities.<ref name=loc/> In addition, 35% of eligible children attended [[preschool education|preschools]].<ref name=loc/> In 1992 Armenia's largest institution of higher learning, [[Yerevan State University]], had eighteen departments, including ones for social sciences, sciences, and law.<ref name=loc/> Its faculty numbered about 1,300 teachers and its student population about 10,000 students.<ref name=loc/> The [[National Polytechnic University of Armenia]] is operating since 1933.<ref name=loc/>

In the early 1990s, Armenia made substantial changes to the centralized and regimented Soviet system.<ref name=loc/> Because at least 98% of students in higher education were Armenian, curricula began to emphasize [[History of Armenia|Armenian history]] and culture.<ref name=loc/> [[Armenian language|Armenian]] became the dominant language of instruction, and many schools that had taught in Russian closed by the end of 1991.<ref name=loc/> Russian was still widely taught, however, as a second language.<ref name=loc/>

On the basis of the expansion and development of Yerevan State University a number of higher educational independent Institutions were formed including Medical Institute separated in 1930 which was set up on the basis of medical faculty. In 1980 Yerevan State Medical University was awarded one of the main rewards of the former USSR – the Order of Labor red Banner for training qualified specialists in health care and valuable service in the development of Medical Science.
In 1995 YSMI was renamed to YSMU and since 1989 it has been named after [[Mkhitar Heratsi]], the famous medieval doctor. [[Mkhitar Heratsi]] was the founder of Armenian Medical school in Cilician Armenia. The great doctor played the same role in Armenian Medical Science as [[Hippocrates]] in Western, [[Galen]] in Roman, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]] in Arabic medicine.
[[File:MAB Graduates.jpg|thumb|Graduates of the MAB program of the Agribusiness Teaching Center]]

Foreign students' department for Armenian diaspora established in 1957 later was enlarged and the enrollment of foreign students began.
Nowadays the YSMU is a Medical Institution corresponding to international requirements, trains medical staff for not only Armenia and neighbor countries, i.e. Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Georgia, but also many other leading countries all over the world. A great number of foreign students from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the USA and Russian Federation study together with Armenian students. Nowadays the university is ranked among famous higher Medical Institutions and takes its honorable place in the World Directory of Medical Schools published by the WHO.

Other educational institutions in Armenia include the [[American University of Armenia]] and the [[QSI International School of Yerevan]].
The [[American University of Armenia]] has [[graduate school|graduate programs]] in Business and Law, among others. The institution owes its existence to the combined efforts of the Government of Armenia, the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]], [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]], and the [[University of California]]. The extension programs and the library at AUA form a new focal point for English-language intellectual life in the city. Armenia also hosts a deployment of [[OLPC]] – One Laptopschool Per child XO laptop-tablet schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://one.laptop.org/stories/nagorno-karabakh-and-armenia|title=Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia – One Laptop per Child|publisher=}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Armenia}}
Armenians have their own distinctive [[Armenian alphabet|alphabet]] and [[Armenian language|language]]. The alphabet was invented in AD 405 by [[Mesrop Mashtots]] and consists of thirty-nine letters, three of which were added during the [[Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician period]]. 96% of the people in the country speak Armenian, while 75.8% of the population additionally speaks Russian, although English is becoming increasingly popular.

=== Media ===
{{Main|Media of Armenia}}
Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Armenia]] guarantees freedom of speech and Armenia ranks 78th in the 2015 [[Press Freedom Index]] report compiled by [[Reporters Without Borders]], between [[Lesotho]] and [[Sierra Leone]].<ref name=FH>[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/armenia Armenia], 2015 Press Freedom report</ref>

Armenian music is a mix of indigenous folk music, perhaps best-represented by [[Djivan Gasparyan]]'s well-known [[duduk]] music, as well as light pop, and extensive [[Christian music]].

Instruments like the duduk, the [[dhol]], the [[zurna]], and the [[Kanun (instrument)|kanun]] are commonly found in Armenian folk music. Artists such as [[Sayat Nova]] are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music. One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the [[Armenian chant]] which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Whilst under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, Armenian classical music composer [[Aram Khatchaturian]] became internationally well known for his music, for various ballets and the [[Sabre Dance]] from his composition for the ballet [[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]].
[[File:Armeniapedia dance2.jpg|thumb|Traditional [[Armenian dance]].]]

The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called "kef" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of [[Western Armenia]], and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated.

[[Richard Hagopian]] is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional "kef" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 1940s and 1950s for developing their own style of "kef music" heavily influenced by the popular American [[Big Band]] Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 1960s and 1970s with artists such as [[Adiss Harmandian]] and [[Harout Pamboukjian]] performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia; also with artists such as [[Sirusho]], performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry.

Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned [[List of French-Armenians|French-Armenian]] singer and composer [[Charles Aznavour]], pianist [[Sahan Arzruni]], prominent opera sopranos such as [[Hasmik Papian]] and more recently [[Isabel Bayrakdarian]] and [[Anna Kasyan]]. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star [[Cher]]. In the Armenian diaspora, [[Armenian Revolutionary Songs|Armenian revolutionary songs]] are popular with the youth. These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes.

===Art===

[[Yerevan Vernissage]] (arts and crafts market), close to Republic Square, bustles with hundreds of vendors selling a variety of crafts on weekends and Wednesdays (though the selection is much reduced mid-week). The market offers woodcarving, antiques, fine lace, and the hand-knotted wool carpets and kilims that are a Caucasus specialty. [[Obsidian]], which is found locally, is crafted into assortment of jewellery and ornamental objects. Armenian gold smithery enjoys a long tradition, populating one corner of the market with a selection of gold items. Soviet relics and souvenirs of recent Russian manufacture – nesting dolls, watches, enamel boxes and so on – are also available at the Vernisage.

[[File:Zabel return.jpg|right|thumb|233x233px|''Queen Zabel’s Return to the Palace'', [[Vardges Sureniants]], (1909).]]

Across from the Opera House, a popular art market fills another city park on the weekends. Armenia’s long history as a crossroads of the [[ancient history|ancient world]] has resulted in a landscape with innumerable fascinating [[archaeological site]]s to explore. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]], [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and even [[Stone Age]] sites are all within a few hours drive from the city. All but the most spectacular remain virtually undiscovered, allowing visitors to view churches and fortresses in their original settings.

The National Art Gallery in Yerevan has more than 16,000 works that date back to the [[Middle Ages]], which indicate Armenia's rich tales and stories of the times. It houses paintings by many [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] masters as well. The Modern Art Museum, the Children’s Picture Gallery, and the [[Martiros Saryan]] Museum are only a few of the other noteworthy collections of fine art on display in Yerevan. Moreover, many private galleries are in operation, with many more opening every year, featuring rotating exhibitions and sales.

On April 13, 2013, the Armenian government announced a change in law to allow [[freedom of panorama]] for 3D works of art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.am/legislation.php?sel=show&ID=4717 |title=Legislation: National Assembly of RA |publisher=Parliament.am |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref>

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Armenia|Chess in Armenia}}
[[File:Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports complex.jpg|thumb|250px|The Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports complex.]]
[[File:Ireland Armenia teams.jpg|thumb|The [[Armenia national football team]] in Dublin, Ireland.]]
A wide array of sports are played in Armenia, the most popular among them being wrestling, weightlifting, judo, association football, chess, and boxing. Armenia's mountainous terrain provides great opportunities for the practice of sports like skiing and climbing. Being a landlocked country, water sports can only be practiced on lakes, notably [[Lake Sevan]]. Competitively, Armenia has been successful in chess, weightlifting and wrestling at the international level. Armenia is also an active member of the international sports community, with full membership in the Union of European Football Associations ([[UEFA]]) and International Ice Hockey Federation ([[IIHF]]). It also hosts the [[Pan-Armenian Games]].

Prior to 1992, Armenians would participate in the Olympics representing the USSR. As part of the Soviet Union, Armenia was very successful, winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions. The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by [[Hrant Shahinyan]] (sometimes spelled as Grant Shaginyan), who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. To highlight the level of success of Armenians in the Olympics, Shahinyan was quoted as saying:

"Armenian sportsmen had to outdo their opponents by several notches for the shot at being accepted into any Soviet team. But those difficulties notwithstanding, 90 percent of Armenians athletes on Soviet Olympic teams came back with medals."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&AID=1910&CID=1973&IID=&lng=eng |title=Ambassadors in Sport?: Independent Armenia far below the glory of Soviet times on the pitch, mat – Features |publisher=ArmeniaNow.com |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>

Armenia first participated at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona under a unified CIS team, where it was very successful, winning three golds and one silver in weightlifting, wrestling and sharp shooting, despite only having 5 athletes. Since the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]], Armenia has participated as an independent nation.

Armenia participates in the Summer Olympic Games in boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, judo, gymnastics, track and field, diving, swimming and sharp shooting. It also participates in the Winter Olympic Games in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and figure skating.

[[File:Levon Aronian 2011.jpg|thumb|180px|World number 2 Chess Champion [[Levon Aronian]].]]
[[Football in Armenia|Football]] is also popular in Armenia. The most successful team was the [[FC Ararat Yerevan]] team of the 1970s who won the [[Soviet Cup]] in 1973 and 1975 and the [[Soviet Top League 1973|Soviet Top League]] in 1973. The latter achievement saw FC Ararat gain entry to the [[European Cup 1974-75|European Cup]] where – despite a home victory in the second leg – they lost on aggregate at the quarter final stage to eventual winner [[FC Bayern Munich]]. Armenia competed internationally as part of the [[USSR national football team]] until the [[Armenian national football team]] was formed in 1992 after the split of the Soviet Union. Armenia have never qualified for a major tournament although recent improvements saw the team to achieve 44th position in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] in September 2011. The national team is controlled by the [[Football Federation of Armenia]]. The [[Armenian Premier League]] is the highest level football competition in Armenia, and has been dominated by [[FC Pyunik]] in recent seasons. The league currently consists of eight teams and relegates to the [[Armenian First League]].

Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have produced many successful footballers, including [[Youri Djorkaeff]], [[Alain Boghossian]], [[Andranik Eskandarian]], [[Andranik Teymourian]], [[Edgar Manucharyan]] and [[Nikita Simonyan]]. Djokaeff and Boghossian won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] with [[France national football team|France]], Andranik Teymourian competed in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] for [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and Edgar Manucharyan played in the Dutch [[Eredivisie]] for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]].

[[Wrestling]] has been a successful sport in the Olympics for Armenia. At the [[Armenia at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Armen Nazaryan]] won the gold in the Men's [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] Flyweight (52&nbsp;kg) category and [[Armen Mkrtchyan]] won the silver in Men's [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]] Paperweight (48&nbsp;kg) category, securing Armenia's first two medals in its Olympic history.

Traditional Armenian wrestling is called Kokh and practiced in traditional garb; it was one of the influences included in the Soviet combat sport of [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], which is also very popular.<ref>{{cite book|last=Green|first=ed. by Thomas A.|title=Martial arts of the world : en encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9781576071502|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v32oHSE5t6cC&pg=PA718&lpg=PA718&dq=kokh+armenia&source=bl&ots=W4eXMFh-UP&sig=jsuaf9z-b-RcrhpUNIRReTLbe_4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UVZzUKKwBtSt0AHXioGACQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=kokh%20armenia&f=false 718]}}</ref>

The [[Politics of Armenia|government of Armenia]] budgets about $2.8&nbsp;million annually for sports and gives it to the [[National Committee of Physical Education and Sports]], the body that determines which programs should benefit from the funds.<ref name="ArmeniaNow.com">{{cite web|url=http://armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&AID=1910&CID=1973&IID=&lng=eng |title=Ambassadors in Sport?: Independent Armenia far below the glory of Soviet times on the pitch, mat – Features |publisher=ArmeniaNow.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref>

Due to the lack of success lately on the international level, in recent years, Armenia has rebuilt 16 Soviet-era sports schools and furnished them with new equipment for a total cost of $1.9&nbsp;million. The rebuilding of the regional schools was financed by the Armenian government. $9.3&nbsp;million has been invested in the resort town of [[Tsaghkadzor]] to improve the [[winter sports]] infrastructure because of dismal performances at recent [[winter sports]] events. In 2005, a cycling center was opened in [[Yerevan]] with the aim of helping produce world class Armenian cyclists. The government has also promised a cash reward of $700,000 to Armenians who win a gold medal at the Olympics.<ref name="ArmeniaNow.com"/>

Armenia has also been very successful in chess, winning the  [[World Team Chess Championship|World Champion]] in 2011 and the [[Chess Olympiad|World Chess Olympiad]] on three occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6679 |title=Chess News – BBC lecture: Armenia, the cleverest nation on earth |publisher=ChessBase.com |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
[[File:Armenian cuisine.jpg|thumb|Armenian cuisine]]
{{Main|Armenian cuisine}}

Armenian cuisine is as [[ancient]] as the history of Armenia, a combination of different tastes and aromas. The food often has quite a distinct aroma. Closely related to eastern and [[Mediterranean cuisine]], various [[spices]], [[vegetables]], [[fish]], and [[fruit]]s combine to present unique dishes. The main characteristics of Armenian cuisine are a reliance on the quality of the ingredients rather than heavily spicing food, the use of herbs, the use of wheat in a variety of forms, of legumes, nuts, and fruit (as a main ingredient as well as to sour food), and the stuffing of a wide variety of leaves.

The [[pomegranate]], with its symbolic association with fertility represents that nation. The [[apricot]] is the national fruit.
