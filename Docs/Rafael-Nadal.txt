He equalled [[Guillermo Vilas]]'s all-time record of 49 clay court titles by winning the Barcelona Open in 2016.

==Early life==
Rafael Nadal was born in [[Manacor]], Balearic Islands, Spain, to Sebastián Nadal, a businessman who owns an insurance company, a glass and window company, Vidres Mallorca, and manages his own restaurant, Sa Punta. His mother is Ana María Parera, a housewife. He has a younger sister named María Isabel. His uncle, [[Miguel Ángel Nadal]], is a retired professional [[association football|footballer]], who played for [[RCD Mallorca]], [[FC Barcelona]], and the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]].<ref name="times">{{cite news | first=Christopher | last=Clarey | title=Rafael Nadal, Barely 19, He's Got Game, Looks and Remarkably Good Manners | date=6 June 2005 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/sports/tennis/06nadal.html|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> Nadal supports football clubs [[Real Madrid]] and RCD Mallorca.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sportsround meets Rafael Nadal | date=11 November 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6130000/newsid_6135900/6135996.stm |publisher=BBC Sports  | accessdate =6 April 2010}}</ref> Recognizing that Nadal had a natural talent for tennis, another uncle, [[Toni Nadal]], a former professional tennis player, introduced him to tennis when he was three years old.<ref name="Rajaraman">{{cite web|url=http://www.insidetennis.com/archive/0608_french_open_nadal.html|first=Aarthi|last= Rajaraman|title=At Home with Humble yet Ambitious Nadal|date=1 June 2008|work=Inside Tennis|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

At age eight, Nadal won an under-12 regional tennis championship at a time when he was also a promising football player.<ref name="timesonline">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article708386.ece|title= The Big Interview: Rafael Nadal|work=The Sunday Times|date=23 April 2006|first=Alison|last= Kervin |accessdate=5 April 2010 | location=London}}</ref> This made Toni Nadal intensify training, and at that time he encouraged Nadal to play left-handed for a natural advantage on the tennis court, as he noticed Nadal played [[forehand]] shots with two hands.<ref name="timesonline"/> This may be due to the fact he is ambidextrous, playing tennis with his left hand, and writing with his right.<ref>{{cite news | title = Rafael Nadal | url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Rafael-Nadal.aspx | archiveurl=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Rafael-Nadal.aspx | archivedate = 24 January 2014 | publisher = ATP | accessdate = 22 February 2014 }}</ref>

When Nadal was 12, he won the Spanish and European tennis titles in his age group and was playing tennis and football all the time.<ref name="timesonline"/> Nadal's father made him choose between football and tennis so that his school work would not deteriorate entirely. Nadal said: "I chose tennis. Football had to stop straight away."<ref name="timesonline"/>

When he was 14, the Spanish tennis federation requested that he leave Mallorca and move to [[Barcelona]] to continue his tennis training. Nadal's family turned down this request, partly because they feared it would hurt his education,<ref name="timesonline"/> but also because Toni said that "I don't want to believe that you have to go to America, or other places to be a good athlete. You can do it from your home."<ref name="Rajaraman"/> The decision to stay home meant that Nadal received less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs. In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion [[Pat Cash]] in a clay-court exhibition match.<ref name="times"/>

Nadal turned professional at the age of 15,<ref name="rafarenaissance">{{cite news|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/DEUCE-Tennis/DEUCE-May-2010/Rafael-Nadal.aspx |title=The Rafa Renaissance | work=atpworldtour | first=Joel | last=Drucker | date=18 May 2010}}</ref> and participated in two events on the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] junior circuit. In 2002, at the age of 16, Nadal reached the semifinals of the Boy's Singles tournament at Wimbledon, in his first ITF junior event.<ref name="ITFTennis">{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100007935|title=ITF Tennis – Juniors – Player Activity|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>

By the age of 17, he beat [[Roger Federer]] the first time they played and became the youngest man to reach the third round at Wimbledon since [[Boris Becker]]. At 18, he helped pace Spain over the US in the junior [[Davis Cup]] in his second, and final, appearance on the ITF junior circuit. At 19, Nadal won the French Open the first time he played it, a feat not accomplished in Paris for more than 20 years. He eventually won it the first four times he played at Roland Garros.<ref name="rafarenaissance"/> In 2003, he had won the ATP [[ATP World Tour Awards#Newcomer of the Year|Newcomer of the Year]] Award. Early in his career, Nadal became known for his habit of biting the trophies he won.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1653408,00.html |title=10 Questions for Rafael Nadal |accessdate=14 September 2010 | work=Time | first=Nathan | last=Thornburgh | date=15 August 2007}}</ref>

===2002–2004===
In April 2002, at 15 years and 10 months, the world No. 762 Nadal won his first [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] match, defeating [[Ramón Delgado]], and became the ninth player in the [[Open Era]] to do so before the age of 16.<ref name="Tennis.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/features/general/features.aspx?id=10488 |title=Wimbledon 2006: The Duel |last=Tignor |first=Stephen |date=20 June 2006 | work=[[Tennis Magazine]] |accessdate=8 November 2008}}</ref> The following year, Nadal won two Challenger titles and finished the year in the top 50.

Nadal reached the third round of the [[2004 Australian Open]] where he lost in three sets against Australian [[Lleyton Hewitt]].

He was one of the six players who defeated Federer that year (along with [[Tim Henman]], [[Albert Costa]], [[Gustavo Kuerten]], [[Dominik Hrbatý]], and [[Tomáš Berdych]]). He missed most of the clay court season, including the French Open, because of a stress fracture in his left ankle.<ref name="times"/>

Nadal, at 18 years and six months, became the youngest player to register a singles victory in a [[Davis Cup]] final for a winning nation.<ref name="telenadkno1">{{cite news | first=Emily | last=Benammar | title=Rafael Nadal: All you need to know | date=8 July 2008 | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/atptour/2305040/Rafael-Nadal-All-you-need-to-know.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | accessdate =5 April 2010 | location=London}}</ref> By beating world No. 2 [[Andy Roddick]], he helped Spain clinch the 2004 title over the United States in a 3–2 win.

===2005: First Grand Slam title===
{{Main|2005 Rafael Nadal tennis season}}
At the [[2005 Australian Open]], Nadal lost in the fourth round to eventual runner-up [[Lleyton Hewitt]]. Two months later, Nadal reached the final of the [[2005 Miami Masters]], and despite being two points from a straight-sets victory, he was defeated in five sets by world No. 1 Roger Federer. Both performances were considered to be breakthroughs for Nadal.<ref>{{cite news | title=Brave Hewitt battles past Nadal | date=24 January 2005 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4200919.stm |publisher=BBC Sports  | accessdate =6 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Nadal proves to be the real deal | date=5 April 2005 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4412667.stm |publisher=BBC Sports  | accessdate =6 April 2010}}</ref>

He then dominated the spring clay court season. He won 24 consecutive singles matches, which broke [[Andre Agassi]]'s Open Era record of consecutive match wins for a male teenager.<ref>{{cite news | title=Teen Nadal gives Spain reign over French Open | date=5 June 2006 | url =http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/french/2005-06-05-day-14_x.htm | agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today | accessdate =6 April 2010}}</ref> Nadal won the [[Torneo Godo|Torneo Conde de Godó]] in Barcelona and beat [[2004 French Open]] runner-up [[Guillermo Coria]] in the finals of the [[2005 Monte Carlo Masters]] and the [[2005 Rome Masters]].

On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the [[2005 French Open]] semifinals, being one of only four players who defeated the top-seeded player that year (along with [[Marat Safin]], [[Richard Gasquet]], and [[David Nalbandian]]). Two days later, he defeated [[Mariano Puerta]] in the final, becoming the second male player after [[Mats Wilander]] to win the French Open on his first attempt. He also became the first teenager to win a Grand Slam singles title since [[Pete Sampras]] won the [[1990 US Open (tennis)|1990 US Open]] at age 19.<ref name="times"/> Winning the French Open improved Nadal's ranking to world No. 3.<ref name="ranking2005"/>

Three days after his victory in Paris, Nadal's 24-match winning streak was snapped in the first round of the grass court [[Gerry Weber Open]] in Halle, Germany, where he lost to the German [[Alexander Waske]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Waske snaps Nadal's winning streak | date=10 June 2005 | url =http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2005/06/10/2003258798 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate =6 April 2010}}</ref> He then lost in the second round of [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|2005 Wimbledon]] to [[Gilles Müller]] of Luxembourg.

Immediately after Wimbledon, Nadal won 16 consecutive matches and three consecutive tournaments, bringing his ranking to world No. 2 on 25 July 2005.

Nadal started his North American summer hard-court season by defeating Agassi in the final of the [[2005 Canada Masters]], but lost in the first round of the [[2005 Cincinnati Masters]]. Nadal was seeded second at the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|2005 US Open]], where he was upset in the third round by world No. 49 [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] in four sets.

In September, he defeated Coria in the final of the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]] in Beijing and won both of his [[Davis Cup]] matches against Italy. In October, he won his fourth ATP Masters Series title of the year, defeating [[Ivan Ljubičić]] in the final of the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|2005 Madrid Masters]]. He then suffered a foot injury that prevented him from competing in the year-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Julian | last=Linden | title=Foot injury delays Rafael Nadal's comeback | date=5 January 2006 | url =http://www.rediff.com/sports/2006/jan/05nadal.htm | agency=Reuters| accessdate =6 April 2010}}</ref>

===2006: Second French Open title===
{{Main|2006 Rafael Nadal tennis season}}
[[File:Rafael Nadal 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nadal in 2006]]
Nadal missed the Australian Open because of a foot injury.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4561684.stm|title=Champion Safin out of Aussie Open|work=BBC Sport|date=10 January 2006|accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref> In February, he lost in the semifinals of the first tournament he played, the [[Open 13]] tournament in [[Marseille]], France. Two weeks later, he handed Roger Federer his first loss of the year in the final of the [[Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Duty Free Men's Open]] (in 2006, Rafael Nadal and [[Andy Murray]] were the only two men who defeated Federer). To complete the spring hard-court season, Nadal was upset in the semifinals of the [[Indian Wells Masters|Pacific Life Open]] in [[Indian Wells, California]], by James Blake, and was upset in the second round of the [[2006 Miami Masters]].

On European [[clay court|clay]], Nadal won all four tournaments he entered and 24 consecutive matches. He defeated Federer in the final of the [[Monte Carlo Masters|Masters Series Monte Carlo]] in four sets. The following week, he defeated [[Tommy Robredo]] in the final of the [[Torneo Godó|Open Sabadell Atlántico]] tournament in [[Barcelona]]. After a one-week break, Nadal won the Masters Series [[Rome Masters|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome, defeating Federer in a fifth-set tiebreaker in the final, after saving two match points and equaling [[Björn Borg]]'s tally of 16 ATP titles won as a teenager. Nadal broke Argentinian [[Guillermo Vilas]]'s 29-year male record of 53 consecutive clay-court match victories by winning his first round match at the [[2006 French Open|French Open]]. Vilas presented Nadal with a trophy, but commented later that Nadal's feat was less impressive than his own because Nadal's winning streak covered two years and was accomplished by adding easy tournaments to his schedule.<ref>{{cite web| first=Greg | last=Garber | title=With Vilas in stands, Nadal makes history | date=31 May 2006 | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french06/news/story?id=2462389&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab4pos1 | work=ESPN Tennis/French06|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref>

Nadal went on to play Federer in the final of the French Open. The first two sets of the match were hardly competitive, as the rivals traded 6–1 sets. Nadal won the third set easily and served for the match in the fourth set before Federer broke him and forced a tiebreaker. Nadal won the tiebreaker and became the first player to defeat Federer in a Grand Slam tournament final.<ref>{{cite web| first=Greg | last=Garber | title=Roger's reign on hold with Nadal's dominance | date=12 June 2006 | work=ESPN Tennis/French06|publisher=ESPN  | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french06/news/story?id=2479425 | accessdate =13 November 2008 }}</ref>

Nadal was seeded second at Wimbledon, but was two points from defeat against American qualifier [[Robert Kendrick]] in the second round before coming back to win in five sets. In the third round, Nadal defeated world No. 20 [[Andre Agassi]] in straight sets at Agassi's last career match at Wimbledon. Nadal also won his next three matches in straight sets, which set up his first Wimbledon final, which was against Federer, who had won this tournament the three previous years. Nadal was the first Spanish man since [[Manuel Santana]] in 1966, to reach the Wimbledon final, but Federer won the match in four sets to win his fourth consecutive [[Wimbledon 2006|Wimbledon]] title.

During the lead up to the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Nadal played the two Masters Series tournaments in North America. He was upset in the third round of the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] in Toronto and the quarterfinals of the [[Cincinnati Masters|Western & Southern Financial Group Masters]] in [[Cincinnati]]. Nadal was seeded second at the US Open, but lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 54 [[Mikhail Youzhny]] of Russia in four sets.

Nadal played only three tournaments the remainder of the year. [[Joachim Johansson]], ranked world No. 690, upset Nadal in the second round of the [[Stockholm Open]]. The following week, Nadal lost to [[Tomáš Berdych]] in the quarterfinals of the year's last Masters Series tournament, the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Mutua Madrileña Masters]] in Madrid. During the round-robin stage of the year-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup]], Nadal lost to [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] but defeated [[Nikolay Davydenko]] and Robredo. Because of those two victories, Nadal qualified for the semifinals, where he lost to Federer. This was Nadal's third loss in nine career matches with Federer.

Nadal went on to become the first player since [[Andre Agassi]] in 1994–95 to finish the year as the world No. 2 in consecutive years.

===2007: Third French Open title===

{{Main|2007 Rafael Nadal tennis season}}

Nadal started the year by playing in six hard-court tournaments. He lost in the semifinals and first round of his first two tournaments and then lost in the quarterfinals of the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] to eventual runner-up [[Fernando González]]. After another quarterfinal loss at the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]], he won the [[2007 Indian Wells Masters]], before [[Novak Djoković]] defeated him in the quarterfinals of the [[2007 Miami Masters]].

He had comparatively more success after returning to Europe to play five clay-court tournaments. He won the titles at the [[Monte Carlo Masters|Masters Series Monte Carlo]], the [[Torneo Godo|Open Sabadell Atlántico]] in Barcelona, and the Masters Series [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome, before losing to Roger Federer in the final of the [[Masters Series Hamburg]]. This defeat ended his 81-match winning streak on clay, which is the male Open Era record for consecutive wins on a single surface. He then rebounded to win the [[2007 French Open – Men's Singles|French Open]] for the third straight year, defeating Federer once again in the final.

Between the tournaments in Barcelona and Rome, Nadal defeated Federer in the "[[Battle of Surfaces]]" exhibition match in Mallorca, Spain, with the tennis court being half [[grass court|grass]] and half clay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebattleofsurfaces.com | title = The Battle of Surfaces | accessdate =4 April 2007}}</ref>

Nadal played the [[Artois Championships]] at the [[Queen's Club]] in London for the second consecutive year. As in 2006, Nadal was upset in the quarterfinals. Nadal then won consecutive five-set matches during the third and fourth rounds of [[2007 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]] before being beaten by Federer in the five-set final. This was Federer's first five-set match at Wimbledon since 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6280788.stm|title=Wimbledon 2007|publisher=BBC Sport |first=Caroline|last=Cheese|date=7 July 2007|accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref>

In July, Nadal won the clay court [[Mercedes Cup]] in [[Stuttgart]], which proved to be his last title of the year. He played three important tournaments during the North American summer hard court season. He was a semifinalist at the Masters Series [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] in Montreal before losing his first match at the [[Western & Southern Financial Group Masters]] in [[Cincinnati]]. He was the second-seeded player at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], but was defeated in the fourth round by [[David Ferrer]].

After a month-long break from tournament tennis, Nadal played the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Mutua Madrileña Masters]] in Madrid and the [[BNP Paribas Masters]] in Paris. [[David Nalbandian]] upset him in the quarterfinals and final of those tournaments. To end the year, Nadal won two of his three round robin matches to advance to the semifinals of the [[Tennis Masters Cup]] in Shanghai, where Federer defeated him in straight sets.

During the second half of the year, Nadal battled a knee injury suffered during the Wimbledon final. In addition, there were rumors at the end of the year that the foot injury he suffered during 2005, caused long-term damage, which were given credence by coach [[Toni Nadal]]'s claim that the problem was "serious". Nadal and his spokesman strongly denied this, however, with Nadal himself calling the story "totally false".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7117076.stm|title=Nadal plays down foot injury fear |work=BBC Sport Tennis|first=Piers|last= Newbury|date=28 November 2007|accessdate =11 February 2009 }}</ref>

=== 2008: French Open, Wimbledon, Olympic Gold & ascent to No. 1 ===

{{Main|2008 Rafael Nadal tennis season}}

Nadal began the year in India, where he was comprehensively beaten by [[Mikhail Youzhny]] in the final of the [[Chennai Open]]. Nadal then reached the semifinals of the [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]] for the first time. [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]] defeated Nadal in the semifinal of 2008 Australian Open. Nadal also reached the final of the [[2008 Miami Masters|Miami Masters]] for the second time.

During the spring clay-court season, Nadal won four singles titles and defeated Roger Federer in three finals. He beat Federer at the [[2008 Monte Carlo Masters|Masters Series Monte Carlo]] for the third straight year, capturing his [[Open Era]] record fourth consecutive title there. He won in straight sets, despite Federer's holding a 4–0 lead in the second set.<ref name="therivalry">{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/Rivalries/Nadal-Federer-Rivalry.aspx|title= Roger & Rafa: The Rivalry|date=14 March 2013|publisher=ATPtennis.com|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref> Nadal then won his fourth consecutive title at the [[2008 Torneo Godó|Open Sabadell Atlántico]] tournament in [[Barcelona]]. A few weeks later, Nadal won his first title at the [[2008 Hamburg Masters|Masters Series Hamburg]], defeating Federer in the three-set final.

By winning his first Wimbledon title, Nadal became the third man in the open era to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, after [[Rod Laver]] in 1969, and Borg in 1978–80, (Federer later accomplished this the following year) as well as the second [[Spaniard]] to win Wimbledon. He also ended Federer's record streak of five consecutive Wimbledon titles and 65 straight wins on grass courts. This was also the first time that Nadal won two Grand Slam tournaments back-to-back.

After Wimbledon, Nadal extended his winning streak to a [[ATP Tour records#Winning streaks|career-best 32 matches]]. He won his second [[2008 Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] title in Toronto, and then made it into the semifinals of the [[2008 Cincinnati Masters|Western & Southern Financial Group Masters]] in [[Cincinnati]]. As a result, Nadal clinched the [[2008 US Open Series|US Open Series]] and, combined with Federer's early-round losses in both of those tournaments, finally earned the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|world No. 1]] ranking on 18 August, officially ending Federer's record four-and-a-half-year reign at the top.

At the [[2008 Beijing Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], Nadal defeated [[Novak Djoković]] in the semifinals and [[Fernando González]] of Chile in the final to win his first Olympic gold medal. Nadal became the first male player ranked in the top five to win the gold medal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.com/news/news.aspx?id=142024|title= Nadal wins Olympic gold over Gonzalez|publisher=Tennis.com|date=17 August 2008|accessdate=5 April 2009}}</ref>

At the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Nadal was the top-seeded player for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament. He did not lose a set during his first three matches, defeating qualifiers in the first and second rounds and [[Viktor Troicki]] in the third round. He then needed four sets to defeat both [[Sam Querrey]] in the fourth round and [[Mardy Fish]] in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, he lost to eventual runner up, Andy Murray. Later in the year in [[Madrid]], Nadal helped Spain defeat the United States in the [[Davis Cup]] semifinals.

At the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Mutua Madrileña Masters]] in Madrid, Nadal lost in the semifinals to [[Gilles Simon]]. However, his performance at the event guaranteed that he would become the first Spaniard during the open era to finish the year as the world No. 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/nadalno1.asp |title=Nadal Clinches Year End No. 1 For First Time |publisher=ATPtennis.com |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=20 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081022030531/http://www.atptennis.com:80/1/en/2008news/nadalno1.asp |archivedate=22 October 2008 }}</ref> On 24 October at the Campoamor theatre in [[Oviedo]], Spain, Nadal was given the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] for Sports, in recognition of his achievements in tennis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpa.es/en/awards/2008/rafael-nadal-1/ |title=2008 Prince of Asturias Award for Sports |accessdate=5 April 2010 |publisher=Fundación Principe de Asturias }}</ref> Two weeks after the Madrid Masters at the [[BNP Paribas Masters]] in France, Nadal reached the quarterfinals, where he faced [[Nikolay Davydenko]].

By beating [[Lleyton Hewitt]] in the third round of [[2009 French Open]], Nadal (2005–09 French Open) set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros, beating the previous record of 28 by [[Björn Borg]] (1978–81 French Open). Nadal had won 32 consecutive sets at Roland Garros (since winning the last 2 sets at the [[2007 French Open]] final against Federer), the second-longest winning streak in the tournament's history behind Björn Borg's record of 41 consecutive sets. This run [[Söderling–Nadal match at the 2009 French Open|came to an end on 31 May 2009]], when Nadal lost to eventual runner-up, [[Robin Söderling]] in the 4th round. This was Nadal's first and, until 2015, only loss at the French Open.

Nadal reached the final of the [[Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters]] in Monaco, after beating fellow Spaniard [[David Ferrer]] in the semifinals. This was Nadal's first tour final since [[Doha]] earlier in the year. He won the final in straight sets over his compatriot [[Fernando Verdasco]]. He lost 14 games throughout all five matches, the fewest he had ever lost en route to a championship, and the final was the shortest Masters 1000 final in terms of games. With this win, Nadal became the first player in the open era to win a tournament title for six straight years.<ref>{{cite news | title=Unstoppable Nadal Captures Sixth Straight Title | date=18 April 2010 | publisher=ATP World Tour | url =http://www.monte-carlorolexmasters.com/News/Tennis/2010/Tournament/Sunday-Singles-Final.aspx | work=James Buddell | accessdate =18 April 2010}}</ref>

Unlike in previous years, Nadal next chose to skip the Barcelona tournament (despite being that event's five-time defending champion), and his next tournament was the [[2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia]]. He defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber, Victor Hănescu, and Stanlias Wawrinka, all in straight sets, to win his 57th straight match in April. In the semis, he faced a resilient [[Ernests Gulbis]], who defeated Roger Federer earlier in the tournament and took Nadal to three sets for the first time this clay-court season. Nadal eventually prevailed in 2 hours and 40minutes. He then defeated compatriot [[David Ferrer]] in the final for his fifth title at Rome to equal [[Andre Agassi]]'s record of winning 17 ATP Masters titles.

In the second round, he defeated qualifier [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]] in straight sets. He then played the six-foot-nine-inch American [[John Isner]]. Nadal comfortably came through in straight sets. He defeated [[Gaël Monfils]] in the quarterfinals and his countryman [[Nicolás Almagro]] in the next round, who was playing in his first Masters 1000 semifinal. The first set of his match against Almagro would be just the second set he lost on clay up to this point in 2010. Nadal then defeated longtime rival Roger Federer, avenging his 2009 finals loss to Federer. The win gave him his 18th Masters title, breaking the all-time record. He became the first player to win all three clay-court Masters titles in a single year and the first player to win three consecutive Masters events. Nadal moved back to No. 2 the following day.

Nadal began his Asian tour at the [[2010 PTT Thailand Open]] in [[Bangkok]] where he reached the semifinals, losing to compatriot [[Guillermo García-López]]. Nadal was able to regroup, and at the [[2010 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships]] in Tokyo (debut), he defeated [[Santiago Giraldo]], [[Milos Raonic]], and [[Dmitry Tursunov]]. In the semifinals against [[Viktor Troicki]], Nadal saved two match points in the deciding set tiebreaker to win it 9–7 in the end. In the final, Nadal comfortably defeated [[Gaël Monfils]] for his seventh title of the season.

Nadal next played in the [[2010 Shanghai Rolex Masters]] in Shanghai, where he was the top seed, but lost to world No. 12 [[Jürgen Melzer]] in the third round, snapping his record streak of 21 consecutive Masters quarterfinals. On 5 November, Nadal announced that he was pulling out of the [[2010 BNP Paribas Masters|Paris Masters]] due to tendinitis in his left shoulder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/11/Other/Nadal-Withdraws-From-Paris.aspx |title=Nadal withdraws from fatigue at the Paris |publisher=Atpworldtour.com |accessdate=11 December 2010}}</ref> On 21 November 2010, in London, Nadal won the [[ATP World Tour Awards|Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite news| title=Nadal wins Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award|date=20 November 2010|url=http://www.tennis.com/articles/templates/news.aspx?articleid=8843|publisher=Tennis.com (Associated Press)|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>

This was the first time that Nadal achieved three wins in the round-robin stage. In the semifinal, he defeated Murray in a hard-fought match to reach his first final at the tournament. In only their second meeting of the year, Federer beat Nadal in the final. After the match, Nadal stated, "Roger is probably the more complete player of the world. I'm not going to say I lost that match because I was tired." This was a reference to his marathon victory over Murray on Saturday.

Nadal ended the 2010 season having won three Grand Slams and three Masters 1000 tournaments, and having regained the No. 1 ranking.

Next up for Nadal was a two-match exhibition against Federer for the [[Roger Federer Foundation]]. The first match took place in [[Zürich]] on 21 December 2010, and the second in Madrid the next day.

Nadal started the [[2011 Sony Ericsson Open]] with a win over [[Kei Nishikori]] then met his compatriot [[Feliciano López]] in the third round, whom he defeated. In the fourth round, he defeated [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]]. In the quarterfinals, Nadal had the first real test of the tournament when he met the world No. 7 Tomáš Berdych, who he defeated in three sets. In the semifinals, Nadal met his main rival Roger Federer, their first meeting in a semifinal since the [[2007 Tennis Masters Cup|2007 Masters Cup]]. Nadal won in straight sets.

Nadal began his clay-court season by winning the [[2011 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters]] with the loss of just one set. Nadal defeated [[Jarkko Nieminen]], [[Richard Gasquet]], [[Ivan Ljubičić]], and Andy Murray to reach his seventh consecutive final in Monte Carlo. In the final, Nadal avenged his defeat by David Ferrer in the quarterfinals of the [[2011 Australian Open]].

Just a week later, Nadal won his sixth Barcelona Open crown, winning the [[2011 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell]] final against Ferrer in straight sets. In doing so, Nadal became the first man in the open era to have won two tournaments at least six times each. Nadal was then the leader in terms of matches won in the year, with 29. He did not gain any points for this victory, however, as only four ATP 500 tournaments can be counted towards a players ranking at one time, but they will go into effect 8 August 2011, when the result of the [[2010 Legg Mason Tennis Classic]] expires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Rafael-Nadal.aspx?t=rb|title=Ranking Breakdown Rafael Nadal|date = 9 June 2011|work= ATP Worldtour|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>

During the first three rounds of Wimbledon, Nadal beat [[Michael Craig Russell|Michael Russell]], Ryan Sweeting, and [[Gilles Müller]]. He then faced Juan Martín del Potro in the fourth round and [[Mardy Fish]] in the quarterfinals, defeating both players in four sets. His semifinal opponent was world No. 4 Andy Murray. Nadal lost the first set, then won the next three. This set up a final against world No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who had beaten Nadal in all four of their matches in 2011 (all in Masters finals). After dropping the third set, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the fourth. This was the first Grand Slam tournament final that Nadal had lost to someone other than Roger Federer and his first loss at Wimbledon since his five-set loss to Federer in the 2007 final. The loss ended Nadal's winning streak in Grand Slam finals at seven, preventing him from tying the Open-Era record of eight victories in a row set by [[Pete Sampras]]. Djokovic's success at the tournament also meant that the Serb ascended to world No. 1 for the first time, breaking the dominance of Federer and Nadal on the position, which one of them had held for every week since 2 February 2004. Nadal fell to world No. 2 in the rankings for the first time since June 2010.

After resting for a month from a foot injury sustained during Wimbledon, he contested the [[2011 Rogers Cup]], where he was shocked by Croatian [[Ivan Dodig]] in a third-set tiebreak. He next played in the [[2011 Western & Southern Open – Men's Singles|2011 Cincinnati Masters]], where he lost to [[Mardy Fish]] in the quarterfinals.

At the [[2011 US Open – Men's Singles|2011 US Open]], Nadal defeated [[Andrey Golubev]] in straight sets and advanced to the third round after Frenchman [[Nicolas Mahut]] retired. After defeating [[David Nalbandian]] on 4 September, Nadal collapsed in his post-match press conference due to severe cramps.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/14783093.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Nadal collapses in front of media | date=4 September 2011}}</ref> Nadal lost to Novak Djokovic in the final in four sets.

After the US Open, Nadal made the final of the [[Japan Open Tennis Championships]]. Nadal, who was the 2010 champion, was defeated by Andy Murray. At the [[Shanghai Masters (tennis)|Shanghai Masters]], Nadal was top seed with the absence of Novak Djokovic, but was upset in the third round by No. 23 ranked [[Florian Mayer]] in straight sets. At the [[2011 ATP World Tour Finals]], Nadal was defeated by Roger Federer in the round-robin stage, in one of the quickest matches between the two, lasting just 60 minutes. In the following match, Nadal was defeated by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and was eliminated from the tournament.

In the Davis Cup final in December, Nadal had a quick straight-set win over [[Juan Mónaco]] in his first match. In his second match against Juan Martín del Potro, Nadal did not win a single service game in the first set but came back to win the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/home.aspx |title=Davis Cup site |publisher=Daviscup.com |accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref>

Nadal ended his tennis season with the [[2011 Mubadala World Tennis Championship (December)|Mubadala World Tennis Championship]], an exhibition tournament not affiliated with the ATP.

The pair set a new world record, breaking the latest longest major singles final between Mats Wilander and Ivan Lendl, which lasted 4 hours and 54 minutes, at the US Open in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/aus12/story/_/id/7515950/2012-australian-open-novak-djokovic-outlasts-rafael-nadal-longest-grand-slam-final|title=Longest Men's Singles Championship Final|date=30 January 2012|publisher=ESPN Sports}}</ref>

Nadal made it to the semifinals in [[2012 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], where he was beaten in straight sets by eventual champion Roger Federer. He also made the semifinals in [[Sony Ericsson Open|Miami]], but withdrew because of knee problems.

As the clay court season started, Nadal was seeded 2nd at the [[2012 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters]]. He defeated Jarkko Nieminen, Mikhael Kukushkin, [[Stanislas Wawrinka]], and [[Gilles Simon]] before topping world No. 1 Novak Djokovic to win his 8th consecutive Monte Carlo trophy. This ended a streak of seven straight final losses to Djokovic, which began at the 2011 Indian Wells Masters final.

A day after the Monte Carlo Masters Final, Nadal traveled to Barcelona where he received a bye in the first round. His tremendous record on clay continued as he beat compatriot David Ferrer in a hard fought final to clinch his seventh title in eight years at the Barcelona Open.

The [[Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open]] did not go very well for Nadal. He beat Nikolay Davydenko, one of the few players to hold a positive head to head record over Nadal, in straight sets. He then lost to [[Fernando Verdasco]], who he held a 13–0 record against in the third round 7–5 in the third, after blowing a 4–0 final set lead. Nadal stated that he was very unhappy with the new blue-colored clay and threatened not to attend in the future if the surface was not changed back to red clay. Several other players (such as Novak Djokovic) voiced similar criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incyprus.com.cy/en-gb/tennis/4172/27612/stars-not-happy-with-madrid |title=Stars not happy with Madrid |publisher=Incyprus.com.cy |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref>

In the last tournament before the French Open, Nadal went to the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. He advanced to his 7th final after defeating Florian Mayer, Marcel Granollers, Tomáš Berdych, and David Ferrer all in straight sets, setting up another finals showdown with World number one Novak Djokovic. Nadal defeated Djokovic in a tight straight sets encounter. This was his second victory over Novak Djokovic in 2012 and his third title of the season, as well as his 6th Rome title overall.

At the [[2012 French Open]], Nadal dropped only 30 games against his first five opponents, without losing a set. In the semifinal he faced a friend and compatriot in David Ferrer. Unlike their previous two encounters in Barcelona and Rome, Nadal showed almost no flaws, dismantling Ferrer to set up another championship title fight with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. This marked the first time where two opposing players faced each other in four consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals. They also became the only players to have faced the same opponent in the finals of all four Majors. Nadal won the first two sets before Djokovic claimed the third. Play was suspended in the fourth set due to rain. When the match resumed the following day, Nadal won when Djokovic double faulted on match point, sealing a record 7th Roland Garros title for Nadal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCABRE85A0LW20120611?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true|title=Nadal wins record seventh French Open|agency=Reuters|first=Toby|last=Davis|date=11 June 2012|accessdate=11 June 2012}}</ref> Throughout the tournament, Nadal lost only one set, occurring in the final.

In July 2012, Nadal withdrew from the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]] due to [[tendinitis]] in his knee, which subsequently also led to him pulling out of both the Rogers Cup and Cincinnati Masters. Prior to his withdrawal, Nadal had been touted as the favourite to successfully defend the Gold Medal he won in [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing four years earlier]], despite his early loss at Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1228442-rafael-nadal-why-spaniard-will-sport-gold-at-2012-olympic-games|title=London 2012: Why Rafael Nadal Will Sport Gold at 2012 Olympic Games|publisher=Bleacher Report|first=Michael|last=Carroll|date=19 June 2012|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> On 15 August, Nadal announced his withdrawal from the US Open in New York, as he felt he still was not healthy enough to compete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/354475/Rafa-Nadal-withdraws-from-Paris-and-London-tournaments|title= Nadal withdraws from Paris and London tournaments|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/news/tennis/2012/07/features/london-olympics-nadal-pulls-out-with-injury.aspx|title=Reigning Champion Nadal Withdraws From London Olympics|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref> On 11 September 2012, Nadal fell to a world No. 4 ranking, his lowest since 2010, as 2012 US Open winner Andy Murray climbed to No. 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livetennisguide.com/2012/09/11/rafael-nadal-falls-as-andy-murray-climbs-in-atp-rankings/ |title=Rafael Nadal falls, as Andy Murray climbs in ATP Rankings |publisher=Livetennisguide.com |accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref> Nadal ended 2012 ranked No. 4 in the world, the first time in eight years that he has not been ranked 1st or 2nd at the end of the year.

===2013: Eighth French Open, second US Open, five masters and return to No. 1===
{{Main|2013 Rafael Nadal tennis season}}

Two weeks prior to the [[2013 Australian Open]], Nadal officially withdrew from the tournament citing a stomach virus.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/8786752/rafael-nadal-pulls-australian-open-due-virus | title=Rafael Nadal out of Aussie Open | publisher=ESPN | date=28 December 2012 | accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref> Nadal's withdrawal subsequently saw him drop out of the ATP's Top Four for the first time since 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-01-28/nadal-out-of-top-four-serena-williams-rises-on-rankings |title=Nadal Out of Top Four, Serena Williams Rises on Rankings |date=28 January 2013 |work=Business Week}}</ref>

Playing in his first tournaments in South America since 2005, Nadal made his comeback at the Latin American [[Golden Swing]], starting his 2013 season at the [[2013 VTR Open]] in Chile,<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Patrice|title=Rafael Nadal Smart to Make Long-Awaited Return on Clay at 2013 ATP VTR Open|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1506335-rafael-nadal-smart-to-make-long-awaited-return-on-clay-at-2013-atp-vtr-open|publisher=Bleacher Report|accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> where he advanced to the final without dropping a set but was beaten by Argentine world No. 73 journeyman [[Horacio Zeballos]]. He also lost in the doubles final (with Juan Mónaco). At the [[2013 Brasil Open]], at [[São Paulo]], Nadal struggled in the opening rounds, dropping sets to Berlocq and qualifier Alund. Despite the poor clay surface, which was the subject of player complaints, he reached the final, where he defeated David Nalbandian.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/21036474| title=Rafael Nadal to make comeback from knee injury at Brazil Open | work=BBC Sport | date=15 January 2013 | accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> In the title match of the [[2013 Abierto Mexicano Telcel]] in Acapulco, Nadal defeated world No. 4 David Ferrer, losing just two games in the match.

Nadal then returned to the American hard courts after a year, playing the [[2013 BNP Paribas Open – Men's Singles|Indian Wells Masters]] as the fifth seed. He lost only one set, and defeated world No. 2 [[Roger Federer]] and world No. 6 [[Tomáš Berdych]] in the matches leading up to the final. Nadal recovered from being one set down in the final, to defeat Juan Martín del Potro. This was his third Indian Wells Masters title and his first hardcourt title since October 2010, and made Nadal the player with the most Masters 1000s wins.

After withdrawing from Miami, Nadal attempted to defend his title at the [[2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters]], but, despite reaching the final for the ninth consecutive year, he was beaten by Djokovic in straight sets. He then won at the [[2013 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell]] over Almagro, in straight sets. This was his 8th victory there, making him the first man to win two different tournaments eight or more times each. It was also his fourth title of the season, and his sixth consecutive final.

Nadal won his 23rd ATP Masters 1000 tournament at the [[2013 Mutua Madrid Open]], beating Wawrinka, despite previously having been two points from defeat in his quarterfinal against David Ferrer. The blue clay that had troubled him the previous year there had been exchanged for the traditional red clay. In May, he won his record 24th Masters 1000 title, beating Roger Federer for his 7th championship at the [[2013 Rome Masters]]. It was his 6th title of the season and his eighth consecutive final. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 4.

Nadal won the [[2013 French Open]] after beating Djokovic in the [[Big Four (tennis)#2013 French Open semifinal|semifinal]] and Ferrer in the final. His match with Djokovic was widely considered one of the greatest clay court matches ever played, as Nadal came back from down a break in the fifth set to take out a hard-fought 4-hour, 37-minute victory. However, because of the nuances of how rankings are calculated (including an improvement in performance by the then world No. 5 David Ferrer at the French Open), Nadal's world ranking dropped from No. 4 to No. 5, with Ferrer replacing him at No. 4.

Nadal then lost his first-round match at the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships]] in straight sets to unseeded Belgian [[Steve Darcis]] (ranked No. 135), making it the second time in a row he failed to reach the third round at Wimbledon and the first ever time Nadal had lost in the first round of a Grand Slam.

In August 2013, Nadal won the semifinal match in Montreal, denying Djokovic his fourth [[Canadian Open (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] title.<ref name="CO2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2013/08/32/Montreal-Saturday-Djokovic-Nadal.aspx |title=Nadal Edges Djokovic In Montreal Thriller, Faces Raonic in Final |publisher=ATP World Tour |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> Nadal proceeded to win the title after beating [[Milos Raonic]] in the final in straight sets.

Later in September, Nadal helped Spain secure their Davis Cup World Group Playoff spot for 2014, with a victory against Sergiy Stakhovsky and a doubles win with Marc Lopez. In October, he reached the final of the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]], guaranteeing he would become world number one for the third time after losing it in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rafael Nadal reaches China Open final to become world number one |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/24409808 |work=BBC Sport |date=5 October 2013 |accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref> In the final, he was beaten by Djokovic in straight sets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Novak Djokovic beats Rafael Nadal in China Open final |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/24418035 |work=BBC Sport |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref> At the [[2013 Shanghai Rolex Masters]], Nadal reached the semi-finals but was defeated by Del Potro.

In November 2013, Nadal played his final event of the season in London at the [[2013 ATP World Tour Finals]] where he secured the year end World Number One spot. Nadal beat David Ferrer, Stanislas Wawrinka and Tomáš Berdych in the Round Robin stage to set up a semi final and victory over Roger Federer. Nadal met Djokovic in the final, losing in straight sets.

At the [[2014 Australian Open - Men's Singles|Australian Open]], he defeated [[Roger Federer]] to reach his third Australian Open final, improving his career record against Federer to 23–10. This marked Nadal's 11th consecutive victory in a Major semifinal (second only to Borg's all-time record of 14), and advanced him to his 19th Major final, tying him with Lendl for second all-time behind Federer's 24. It also marked Nadal's sixth consecutive victory over Federer in a Major. In the final, he faced [[Stanislas Wawrinka]], against whom he entered the match with a 12–0 record, having won all of their previous 26 sets.  After losing the first set, Nadal suffered a back injury down 2–0 in the second set, and although he won a set, he lost the match in four sets. The first tournament he played after that was the inaugural [[2014 Rio Open – Men's Singles|Rio Open]] which he won after defeating [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]] in the final extending his record of ATP 500 titles to 15. However, at the [[2014 BNP Paribas Open – Men's Singles|Indian Wells Masters]], Dolgopolov would avenge his loss, defeating Nadal in three sets in the third round. He reached the final of the [[2014 Sony Open Tennis – Men's Singles|Miami Masters]] before falling to [[Novak Djokovic]] in straight sets.

Nadal began his clay court season with a quarterfinal loss to [[David Ferrer]] in the [[2014 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters – Singles|Monte-Carlo Masters]]. He was stunned by [[Nicolas Almagro]] in the quarterfinals of the [[2014 Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell – Singles|Barcelona Open]]. Nadal won his 27th masters (a record at the time) at the [[2014 Mutua Madrid Open – Men's Singles|Madrid Open]] after [[Kei Nishikori]] retired in the third set.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> On 8 June 2014, Nadal defeated Novak Djokovic in the Men's Singles [[2014 French Open – Men's Singles|French Open final]] to win his 9th French Open title and a 5th straight win at Roland Garros. Nadal dropped the first set but came back in the game to win the next three sets to lift the trophy.

Nadal then entered the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon Championships]] in a bid to win the tournament for the third time and to win his 15th Grand Slam title overall. In the first three rounds he faced [[Martin Kližan]], Lukáš Rosol (to whom he suffered a shock defeat at the same stage of the tournament two years earlier) and [[Mikhail Kukushkin]]. In each of these matches he lost the first set before taking command and winning them in four sets. In the fourth round he faced Australian teenager [[Nick Kyrgios]] (ranked 143 places lower than Nadal) and again lost the first set, but despite winning the second set, he was unable to turn the tide and eventually lost in four sets.<ref name="Wimbledon 2014">{{cite news |last1=Newbery |first1=Piers |title=Rafael Nadal beaten by Nick Kyrgios at Wimbledon |url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/tennis/28118239 |date=1 July 2014 |accessdate=1 July 2014 |work=BBC Sport}}</ref>

In early September, Nadal once again faced Fognini, and again was defeated by the player from [[Italy]], losing in the third round at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]].

Nadal started the year winning [[2016 Mubadala World Tennis Championship|Mubadala Title]] defeating [[Milos Raonic]] in straight sets. After that, he entered the tournament in [[2016 Qatar ExxonMobil Open|Doha, Qatar]], where he reached the finals, losing to [[Novak Djokovic|Djokovic]] in straight sets. This was their 47th match and Djokovic now leads the rivalry with 24 matches won. At the [[2016 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Nadal was defeated in five sets by compatriot [[Fernando Verdasco]] in the first round, in a match that echoed memories of their marathon five-set semi-final from [[2009 Australian Open|2009]].

He went on to win his 17th ATP 500 in Barcelona, winning the trophy for the ninth time in his career; this was his 49th clay-court title, which put him level with [[Guillermo Vilas]] as the player with the most clay-court titles in the Open Era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/nadal-beats-nishikori-for-barcelona-2016-title|title=Nadal Notches Record-Tying 49th Clay-Court Title In Barcelona|publisher=ATP World Tour|date=24 April 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>
Nadal continued the clay court season in [[Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]], where he defeated [[Andrey Kuznetsov (tennis)|Andrey Kuznetsov]], [[Sam Querrey|Querrey]] and [[João Sousa|Sousa]] before falling to Murray in the semifinal.

==Playing style==
[[File:Rafael Nadal at the 2010 US Open 06.jpg|thumbnail|left|Nadal's forehand]]
Nadal generally plays an aggressive, behind-the-[[Tennis court#Dimensions|baseline]] game founded on heavy [[topspin]] groundstrokes, consistency, speedy footwork and tenacious court coverage, thus making him an aggressive counterpuncher.<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=3472238|title=Nadal Has Improved Virtually Every Aspect of His Game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=3 July 2008|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> Known for his athleticism and speed around the court, Nadal is an excellent defender<ref name="about bio">{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Cooper | title=Rafael Nadal&nbsp;– Game Profile | url =http://tennis.about.com/od/playersmale/a/nadalgp.htm | accessdate =30 July 2007 }}</ref> who hits well on the run, constructing winning plays from seemingly defensive positions. He also plays very fine dropshots, which work especially well because his heavy topspin often forces opponents to the back of the court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/yourgame/instructionarticles/netgame/netgame.aspx?id=123244|title=Rafael Nadal's Drop Volley|work=Tennis Magazine|date=27 March 2008|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Nadal 4 Monte Carlo 2007.jpg|thumb|Nadal playing on clay]]
Nadal employs a semi-western grip forehand, often with a "lasso-whip" follow through, where his left arm hits through the ball and finishes above his left shoulder – as opposed to a more traditional finish across the body or around his opposite shoulder.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elitetennistraining.com/free-online-tennis-lessons/gripping-the-tennis-racquet/ | title=How To Hold A Tennis Racket | accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.essentialtennis.com/category/video/grips/ | title=Essential Tennis –  Rafael Nadal’s Forehand Grip Revealed | accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref> Nadal's forehand groundstroke form allows him to hit shots with heavy topspin – more so than many of his contemporaries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/sports/tennis/27tennis.html |title=More and More Players Deliver Slap to Classic Forehand|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 June 2006|accessdate=30 January 2009 | first=Christopher | last=Clarey}}</ref>

San Francisco tennis researcher John Yandell used a high-speed video camera and special software to count the average number of revolutions of a tennis ball hit full force by Nadal. While Nadal's shots tend to land short of the baseline, the characteristically high bounces his forehands achieve tend to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/yourgame/instructionarticles/forehand/forehand.aspx?id=56544|title=The Forehand of Rafael Nadal|work=Tennis Magazine|date=15 December 2006|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> Although his forehand is based on heavy topspin, he can hit the ball deep and flat with a more orthodox follow through for clean winners.

{{rquote|right|"The first guys we did were Sampras and Agassi. They were hitting forehands that in general were spinning about 1,800 to 1,900 revolutions per minute.

Nadal's serve was initially considered a weak point in his game, although his improvements in both first-serve points won and break points saved since 2005 have allowed him to consistently compete for and win major titles on faster surfaces. Nadal relies on the consistency of his serve to gain a strategic advantage in points, rather than going for [[Serve (tennis)#Serve terminology|service winners]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/2304937/Rafael-Nadal-determined-to-keep-one-step-ahead-of-Roger-Federer.html|title=Rafael Nadal Determined to Keep One Step Ahead of Roger Federer|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=6 July 2008|accessdate=30 January 2009  | first=Clive | last=White}}</ref> However, before the 2010 US Open, he altered his service motion, arriving in the trophy pose earlier and pulling the racket lower during the trophy pose. Before the 2010 U.S. Open, Nadal modified his service grip to a more continental one. These two changes in his serve increased his average speed by around 10&nbsp;mph during the 2010 US Open, maxing out at 135&nbsp;mph (217&nbsp;km), allowing him to win more free points on his serve.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tony Kurdzuk/The Star-Ledger |url=http://www.nj.com/sports/njsports/index.ssf/2010/09/rafael_nadal_has_gotten_a_grip.html |title=12 September 2010 |work=The Star-Ledger |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> However, since the 2010 US Open, Nadal's serve speed has dropped to previous levels and has again been cited as a need for improvement.<ref>{{cite web|author=Timothy Rapp |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1044134-rafael-nadal-rafa-must-improve-serve-to-beat-novak-djokovic |title=Rafael Nadal: Rafa Must Improve Serve to Beat Novak Djokovic |publisher=Bleacher Report |date= 30 January 2012|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Skuzinski

Nadal is a clay court specialist in the sense that he has been extremely successful on that surface. Since 2005, he won nine times at Roland Garros, eight times at Monte Carlo and seven at Rome. However, Nadal has shed that label due to his success on other surfaces, including holding simultaneous Grand Slam tournament titles on grass, hard courts, and clay on two separate occasions, winning eight Masters series titles on hardcourt, and winning the Olympic gold medal on hardcourt.<ref name="ESPN"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/aus09/columns/story?columnist=harwitt_sandra&id=3876694|title=No limit to what Nadal can accomplish|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=1 February 2009|accessdate=1 February 2009}}</ref>

Despite praise for Nadal's talent and skill, some have questioned his longevity in the sport, citing his build and playing style as conducive to injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen07/news/story?id=2996956|title=Style of play catching up with Rafa?|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> Nadal himself has admitted to the physical toll hard courts place on [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP Tour]] players, calling for a reevaluated tour schedule featuring fewer hard court tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.com/tournaments/2009/australianopen/australianopen.aspx?id=163626|title=Oz Champ Nadal Wants Changes in Tennis Schedule|work=Tennis Magazine|date=2 February 2009|accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref>
<!-- Nadal is ''not'' a clay-court specialist. Although clay is his best surface, four of his slams have been on non-clay surfaces, he won the Olympic singles gold medal on hardcourt, and has won five Masters titles on hardcourts. Just because clay is his best surface does not make him a claycourt specialist. Sergi Bruguera, Thomas Muster, Alberto Berasategui, Carlos Costa – those are clay-court specialists, none of whom even made a major final other than the French (and all were terrible on grass). Nadal has made five Wimbledon finals and was clearly the second-best player in the world on grass for 2006, and 2007, and 2011, and was the best in 2008, and 2010. That is not counting his Australian Open title, U.S. Open titles, or Olympic gold medal. Nadal has made 10 of his 18 Grand Slam finals outside of clay. -->

===Involvement in football===
Nadal is an avid fan of association football club [[Real Madrid]]. On 8 July 2010, it was reported that he had become a shareholder of [[RCD Mallorca]], his local club by birth, in an attempt to assist the club from debt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE66727020100708 | agency=[[Reuters]] | title=Soccer-Rafa Nadal becomes shareholder at troubled Real Mallorca | date=9 July 2010}}</ref> Nadal reportedly owns 10 percent and was offered the role of vice president, but he rejected that offer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.realmallorca.co.uk/news/club/2010/sale-of-the-club-completed | work=[[Real Mallorca]]| title=Sale of the club completed | date=7 September 2010}}</ref> His uncle [[Miguel Ángel Nadal]], became assistant coach under [[Michael Laudrup]]. Nadal remains a passionate [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] supporter; ''[[ESPN.com]]'' writer Graham Hunter wrote, "He's as ''Merengue'' as [Real Madrid icons] [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]], [[Iker Casillas]] and [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]]."

Shortly after acquiring his interest in Mallorca, Nadal called out [[UEFA]] for apparent hypocrisy in ejecting the club from the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League]] for excessive debts, saying through a club spokesperson, "Well, if those are the criteria upon which UEFA is operating, then European competition will only comprise two or three clubs because all the rest are in debt, too."<ref name=Football>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/5542102/rafael-nadal-tries-save-mallorca-football-club |title=Rafa to the rescue |first=Graham |last=Hunter |publisher=[[ESPN]]  |date=9 September 2010 |accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref>

===Philanthropy===
Nadal took part in Thailand's "A Million Trees for the King" project, planting a tree in honour of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] on a visit to [[Hua Hin]] during his [[2010 PTT Thailand Open|Thailand Open 2010]]. "For me it's an honour to part of this project", said Nadal. "It's a very good project. I want to congratulate the Thai people and congratulate the King for this unbelievable day. I wish all the best for this idea. It's very, very nice."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/10/39/Bangkok-Nadal-Plants-Tree.aspx |title=Nadal Lends Hand To Million Trees Project |publisher=[[ATP World Tour]] |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2010}}</ref>

====Fundación Rafa Nadal====
The creation of the Fundación Rafa Nadal took place in November 2007, and its official presentation was in February 2008, at the Manacor Tennis Club in Mallorca, Spain. The foundation will focus on social work and development aid particularly on childhood and youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionrafanadal.org/ |title=Rafa Nadal Foundation |publisher=Fundacionrafanadal.com |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> On deciding why to start a foundation, Nadal said "This can be the beginning of my future, when I retire and have more time, [...] I am doing very well and I owe society, [...] A month-and-a-half ago I was in [[Chennai]], in India. The truth is we live great here....I can contribute something with my image..." Nadal was inspired by the [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|Red Cross]] benefit match against [[malaria]] with Real Madrid goalkeeper [[Iker Casillas]], recalling, "We raised an amount of money that we would never have imagined. I have to thank Iker, my project partner, who went all out for it, [...] That is why the time has come to set up my own foundation and determine the destination of the money."

Nadal's mother, Ana Maria Parera, chairs the charitable organization and father Sebastian is vice-chairman. Coach and uncle Toni Nadal and his agent, former tennis player [[Carlos Costa (tennis)|Carlos Costa]], are also involved. Roger Federer has given Nadal advice on getting involved in philanthropy. Despite the fact that poverty in India struck him particularly hard, Nadal wants to start by helping "people close by, in the [[Balearic Islands]], in Spain, and then, if possible, abroad".<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/185574,rafael-nadal-launches-foundation--feature.html |title=Rafael Nadal launches foundation |publisher= Earth Times News |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

On 16 October 2010, Nadal traveled to India for the first time to visit his tennis academy for underprivileged children at [[Anantapur Sports Village]], in the [[Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh|Anantapur City, Andhra Pradesh]]. His foundation has also worked in the Anantapur Educational Center project, in collaboration with the [[Vicente Ferrer Moncho|Vicente Ferrer Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rafaelnadal.com/content/rafa-and-his-foundation-india |title=Rafa and his foundation in India |publisher=The Official Rafa Nadal Website |accessdate=3 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110711114321/http://www.rafaelnadal.com:80/content/rafa-and-his-foundation-india |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rafa in India to promote tennis school |first=Sreenivas |last=Janyala |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/rafa-in-india-to-promote-tennis-school/698828/ |work=The Indian Express |location=Mumbai |date=18 October 2010}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Nadal lived with his parents and younger sister Maria Isabel in a five-story apartment building in their hometown of Manacor, Mallorca. In June 2009, Spanish newspaper ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', and then ''[[The New York Times]]'', reported that his parents, Ana Maria and Sebastian, had separated. This news came after weeks of speculation in Internet posts and message boards over Nadal's personal issues as the cause of his setback.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon09/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=4280346 | publisher=ESPN | title=Personal woes affecting Rafa? | date=23 July 2009}}</ref>
