This led to the names "Indies" and "Indian", which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the aboriginal peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by indigenous peoples but has been embraced by many over the last two centuries.{{Citation needed||date=January 2016}} Even though the term "Indian" does not include the [[Aleut]]s, [[Inuit]], or [[Yupik peoples]], these groups are considered indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally [[hunter-gatherer]]s—and many, especially in [[Amazonia]], still are—many groups practiced [[aquaculture]] and [[agriculture]]. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas.<ref name="mann">{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C.

Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially [[Belize]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Greenland]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], and [[Peru]]. At least a thousand different [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as the [[Quechuan languages]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Guarani language|Guaraní]], [[Mayan languages]], and [[Nahuatl]], count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, [[social organization]], and subsistence practices. Like most cultures, over time, cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects, but also cater to modern needs. Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from [[Western culture]] and a few are still counted as [[uncontacted peoples]].

The European colonization of the Americas forever changed the lives and cultures of the peoples of the continents. Although the exact pre-contact population of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80 and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The leading cause was disease. The continent was ravaged by epidemics of diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]], which were brought from Europe by the early explorers and spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them. Native Americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases. The loss of lives was exacerbated by conflict between colonists and indigenous people. Colonists also frequently perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Stacie E|chapter=Native Americans|title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity|editor=Dinah Shelton|publisher=Macmillan Library Reference|year=2004|pages=740–746|ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= David E. |last=Stannard| title = American Holocaust:The Conquest of the New World: The Conquest of the New World| year= 1993| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-508557-0 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| first = Russel | last=Thornton| title = American Indian Holocaust and Survival: ˜a Population History Since 1492| year = 1987| publisher = Norman : University of Oklahoma Press| isbn = 978-0-8061-2074-4 |ref=harv}}</ref> According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the North American Indian Wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 Native Americans.<ref>Thornton, Russell (1990).

Chief among these is [[maize]] or "corn", arguably the most important crop in the world.<ref>[[Michael Pollan]], ''The Omnivore's Dilemma''</ref> Other significant crops include [[cassava]], [[Salvia hispanica|chia]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] (pumpkins, zucchini, marrow, [[acorn squash]], [[butternut squash]]), the [[pinto bean]], ''[[Phaseolus]]'' beans including most [[common bean]]s, [[tepary bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[avocado]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (used to make [[chocolate]]), [[vanilla]], [[strawberries]], [[pineapple]]s, [[Capsicum|Peppers]] (species and varieties of ''[[Capsicum]]'', including [[bell pepper]]s, [[jalapeño]]s, [[paprika]] and [[chili pepper]]s) [[sunflower|sunflower seeds]], [[rubber]], [[brazilwood]], [[chicle]], [[tobacco]], [[coca]], [[manioc]] and some species of [[cotton]].

Studies of contemporary indigenous environmental management, including agro-forestry practices among [[Itza]] [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in Guatemala and hunting and fishing among the [[Menominee]] of Wisconsin, suggest that longstanding "sacred values" may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.<ref>Atran, Scott: Medin, Douglas (2010) ''The Native Mind and the Cultural Construction of Nature'', MIT Press</ref>

Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations. An example of such a [[cultural area]] is [[Mesoamerica]], where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of [[nomad]]ic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.

===Writing systems===
{{see also|Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cherokee syllabary|Quipu}}
[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], [[Mexico]]]]
The development of [[writing]] is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the [[Mesoamerica]]n region produced several [[Mesoamerican writing systems|indigenous writing systems]] beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the [[Cascajal Block]]. The [[Olmec]] hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] began to wane.<ref>{{cite web |last=Skidmore|first=Joel|title= The Cascajal Block: The Earliest Precolumbian Writing|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/Cascajal.pdf|year= 2006|pages= 1–4|publisher= Mesoweb Reports & News|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>

The Maya [[writing system]] (often called ''[[Maya script|hieroglyphs]]'' from a superficial resemblance to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian writing) was a combination of [[phonetic]] symbols and [[logogram]]s. It is most often classified as a '''[[logogram|logographic]]''' or (more properly) a '''[[logosyllabic]]''' writing system, in which [[syllabary|syllabic]] signs play a significant role. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the [[spoken language]] of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different [[glyph]]s although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.

[[Aztec codices]] (singular ''[[codex]]'') are [[book]]s written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era [[Aztec]]s. These codices provide some of the best [[primary sources]] for [[Aztec society|Aztec culture]]. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.<ref>Elizabeth Hill Boone, "Pictorial Documents and Visual Thinking in Postconquest Mexico". p. 158.</ref> The colonial era codices not only contain [[Aztec writing|Aztec pictograms]], but also [[Classical Nahuatl]] (in the [[Latin alphabet]]), [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and occasionally [[Latin]].

Spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters and there is a large number of local-level documents in [[Nahuatl]], [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], and Yucatec [[Mayan languages|Maya]] from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.<ref>Frances Karttunen, "Nahuatl Literacy," in George A. Collier et al, eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York: Academic Press 1982, pp. 395-417.</ref> The Spanish crown gathered such documentation and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the [[New Philology]] to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref>

The [[Wiigwaasabak]], [[birch bark]] scrolls on which the [[Ojibwa]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics]].

Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply '''syllabics''', is a family of [[abugida]]s used to write some Aboriginal [[Canada|Canadian]] languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Inuit]], and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language families.

===Music and art===

[[Native American music]] in North America is almost entirely [[Texture (music)|monophonic]], but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around [[drum]]ming. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. [[Flute]]s were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in [[Northern California]], a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The [[Apache fiddle]] is a single [[stringed instrument]].
[[File:False face mask 2 EthnM.jpg|thumb|upright|A carved wood Iroquois mask used by the [[False Face Society]], Berlin Ethnological Museum]]
The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America was often [[pentatonic]]. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and other Europeans, music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and [[wind instrument]]s such as drums, flutes, sea snail shells (used as a trumpet) and "rain" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600–900 CE), which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European [[musical instrument]]s; when played it produces a sound virtually identical to a jaguar's growl.<ref>A sample of this sound is available at the [http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html Princeton Art Museum website].</ref>

Large numbers of Bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of "empowered caciques" to further communal organization.

That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the [[ILO Convention 169]] and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories. The 1994 [[Law of Popular Participation]] granted "grassroots territorial organizations" that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas.

Some radio and television programs in Quechua and Aymara are produced. The constitutional reform in 1997 recognized Bolivia as a multilingual, pluri-ethnic society and introduced [[education reform]]. In 2005, for the first time in the country's history, an indigenous Aymara, [[Evo Morales]], was elected as President.

===Chile===

{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Chile}}
[[File:Hombre & mujer Mapuche.jpg|thumb|Mapuche man and woman. The Mapuche make up about 85% of Chile's indigenous population.]]
According to the 2002 Census, 4.6% of the Chilean population, including the [[Rapanui]] (a [[Polynesians|Polynesian people]]) of [[Easter Island]], was indigenous, although most show varying degrees of mixed heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medwave.cl/ciencia/11.act |title=El gradiente sociogenético chileno y sus implicaciones ético-sociales |publisher=Medwave.cl |date=2000-06-15 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref> Many are descendants of the [[Mapuche]], and live in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Araucanía Region|Araucanía]] and the [[Zona Sur|lake district]]. The Mapuche successfully fought off defeat in the first 300–350 years of Spanish rule during the [[Arauco War]]. Relations with the new Chilean Republic were good until the Chilean state decided to occupy their lands. During the [[Occupation of Araucanía]] the Mapuche surrendered to the country's army in the 1880s. Their land was opened to settlement by Chileans and Europeans. [[Mapuche conflict|Conflict over Mapuche land rights]] continues to the present.

Other groups include the [[Aymara people|Aymara]], the majority of whom live in Bolivia and Peru, with smaller numbers in the [[Arica-Parinacota Region|Arica-Parinacota]] and [[Tarapacá Region]]s, and the [[Atacama people]] (''Atacameños''), who reside mainly in [[El Loa]].

===Colombia===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Colombia}}
[[File:Guambia, Colombia.jpg|thumb|[[Guambía people]] relaxing in [[Colombia]]]]
A minority today within [[Colombia]]'s overwhelmingly [[Mestizo]] and [[White Colombian]] population, Colombia's indigenous peoples consist of around 85 distinct cultures and more than 1,378,884 people.<ref>DANE 2005 national census</ref><ref>[http://www.who.int/social_determinants/resources/isa_etnic_minorities_col.pdf "Health equity and ethnic minorities in emergency situations"], Pier Paolo Balladelli, José Milton Guzmán, Marcelo Korc, Paula Moreno, Gabriel Rivera, The Commission on Social Health Determinants, [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[World Health Organization]], [[Bogotá|Bogotá, Colombia]], 2007</ref> A variety of [[collective rights]] for indigenous peoples are recognized in the 1991 Constitution.

One of the influences is the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] culture, a subset of the larger [[Chibcha]] [[ethnic group]], famous for their use of [[gold]], which led to the legend of ''[[El Dorado]]''. At the time of the [[Spanish conquest]], the Muisca were the largest native civilization geographically between the [[Inca Empire|Incas]] and the [[Aztec]]s empires.

===Costa Rica===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica}}
There are over 60,000 inhabitants of Native American origins, representing 1.5% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (In the Central Valley), Matambú or [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku people|Maleku]] (Northern Alajuela), [[Bribri people|Bribri]] (Southern Atlantic), [[Cabécar people|Cabécar]] (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Guaymí]] (Southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), [[Boruca people|Boruca]] (Southern Costa Rica) and [[Ngäbe people|Ngäbe]] (Southern Costa Rica).

These native groups are characterized for their work in wood, like masks, drums and other artistic figures, as well as fabrics made of cotton.

Their subsistence is based on agriculture, having corn, beans and plantains as the main crops.

===Cuba===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
In [[Cuba]] the [[population]] of Amerindians includes 0.1 of the population and 0.2 part Native which is also part of the population. Many are from the [[Taino people]] or [[Arawak people]]. When the [[Spanish Empire]] was in control of the island they used the Natives as slaves and many died from diseases, hence decreasing the population. Presently 0.3 of the population of [[Cuba]] consists of part Native and full-blooded Amerindians.

===Dominica===
Dominica is home to the [[Carib Territory]], one of the last indigenous communities in the Caribbean. The Carib Territory is home to an estimated 3,000 Kalinago or Carib people.

===Ecuador===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Ecuador}}
[[File:EquateurOtavalo 0606.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Otavalo people|Otavalo]] girl from Ecuador]]
[[Ecuador]] was the site of many indigenous cultures, and civilizations of different proportions. An early sedentary culture, known as the [[Valdivia culture]], developed in the coastal region, while the [[Caras (tribe)|Caras]] and the [[Quitu]]s unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the Capital Quito. The [[Cañari]]s near [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] were the most advanced, and most feared by the [[Inca]], due to their fierce resistance to the Incan expansion. Their architecture remains were later destroyed by Spaniards and the Incas.

Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendents of Incans, they are [[Kichwa]] speakers and include the Caranqui, the [[Otavalo people|Otavalo]]s, the Cayambi, the Quitu-Caras, the [[Panzaleo]], the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruhá, the [[Cañari]], and the Saraguro. Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may have been the descendants of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador as ''mitimaes''.

Coastal groups, including the [[Awá (kwaiker)|Awá]], [[Ecuador|Chachi]], and the [[Tsáchila]], make up 0.24% percent of the indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Kichwa (the Canelo and the Quijos), the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], the [[Huaorani]], the Siona-Secoya, the [[Cofán]], and the [[Achuar people|Achuar]].

In 1986, indigenous people formed the first "truly" national [[Political organisation|political organization]]. [[CONAIE|The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[CONAIE]]) has been the primary political institution of the Indigenous since then and is now the second largest political party in the nation. It has been influential in national politics, contributing to the ouster of presidents [[Abdalá Bucaram]] in 1997 and [[Jamil Mahuad]] in 2000.

===El Salvador===

[[File:Nuestros Angeles de El Salvador.jpg|thumb|Indigenous Salvadoran [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women dancing in the traditional Procession of Palms, [[Panchimalco]] in [[El Salvador]]]]
Much of [[El Salvador]] was home to the [[Pipil people|Pipil]], the [[Lenca people|Lenca]], Xinca, and Kakawira. The Pipil lived in western [[El Salvador]], spoke [[Nahuat|Nawat]], and had many settlements there, most noticeably [[Cuzcatlan]]. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and [[fertile soil|fertile land]] that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [[El Salvador]] as they had in other lands like [[Guatemala]] or [[Mexico]], but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people. Today many Pipil and other indigenous populations live in the many small towns of El Salvador like [[Izalco]], [[Panchimalco]], [[Sacacoyo]], and [[Nahuizalco]].

===Guatemala===
{{main|Demographics of Guatemala}}
[[File:Guatémala 78.jpg|thumb|left|Maya women from Guatemala]]
Most of the indigenous peoples of [[Guatemala]] are of [[Maya peoples|Maya]] heritage. The [[Xinca people]] are a non-Maya indigenous people.

Pure Maya account for some forty percent of the population; although around forty percent of the population speaks an [[indigenous language]], those tongues (of which there are more than twenty) enjoy no official status. Guatemala's majority population holds a percentage of 59.4% in [[White people|White]] or [[Mestizo]] (of mixed European and indigenous ancestry) people. The area of [[Livingston, Guatemala]] is highly influenced by the Caribbean and its population includes a combination of Mestizos and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] people.

===Honduras===

===Mexico===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Mexico}}
[[File:Huichol indian.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huichol people|Wixarika (Huichol)]] woman from Zacatecas]]
The territory of modern-day [[Mexico]] was home to numerous indigenous civilizations prior to the arrival of the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]es'': The [[Olmec]]s, who flourished from between 1200 BCE to about 400 BCE in the coastal regions of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] and the [[Mixtec]]s, who held sway in the mountains of [[Oaxaca]] and the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]; the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in the [[Yucatan]] (and into neighbouring areas of contemporary [[Central America]]); the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] in present-day [[Michoacán]] and surrounding areas, and the [[Aztec]]s/[[Mexica]], who, from their central capital at [[Tenochtitlan]], dominated much of the centre and south of the country (and the non-Aztec inhabitants of those areas) when [[Hernán Cortés]] first landed at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]].

In contrast to what was the general rule in the rest of North America, the history of the colony of [[New Spain]] was one of racial intermingling (''mestizaje''). ''[[Mestizo]]s'', which in Mexico designate people who do not identify culturally with any indigenous grouping, quickly came to account for a majority of the colony's population; but 6% of the Mexican population identify as speakers of one of the indigenous languages. The [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]] identifies 62 indigenous groups in Mexico, each with a unique language.<ref>[http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/257.pdf Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas] (PDF).</ref>

In the states of [[Chiapas]] and [[Oaxaca]] and in the interior of the [[Yucatan]] peninsula the majority of the population is indigenous. Large indigenous minorities, including [[Aztecs]] or [[Nahua people|Nahua]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]]s, [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], and [[Mixtec]]s are also present in the central regions of Mexico. In Northern Mexico indigenous people are a small minority.

Nonetheless, of the indigenous peoples in Mexico, only about 67% of them (or 5.4% of the country's population) speak an indigenous language and about a sixth do not speak Spanish (1.2% of the country's population).<ref>{{cite web |title=Poblicación de 5 años y más por Entidad Federativa, sexo y grupos lengüa indígena quinquenales de edad, y su distribución según condición de habla indígena y habla española |work=INEGI, México|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00li01.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 December 2007}}</ref>

===Nicaragua===
About 5% of the Nicaraguan population are indigenous. The largest indigenous group in Nicaragua is the [[Miskito people]]. Their territory extended from [[Cape Camarón]], [[Honduras]], to [[La Cruz de Río Grande|Rio Grande]], [[Nicaragua]] along the [[Mosquito Coast]]. There is a native [[Miskito language]], but large groups speak [[Miskito Coast Creole]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Rama language|Rama]] and other languages. The [[English-based creole languages|Creole English]] came about through frequent contact with the British who colonized the area. Many are Christians. Traditional Miskito [[society]] was highly structured with a defined [[politics|political]] structure. There was a [[monarch|king]], but he did not have total power. Instead, the power was split between himself, a [[Miskito Governor|governor]], a [[Miskito General|general]], and by the 1750s, an [[Miskito Admiral|admiral]]. Historical information on kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-[[mythology|mythical]]. Another major group is the [[Sumo people|Mayangna (or Sumu) people]], counting some 10,000 people.<ref>Gould, J. L. (1998). To die in this way: Nicaraguan Indians and the myth of mestizaje, 1880-1965. Duke University Press.</ref>

Other indigenous groups in Nicaragua are located in the Central and Northern Pacific area and they are self-identified as follows: [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]], [[Cacaopera]], Xiu-Subtiaba and Nahoa.<ref>[http://www.pueblosindigenaspcn.net/component/content/article/84.html CaracterĂsticas Socioculturales de los Pueblos IndĂgenas del PacĂfico, Centro y Norte].

Indigenous peoples in what is now the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]], including their descendants, are commonly called "American Indians", or simply "Indians" domestically, or "Native Americans" by the [[United States Census Bureau|USCB]]. In Alaska, indigenous peoples belong to 11 cultures with 11 languages. These include the [[St. Lawrence Island Yupik]], [[Iñupiat]], [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]], [[Yup'ik]], [[Cup'ik]], [[Unangax]], [[Alutiiq]], [[Eyak]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tsimshian]], and [[Tlingit]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Education and Programs: Traditional Territories of Alaska Native Cultures|url=http://www.alaskanative.net/en/main-nav/education-and-programs/cultures-of-alaska/|website=Alaskan Native Heritage Center Museum|accessdate=8 November 2015|location=Anchorage, AK}}</ref> who are collectively called [[Alaska Natives]]. Indigenous [[Polynesia|Polynesian peoples]], which include [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]], [[Samoan people|Samoan]], [[Tahitian people|Tahitian]], and [[Demographics of Tonga|Tongan]], are politically considered [[Pacific Islands American]] but are geographically and culturally distinct from indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Native Americans in the United States make up 0.97%<ref>{{cite web|title=North America: United States|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html|website=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=28 October 2015}}</ref> to 2% of the population. In the 2010 census, 2.9 million people self-identified as Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native alone, and 5.2 million people identified as U.S. Native Americans, either alone or in combination with one or more ethnicity or other races.<ref name="uscensus"/> 1.8 million are recognized as enrolled tribal members.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Tribes have established their own criteria for membership, which are often based on [[blood quantum]], [[lineal descent]], or residency. A minority of US Native Americans live in land units called [[Indian reservation]]s. Some California and Southwestern tribes, such as the [[Kumeyaay]], [[Cocopa]], [[Pascua Yaqui]] and [[Apache]] span both sides of the US–Mexican border. [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee people]] have the legal right to freely cross the US–Canadian border. [[Athabaskan languages|Athabascan]], [[Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tsimshian people|Tsimshian]], [[Inupiat people|Iñupiat]], [[Blackfeet]], [[Nakota]], [[Cree]], [[Anishinaabe]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Lenape]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]], and Haudenosaunee, among others live in both Canada and the US.

===Venezuela===
{{main|Indigenous peoples in Venezuela}}
[[File:A Warao family in their canoe.jpg|thumb|right|A Venezuelan [[Warao people|Warao family]] traveling in their canoe]]
Most [[Venezuela]]ns have some indigenous heritage, but the indigenous population make up only around 2% of the total population. They speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects, but some of the ethnic groups are very small and their languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades. The most important indigenous groups are the [[Ye'kuana]], the [[Wayuu]], the [[Pemon]] and the [[Warao people|Warao]]. The most advanced native people to have lived in present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the [[Timoto-cuicas]], who mainly lived in the Venezuelan Andes. In total it is estimated that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand inhabitants, the most densely populated area being the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to the advanced agricultural techniques used.

The 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]] gives them [[special rights]], although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The largest groups receive some basic [[primary education]] in their languages.

===Other parts of the Americas===
Indigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Uruguay]] ([[Charrua|Native Charrúa]]). According to the 2011 Census, 2.4% of Uruguayans reported having indigenous ancestry.<ref name="enha_asc"/> At least four of the Native American languages ([[Quechua language|Quechua]] in Peru and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in Peru and [[Bolivia]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] in [[Greenland]]) are recognized as official languages.

==Native American name controversy==
{{Main|Native American name controversy}}

The Native American name controversy is an ongoing dispute over the acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes.  When discussing broader subsets of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship. Many [[English language|English]] [[exonyms]] have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some of these names were based on foreign-language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists, while others resulted from the colonists' attempt to translate [[endonyms]] from the native language into their own, and yet others were pejorative terms arising out of prejudice and fear, during periods of [[American Indian Wars|conflict]].

However, since the 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about the ways they wish to be referred to, pressing for the elimination of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term "[[Native American]]," to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation, but this term was not fully accepted. Other naming conventions have been proposed and used, but none are accepted by all indigenous groups.

==Rise of indigenous movements==
{{Indigenous rights}}
In recent years, there has been a rise of indigenous movements in the Americas (mainly South America). These are rights-driven groups that organize themselves in order to achieve some sort of [[self-determination]] and the preservation of their culture for their peoples. Organizations like the [[Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin]] and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are breaking the barrier of borders in order to obtain rights for [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] indigenous populations everywhere. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and the accession of native Indian group into the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].

There has also been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale, with the [[United Nations]] adopting the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], despite dissent from the stronger countries of the Americas.

In Colombia, various indigenous groups protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in [[Cali]] in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [[free trade]] pact with the United States.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html Africa.euters.com] {{wayback|url=http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html |date=20081027221046 |df=y }}</ref>

===Legal prerogative===
[[File:Evomorales-cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Evo Morales]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]), [[President of Bolivia]]]]

The first indigenous president to be democratically elected in Latin America was [[Benito Juarez]], a Mexican of the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] ethnic group, who was elected President of Mexico in 1858.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harten|first=Sven|title=The Rise of Evo Morales|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-523-9|url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Rise-Evo-Morales-MAS/dp/1848135238/ref=dp_return_1?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books}}</ref>

With the rise to power of governments in [[Hugo Chavez's foreign policy#Vatican|Venezuela]], Ecuador, Paraguay, and especially Bolivia where [[Evo Morales]] was the first indigenous descendant elected [[president of Bolivia]], the indigenous movement gained a strong foothold.

Representatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned plans by the European "foreign [[power elite]]" to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with the Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. Furthermore, in a cathartic blow to the US-backed elite, it questioned US interference through diplomats and NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries, including Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and [[Nicaragua]].<ref name="plenglish">[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D)&language=EN Plenglish.com] {{wayback|url=http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D)&language=EN |date=20090409050852 |df=y }}</ref>

The forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called "Crescent departments" in Bolivia to impose their autonomous statutes, applauded the decision to expel the US ambassador to Bolivia, and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency. Amongst others, representatives of [[CONAIE]], the [[National Indigenous Organization of Colombia]], the Chilean Council of All Lands, and the Brazilian Landless Movement participated in the forum.<ref name="plenglish"/>

Colours of the arrows correspond to approximate timing of the events and are decoded in the coloured time-bar. The initial peopling of Berinigia (depicted in light yellow) was followed by a standstill after which the ancestors of indigenous Americans spread swiftly all over the New World while some of the Beringian maternal lineages–C1a-spread westwards.

A 2013 study in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young boy from the [[Mal'ta-Buret' culture|archaeological Mal'ta-Buret' culture]] suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to [[Eurasia#Anthropology and genetics|western Eurasians]], who may have "had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought".<ref name=Raghavan>{{cite journal |last1=Raghavan |first1=Maanasa |last2=Skoglund |first2=Pontus |last3=Graf |first3=Kelly E. |last4=Metspalu |first4=Mait |last5=Albrechtsen |first5=Anders |last6=Moltke |first6=Ida |last7=Rasmussen |first7=Simon |last8=Stafford Jr |first8=Thomas W. |last9=Orlando |first9=Ludovic |last10=Metspalu |first10=Ene |last11=Karmin |first11=Monika |last12=Tambets |first12=Kristiina |last13=Rootsi |first13=Siiri |last14=Mägi |first14=Reedik |last15=Campos |first15=Paula F. |last16=Balanovska |first16=Elena |last17=Balanovsky |first17=Oleg |last18=Khusnutdinova |first18=Elza |last19=Litvinov |first19=Sergey |last20=Osipova |first20=Ludmila P. |last21=Fedorova |first21=Sardana A. |last22=Voevoda |first22=Mikhail I. |last23=DeGiorgio |first23=Michael |last24=Sicheritz-Ponten |first24=Thomas |last25=Brunak |first25=Søren |last26=Demeshchenko |first26=Svetlana |last27=Kivisild |first27=Toomas |last28=Villems |first28=Richard |last29=Nielsen |first29=Rasmus |last30=Jakobsson |first30=Mattias |last31=Willerslev |first31=Eske |title=Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans |journal=Nature |volume=505 |issue=7481 |pages=87–91 |year=2014 |pmid=24256729 |pmc=4105016 |doi=10.1038/nature12736 |laysummary=http://news.ku.dk/all_news/2013/2013.11/ancient_siberian_genome_reveals_genetic_origins_of_native_americans/ |laysource=University of Copenhagen |laydate=November 20, 2013}}</ref> "We estimate that 14 to 38 percent of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population," the authors wrote. Professor Kelly Graf said,
<blockquote>Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that [[History of Siberia#Prehistory and antiquity|Upper Paleolithic Siberians]] came from a cosmopolitan population of [[Recent African origin of modern humans|early modern humans that spread out of Africa]] to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons like [[Buhl Woman]] with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day indigenous Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia.</blockquote>

A route through Beringia is seen as more likely than the [[Solutrean hypothesis]].<ref name=Raghavan/> Kashani et al. 2012 state that "The similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians. Taking into account that C4c is deeply rooted in the Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny and is indubitably of Asian origin, the finding that C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an Atlantic glacial entry route into North America."<ref name=Kashani>{{cite journal |last1=Kashani |first1=Baharak Hooshiar |last2=Perego |first2=Ugo A. |last3=Olivieri |first3=Anna |last4=Angerhofer |first4=Norman |last5=Gandini |first5=Francesca |last6=Carossa |first6=Valeria |last7=Lancioni |first7=Hovirag |last8=Semino |first8=Ornella |last9=Woodward |first9=Scott R. |last10=Achilli |first10=Alessandro |last11=Torroni |first11=Antonio |title=Mitochondrial haplogroup C4c: A rare lineage entering America through the ice-free corridor? |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=35–9 |year=2012 |pmid=22024980 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21614 }}</ref>
