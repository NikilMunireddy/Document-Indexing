'''Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre co.ltd''' ('''CMLL'''; {{IPA-es|konˈsexo munˈdjal de ˈlutʃa ˈliβɾe}}, "World Wrestling Council") is a ''[[lucha libre]]'' free-style professional wrestling promotion based in [[Mexico City]] while running cards in [[Guadalajara]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] and elsewhere in central and southern [[Mexico]]. The promotion is also referred to by its previous name '''Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre''' ('''EMLL''') (''Mexican Wrestling Enterprise''). Founded in 1933, it became the world's oldest pro wrestling promotion still in existence when [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] was sold in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref>

CMLL has been nicknamed "The serious and the stable" , referencing their very conservative booking style and their traditional structure to how wrestlers are used and allowed to express themselves. Outside of live Television broadcasts CMLL has not shown matches where one of the competitors bleed. They have a few [[steel cage match]]es and on occasion have ''Super Libre'' matches where there are no disqualifications, but otherwise does not promote any variety of matches that would be considered [[hardcore wrestling]], nor match types such as [[Ladder match]]es. CMLL has on occasion fired wrestlers for excessive violence, like the use of chairs, during a match or for using profanity while addressing the crowd during a show.

CMLL currently recognizes and promotes twelve "World Championships" for various weight divisions and classifications, six national level and six regional level championships. The [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows|CMLL Anniversary Show]] series is the longest running annual major show, starting in 1934 and with the [[CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show]] being the most recent. CMLL also regularly promotes major events under the names ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' ("Homage to two legends"), [[Sin Piedad]] ("No Mercy"), ''[[Sin Salida]]'' ("No Escape"), ''[[Infierno en el Ring]]'' ("Inferno in the Ring") during the year. CMLL has promoted their regular weekly ''[[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]]'' ("Super Friday") on a regular basis since the 1930s. Founder Salvador Lutteroth funded the building of [[Arena Coliseo]] in 1943, making it the first building in Mexico built specifically for professional wrestling.

==History==
Prior to 1933, ''[[lucha libre]]'' shows in Mexico were primarily promoted by foreign promoters doing the occasional through through Mexico or a few scattered local promoters, especially along the U.S. border, who brought in American professional wrestlers as their main attractions.

===Creation===
In 1929, [[Salvador Lutteroth]], who at the time was a property inspector for the Mexican Tax department, moved to [[Ciudad Juárez]] near the Mexico/U.S. border. During a trip to El Paso, Texas Lutteroth witnessed a [[professional wrestling]] show and was intrigued by the show and especially the main event Greek wrestler [[Gus Pappas]].<ref name=Lutteroth>{{cite book|title=Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=Los Lutteroth / the Lutteroths|pages=20–27|isbn=968-6842-48-9}}</ref><ref name=MondoStart>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> Four years later Lutteoth, along with his financial backer Francisco Ahuada chartered ''Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre'' (EMLL; The "Mexican Wrestling Enterprise"), the first Mexican owned wrestling promotion in the country. EMLL held their first shown on September 21, 1933, considered the "birth of Lucha libre" and led to Lutteroth being known as "the father of Lucha Libre" .<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe/22262-wed-update-flair-in-boston-ratings-anniversary-white-on-hhh-dgusa-star-on-smackdown-orton | title= WED.

EMLL initially tried to book Arena Nacional, the premier boxing venue in [[Mexico City]] but the promoters would not let him rent it, forcing Lutteroth and EMLL to take up residence in [[Arena México|Arena Modelo]], an abandoned and run down facility that Lutteroth was able to use as his home base. The concept of Lucha Libre quickly became very popular, so much so that the [[EMLL 1st Anniversary Show]] drew a sell out crowd of 5,000 paying fans. In 1934, an American wrestler debuted in Mexico under a [[wrestling mask|black, leather mask]], and Lutteroth dubbed him "[[Cyclone Mackey|La Maravilla Enmascarada]]" or "The Masked Marvel". In the United States the concept of the masked wrestler was more of a mid-level attraction, but the reaction to ''La Maravilla Enmascarada'' led to Lutteroth and the EMLL officials to introduce more masks, starting with a wrestler known simply as ''El Enmascarado'' ("the Masked Wrestler") and late on El Murciélago Enmascarado ("The Masked Bat"). Through the use of the masks and ring characters EMLL helped create the sacred position of the mask in ''Lucha libre'', making it the ultimate status symbol for ''luchadors''.<ref name=Lutteroth/><ref name=MondoStart/> In the early days of EMLL most of the top names were Americans, but with time EMLL introduced several Mexican natives that became so popular that they began to main event most of the EMLL shows. In order to expand their business EMLL began working with a number of local wrestling promoters across Mexico, allowing them to use the EMLL name and some of their contracted wrestlers while also gaining access to local wrestlers in return. Each booking office was independent of each other but the main office in Mexico City had the final say if there were disputes over who would be able to book certain wrestlers.<ref name=Lutteroth/><ref name=MondoStart/>

In 1942, a masked wrestler clad is silver, simply known as [[El Santo]] ("the Saint"), a man who go on to become a cultural icon in Mexico and is often cited as the greatest Mexican wrestler of all times.<ref name=MondoSanto>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=200|chapter=Los Enmascarados (the masked med): El Santo|pages=71–79|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> With the popularity of El Santo as well as other Mexican stars such as  [[Bobby Bonales]], [[Tarzán López]], [[Cavernario Galindo]] and [[Gory Guerrero]] Arena Modelo eventually became too small to accommodate the demand for tickets. To solve the problem Lutteroth financed the construction of [[Arena Coliseo]] in Mexico City, the first arena in Mexico built specifically for professional wrestling and the first sports building in Mexico to have built in air conditioning. The arena, nicknamed the "Lagunilla Funnel" due to its interior shape would hold over 8,800 spectators when configured for ''Lucha libre'' or boxing. Arena Coliseo began hosting EMLL's annual [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows|Anniversary shows]] starting with the [[EMLL 10th Anniversary Show|10th Anniversary show]].<ref name=Lutteroth/><ref name=Mondo/><ref name=76Anniversaries>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/?p=3072|title=Historia de Los Aniversarios del CMLL|date=September 2, 2010|accessdate=September 28, 2012|work=The Gladiatores Magazine|language=Spanish}}</ref>

In 1953, Salvador Lutteroth joined the US based [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), becoming the official [[List of NWA territories|NWA territory]] for all of Mexico, known as "NWA-EMLL" outside of Mexico. By joining the NWA Lutteroth and EMLL gained control of the [[NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]]. They were also able to re-brand their "World Middleweight Championship to become the [[NWA World Middleweight Championship]] and their [[World Welterweight Championship]] became the [[NWA World Middleweight Championship]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|chapter=Mexico: EMLL NWA World Light Heavyweight Title|page=389|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|chapter=Mexico: EMLL NWA World Middlweight Title|pages=389–390|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|chapter=Mexico: EMLL NWA Welterweight Heavyweight Title|page=390|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> In the early 1950s television became as a viable entertainment medium in Mexico which was set to bolster the popularity of EMLL, but Arena Coliseo was not equipped properly for television transmissions. As it turns out luck was on Lutteroth and EMLL's side as Lutteroth and the personnel at Arena Coliseo bought a lottery ticket worth 5 million [[Mexican Peso|Pesos]]. Lutteroth used his portion of the winnings to finance the construction of [[Arena México]], on the location where Arena Modelo used to sit. Arena México enabled EMLL to broadcast their weekly wrestling shows across Mexico, yielding a popularity explosion for the sport.<ref name=Lutteroth/><ref name=MondoStart/> Starting in 1956, with the [[EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show]] all anniversary shows were held in Arena México, except the [[EMLL 46th Anniversary Show]]. Over time the arena became known as "The Cathedral of Lucha Libre".

Over time, Lutteroth retired from the day-to-day operations of EMLL leaving the company in the hands of his son Salvador "Chavo" Lutteroth Jr.<ref name=Lutteroth/><ref name=MondoStart/> in 1975 local promoter [[Francisco Flores (wrestling)|Francisco Flores]], along with EMLL trainer [[Ray Mendoza]] broke away from EMLL, citing their displeasure with EMLL's conservative, restrictive promotional style. The two took a number of EMLL's younger wrestlers with them to form ''Lucha Libre Internacional, S. C'', later known as the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA).<ref name=MondoStart/> With the creation of the UWA EMLL faced a rival national promotion for the first time.<ref name=MondoMendoza>{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Ray Mendoza and Los Villaños | pages = 1936–196 | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref>

===Becoming CMLL===
[[File:Cmll.png|thumb|150px|The original logo of Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre.]]
In the mid-1980s, Chavo Lutteroth retired, allowing his nephew [[Paco Alonso]], grandson of Salvador Lutteroth, to take control of EMLL. In the late 1980s EMLL decided to leave the NWA, seeking to distance themselves from the political infighting left the National Wrestling Alliance. In 1991 EMLL changed their name to ''Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre'' (CMLL; "World Wrestling Council") to establish a new identity after the NWA split.<ref name=Mondo>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=Okay... what is Lucha Libre?|pages=29–40|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> From 1991 through 1993 CMLL created eight "CMLL World" titles in addition to the three NWA branded titles they retained and a slew of other championships.<ref name=CMLLTitles>{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter = MEXICO: EMLL CMLL| pages = 395–410 |year= 2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> At the start of the 1990s the company began appearing on the national [[Televisa]] network, which led to a second big boom in business due to the renewed national television exposure, in the mid-1970s through the 1980s, magazines and newspapers were the sole medium of Lucha Libre for most Mexicans.

===AAA split and rivalry===
In the mid-1980s, retired wrestler [[Antonio Peña]] became one of the main bookers for EMLL, helping determine who would win matches, what storylines to use and so on, he was also a driving force behind the name change to ''Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre''.<ref name=SLOrbit>{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}</ref> Peña would often clash with Juan Herrera, the other main booker for CMLL at the time. Herrera wanted to maintain the old style of booking with heavyweights such as [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]], [[El Dandy]] and [[El Satánico]], while Peña wanted to feature younger, faster moving wrestlers such as [[Konnan]], [[Octagón]] or [[Máscara Sagráda]]. In the end CMLL owner Paco Alonso decided to go with Herrera's booking style.<ref name=SL182>{{cite news | author = Ocampo, Ernesto | title = El fin de una era: Adiós a Antonio Peña | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 182 | date = October 7, 2006 | url=http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/ | accessdate = October 14, 2009| language = Spanish}}</ref>

After Paco Alonso chose to ignore Peña's booking ideas, Peña began negotiations with ''Televisa'' television channel to fund a new wrestling promotion that would provide ''Televisa'' with weekly wrestling shows. In 1992 Peña started a booking agency, providing wrestlers and matches for the ''Televisa'' owned [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA) promotion. While Peña technically owned the promotion ''Televisa'' owns the rights to the AAA name.<ref name=SLOrbit/> In a move that mirrored Flores' departure in the 1970s Peña left the promotion alongside a number of young wrestlers who were unhappy with their position in the promotion. With the creation of AAA the promotion replaced the UWA as Mexico's other main wrestling promotion, creating a long running rivalry between CMLL and AAA.<ref name=SLOrbit/> Starting in 1996 CMLL began promoting an annual show in March, first paying homage to Salvador Lutteroth, then later Lutteroth and El Santo and then finally becoming the ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' ("Homage to Two Legends") annual show series.<ref name="BrazoFamily">{{cite book|title= Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling | publisher= Distributed Art Publishers, Inc. | year= 2005 | chapter = Los Brazos Familia Ejemplar / the Brazos a model Family | pages = 184–190 | isbn=968-6842-48-9}}</ref><ref name="EncyHijoSanto">{{cite news|title=Enciclopedia de las Mascaras|work=Santo, Hijo|location=[[Mexico]]|id=Tomo IV|pages=31–32|date=October 2007|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=DosLeyendas2005>{{cite news|title = El Perro se va triunfante | work =SuperLuchas | pages= 5–8 | author= Ocampo, Jorge | id = issue 101 | date = March 21, 2005|language = Spanish}}</ref>

===CMLL in the 21st century===
[[File:Hiroshi Tanahashi at BCW East Meets West.jpg|left|thumb|Through their relationship with NJPW, wrestlers such as [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] have toured Mexico]]

From 2007 to 2009, CMLL had a working relationship with American promotion [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], which saw CMLL's [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]], [[Rey Bucanero]], [[Último Guerrero]] and [[Volador, Jr.]] winning the [[TNA 2008 World X Cup Tournament|2008 TNA World X Cup]] and TNA worker [[Alex Shelley]] winning the [[CMLL International Gran Prix#International Gran Prix 2008|2008 CMLL International Grand Prix]]. In 2008, CMLL established a working relationship with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] as part of "G-1 World", several wrestlers have since toured between the two companies winning titles, including [[Místico]] winning the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] and [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] winning the [[CMLL Universal Championship]]. Since 2011, the two promotions have annually co-promoted events in Japan, under the name ''[[Fantastica Mania]]''. In 2011, CMLL established a working relationship with Japanese women's promotion Universal Woman's Pro Wrestling Reina and announced that the two promotions would create a new championship for women who have been in the business for less than ten years, called the [[CMLL-Reina International Junior Championship]]. This was later followed by the [[CMLL-Reina International Championship]].

On March 16, 2010, a video was posted on [[YouTube]] featuring an interview David Marquez had with NWA Executive Director and Legal Counsel [[Robert Trobich]]. Trobich announced that CMLL did not have permission to use the NWA trademark. The rights to usage of the NWA trademark in Mexico is now held by NWA Mexico, represented by [[Blue Demon, Jr.]] CMLL replaced the three championships with the [[NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship]], [[NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship]] and the [[NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship]].<ref name="FirstHistoricMiddleWelter">{{cite web | url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1282333662 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100823021731/http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1282333662 | title=Viva la Raza!

On September 19, 2014, CMLL became only the second promotion in the Americas, after [[WWE]], to draw a $1 million gate with their [[CMLL 81st Anniversary Show|81st Anniversary Show]], headlined by a [[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Mask vs. Mask match]] between [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] and Último Guerrero.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = September 29, 2014 | title = Sep 22 2014 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: Roman Reigns injury update, Night of Champions, Atlantis vs. Guerrero, huge issue | journal = [[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | page=7 | url=http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/110-wrestling-observer-newsletter/39105-sep-22-2014-wrestling-observer-newsletter-roman-reigns-injury-update-night-of-champions-atlantis-vs-guerrero-huge-issue | quote=More than 17,000 fans, a standing room only crowd, paid in excess of $1 million, for CMLL's 81st anniversary show at Arena Mexico in Mexico City. In doing so, CMLL has become only the second promotion ever to run in the North, South or Central America (WWE obviously being the other) to ever draw a $1 million gate.}}</ref>

On November 6, 2014, CMLL made an alliance with independent circuit a company called Lucha Libre Elite they have brought independent wrestlers. TV Azteca announced that from April transmit combats the Lucha Libre Elite through channel Azteca 7. According to information Publimetro, "Lucha Azteca" will be open from Friday at 18:00.

==Style and television==
[[File:LA Park at LuchaTO Jan 2016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[L.A. Park]], who has been fired from CMLL twice]]
Most CMLL events are held in the famous [[Arena Mexico]] in Mexico City, with the biggest weekly show being the Friday night [[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]] ("Super Friday") show, but they also have regular shows on Tuesday and Saturday night. Of all the major promotions in the world, CMLL is one of the most conservative, having earned the nickname "The serious and the stable" (''La Seria y Estable'') over time.<ref name=EndofSerious>{{cite web | url=http://www.deportivoros.com/2010/10/entre-el-cielo-y-el-infierno-el-adios.html | title='Entre el cielo y el infierno', el adiós definitivo de la 'Seria y Estable' | date= October 2010 | accessdate=July 1, 2015 | first=Gerado | last=Cuéllar | publisher=Deportivoros | language=Spanish}}</ref> Matches with blood are not broadcast unless it accidentally happens during a live event. CMLL rarely uses specialty or "gimmick matches" outside of a limited number of [[steel cage match]]es and the occasional ''Super Libre'', no-disqualification matches.  While other promotions have adopted matches such as the [[ladder match]], CMLL remains much more traditional. They also have strict rules for what they will allow to happen during their shows, on one occasion a match between [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]] and [[L.A. Park]] during the [[CMLL 75th Anniversary Show]] degenerated into a brawl on the floor that was so out of control that both wrestler were fired by CMLL a short time later.<ref name=Lucha2007>{{cite news|title=2007 Lo Mejor de la Lucha Mexicana|work=SuperLuchas|id=issue 244|date=December 26, 2007|url=http://superluchas.com/2007/12/26/superluchas-224-lo-mejor-del-2007/|accessdate=July 11, 2009|language=Spanish}}</ref> CMLL also has strict rules on what wrestlers can and cannot say during their shows, a rule illustrated in 2015 where L.A. Park was fired from the promotion only three weeks after returning due to a profanity laden rant during a CMLL show.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/09/08/l-a-park-fuera-del-cmll-por-insultar-al-publico | title=L.

CMLL's main programming, hosted by Alfonso Morales, Leobardo Magadan and Miguel Linares, is broadcast regularly on [[Televisa]] in Mexico, on [[LATV]] in the [[United States]], and formerly on [[Telelatino]] in [[Canada]] and [[The Wrestling Channel]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. CMLL also had a syndicated show called "Sin Limite de Tiempo" ("with no time limit") which shows matches from [[Arena Coliseo]] shows and matches they could not fit onto the regular broadcast. It aired in [[Los Angeles]] on [[KWHY]] and Also Air in [[San Francisco]] on [[KEMO-TV]]. This show was followed up by "Guerreros del Ring" on Canal 52MX. Also, Spanish-language American sports channel [[Fox Sports en Español]] recently started broadcasting CMLL programming. Recently CMLL also added the Mexican network Cadena Tres to its list of networks airing CMLL Wrestling. [[Galavisión (Mexico)|Galavision]] began airing CMLL wrestling in the spring of 2011. Galavision shows only a one-hour version while LATV has shown a two-hour version. In 2015 several of CMLL's shows became available live on their YouTube channel and they have held a number of internet-[[Pay Per View]]s (PPVs)

==Major shows==
Each year CMLL promotes a number of signature events, some shown as pay-per-view events and others shown on regular television. Over the last couple of years CMLL have held three regular events each year and a number of one off, special events. The Major show, shown in order of when they happen during the year, include:
