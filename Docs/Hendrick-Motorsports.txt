'''Hendrick Motorsports''' ('''HMS'''), originally named '''All Star Racing''', is a current [[United States|American]] [[auto racing]] team created in 1984 by [[Rick Hendrick]]. The team currently competes in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]]. One of stock car racing's premier organizations, Hendrick Motorsports has garnered eleven [[Sprint Cup Series]] owners and drivers championships, three [[Camping World Truck Series]] owners and drivers titles, and one [[Xfinity Series]] drivers crown, 240 Sprint Cup Series victories, 26 Xfinity Series wins, and 26 Camping World Truck Series victories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/hms_stats.asp |title=Official site of Hendrick Motorsports NASCAR Racing & Team Store |publisher=Hendrickmotorsports.com |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> As of the [[2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2015 season]], the team has won a Sprint Cup race on every track on the current circuit&nbsp;– except for [[Kentucky Speedway]], which has only been on the circuit since 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2012/11/18/Gordon-wins-at-Homestead-a-Hendrick-Motorsports-first|title=Gordon wins at Homestead&nbsp;– a Hendrick Motorsports' first|work=Hendrick Motorsports|date=November 18, 2012|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref>

The team currently fields four full-time Sprint Cup Series teams, including the No. 5 [[Farmers Insurance Group]]/[[Great Clips]]/[[LiftMaster]]/[[Quicken Loans]]/[[Toughbook|Panasonic Toughbook]]/[[Pepsi]] [[Chevrolet SS]] for [[Kasey Kahne]], the No. 24 [[National Automotive Parts Association|NAPA]]/[[3M]]/[[Kelley Blue Book]]/[[Time Warner Cable]]/[[Mountain Dew]] Chevrolet SS for [[Chase Elliott]], the No. 48 [[Lowe's]]/[[Kobalt Tools]] Chevrolet SS for [[Jimmie Johnson]], and the No. 88 [[Nationwide Insurance]]/[[The Carlyle Group|AXALTA]]/[[Diet Mountain Dew]]/[[TaxSlayer.com]] Chevrolet SS for [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] The team formerly fielded teams in the now-[[Xfinity Series]] before merging its efforts with [[JR Motorsports]]. The team also fielded several trucks in the [[Camping World Truck Series]], most recently for development driver [[Chase Elliott]] in 2013. The team has fielded cars in the past for many NASCAR drivers, including [[Geoff Bodine]], [[Tim Richmond]], [[Darrell Waltrip]], [[Benny Parsons]], [[Ricky Rudd]], [[Ken Schrader]], [[Terry Labonte]], [[Kyle Busch]], [[Casey Mears]], [[Mark Martin]], [[Brian Vickers]], and [[Jeff Gordon]].

All Hendrick racecars are constructed start-to-finish at the 100-plus acre Hendrick Motorsports complex in [[Concord, North Carolina]]. More than 550 engines are built or re-built on-site each year, with the team leasing some of those to other NASCAR outfits. Hendrick Motorsports employs over 500 people that perform many day-to-day activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/hendrick-motorsports-shops-museum-complex.asp |title=Official site of Hendrick Motorsports NASCAR Racing & Team Store |publisher=Hendrickmotorsports.com |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> In 2009, Hendrick Motorsports made history by having three out of the four full-time drivers finish in the top three places in the point standings (Johnson, Martin, and Gordon).

==History==
What is now Hendrick Motorsports was founded prior to the [[1984 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1984 season]] by [[Rick Hendrick]], a [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-based [[car dealership]] owner who currently operates a network of dealerships called [[Hendrick Auto Group]]. The team was formed along with longtime crew chief and car builder [[Harry Hyde]], [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]] and NASCAR team owner [[Raymond Beadle]], and music entrepreneur [[C.K. Spurlock]] as '''All-Star Racing'''.<ref name="Poole2013">{{cite book|author=David Poole|title=Tim Richmond: The Fast Life and Remarkable Times of NASCAR's Top Gun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpB9yRlaaasC&pg=PT44|date=February 22, 2013|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-61321-090-1}}</ref><ref name=Fox-Hendrick-Humble-2014-Video /><ref name=Fox-Hendrick-Humble-2014 /> The team, called Hendrick Motorsports by 1985, expanded to two full-time cars in 1986, three in 1987, and four in 2002.<ref name=StockCar-MultiCar-Sept2003 /><ref name=SunSentinal-HSM-Concert-Feb1987 /><ref name=Motorsport-JJohnson-HMS-2000/> HMS was one of the first teams in NASCAR to be successful operating multiple entries, based on the model used at the Hendrick dealerships.<ref name=Poole2013 /><ref name=StockCar-MultiCar-Sept2003 /> The team has also been credited for innovations in engine construction<ref name=ESPN-HMS-Dorton-Oct2007>{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=David|title=Dorton's stamp still found all over Hendrick Motorsports' success|url=http://espn.go.com/rpm/columns/story?seriesId=2&columnist=newton_david&id=3070476|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=December 3, 2015|location=[[Concord, North Carolina]]|date=October 20, 2007}}</ref> and [[pit stop|pit crew]] training.<ref name=BCSN-HMSPitCrew-2014>{{cite web|last1=Lenzi|first1=Rachel|title=Athletes at center of pit crew revolution|url=http://www.bcsn.tv/news_article/show/410743|website=[[Buckeye Cable Sports Network|bcsn.tv]]|publisher=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|The Blade]]|accessdate=December 3, 2015|location=[[Brooklyn, Michigan]]|date=August 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=HMS-RainbowWarriors-2010>{{cite web|title=Evolution of a pit stop: Era of the Rainbow Warriors|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/articles/5496/evolution-of-a-pit-stop-era-of-the-rainbow-warriors|publisher='''Hendrick Motorsports'''|accessdate=December 3, 2015|location=[[Concord, North Carolina]]|date=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pit Crew Revolution|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRXykoDq8CM|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[YouTube]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[NASCAR]]|accessdate=November 2, 2014|date=September 5, 2012}}</ref>

==Sprint Cup Series==

===Car No. 5 history===
[[File:GeoffBodine1985Pocono.jpg|thumb|left|[[Geoff Bodine]] in 1985.]]
Hendrick Motorsports debuted in [[1984 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1984]] under the banner "All Star Racing" with five employees, rented equipment, and two cars, with the highest-paid person's wages at only $500/week.<ref name="Poole2013"/><ref name=Fox-Hendrick-Humble-2014-Video>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SOpjbcaVb8 Hendrick Motorsports' Humble Beginnings - 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup]
</ref> Initially, the team had planned to field a car for seven-time Cup champion [[Richard Petty]] with funding from country music business mogul [[C.K. Spurlock]], but the deal failed to materialize. Afterwards, Hendrick attempted to hire [[Tim Richmond]], then [[Dale Earnhardt]], but did not. As a result, the team signed former Rookie of the Year [[Geoff Bodine]] to drive the unsponsored No. 5 [[Chevy Monte Carlo]] for 1984. After a slow start seven races into the season, Hendrick informed Bodine and crew chief [[Harry Hyde]] that he planned to shut down the team due to funding trouble. Instead, Bodine and the team won at [[Martinsville Speedway]], leading to sponsorship from Northwestern Security Life; on March 30, 2014, the 30-year anniversary of the win, Hendrick stated, "We owe Martinsville so much. If we hadn't won that race, then literally the next Monday we were going to shut it down."<ref name="Poole2013"/><ref name=Fox-Hendrick-Humble-2014-Video/><ref name=Fox-Hendrick-Humble-2014>{{cite web|last=Jensen|first=Tom|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/rick-hendrick-talks-martinsville-and-about-the-drivers-who-got-away-033014|title=Rick Hendrick talks Martinsville and about drivers who got away|publisher=[[Foxsports.com]]|date=March 30, 2014|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref> The team won two more times and finished ninth in points. [[Levi Garrett]] came on to sponsor the No. 5 Chevy in 1985 as part of a multi-year deal.<ref name="Poole2013"/> Despite not winning a race that year, Bodine earned three poles and improved to fifth in points.<ref name="Poole2013"/> The team briefly became a two-car operation when [[Dick Brooks]] drove the No. 1 [[Exxon]] Chevy at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway|Charlotte Motor Speedway]], in what proved to be Brooks' last NASCAR race.

[[File:TerryLabonte1997Pocono.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Terry Labonte]]'s No. 5 car as it looked from 1994 until 2000.]]
Hendrick expanded into a multi-car team full-time in [[1986 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1986]], with Bodine and [[Tim Richmond]] as drivers.<ref name=StockCar-MultiCar-Sept2003>{{cite web|last1=Cothren|first1=Larry|title=Advantages of Multi-Car NASCAR Teams - Are One-Car Teams Dead?

His younger brother, [[Brett Bodine|Brett]], raced as a teammate in the [[Coca-Cola 600|World 600]] that year. Bodine went winless again in 1987, finishing thirteenth in points. Bodine won one race each of the next two years before leaving for [[Junior Johnson & Associates]] in 1990.

[[Ricky Rudd]] took Bodine's place,<ref name=Roanoke-RRudd-Owner-Dec1993>{{cite news|last1=Zeller|first1=Bob|title=RICKY RUDD TAKES THE WHEEL AS TEAM OWNER|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/ROA-Times/issues/1993/rt9312/931218/12180123.htm|accessdate=February 2, 2016|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|agency=[[Virginia Tech]] Digital Library and Archives|date=December 18, 1993 |location=[[Mooresville, North Carolina]]|page=C1}}</ref> winning once at [[Watkins Glen International]],<ref>{{cite news|author1=[[Associated Press]]|title=MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP : Rudd Struggles, but Wins at Watkins Glen|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-13/sports/sp-509_1_watkins-glen|accessdate=February 2, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 13, 1990}}</ref> and finishing seventh in points. For 1991, the team received sponsorship from [[Tide]] as part of the car's merger with [[Darrell Waltrip]]'s old team. Winning one race that year, Rudd finished a career high second in points behind champion [[Dale Earnhardt]].<ref name=Roanoke-RRudd-Owner-Dec1993/> On the final lap of that year's race at [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point Raceway]], second-place Rudd spun out leader [[Davey Allison]] on the last turn and went on to win. NASCAR penalized the team for rough driving and awarded Allison the win. Rudd won once each of the next two years.<ref name=Roanoke-RRudd-Owner-Dec1993/> Dissatisfied with the distribution of resources within HMS's multiple teams, Rudd left to form [[Rudd Performance Motorsports|his own team]], taking Tide with him.<ref name=Roanoke-RRudd-Owner-Dec1993/>

Rudd's replacement was 1984 Winston Cup champion [[Terry Labonte]].<ref name=USA2Day-TLabonte-Texas-2006 /><ref name=Motorsport-TLabonte-Master-2014 /> The car received sponsorship from [[Kellogg's]] and their [[Corn flakes]] brand.<ref name=Motorsport-TLabonte-Master-2014 /> Labonte won three races each in 1994 and 1995, and defeated teammate Jeff Gordon for the [[1996 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1996]] [[Winston Cup]] championship by 37 points.<ref name=USA2Day-TLabonte-Texas-2006 /><ref name=Motorsport-TLabonte-Master-2014 /> Labonte won one race each of the next three seasons. The [[2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2000 season]] was a very difficult year for the team as two long streaks that defined Labonte's career came to an end. In the [[Pepsi 400]], Labonte crashed his car and broke his leg. After an accident at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]] damaged his inner ear, Labonte was not capable of driving, and he ended up missing two races, bringing his streak of most consecutive races to an abrupt end.<ref name=USA2Day-TLabonte-Texas-2006 /> [[Todd Bodine]] and [[Ron Hornaday, Jr.]] subbed for Labonte. His six-year winning streak was also broken as he failed to visit victory lane that year.<ref name=Motorsport-TLabonte-Master-2014 />

At the end of the 2000 season Labonte's team switched to Kellogg's [[Frosted Flakes]] brand for its primary sponsorship. After a couple of low-key years, Labonte finished tenth in the points in 2003. He also revisited victory lane after a four-year drought by winning the [[Mountain Dew Southern 500|Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], the last Southern 500 to be held during the [[Labor Day]] weekend until 2015.<ref name=USA2Day-TLabonte-Texas-2006 /><ref name=Motorsport-TLabonte-Master-2014>{{cite web|last1=Pegler|first1=Philip|title=Masters of the game: Terry Labonte|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/masters-of-the-game-terry-labonte-453493/?s=1&q=%22earnhardt+childress+racing%22|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=December 4, 2015|date=June 29, 2014}}</ref> After slipping to twenty-sixth in points in 2004, Labonte announced his semi-retirement. He would drive a limited schedule for two years in the No. 44 car before leaving HMS after the [[2006 in NASCAR|2006 season]]. Labonte scored 12 victories with Hendrick Motorsports, to go along with his championship in 1996.<ref name=USA2Day-TLabonte-Texas-2006 /><ref name=Motorsport-TLabonte-Master-2014 />

[[File:Casey Mears 2008 Kelloggs Chevy Impala.jpg|thumb|left|2008 No. 5 Kellogg's / [[Carquest]]-sponsored Chevrolet, driven by [[Casey Mears]].]]
Hendrick tabbed development driver [[Kyle Busch]], the younger brother of [[Kurt Busch]], as Labonte's replacement for the 2005 season. Busch easily won the 2005 [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|rookie of the year]] battle and made history when he took the checkered flag in the [[Sony HD 500]] at [[California Speedway]] for his first win, becoming the youngest driver to ever win a Cup Series race at the age of 20 years, 4 months, and 2 days. Busch would win later that year at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]]. In 2006, Kyle won once and qualified for the Chase for the Nextel Cup, ultimately finishing tenth in points. In 2007, Busch grabbed a win at the [[Food City 500]], the inaugural race for the [[Car of Tomorrow]]. On June 13, 2007 Hendrick announced that Kyle Busch would not return to drive the No. 5 car in 2008. On September 4, 2007 it was announced that [[Casey Mears]] would drive the No. 5 in 2008.

On June 22, 2008, ESPN.com reported that [[Mark Martin]] would leave [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] to replace Casey Mears in the No. 5 car for the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=3456369|title=Sources: Martin to leave DEI, replace Mears in No. 5&nbsp;– Racing&nbsp;— ESPN|publisher=Sports.espn.go.com|date=June 23, 2008|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> On Friday, July 4 at [[Daytona International Raceway]], Hendrick and Martin announced that Martin had agreed to a two-year contract in the No. 5 car.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Rodman|url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/headlines/cup/07/04/mmartin.rhendrick.contract/index.html|title=Martin signs two-year deal with Hendrick for the No. 5&nbsp;– Jul 4, 2008|publisher=Nascar.com|date=July 4, 2008|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref>

Mark Martin scored his first win with Hendrick Motorsports at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]] on April 18, 2009. He became the third oldest winner and fourth driver over the age of 50 to win a Sprint Cup Series race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jayski.com/cupnews.htm#old|title=Jayski's NASCAR Silly Season Site&nbsp;– NASCAR Sprint Cup News Page|publisher=Jayski.com|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> The win was also the 36th victory and 400th top 10 of Martin's career. Martin won four more races in 2009, [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicagoland]], and [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]]. He also won seven pole positions in addition to finishing second in the point standings to teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet/martima01/2009/W|title=Mark Martin 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Results|publisher=Racing-Reference|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref> On September 18, 2009, Hendrick announced that Martin had extended his contract through the 2011 season and would race full-time with [[Go Daddy|GoDaddy.com]] as a primary sponsor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/cup/09/18/mmartin.2010.sponsor/index.html|title=Martin signs through '11 and adding new sponsor&nbsp;– Sep 18, 2009|publisher=Nascar.com|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref>

In 2010, Martin struggled, ending the season 13th in the point standings with no wins and only one pole position, which came in the [[2010 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]]. His season best finish of second came in October at [[Martinsville Speedway|Martinsville]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet/martima01/2010/W|title=Mark Martin 2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Results|publisher=Racing-Reference|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref> [[Lance McGrew]] took over as crew chief for the No. 5 in 2011 as Gustafson moved to Jeff Gordon's team.

[[Kasey Kahne]] and his crew chief [[Kenny Francis]] were picked up from [[Red Bull Racing Team]] to run the No. 5 in 2012. Farmers and Quaker State returned, with Farmers increasing its sponsorship to 22 races. GoDaddy.com left for [[Tommy Baldwin Racing]]/[[Stewart-Haas Racing]] to sponsor [[Danica Patrick]], but [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Great Clips]] signed on as replacements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news_detail.asp?id=2702 |title=Official site of Hendrick Motorsports NASCAR Racing & Team Store |publisher=Hendrickmotorsports.com |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> After a poor start to the season, Kahne rebounded immensely and picked up a win in the [[2012 Coca-Cola 600|Coca-Cola 600]]. He won again at New Hampshire in July and made the 2012 Chase, finishing a career-best 4th in standings. Kahne also won four pole positions throughout the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet/kahneka01/2012/W|title=Kasey Kahne 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Results|publisher=Racing-Reference|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Kasey Kahne during practice at Thunder Valley..JPG|thumb|right|Kahne's [[Great Clips]] Chevrolet at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] in 2015.]]
Kahne won twice in 2013, at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] in March and [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]] in August, and again qualified for the Chase in 2013.

Kahne was eliminated from the Chase following the October Talladega race (as a result of a new Chase format) and finished 15th in the final point standings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet/kahneka01/2014/W|title=Kasey Kahne 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Results|publisher=Racing-Reference|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}</ref>

===Car No. 17 history===
[[File:DarrellWaltrip17car1989.jpg|thumb|300px|right|1989 No. 17 Tide Chevy Lumina.]]
The No. 17 car at Hendrick Motorsports came about when [[Darrell Waltrip]] left [[Junior Johnson]]'s team following the [[1986 in NASCAR|1986 season]] in order to end his relationship with Budweiser. Waltrip chose to join Hendrick Motorsports with [[Tide (brand)|Tide]] as his sponsor and 17 as his car number.<ref name=SunSentinal-HSM-Concert-Feb1987>{{cite web|last1=Winderman|first1=Ira|title=In Concert – A Solo Trio When Bodine, Waltrip And Parsons Team Up, It's Every Man For Himself.|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-02-15/sports/8701100221_1_waltrip-winston-cup-races-benny-parsons|publisher=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|accessdate=November 28, 2015|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]|date=February 15, 1987}}</ref> Waltrip won nine races in his first three seasons with Hendrick, including the [[Daytona 500]] in 1989, a race that had eluded him for many years.

While practicing for his 500th career start in the [[Pepsi 400|1990 Pepsi 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], Waltrip's car spun in oil laid down by another car experiencing engine failure and was hit by [[Dave Marcis]]. Waltrip suffered a broken arm, a broken leg, and a [[concussion]]. He missed the [[Pepsi 400]], but came back to run one lap at [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]], before giving way to [[Jimmy Horton]] as a relief driver. After Pocono, Waltrip sat out the next five races due to his injuries. Despite missing six races, Waltrip finished 20th in driver points and the team finished 5th in owner points with substitute drivers taking turns in the car&nbsp;– [[Greg Sacks]]' second-place finish at Michigan, in August, was the best finish of the team's season. The team scored only one DNF for the season, when [[Sarel van der Merwe]] crashed late in the race at [[Watkins Glen International Speedway|Watkins Glen]]. However, in the 23 races that Waltrip did start, he failed to win for the first time since 1974. At the end of the [[1990 in NASCAR|1990 season]], Waltrip decided he wanted to start [[Darrell Waltrip Motorsports|his own team]], so he left Hendrick Motorsports, taking the No. 17 with him.<ref name=DailyPressVA-HMSTrim-Jan1991/> The Tide sponsorship moved to the flagship No. 5 team with [[Ricky Rudd]] as the driver and remained there until the end of the [[1993 in NASCAR|1993 season]].<ref name=DailyPressVA-HMSTrim-Jan1991/>

===Car No. 24 history===
{{See also|Jeff Gordon}}
[[File:JeffGordon1997Pocono.jpg|thumb|left|The rainbow paint scheme in 1997.]]
From 1992 to 2015, the No. 24 car was driven by [[Jeff Gordon]] with a sponsorship from [[DuPont]] Automotive Finishes (now [[Axalta]] Coating Systems) with [[Pepsi]] also having a long relationship with him. [[AARP]] Drive to End Hunger took over as the primary sponsorship in 2011. Gordon and his crew chief, [[Ray Evernham]], were signed away from [[Bill Davis Racing]] after [[Rick Hendrick]] watched Gordon's first [[Busch Series]] victory at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] in March 1992, driving BDR's No.1 Ford.<ref name=NASCAR-Gordon-Story-2013>{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Kenny|title=GORDON'S STORIED CAREER COULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/05/25/gordons-storied-career-could-have-been-different.html|website=[[NASCAR]].com|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=January 8, 2015|date=May 25, 2013}}</ref> The car number was originally to have been 46, a car fielded by Hendrick for [[Greg Sacks]] for the filming of ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' in 1989 and 1990, but was changed after a licensing conflict with [[Paramount Pictures]]. The number 24 was selected due to when it had little significance in [[NASCAR]] history prior to Gordon.<ref name=MRN-Gordon-46-2015>{{cite web|last1=Long|first1=Dustin|title=How Jeff Gordon's Car Number Nearly Became No. 46|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2015/01/How-Jeff-Gordon-Nearly-Drove-Number-46-Car.aspx|website=[[Motor Racing Network|mrn.com]]|publisher=[[Motor Racing Network]]|accessdate=January 8, 2015|date=January 7, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Jeff Gordon Sonoma CA June 2005 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|Gordon at [[Sonoma Raceway]] in 2005.]]
Gordon debuted in the 1992 [[Labor Day Classic 500|Hooters 500]], with the now iconic [[DuPont]] rainbow paint scheme designed by [[Sam Bass (artist)|Sam Bass]],<ref name=MRN-Gordon-46-2015 /><ref name=HMS-Gordon-Axalta-Rainbow-2015/> qualifying 21st and finishing 31st following a crash. The team went full-time in 1993 with [[Ray Evernham]] serving as crew chief. Gordon won his [[Gatorade Duel|Twin 125 qualifying race]] at Daytona and finished fifth in the [[1993 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]]. He finished 14th in points and took home rookie of the year honors.<ref name=HMS-Gordon-Axalta-Rainbow-2015/> In 1994, Gordon scored his first Winston Cup victory in the [[Coca-Cola 600]] and also won the inaugural [[Brickyard 400]] at Indianapolis. Gordon improved to eighth in the points that year. The following year, Gordon would go on to win the [[1995 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1995 Winston Cup]] championship. He finished second behind teammate [[Terry Labonte]] for the [[1996 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1996]] season.

Gordon won his second championship in [[1997 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1997]], after winning three of [[NASCAR]]'s crown jewel races (the [[1997 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], Coca-Cola 600, and Southern 500).<ref name=HMS-Gordon-Axalta-Rainbow-2015/> He won his third championship and second consecutive title in [[1998 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1998]], and also tied Richard Petty's modern era record for most victories in a season with 13. The [[1999 NASCAR Winston Cup Series| following season]], Gordon again won the [[1999 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], but the team struggled with consistency that year. Crew chief Ray Evernham announced he was leaving the team to help with [[Dodge]]'s return to NASCAR that September. He was replaced by [[Brian Whitesell]], who guided Gordon to wins in the first two races after Evernham's departure. At the end of the season, Gordon signed a "lifetime" contract with HMS that gave him part ownership of the team.<ref name=Motorsport-Gordon-Lifetime-1999>{{cite web|author1=[[NASCAR|NASCAR Online]]|title=Jeff Gordon Signs Lifetime Agreement with Henrick Motorsports|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/jeff-gordon-signs-lifetime-agreement-with-henrick-motorsports/|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=May 8, 2015|location=[[Harrisburg, North Carolina]]|date=October 6, 1999}}</ref>

[[File:Jeff Gordon Dupont Chevy Impala.jpg|thumb|left|2008 No. 24 DuPont-sponsored Impala.]]
In [[2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2000]], Whitesell moved to a new position within the organization and was replaced by [[Robbie Loomis]]. Gordon picked up his 50th career victory at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] but finished ninth in points. For [[2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2001]], the team unveiled a new blue and red-flame scheme also designed by [[Sam Bass (artist)|Sam Bass]], with sponsor [[DuPont]] expanding its marketing beyond automotive finishes.<ref>{{cite web|title=New look, new beginning for No. 24|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/new-look-new-beginning-for-no-24/?v=2&s=1&q=Jeff+Gordon+2001|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=May 8, 2015|location=[[Harrisburg, North Carolina]]|date=December 12, 2000}}</ref> Gordon would bounce back with six wins, six poles, and 24 total top finishes, winning his fourth championship. In 2002, Gordon became car owner for rookie [[Jimmie Johnson]]'s No. 48 [[Lowe's]]-sponsored Chevrolet, and announced his first wife Brooke had filed for divorce. He finished fourth in points in 2003. In 2004, Gordon finished third in the inaugural Chase for the Nextel Cup. After winning three of the first nine races in 2005 including the [[2005 Daytona 500|Daytona 500 for the third time]], his season fell into a downward spiral. Gordon missed the chase for the Nextel Cup and finished 11th in points that year, which was the first time since his rookie season that he finished outside the Top 10 in points. 2006 was Gordon's comeback year. With the help of new crew chief [[Steve Letarte]], Gordon would rebound to make the Chase for the Sprint Cup and finish sixth in points. In 2007, despite winning six races and scoring a modern era record 30 Top 10's, Gordon wound up finishing second in points to teammate Jimmie Johnson.

In 2008, Gordon returned to the Chase, but he failed to win a race for the first time since his rookie year. Despite that statistic, he managed to enter the Chase and finish seventh in the season points standings.

At the end of the 2008 season, Gordon unveiled on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' his new Firestorm paint scheme for 2009 and beyond. Gordon also broke a 47 race winless drought on April 4, 2009 at Texas, his first win at that track.

Beginning in 2011, [[Alan Gustafson]] became the crew chief of the No. 24 team. [[AARP]] became the primary sponsor for 22 races, partnering with Gordon to form the "Drive to End Hunger" initiative. Pepsi continued its associate sponsor deal, with DuPont scaling back to 14 races as primary sponsor.<ref name="HMS Crew Chief Swap" /> The new driver-crew chief combination saw a resurgence for Gordon, as he won at Phoenix, Pocono, and Atlanta and finished 8th in points. The following season, Gordon would be hampered by bad luck during most of the regular season. However, a win at Pocono and a 2nd-place finish at Richmond vaulted Gordon into the 2012 Chase. At the Phoenix race, Gordon would tangle with fellow Chase contender [[Clint Bowyer]], intentionally taking him out late in the race after initial contact early on. Gordon was fined $100,000 by NASCAR for the incident, but came back to take his first win in the season finale at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]], the first time a full works Hendrick team had won at the circuit in Sprint Cup. It was also final race for DuPont as Gordon's sponsor after 20 years of sponsorship, as a restructuring of DuPont meant the Performance Coatings group that originally sponsored Gordon would be spun off. That spinoff company, Axalta Coating Systems, owned by [[The Carlyle Group]], replaced DuPont as the primary sponsor for the same 14 races.<ref>[http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2013/02/04/Rebranded-Axalta-Coating-Systems-remains-committed-to-Hendrick-Motorsports-and-Jeff-Gordon Rebranded Axalta Coating Systems remains committed to Hendrick Motorsports and Jeff Gordon.]</ref>

The next year in 2014, Gordon reached the second to last race of the season at Phoenix in position to be eligible for the title at Homestead, however he was passed in the points standings in the final laps and missed out on eligibility.

===Car No. 25 history===
[[File:Tim Richmond 25 Folgers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tim Richmond]]'s Folgers Chevrolet.]]
Car No. 25 was owned for many years by Rick Hendrick's father, the late Joe "Papa" Hendrick. It debuted in 1986 as HMS's second team, with a [[Folgers]] sponsorship and [[Tim Richmond]] driving. Richmond was teamed with veteran crew chief [[Harry Hyde]], who moved over from the No. 5 team after chemistry issues with [[Geoff Bodine]].<ref name="Poole2013"/><ref name=StockCar-MultiCar-Sept2003 /><ref name=Fox-TRichmond-Earnhardt-2014>{{cite web|last1=Jensen|first1=Tom|title=What might have been: The legend of Tim Richmond vs. Dale Earnhardt|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/pocono-raceway-sprint-cup-series-tim-richmond-vs-dale-earnhardt-081214|publisher=[[Fox Sports]]|accessdate=November 28, 2015|date=August 12, 2014}}</ref> Richmond won seven times that year and finished third in points.<ref name=ESPN-TRichmond-Hinton-2009>{{cite web|last1=Hinton|first1=Ed|title=More than Tim Richmond died in 1989|url=http://espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?columnist=hinton_ed&id=4394325|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 28, 2015|date=August 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Racing the Devil: The Tim Richmond Story|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=4309260|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 28, 2015|date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> He missed the beginning of the 1987 season due to [[HIV/AIDS]], while publicly saying he was suffering from pneumonia.<ref name=ESPN-TRichmond-Hinton-2009/> [[Benny Parsons]] drove the first 11 races of the season, with the car renumbered 35;<ref name=SunSentinal-HSM-Concert-Feb1987 /><ref name=Fox-TRichmond-Earnhardt-2014 /> [[Darrell Waltrip]] was hired to drive Hendrick's third car at this time.<ref name=SunSentinal-HSM-Concert-Feb1987 /> Richmond returned midway through the season and won his first two races, at Pocono and Riverside.<ref name=ESPN-TRichmond-Hinton-2009/> Following a blown engine at Michigan and deteriorating health, he left the ride after only eight starts.<ref name=Fox-TRichmond-Earnhardt-2014 /> He died in August 1989.<ref name=ESPN-TRichmond-Hinton-2009/>

[[File:RickyCraven1997Pocono.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1997 No. 25 Budweiser-sponsored Chevrolet, driven by Ricky Craven.]] In 1988, [[Ken Schrader]] took over the ride, winning the pole at the season opening Daytona 500.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Newswire|title=Schrader Takes Pole; Richmond Suspended|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-07/sports/sp-41260_1_pole-position|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 28, 2015|date=February 7, 1988}}</ref> He won two pole positions, won the [[Talladega DieHard 500]], and finished fifth in points. He won four more poles in 1989 and picked up a victory in the fall race at Charlotte. [[Kodiak tobacco|Kodiak]] replaced Folgers as the sponsor of the No. 25 for the 1990 season. Schrader failed to win a race in 1990, but he won the Daytona 500 pole for the third year in a row. He won two more races in 1991 and finished ninth in points. Schrader did not win again, but he finished a career-best fourth in points in 1994. After that year, [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] replaced Kodiak as the sponsor. Schrader left the team after the [[1996 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1996 season]] and was replaced by [[Ricky Craven]].

Craven helped Hendrick complete a 1–2–3 finish in the [[1997 Daytona 500]] by finishing third behind winner [[Jeff Gordon]] and second-place [[Terry Labonte]]. After suffering a concussion at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]], he missed two races. [[Jack Sprague]] and Todd Bodine filled in for him during the injury. The other highlight for Craven during the 1997 campaign was a [[Winston Open]] win. Craven ultimately finished nineteenth in points. In 1998, to honor NASCAR's fiftieth anniversary, the No. 25 car changed its number to No. 50 for the season. Shortly after the season started Craven, still feeling the effects from his concussion the year before, was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome. [[Randy LaJoie]] and [[Wally Dallenbach, Jr.]] filled in while Craven recovered. Craven returned to driving at his home track, [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]], and won the pole for the event, but after four more races Hendrick replaced Craven with Dallenbach, who had put together the stronger run of the two substitute drivers.

[[File:Jerry Nadeau.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jerry Nadeau]] in 2000.]]
With the team back to racing the No. 25 with Dallenbach behind the wheel, the team raced to an eighteenth-place finish in points 1999. However, Dallenbach left the team to drive for a new team and Budweiser moved over to sponsor [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]]'s No. 8 car in 2000 and the team needed to hire a replacement and find a sponsor. Homebuilder and television personality Michael Holigan came on to sponsor the car for 2000 and Hendrick hired driver [[Jerry Nadeau]].<ref name=Motorsport-Gordon-Lifetime-1999 /> Nadeau had most recently been driving for [[Ginn Racing|MB2 Motorsports]] as a replacement for the retired [[Ernie Irvan]], who due to injuries was forced out of NASCAR midway through 1999. Nadeau had a solid first year with Hendrick, finishing twentieth in points and winning the season-ending race at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]].<ref name=SB-Hendrick200-May2012 /> The team returned for 2001 with [[United Auto Workers|UAW]] and [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]] as co-sponsors, and Nadeau finished a career high seventeenth in points while nearly repeating his Atlanta victory; Nadeau ran out of gas short of the finish and finished fifth. After eleven races in 2002, Nadeau was let go from the team.<ref name=SB-Hendrick200-May2012 /> His replacement was [[Joe Nemechek]], who had been released from [[Haas-Carter Motorsports]] after his team lost its sponsor [[Kmart]] due to bankruptcy and had spent much of the early part of the season substituting for an injured [[Johnny Benson, Jr.|Johnny Benson]] in the No. 10 car at MB2. Nemechek won at Richmond in 2003<ref name=SB-Hendrick200-May2012 /> but was let go before the end of the season so he could join MB2 Motorsports as the replacement for an injured Nadeau.<ref name=SB-Hendrick200-May2012 /><ref name=Motorsport-Vickers-60/25-2003/>

Nemechek's replacement in the No. 25 was [[Brian Vickers]],<ref name=Motorsport-Vickers-60/25-2003/> who was initially supposed to drive the car beginning in 2004 while racing full-time in the [[Busch Series]] in 2003 (where he won the championship). UAW and Delphi did not return as sponsors after 2003, so Hendrick replaced them with [[Ally Financial|GMAC Financial]] (Vickers' primary sponsor in Busch) and sister company [[Ditech]].com. In spite of high expectations, Vickers finished third in Rookie of the Year standings behind [[Kasey Kahne]] and [[Brendan Gaughan]].<ref name=Motorsport-2004-ROTY-CUP>{{cite web|title=2004 Rookie standings|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/2004-rookie-standings-2004-12-02/?v=2&s=1&q=Kasey+Kahne+2004|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=November 28, 2014|date=December 2, 2004}}</ref> 2004 was a sad year for Vickers and the No. 25 team. "Papa" Joe, long-time owner of the No. 25 car, died in July, while Vickers' close friend [[Ricky Hendrick]] (the more recent owner of the 25) perished in a plane crash that also took the lives of nine others in October.<ref name=USA2Day-RickyHendrickRising-2004 /> Vickers improved to seventeenth in points in [[2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2005]].

In 2007, the [[Army National Guard]] joined forces with longtime Hendrick Motorsports partner [[Ally Financial|GMAC]] to sponsor the No. 25 Chevrolet driven by [[Casey Mears]]. Mears piloted the No. 25 to his first career win at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in the [[Coca-Cola 600]].<ref name=SB-Hendrick200-May2012 /> After the season, Mears moved to the No. 5, while the fourth full-time ride was given to the new No. 88 for [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], who replaced [[Kyle Busch]] at Hendrick Motorsports.<ref name=Bleacher-Yates28-HMS25-2009>{{cite web|last1=Tiongson|first1=Rob|title=Too Late for Car No. 28: Another Tragic Tale of Fabled Yates Racing Ride|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/146419-too-late-for-car-no-28-another-tragic-tale-of-fabled-yates-racing-ride|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=February 8, 2015|date=March 28, 2009}}</ref> This left the No. 25 as a part-time team.

Making his Sprint Cup debut at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] in the 2008 [[Dickies 500]], [[JR Motorsports]] driver [[Brad Keselowski]] started 37th and finished 19th in the No. 25 [[GoDaddy]]-sponsored Chevrolet. Keselowski would go on to make limited appearances in the No. 25 in both 2008 and 2009 with the intent of eventually taking over the team's No. 5 car.<ref name=InDepth-Keselowski-2014/> However, after [[Mark Martin]] re-signed to continue driving the No. 5 car in 2010, Keselowski replaced [[David Stremme]] in the No. 12 car for [[Penske Racing]] late in the 2009 season (the ride he had been offered at the beginning of the season), leaving the Hendrick organization.<ref name=InDepth-Keselowski-2014>{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Bensinger]]|title=Brad Keselowski: Betrayed by Rick Hendrick?|url=https://screen.yahoo.com/brad-keselowski-betrayed-rick-hendrick-110000397.html|website=[[Yahoo!

The No. 25 returned in 2011, being driven by [[Mark Martin]] in that year's [[Sprint All-Star Race]] while his usual No. 5 was being occupied by [[Jimmie Johnson]]. The [[Farmers Insurance Group]]-sponsored car sported a retro red paint scheme resembling the [[Budweiser]] and [[Folgers]] schemes run by the team in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=Hendrick-Farmers-MMartin-2011>{{cite web|title=Farmers Insurance partners with Hendrick Motorsports|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2011/04/21/Farmers-Insurance-partners-with-Hendrick-Motorsports|website=Hendrick Motorsports|publisher=Hendrick Motorsports|accessdate=February 8, 2015|location=[[Concord, North Carolina]]|date=April 21, 2011}}</ref>

In late-2014, it was announced that [[2014 NASCAR Nationwide Series|Nationwide Series Champion]] [[Chase Elliott]] would drive several races in a fifth Hendrick car in 2015, according to Hendrick Motorsports general manager Doug Duchardt.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chase Elliott: Sprint Cup Plants in 2015|url=http://news.rotowire.com/Chase-Elliott-googid23029-spcar.htm|work=[[Rotowire]]|date=November 21, 2014|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> The car was officially announced as the No. 25 on January 29, 2015, and Elliott drove the car in five races with [[Xfinity Series]] sponsor [[National Automotive Parts Association|NAPA Auto Parts]], in preparation for taking over the No. 24 car in 2016.<ref name=Fox-CElliott-Cup-2015>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/jeff-gordon-chase-elliott-hendrick-motorsports-2016-012915|title=It's official: Chase Elliott to replace Jeff Gordon in No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevy|work=[[Foxsports.com]]|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}</ref>

===Car No. 48 history===
{{Main|Jimmie Johnson}}
[[File:JimmieJohnsonCalifornia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jimmie Johnson]]'s original Lowe's paint scheme in 2005.]]
[[File:Jimmie Johnson 2008 Lowes Chevy Impala.jpg|thumb|275px|right|2008 No. 48 Lowe's Impala.]]

The current No. 48 car, co-owned by Jeff Gordon and Rick Hendrick, began competing in 2001 when Hendrick signed [[Jimmie Johnson]], a second-year [[Xfinity Series]] driver for [[Herzog-Jackson Motorsports]].<ref name=Motorsport-JJohnson-HMS-2000>{{cite web|title=BUSCH: Jimmie Johnson signs with Hendrick|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/busch-jimmie-johnson-signs-with-hendrick/?v=2&s=1&q=Jeff+Gordon+2001|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=May 8, 2015|location=[[Dover, Delaware]]|date=September 22, 2000}}</ref> Johnson made his debut at the fall [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] race, qualifying fifteenth and finishing thirty-ninth after crashing out. Johnson competed in two other races that year before moving to the Sprint Cup Series circuit full-time in 2002. The No. 48 team was given all of the No. 24 team's old cars, while the No. 24 built all new cars for the 2002 season. Johnson won three races and finished runner-up to [[Ryan Newman]] in the rookie battle. During his first season, Johnson became the first rookie to ever lead the points standings. He finished fifth in final points in 2002. He won three more races in 2003 and finished second in points.

Johnson led much of the [[2004 in NASCAR|2004 season]] point standing but suffered bad luck before the Chase for the Nextel Cup began, falling to second behind Jeff Gordon. After falling as far as ninth in points during the Chase, he rebounded with four wins in five races. Despite this, Johnson would lose the championship by only eight points to [[Kurt Busch]] in what was until 2011 the closest final championship margin in Cup history.

Johnson led the points for much of the [[2005 in NASCAR|2005 season]], but lost the points lead to [[Tony Stewart]] after the [[Allstate 400 at the Brickyard|Brickyard 400]] when he suffered a hard crash. He won four races and ultimately finished fifth in points that year. On February 19, 2006, Johnson won his first [[2006 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] while crew chief [[Chad Knaus]] was serving a four-race suspension for rules infractions.<ref name="2006 Daytona 500">{{cite web|url=http://www.racewayreport.com/drivers/news/jjohnson.html |title=Jimmie Johnson wins Daytona 500 without crew chief Knaus |publisher=Racewayreport.com |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> Johnson would go on to win the [[Nextel All-Star Challenge|All-Star Challenge]], Brickyard 400, and the 2006 Nextel Cup championship.

Johnson also won the 2007 Nextel Cup championship in a season that Hendrick Motorsports won eighteen of thirty-six races. Johnson won a staggering 10 races, including taking four in a row during the Chase for the Cup.

[[File:Jimmie Johnson Hendrick Motorsports Texas April 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's white Lowe's Chevrolet in 2013.]]
[[File:TSM350 - 2015 - Jimmie Johnson 2 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson at [[Sonoma Raceway]] in 2015.]]
In 2008, Johnson tied [[Cale Yarborough]]'s record by winning his third consecutive Sprint Cup Series title. In 2009 Johnson won 7 races, had 16 top fives, and 24 top tens. He went on to win his fourth consecutive championship. He is the only driver in NASCAR history to ever win four cup championships in a row. In 2010 he beat that record by winning a fifth championship in a row. He was in second at the start of the race. This is the first time since 2005, that he had to run a final race with him not in the lead of the points.

2011, statistically, was the worst season for the 48 team. Aside from using a push from [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] to beat [[Clint Bowyer]] at Talladega by just .002 seconds and a victory in the fall Kansas race, Johnson would finish 6th in the Chase, the first time he finished outside the top 5 in his career. 2012 would be better for the team, as they won races at Darlington, Dover, Indianapolis, Martinsville and Texas, but were hampered by a crash at the fall Phoenix race as well as a broken drive shaft at Homestead relegating them to 3rd in points.

2013 was a championship year for Johnson. He started off strong with his 2nd Daytona 500 winner and swept both races there at Daytona. He won the Sprint All Star Race and in November won his 6th Championship.

In 2014, Johnson won 4 races including the Coca-Cola 600. However, his season was a major nightmare. He wrecked in the Sprint Unlimited and the Bud Duels and had back to back 42nd-place finished in Daytona and Loudon. He finished 11th in the standings. It was the first time he finished outside the top 10 in the standings.

===Car No. 88 history===

[[File:Dale Earnhardt, Jr. 2008 Amp Chevy Impala.jpg|thumb|right|300px|2008 No. 88 AMP Impala, driven by [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]]]]
The car debuted in 2002 as the No. 60 [[Haas Automation]]/[[NetZero]] Chevrolet, fielded jointly between Hendrick and [[Gene Haas]] in preparation for Haas to field his own team, [[Haas CNC Racing]]. Hendrick driver [[Jack Sprague]] attempted six races (qualifying for three) with a best finish of 30th at [[Homestead Miami Speedway]].<ref name=StockCar-Sprague-Interview-2002 /><ref name=Motorsport-HaasCNCRacing-2002>{{cite web|author1=[[Haas CNC Racing]]|title=Haas Automation, Jack Sprague announce new team|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/haas-automation-jack-sprague-announce-new-team/?v=2&s=1&q=Jack+Sprague+2003|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=May 3, 2015|location=[[Oxnard, California]]|date=April 19, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Homestead: Jack Sprague race report|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/homestead-jack-sprague-race-report/?v=2&s=1&q=Jack+Sprague+2003|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=May 3, 2015|location=[[Homestead, Florida]]|date=November 17, 2002}}</ref> While Haas and Sprague moved over to the No. 0 Pontiac, the No. 60 returned as a Hendrick [[research and development|R&D]] car in 2003 with test driver [[David Green (NASCAR driver)|David Green]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2003 Monte Carlo test report|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/2003-monte-carlo-test-report/?v=2&s=1&q=David+Green+2003|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=May 13, 2015|date=November 3, 2002}}</ref> and continued sponsorship from Haas and NetZero.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talladega II: Green/Leffler race report|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/talladega-ii-green-leffler-race-report/?v=2&s=1&q=David+Green+2003|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=May 13, 2015|location=[[Huntersville, North Carolina]]|date=September 29, 2003}}</ref> Green attempted the four restrictor plate races (missing the first Daytona and Talladega races) with a best finish of 32nd.

18-year-old [[Kyle Busch]] took over the car the following season, selecting the number 84 (reverse of No. 48) for the [[Carquest]] Chevy. He made his debut at his hometown track [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Busch Grateful for Opportunity in CARQUEST Chevy|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2004/03/03/Busch-Grateful-for-Opportunity-in-CARQUEST-Chevy|website=Hendrickmotorsports.com|publisher=Hendrick Motorsports|accessdate=January 8, 2015|location=[[Las Vegas]]|date=March 3, 2004}}</ref> and made five more starts that year with a best finish of twenty-fourth at California.

In [[2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2005]], [[Terry Labonte]] took over the car after he announced he became semi-retired; the number had been changed to No. 44, used by Labonte during his [[1984 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|first championship season]] in 1984. Kyle Busch, meanwhile, moved to his No. 5 car full-time. Sponsored by [[Kellogg's]], [[Pizza Hut]], and [[GMAC Insurance|GMAC]]/[[Ditech]].com, Labonte drove the car in a limited schedule over the next two years.<ref name=USA2Day-TLabonte-Texas-2006 /> His final race with the team was at his native [[Texas Motor Speedway]] in November 2006, in a special commemorative paint scheme sponsored by longtime-partner Kellogg's.<ref name=USA2Day-TLabonte-Texas-2006>{{cite web|last1=Livingstone|first1=Seth|title=Ironman Terry Labonte signs off this weekend in Texas|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2006-11-01-sw-cover-tlabonte_x.htm|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=January 8, 2015|date=November 5, 2006}}</ref> Though Labonte planned to retire following the race, he would race on a part-time or substitute basis until 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pockrass|first1=Bob|title=NASCAR won't OK tribute paint scheme for Terry Labonte|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2014-10-18/nascar-wont-ok-tribute-paint-scheme-for-terry-labonte|website=[[Sporting News]]|publisher=[[Sporting News]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Talladega, Alabama]]|date=October 18, 2014}}</ref>

On June 13, 2007, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] announced he would join Hendrick Motorsports for the [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2008 season]]. On September 14, 2007 it was announced that he would drive the No. 88 car, after a deal with [[Robert Yates Racing]] that sent the No. 88 car to Hendrick Motorsports. The No. 88 replaced the No. 25, which scaled back to part-time. [[Mountain Dew AMP|AMP Energy]] (owned by longtime Hendrick sponsor [[Pepsico]]) and the [[Army National Guard|National Guard]] (which had sponsored the No. 25) stepped up to sponsor the car. Earnhardt, Jr.'s crew chief and cousin, [[Tony Eury, Jr.]], also made the move to Hendrick Motorsports. However, this partnership only lasted until April 2009 when Tony Eury, Jr. was replaced by [[Lance McGrew]], a technical advisor and part-time crew chief with HMS for the No. 25 car.

At the start of the 2011 season, [[Steve Letarte]] moved over from Jeff Gordon's team and became Earnhardt's crew chief.<ref name="HMS Crew Chief Swap" /> For 2012, [[PepsiCo]] decided to replace the struggling AMP Energy brand with the [[Diet Mountain Dew]] brand. The team won for the first time since 2008 and for the second consecutive year made the Chase, but Earnhardt suffered a concussion during an August [[Hollywood Casino 400]] tire testing on the reconfigured Kansas Speedway, and was not tested for the concussion until the [[Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500]] at Talladega, where he was involved in a second hard crash. After testing, Earnhardt was deemed medically unfit to race. [[Regan Smith]], scheduled to drive for [[Phoenix Racing]], instead drove the No. 88 at Charlotte and Kansas in what turned out to be a tryout that led to Smith joining Earnhardt's Xfinity team for 2013. Earnhardt returned at Martinsville and finished out the season.

[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet Texas April 2013.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The National Guard Chevrolet at Texas in 2013.]]
Earnhardt finished fifth in Sprint Cup points in 2013, after winning two poles (at [[Kentucky Speedway]] and [[Dover International Speedway]]), and posting five-second-place finishes.

The No. 88 returned to prominence in 2014 when Earnhardt won four races&nbsp;– the [[2014 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], both Pocono races, and the fall Martinsville race. Letarte joined [[NASCAR on NBC]] in 2015, and [[JR Motorsports]] crew chief [[Greg Ives]] was hired to replace him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greg Ives named Junior's crew chief in 2015|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/7/30/dale-earnhardt-jr-greg-ives-new-crew-chief-no-88-team-hendrick-motorsports-sprint-cup-series.html|publisher=NASCAR|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> On August 6 of that year, the National Guard decided not to renew their sponsorship with Earnhardt.<ref name=nationalguardendsponsorship>{{cite web|last1=Estrada|first1=Chris|title=National Guard to end sponsorship of Dale Jr., IndyCar's Rahal|url=http://motorsportstalk.nbcsports.com/2014/08/06/national-guard-to-end-sponsorship-of-dale-jr-indycars-rahal/|date= August 6, 2014 |publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}</ref> They would be replaced by [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company|Nationwide Insurance]], outgoing sponsor of the now-[[Xfinity Series]] and longtime sponsor of Earnhardt, for the 2015 season.

Late in 2015, it was announced that Axalta Coating Systems, longtime sponsor of Hendrick's No. 24, would move to sponsor the No. 88 in 2016.<ref name=Motorsport-HMS-Axalta-2016/>

===Other car history===
In [[1987 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1987]], [[Benny Parsons]] drove for Hendrick's second team as a replacement for Tim Richmond. Hendrick kept the No. 25 available for Richmond to run a limited schedule, so Parsons drove the No. 35 car instead with Richmond's crew chief [[Harry Hyde]].<ref name=SunSentinal-HSM-Concert-Feb1987 /><ref name=SB-Hendrick200-May2012>{{cite web|last1=Weiker|first1=Kevin|title=Hendrick 200th Victory Class Photo Would Be a Sight to Behold|url=http://www.sbnation.com/2012/5/10/3011259/hendrick-200th-victory-class-photo-would-be-a-sight-to-behold|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|accessdate=November 28, 2015|date=May 10, 2012}}</ref><ref name=HMS-20Years-Feb2004>{{cite web|title=HMS Notes: Celebrating 20 Years|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/articles/10592/hms-notes-celebrating-20-years|publisher='''Hendrick Motorsports'''|accessdate=November 28, 2015|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]|date=February 12, 2004}}</ref> Parsons opened the year with a second-place finish at the [[1987 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]].<ref name=HMS-20Years-Feb2004 /> Parsons ended up running the entire season, with the team temporarily expanding to four teams when Richmond returned for eight races,<ref name=Fox-TRichmond-Earnhardt-2014 /> and finished sixteenth in points with six top-fives and nine top-tens.<ref name=SB-Hendrick200-May2012/>

In 1993, Hendrick fielded a car numbered 46 for two races. The first race was that year's Daytona 500 as [[Al Unser, Jr.]] qualified for his only career NASCAR race in a Valvoline-sponsored car (Valvoline being his then-primary sponsor in the [[IndyCar Series]]).<ref name=Roanoke-RRudd-Owner-Dec1993/> The second saw [[Buddy Baker]] fail to qualify a [[DuPont]]-sponsored car at Talladega in the spring.<ref name=MRN-Gordon-46-2015 />

In 1995, Hendrick fielded the No. 58 Racing for a Reason Chevrolet. The sponsor is a [[leukemia]] marrow sponsor founded by Rick Hendrick. The car was entered originally a safety car for Jeff Gordon to clinch his first championship. The No. 58 was driven by [[Jeff Purvis]], as Gordon had to finish 41st or better in the 42 car field. Gordon clinched the championship by staying out on green flag pit stops. Purvis came in 26th place. The No. 58 would not return until 2001 as the No. 48 car.

====''Days of Thunder'' cars====
{{main|Days of Thunder}}
[[File:ColeTrickle46DaysofThunderCar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Greg Sacks]]' 46 City Chevrolet car at Phoenix in 1989.]]
In 1989 and 1990, Hendrick Motorsports served as a technical consultant during the filming of ''Days of Thunder'', including providing camera-equipped racecars to capture racing footage. The team prepared a total of 14 racecars for the filming. In-race footage was taken at the [[1989 Autoworks 500]] at [[Phoenix International Raceway]], and the [[1990 Daytona 500]], in addition to stunt footage shot outside of NASCAR events.

==Xfinity Series==
Hendrick Motorsports fielded in-house entries in the [[Busch Series]] (now Xfinity Series) from 1984 to 1990, and again from 2000 to 2007, primarily the No. 5 entry. Following the conclusion of the 2007 racing season, Hendrick and [[JR Motorsports]] (owned by Hendrick driver [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]]) officially combined Xfinity Series operations. The No. 5 Chevrolets began running full-time under the JR Motorsports banner in 2008, and the team receives engines and technical support from Hendrick Motorsports, with several HMS employees moving to JR Motorsports. [[Rick Hendrick]] continues to be listed as car owner of the No. 5 team.

On October 24, 2004, ten people associated with Hendrick Motorsports lost their lives in a plane crash while en route from [[Concord, North Carolina]], to a small airport near the [[Martinsville Speedway]]. The plane crashed in heavy fog into Bull Mountain, seven miles (11&nbsp;km) from the [[Blue Ridge Airport]] in [[Stuart, Virginia]], after a failed attempt to land.<ref>[http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief.asp?ev_id=20041104X01760 NTSB Identification: IAD05MA006] from the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] website</ref>
Ten people aboard the [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft King Air 200]] died. Six were Hendrick family members and/or Hendrick Motorsports employees:
John Hendrick, the owner's brother and president of Hendrick Motorsports;
Jeff Turner, general manager of Hendrick Motorsports;
[[Ricky Hendrick]], a Hendrick Motorsports driver and its owner's son;
Kimberly and Jennifer Hendrick, John Hendrick's twin daughters; and
[[Randy Dorton]], chief engine builder.
Also dead were the plane's pilots, Richard Tracy and Elizabeth Morrison, Joe Jackson, director of the [[DuPont]] Motorsports program,<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/official/10/25/jjackson_dupont/ DuPont statement: Joe Jackson], an October 25, 2004 Dupont press release via NASCAR.com</ref> and Scott Lathram, who worked for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]] as a helicopter pilot.<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/cup/10/29/tstewart_lathram/index.html Stewart on Lathram: 'I got really close to him'], an October 29, 2004 article from NASCAR.com</ref>

NASCAR officials learned of the crash during that day's [[2004 Subway 500|Subway 500]] race in [[Martinsville, Virginia]]; they withheld the information from drivers until the end of the race, which was won by Hendrick driver [[Jimmie Johnson]]. For the rest of the [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2004 season]], all Hendrick Motorsports cars and the No. 0 [[Haas CNC Racing]] car featured pictures of the crash victims on the hood, accompanied by the phrase "Always in our hearts".
