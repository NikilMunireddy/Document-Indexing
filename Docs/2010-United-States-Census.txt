The '''2010 United States Census''', known as "'''Census 2010'''", is the twenty-third and most recent United States [[United States Census|national census]].

==Introduction==
As required by the [[United States Constitution]], the U.S. census has been conducted every 10 years since 1790. The [[2000 U.S. Census]] was the previous census completed. Participation in the U.S. Census is required by law in [[Title 13 of the United States Code]].<ref>[http://ask.census.gov/cgi-bin/askcensus.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=7634&p_created=1221755235&p_sid=F4uEQg5k&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_srch=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX3NvcnRfYnk9JnBfZ3JpZHNvcnQ9JnBfcm93X2NudD0xMjU3LDEyNTcmcF9wcm9kcz0mcF9jYXRzPSZwX3B2PSZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfcGFnZT0x&p_li=&p_topview=1 Must I answer the census?] from the [[United States Census]] website</ref>

On January 25, 2010, Census Bureau Director [[Robert Groves (academic)|Robert Groves]] personally inaugurated the 2010 Census enumeration by counting World War II veteran Clifton Jackson, a resident of [[Noorvik, Alaska]].<ref name="noorvik-kickoff">{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010889077_apusalaskacensuslaunch.html|title=Remote Alaska village is first eyed in census|first=Rachel|last=D'oro |agency=Associated Press|location=Noorvik, Alaska| accessdate=March 29, 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |date=January 2010|work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> Census forms were delivered by the U.S. Post Office beginning March 15, 2010. The number of forms mailed out or hand-delivered by the Census Bureau was approximately 134 million.<ref name=economist_april>Census Day: Stand up and be counted. The Economist. April 3–9, 2010. p. 40</ref> Although the questionnaire used April 1, 2010 as the reference date as to where a person was living, an insert dated March 15, 2010 included the following printed in bold type: "Please complete and mail back the enclosed census form today."

The 2010 Census national mail participation rate was 74%.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://2010.census.gov/2010census/take10map/|title=Take 10 Map 2010 Census Participation Census Bureau|accessdate=August 10, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100820144620/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/take10map/| archivedate= August 20, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> From April through July 2010, census takers visited households that did not return a form, an operation called "non-response follow-up" (NRFU).

In December 2010, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] delivered population information to the [[President of the United States|president]] for [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]], and in March 2011, complete [[redistricting]] data was delivered to states.<ref name="timeline"/>

Personally identifiable information will be available in 2082.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The "72-Year Rule" - History - U.S. Census Bureau|url = https://www.census.gov/history/www/genealogy/decennial_census_records/the_72_year_rule_1.html|website = www.census.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-26|first = US Census Bureau, Census History Staff,|last = PIO}}</ref>

==Major changes==
The Census Bureau did not use a long form for the 2010 Census.<ref name="c2010-aboutform">{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/partners/pdf/2010_TQA_Agent_FAQs_english.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=2010 Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|date=May 10, 2010|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}</ref> In several previous censuses, one in six households received this long form, which asked for detailed social and economic information. The 2010 Census used only a short form asking ten basic questions:<ref name="c2010-aboutform"/>
# How many people were living or staying in this house, apartment, or mobile home on April 1, 2010?
# Were there any additional people staying here on April 1, 2010 that you did not include in Question 1? Mark all that apply: (checkboxes for: children; relatives; non-relatives; people staying temporarily; none)
# Is this house, apartment, or mobile home – [Checkboxes for owned with a mortgage, owned free and clear, rented, occupied without rent.]
# What is your telephone number?
# What is Person 1's name? (last, first)
# What is Person 1's sex? (male, female)
# What is Person 1's age and Person 1's date of birth?
# Is Person 1 of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin? (checkboxes for: "No", and several for "Yes" which specify groups of countries)
# What is Person 1's race? (checkboxes for 14 including "other". One possibility was "Black, African Am., or Negro".)
# Does Person 1 sometimes live or stay somewhere else? (checkboxes for "No", and several locations for "Yes")
The form included space to repeat some or all of these questions for up to twelve residents total.

In contrast to the 2000 census, an Internet response option was not offered, nor was the form available for download.<ref name="c2010-aboutform"/><ref name="itif-unplugged"/>

Detailed socioeconomic information collected during past censuses will continue to be collected through the [[American Community Survey]].<ref name="itif-unplugged">{{cite web|url=http://www.itif.org/files/eCensusUnplugged.pdf|title=e-Census Unplugged: Why Americans Should Be Able to Complete the Census Online|first=Daniel|last=Castro |publisher=Information Technology & Innovation Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=March 29, 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |date=February 2008}}</ref> The survey provides data about communities in the United States on a 1-year or 3-year cycle, depending on the size of the community, rather than once every 10 years. A small percentage of the population on a rotating basis will receive the survey each year, and no household will receive it more than once every five years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 4: Sample Design and Selection|url=http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/survey_methodology/Chapter_4_RevisedDec2010.pdf|work=ACS Design and Methodology|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=June 17, 2011|date=December 2010}}</ref>

In June 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that it would count [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex married couples]]. However, the final form did not contain a separate "same-sex married couple" option. When noting the relationship between household members, same-sex couples who are married could mark their spouses as being "Husband or wife", the same response given by opposite-sex married couples. An "unmarried partner" option was available for couples (whether same-sex or opposite-sex) who were not married.<ref>[http://2010.census.gov/partners/pdf/factSheet_General_LGBT.pdf LGBT Fact Sheet]</ref>

==Cost==
The 2010 census cost $13 billion, approximately $42 per capita; by comparison, the 2010 census per-capita cost for China was about US$1 and for India was US$0.40.<ref name="econ201106">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18772674?story_id=18772674&CFID=165420949&CFTOKEN=32425086|title=Censuses: Costing the count|date=June 2, 2011|work=The Economist| accessdate=June 17, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110610033208/http://www.economist.com/node/18772674?story_id=18772674| archivedate= June 10, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Operational costs were $5.4 billion, significantly under the $7 billion budget.<ref name="cnn20100810"/> In December 2010 the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) noted that the cost of conducting the census has approximately doubled each decade since 1970.<ref name="econ201106"/> In a detailed 2004 report to [[United States Congress|Congress]], the GAO called on the Census Bureau to address cost and design issues, and at that time, had estimated the 2010 Census cost to be $11 billion.<ref name="gao">{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-04-37|title=2010 Census: Cost and Design Issues Need to Be Addressed Soon (GAO-04-37)|date=January 15, 2004|format=PDF|publisher=U.S. General Accounting Office|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=54778614|accessdate=December 27, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100107165327/http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-04-37| archivedate= January 7, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In August 2010, Commerce Secretary [[Gary Locke]] announced that the census [[operating expense|operational cost]]s came in significantly under budget; of an almost $7 billion operational budget:<ref name="cnn20100810">{{cite news|title=Census Bureau comes in under budget for 2010 operational costs|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/08/10/census.under.budget/|publisher=CNN|date=August 10, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref>
*$650 million was saved in the budget for the door-to-door questioning (NRFU) phase because 72% of households returned mailed questionnaires;
*$150 million was saved because of lower-than-planned costs in areas including Alaska and tribal lands; and
*the $800 million emergency fund was not needed.
Locke credited the management practices of Census Bureau director [[Robert Groves]], citing in particular the decision to buy additional advertising in locations where responses lagged, which improved the overall response rate. The agency also has begun to rely more on questioning neighbors or other reliable third parties when a person could not be immediately reached at home, which reduced the cost of follow-up visits. Census data for about 22% of U.S. households that did not reply by mail were based on such outside interviews, Groves said.<ref name="cnn20100810"/>

==Technology==
In 2005, [[Lockheed Martin]] won a six-year, $500 million contract to capture and standardize data for the census. The contract included systems, facilities, and staffing.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Lockheed Gets Census Job|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/02/AR2005100201032.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2005-10-03|access-date = 2015-09-28|issn = 0190-8286|first = Mary|last = Mosquera}}</ref> The final value of that contract was in excess of one billion dollars <ref>{{Cite report|title = 2010 CENSUS PLANNING MEMORANDA SERIES No 195  =https://www.census.gov/2010census /pdf/2010_Census_DRIS_Paper_Questionnaire_Data_Capture_Assessment.pdf |date = 2012-05-22|access-date = 2016-02-10}}</ref> Information technology was about a quarter of the projected $11.3 billion cost of the decennial census.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fcw.com/articles/2005/06/13/preparing-for-a-decennial-task.aspx|title=Preparing for a decennial task|first=Aliya|last=Sternstein|date=June 13, 2005|work=[[Federal Computer Week]]|publisher=1105 Media|location=Falls Church, Virginia|accessdate=December 27, 2009}}</ref> The use of high-speed document scanning technology, such as ImageTrac scanners developed by [[IBML]], helped Lockheed Martin complete the project on schedule and under budget.<ref>[http://www.healthitoutcomes.com/doc/ibml-scanning-platform-helps-lockheed-martin-0001 "IBML Scanning Platform Helps Lockheed Martin Team Complete 2010 Census Project On Schedule, Under Budget"].

This was the first census to use [[Hand Held Computer|hand-held computing devices]] with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] capability, although they were only used for the address canvassing operation. Enumerators (information gatherers) that had operational problems with the device understandably made negative reports. During the 2009 Senate confirmation hearings for [[Robert Groves]], President Obama's Census Director appointee, there was much mention of contracting problems but very little criticism of the units themselves.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web | url=http://www.fcw.com/Articles/2008/03/28/Have-feds-cheapened-contract-bonuses.aspx | title=Have feds cheapened contract bonuses? | publisher=FCW | date=2008-03-28 | accessdate=2013-08-09 | author=Chan, Wade-Hahn}}</ref> In rural areas there was a problem with transmission of data to and from the HHC. Since the units were updated nightly with important changes and reprogramming, operator implementation of proper procedure was imperative. Dramatic dysfunction and delays were caused if the units were not put into [[sleep mode]] overnight. The Census Bureau chose to conduct the primary operation, Non-Response Follow Up (NRFU), without using the handheld computing devices.<ref>[http://www.harris.com/view_pressrelease.asp?act=lookup&pr_id=1818 Harris Corporation Selected for $600 Million U.S. Census Bureau Field Data Collection Automation Program]</ref><ref>[https://ask.census.gov/cgi-bin/askcensus.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=8517&p_sid=eTlggqZj&p_created=1250512381&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX3NvcnRfYnk9JnBfZ3JpZHNvcnQ9JnBfcm93X2NudD0mcF9wcm9kcz0mcF9jYXRzPSZwX3B2PSZwX2N2PSZwX3BhZ2U9MQ!!&p_search_text=Hand%20held%20computers U.S. Census Bureau – Use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS)]</ref>

==Marketing and undercounts==
Due to allegations surrounding previous censuses that poor people and non-whites are routinely undercounted, for the 2010 census, the Census Bureau tried to avoid that bias by enlisting tens of thousands of intermediaries, such as churches, charities and firms, to explain to people the importance of being counted.<ref name=economist_april/>

In April 2009, the Census Bureau announced that it intended to work with [[community organization]]s in an effort to count all [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] in the United States for the census.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ballasy|first=Nicholas|title=Census Bureau: We'll Work with 'Community Organizations' to Count All Illegal Aliens in 2010|publisher=[[Cybercast News Service]]|date=April 2, 2009|url= http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/46021|accessdate =June 17, 2011}}</ref>

The [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN) was given a contract to help publicize the importance of the census count and to encourage individuals to fill out their forms. In September 2009, after [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy|controversial undercover videos]] showing four ACORN staffers giving tax advice to a man and a woman posing as a prostitute, the Bureau canceled ACORN's contract.<ref name=wsjournal>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125271412822705239.html|title=Census Bureau Cuts Its Ties With Acorn|last=Sherman|first=Jake|date=September 12, 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}</ref> Various American celebrities, including [[Demi Lovato]] and [[Eva Longoria]],<ref>[http://www.looktothestars.org/news/4051-demi-lovato-and-eva-longoria-urge-census-participation Demi Lovato And Eva Longoria Urge Census Participation]</ref> were used in [[public service announcement]]s targeting younger people to fill out census forms.

The Census Bureau hired about 635,000 people to find those U.S. residents who had not returned their forms by mail; as of May 28, 2010, 113 census workers had been victims of crime while conducting the census.<ref name="635Khired">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/ledgerdc/article_272632041.shtml|title=US Census Takers Attacked on the Job|work=National Ledger|date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=May 30, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100531064523/http://www.nationalledger.com/ledgerdc/article_272632041.shtml| archivedate= May 31, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>{{Update after|2014|8|16}} As of June 29, there were 436 incidents involving assaults or threats against enumerators, more than double the 181 incidents in [[2000 United States Census|2000]]; one enumerator, attempting to hand-deliver the census forms to a [[Hawaii County]] police officer, was arrested for trespassing – the officer's fellow policemen made the arrest.<ref name="hawaii">{{cite news|title=Census worker taken to court for trespassing|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2012284278_apuscensussquabble.html|agency=Associated Press|date=July 5, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2010|quote=The resident continued to refuse to take the Census, and [census worker Russell] Haas said he waited outside a chain-link fence while the resident called his co-workers at the [[Hawai‘i County Police Department]].

As a result, the Census Bureau undertook an unprecedented advertising campaign targeted at encouraging white political conservatives to fill out their forms, in the hope of avoiding an undercount of this group.

The term "[[Negro]]" was used in the questionnaire as one of the options for [[African Americans]] (Question 9. What is Person (number)'s race? ...

The 2010 census contained ten questions about age, gender, ethnicity, home ownership, and household relationships. Six of the ten questions were to be answered for each individual in the household. Federal law has provisions for fining those who refuse to complete the census form.<ref>[http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/frequently-asked-questions-national-census Frequently Asked Questions on the National Census] from the [[ACLU]] website</ref>

Detroit Mayor [[Dave Bing]] held a press conference on March 22, 2011 to announce that the city would challenge its census results.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://michigan.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/post/bing-plans-challenge-detroit-census-numbers|title=Bing plans to challenge Detroit census numbers|author=Cwiek, Sarah|publisher=MichiganRadio.com|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref> The challenge, being led by the city's planning department, cited an inconsistency as an example showing a downtown census tract which lost only 60 housing units, but 1,400 people, implying that a downtown jail or dormitory was missed in canvassing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://michigan.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/post/detroit-census-challenge|title=Detroit census challenge|author=Davidson, Kate|publisher=MichiganRadio.com|date=May 2, 2011|accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref>

New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] held a conference on March 27, 2011, to announce that the city would also challenge his city's census results, specifically the apparent undercounting in the boroughs of [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn]].<ref>NYC To File Formal Challenge to 2010 Census under Count Question Resolution Process [http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=F93690A8-C29C-7CA2-F22FCD1FB0842DD4]</ref> Bloomberg said that the numbers for Queens and Brooklyn, the two most populous boroughs, are implausible.<ref>[http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=E98B9E79-C29C-7CA2-FE04261B98D69D26 On the 2010 Census Results]</ref> According to the Census, they grew by only 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, while the other boroughs grew by between 3% and 5%. He also stated that the census showed improbably high numbers of vacant housing in vital neighborhoods such as [[Jackson Heights, Queens]].

The [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] announced in August 2011 that it would also challenge its census results. The Mayor's Office claimed that the detailed information provided for 549 census blocks is "nonsensical", listing examples of census data that show housing units located in the middle of a street that do not actually exist. However, officials do not believe the city's total population will drastically change as a result of the challenge.<ref>{{cite news|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|title=District challenges its 2010 Census count|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/district-challenges-its-2010-census-count/2011/08/10/gIQAdmfP7I_story.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>

===''Clemons v. Department of Commerce''===
{{main|Clemons v. Department of Commerce}}
A 2009 lawsuit, ''[[Clemons v. Department of Commerce]]'' (see also [[United States congressional apportionment#Controversy and history]]), sought a court order for Congress to reapportion the House of Representatives with a greater number of members following the census, to rectify under- and over-representation of some states under the so-called 435 rule established by [[Public Law 62-5|the Apportionment Act of 1911]], which limits the number of U.S. Representatives to that number, meaning that some states are slightly underrepresented proportionate to their true population and that others are slightly overrepresented by the same standard.{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} Had this occurred, it would have also affected Electoral College apportionment for the 2012–2020 presidential elections.<ref>http://apportionment.us/Complaint.pdf; http://apportionment.us/case.html</ref> After the court order was not granted, the plaintiffs appealed the case to the [[United States Supreme Court]], and on December 13, 2010, the Supreme Court [[vacated judgment|vacated]] and [[remand (court procedure)|remanded]] with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.<ref>[http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121310zor.pdf Supreme Court orders for December 13, 2010]</ref>

==State rankings==
{{see also|List of U.S. states and territories by population}}
The state with the highest percentage rate of growth was [[Nevada]], while the state with the largest population increase was [[Texas]].<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-21/texas-hispanics-set-to-challenge-status-quo-in-reapportionment.html Texas Adds Four Congressional Seats as State's Hispanic Population Grows]</ref> [[Michigan]], the 8th largest by population, was the only state to lose population (although [[Puerto Rico]], a [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territory]], lost population as well), and the [[District of Columbia]] saw its first gain since the 1950s.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/default.htm USA Today 2010 Census]</ref> Note that the resident populations listed below do not include people living overseas. For Congressional apportionment, the sum of a state's resident population and overseas population is used.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-08.pdf Congressional Apportionment]</ref>
