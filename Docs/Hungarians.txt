{{History of Hungary}}
'''Hungarians''', also known as '''Magyars''' ({{lang-hu|magyarok}}), are a [[nation]] and [[ethnic group]] who speak [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and are primarily associated with [[Hungary]]. There are around 13.1–14.7 million Hungarians, of whom 8.5–9.8 million live in today's Hungary (as of 2011).<ref name="Eurostat">[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=en&pcode=tgs00079&plugin=1 Eurostat]. Retrieved 28 March 2012.</ref> About 2.2 million Hungarians live in areas that were part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] before the 1918–1920 dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]], and are now parts of Hungary's seven neighbouring countries, especially [[Hungarians in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Ukraine]]. [[Hungarian diaspora|Significant groups]] of people with Hungarian ancestry live in various other parts of the world, most of them in the [[Hungarian American|United States]], [[Hungarian Canadians|Canada]], [[Hungarians in Germany|Germany]], the [[Hungarians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Hungarian Brazilian|Brazil]], [[Hungarian Australian|Australia]], [[Colombia]], [[Hungarians in Chile|Chile]], and [[Hungarians in Argentina|Argentina]]. Hungarians can be classified into several subgroups according to local linguistic and cultural characteristics; subgroups with distinct identities include the [[Székely]], the [[Csángó]], the [[Palóc]], and the [[Jassic people|Jassic (Jász)]] people.

== Name ==
{{further|Name of Hungary}}
The [[exonym]] "Hungarian" is thought to be derived from [[Ugrians|Ugor]] or the [[Bulgar language|Bulgar-Turkic]] ''[[Onogurs|On-Ogur]]'' (meaning "ten" Ogurs),<ref name="A History of Hungary"/> which was the name of the tribes who joined the [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] tribal confederacy that ruled the eastern parts of Hungary after the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. Although, written sources called Magyars "Hungarians" prior to the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] (in 837 "Ungri" mentioned by [[Georgius Monachus]], in 862 "Ungri" by ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'', in 881 "Ungari" by the ''[[Annales ex Annalibus Iuvavensibus]]'') when they still lived on the [[Etelköz|steppes of Eastern Europe]] eastward from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The Hungarians probably belonged to the Onogur tribal alliance, and it is possible that they became its ethnic majority.<ref name="A History of Hungary">{{cite book|title=A History of Hungary|editor=Peter F.

Another possible explanation comes from the [[Old Russian]] word ''[[Yugra]]'' (Югра).

The historical Latin term ''[[Name of Hungary|Natio Hungarica]]'' ("Hungarian nation") had a wider meaning, as it once referred to all nobles of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], regardless of their ethnicity.

According to Jewish sources including [[Josippon]], [[Chronicles of Jerahmeel]] and [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]], Hungarians are the 9th son of [[Togarmah]].

==History==

===Pre-4th century AD===
{{Main|Hungarian prehistory}}
During the 4th millennium BC, the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]-speaking peoples who were living in the central and southern regions of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] split up. Some dispersed towards the west and northwest and came into contact with [[Iranian languages|Iranian speakers]] who were spreading northwards.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=András|last=Róna-Tas|title=Hungarians and Europe in the Early Middle Ages|year=1999|page=96}}</ref> From at least 2000&nbsp;BC onwards, the Ugrian speakers became distinguished from the rest of the Uralic community.

===4th century to c. 830===
[[File:UralMountains1.png|right|150px|thumb|The possible [[Hungarian prehistory#The Hungarian Urheimat|homeland of the Hungarians]], situated in the Southern Urals.]]

In the 4th and 5th centuries&nbsp;AD, the Hungarians moved from the West of the Ural Mountains to the area between the southern Ural Mountains and the [[Volga River]] known as Bashkiria ([[Bashkortostan]]) and [[Perm Krai]]. In the early 8th century, some of the Hungarians moved to the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] to an area between the Volga, Don and the [[Seversky Donets]] rivers.<ref name="HungaryEarlyHistory"/> Meanwhile, the descendants of those Hungarians who stayed in [[Bashkortostan|Bashkiria]] remained there as late as 1241.

The Hungarians around the Don River were subordinates of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] [[khagan]]ate. Their neighbours were the archaeological [[Saltov Culture]], i.e. Bulgars (Proto-Bulgarians, [[Onogurs]]) and the [[Alans]], from whom they learned gardening, elements of cattle breeding and of agriculture. Tradition holds that the Hungarians were organized in a confederacy of seven tribes. The names of the seven tribes were: ''Jenő'', ''Kér'', ''Keszi'', ''Kürt-Gyarmat'', ''Megyer'', ''Nyék'', and ''Tarján''.

===c. 830 to c. 895===
Around 830, a rebellion broke out in the Khazar khaganate. As a result, three [[Kabar]] tribes<ref>Peter F. Sugar, Péter Hanák, [[Tibor Frank]], A History of Hungary, Indiana University Press, 1994 page 11. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SKwmGQCT0MAC&pg=PA1&dq=Hungarian+conquest&hl=en&ei=MwqvTOLICM_IswaqusmwDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=three%20kabar&f=false Google Books]</ref> of the Khazars joined the Hungarians and moved to what the Hungarians call the [[Etelköz]], the territory between the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and the [[Dnieper River]]. The Hungarians faced their first attack by the [[Pechenegs]] around 854,<ref name="HungaryEarlyHistory">{{cite book |title=A Country Study: Hungary |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+hu0013)|accessdate=2009-03-06}}{{Dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref> though other sources state that an attack by Pechenegs was the reason for their departure to Etelköz. The new neighbours of the Hungarians were the [[Varangians]] and the eastern [[Slavs]]. From 862 onwards, the Hungarians (already referred to as the ''Ungri'') along with their allies, the Kabars, started a series of looting raids from the Etelköz into the Carpathian Basin, mostly against the [[East Francia|Eastern Frankish Empire]] (Germany) and [[Great Moravia]], but also against the [[Balaton principality]] and [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenagain.info/WebChron/EastEurope/Magyars.html |title=Magyars |publisher=Thenagain.info |accessdate=2013-08-22}}</ref>

===Entering the Carpathian Basin (c. 895)===
{{Main|Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Pannonian basin before Hungary}}
[[File:Magyarok-Bejovetele-ChroniconPictum.jpg|thumb|[[Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin]], from the [[Chronicon Pictum]], 1360.]]

In 895/896, under the leadership of [[Árpád]], some Hungarians crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and entered the [[Carpathian Basin]]. The tribe called Magyar was the leading tribe of the Hungarian alliance that conquered the centre of the basin. At the same time (c. 895), due to their involvement in the 894–896 [[Byzantine–Bulgarian wars|Bulgaro-Byzantine war]], Hungarians in Etelköz were attacked by Bulgaria and then by their old enemies the Pechenegs. The [[Bulgarians]] won the decisive [[battle of Southern Buh]]. It is uncertain whether or not those conflicts were the cause of the Hungarian departure from Etelköz.

From the upper [[Tisza]] region of the Carpathian Basin, the Hungarians intensified their looting raids across continental Europe. In 900, they moved from the upper Tisza river to Transdanubia ([[Pannonia]]),{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} which later became the core of the arising Hungarian state.

=== After 900===
{{main| Hungarian invasions of Europe}}

Medieval Hungary controlled more territory than medieval France, and the population of medieval Hungary was the third largest of any country in [[Europe]]. The Hungarian leader [[Árpád]] is believed to have led the Hungarians into the [[Carpathian Basin]] in 896. In 907, the Hungarians destroyed a [[Bavaria]]n army in the [[Battle of Pressburg]] and laid the territories of present-day Germany, France, and Italy open to Hungarian raids, which were fast and devastating. The Hungarians defeated the Imperial Army of [[Louis the Child]], son of [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] and last legitimate descendant of the German branch of the house of [[Charlemagne]], near [[Augsburg]] in 910. From 917 to 925, Hungarians raided through [[Basle]], [[Alsace]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Saxony]], and [[Provence]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Wyley |url=http://www.geocities.com/egfrothos/magyars/magyars.html |title=The Hungarians of Hungary |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2013-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027151814/http://www.geocities.com/egfrothos/magyars/magyars.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref> Hungarian expansion was checked at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955, ending their raids against [[Western Europe]], but the raids on the [[Balkan Peninsula]] continued until 970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/eceurope/hungary895955.html |title=History of Hungary, 895–970 |publisher=Zum.de |accessdate=2013-08-22}}</ref> Hungarian settlement in the area was approved by the [[Pope]] when their leaders accepted [[Christianity]], and [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I the Saint]] (''Szent István'') was crowned King of Hungary in 1001.

[[File:Magyars 900-1980.png|thumb|left|Population growth of the Hungarians (900–1980)]]

At this time, the Hungarian nation numbered around 400,000 people.<ref name="HungaryEarlyHistory"/> The first accurate measurements of the population of the Kingdom of Hungary including ethnic composition were carried out in 1850–51. There is a debate among Hungarian and non-Hungarian (especially [[Slovaks|Slovak]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]]) historians about the possible changes in the ethnic structure of the region throughout history. Some historians support the theory that the proportion of Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin was at an almost constant 80% during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=Britannica2>Hungary. (2009).

Other historians, particularly Slovaks and Romanians, argue that the drastic change in the ethnic structure hypothesized by Hungarian historians in fact did not occur. They argue that the Hungarians accounted for only about 30–40%{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} of the Kingdom's population since its establishment. In particular, there is a [[Origin of the Romanians|fierce debate]] among Hungarians and Romanian historians about the ethnic composition of [[Transylvania]] through these times.

In the 19th century, the proportion of Hungarians in the Kingdom of Hungary rose gradually, reaching over 50% by 1900 due to higher natural growth and [[Magyarization]]. Between 1787 and 1910 the number of ethnic Hungarians rose from 2.3 million to 10.2 million, accompanied by the resettlement of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] and [[Voivodina]] by mainly [[Roman Catholic]] Hungarian settlers from the northern and western counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1715 (after the Ottoman occupation) the [[Southern Great Plain]] was nearly uninhabited but now has 1.3 million inhabitants, nearly all of them Hungarians.

Spontaneous assimilation was an important factor, especially among the German and Jewish minorities and the citizens of the bigger towns. On the other hand, about 1.5 million people (about two-thirds non-Hungarian) left the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between 1890–1910 to escape from [[poverty]].<ref name="immigrants">[http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Immigration/waves_of_immigration.html ''Peaks/waves of immigration''] {{wayback|url=http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Immigration/waves_of_immigration.html |date=20060925013202 }}</ref>

[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|The [[Treaty of Trianon]]: Kingdom of Hungary lost 72% of its land and 3.3 million people of Hungarian ethnicity.]]

The years 1918 to 1920 were a turning point in the Hungarians' history. By the [[Treaty of Trianon]], the Kingdom had been cut into several parts, leaving only a quarter of its original size. One-third of the Hungarians became minorities in the neighbouring countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kocsis |first=Károly |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin |origyear= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&pg=PA9&dq=one+third+of+Hungarian+people+minorities+in+the+neighbouring+countries+Trianon |accessdate=2008-05-21 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1998 |publisher=Simon Publications LLC |location= |language= |isbn=1-931313-75-X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl= |quote=}}</ref> During the remainder of the 20th century, the Hungarians population of Hungary grew from 7.1 million (1920) to around 10.4 million (1980), despite losses during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the wave of emigration after the attempted [[Hungarian revolution of 1956|revolution in 1956]].

After the [[Post-World War II baby boom|"baby boom" of the 1950s]] (''Ratkó era''), a serious demographic crisis began to develop in Hungary and its neighbours.<ref name=origo/> The Hungarian population reached its maximum in 1980, then began to decline.<ref name=origo>{{cite web | title= Nyolcmillió lehet a magyar népesség 2050-re| url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20050414nyolcmillio.html | work= | publisher=origo | accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref>

For historical reasons (see [[Treaty of Trianon]]), significant Hungarian minority populations can be found in the surrounding countries, most of them in [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Romania]] (in [[Transylvania]]), [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], and [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Serbia]] (in [[Vojvodina]]). Sizable minorities live also in [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Ukraine]] (in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]), [[Hungarians in Croatia|Croatia]] (primarily [[Slavonia]]), and [[Hungarians in Austria|Austria]] (in [[Burgenland]]). Slovenia is also host to a number of ethnic Hungarians, and Hungarian language has an official status in parts of the [[Prekmurje]] region. Today more than two million ethnic Hungarians live in nearby countries.<ref>[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=181 Hungary: Transit Country Between East and West].

There was a [[referendum]] in Hungary in December 2004 on whether to grant Hungarian [[citizenship]] to Hungarians living outside Hungary's borders (i.e. without requiring a permanent residence in Hungary). The referendum failed due to insufficient [[voter turnout]]. On May 26, 2010, Hungary's Parliament passed a bill granting dual citizenship to ethnic Hungarians living outside of Hungary. Some neighboring countries with sizable Hungarian minority expressed concerns over the legislation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hungary Citizenship Bill Irks Neighbor |author=Veronika Gulyas |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2010/05/26/hungary-angers-neighbor-with-citizenship-bill |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 26, 2010}}</ref>

==Later influences==
Besides the various peoples mentioned above, the Magyars assimilated or were influenced by subsequent peoples arriving in the Carpathian Basin. Among these are the [[Cumans]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Jassic people|Jazones]], [[Germans]], [[Vlachs]] ([[Romanians]]) and [[Slavs]], amongst others. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who occupied the central part of Hungary from c. 1526 until c. 1699, inevitably exerted an influence, as did the various nations (Germans, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats, and others) that resettled depopulated territories after their departure. Similar to other European countries, [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]], [[Armenians]], and [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsy) minorities have been living in Hungary since the Middle Ages.

==Ethnic affiliations and genetic origins==
[[File:Origin of Hungarians according to Kinga Ery.png|thumb|right|The place of origin for the regional groups of Hungarians in the conquest period according to Kinga Éry]]
The linguistic heritage of the Hungarians comes from the [[Finno-Ugric peoples]]. A branch of Uralic speakers migrated from their earlier homeland near the Ural mountains and settled in various places in [[Eastern Europe]], until they conquered the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Carpathian Basin]] between the 9th and 10th centuries. Present-day Hungarian populations seem to be genetically European, with some minor affinities to populations east of the [[Ural mountains]] and in Central Asia which are related to their origins, namely Uralic-speakers and Turks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8935316 | work=Human Biology | title=Genetic structure in relation to the history of Hungarian ethnic groups | year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18373723  |title=Y-chromosome analysis of ancient Hungarian and two modern Hungarian-speaking populations from the Carpathian Basin; |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=}}</ref> Compared to the European nations, Andrea Vágó-Zalán's study determined that the Bulgarians were genetically the closest and the Finns were the furthest from the recent Hungarian population.<ref>Andrea Vágó-Zalán, [http://teo.elte.hu/minosites/ertekezes2012/vago-zalan_a.pdf A magyar populáció genetikai elemzése nemi kromoszómális markerek alapján], ELTE TTK Biológia Doktori Iskola, 2012, p. 51</ref>

Thanks to [[Pál Lipták]]'s researches it has been known for almost half a century that only 16.7 percent of 10th century human bones belong to the [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Euro-Mongoloid]] and Mongoloid types.<ref name='Bálint'>{{cite journal |author =Csanád Bálint|date=October 2008|title =A történeti genetika és az eredetkérdés(ek)| journal =[[Magyar Tudomány]]|page = 1170| id = |url = http://www.matud.iif.hu/08okt/02.html| accessdate = 2009-10-06}} ''Cited:'' "Lipták Pálnak köszönhetően közel fél évszázada tudjuk, hogy a 10. sz.-i embercsontoknak csak 16,7 %-a tartozik a mongolid és az europo-mongolid rasszhoz.

Thus, the unambiguously established European characteristics in the genetic and serological composition of the recent Hungarian population and the lack of Asian markers are not solely due to the thousand years of blending but biologically the populations of the conquest period and St Stephen's Hungary were made up almost exclusively of peoples of European origin."</ref><ref>Pál Lipták: A magyarság etnogenezisének paleoantropológiája (The paleoanthropology of Hungarian people's ethnogenesis) (Antropológiai Közl., 1970. 14. sz.)</ref> The European characteristics in the biological composition of the recent Hungarian population and the lack of Asian markers are not solely due to the thousand years of blending.<ref name='Bálint'/> Biologically, the population around 1000 AD in Hungary was made up almost exclusively of Europeans.<ref name='Bálint'/>

According to [[István Raskó]]'s team, "genetic differences exist between the ancient and recent Hungarian-speaking populations, and no genetic continuity is seen".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17632797 |title=Comparison of maternal lineage and biogeographic analyses of ancient and modern Hungarian populations, '&#39;U.S. National Library of Medicine'&#39; |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-08-22}}</ref> This study suggests "a Siberian lineage of the invading Hungarians, which later has largely disappeared". Another study on [[Y-Chromosome]] markers concluded that "modern Hungarian and [[Székelys|Szekler]] populations are genetically closely related", and that they "share similar components described for other Europeans, except for the presence of the [[haplogroup P (Y-DNA)|haplogroup P]]*(xM173) in Szekler samples, which may reflect a [[Central Asian]] connection, and high frequency of [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J]] in both Szeklers and Hungarians".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18373723  |title=Y-chromosome analysis of ancient Hungarian and two modern Hungarian-speaking populations from the Carpathian Basin; |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=}}</ref>

According to Dreisziger, István Raskó's research concludes that present-day Hungarians are the descendants of the subjugated pre-conquest population.<ref name="Dreisziger"/> István Raskó presumed that [[Árpád]]'s Magyars carried the Hungarian language, however the results of his studies may imply that the conquerors were not Hungarians but a small-numbered Turkic-speaking people.<ref name="Dreisziger">Dreisziger, Nándor, [http://ahea.net/e-journal/volume-6-2013/6 "Ármin Vámbéry (1832-1913) as a Historian of Hungarian Settlement in the Carpathian Basin."] AHEA: E-Journal of the American Hungarian Educators Association, Volume 6, 2013</ref>

Horolma Pamjav's group sees a connection between Madjars (a Kazakh tribe) and recent Hungarian population "they were closest to the Hungarian population rather than their geographical neighbors". The drawn conclusion was that "modern Hungarians may trace their ancestry to [[Central Asia]], instead of the Eastern [[Ural (region)|Uralic region]] as previously thought".<ref>A. Z. Bíró, A.
