==History and profile==
''Aftenposten'' was founded by Christian Schibsted on 14 May 1860<ref name="Cook2001">{{cite book|author=Bernard A. Cook|title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hafLHZgZtt4C&pg=PA935|accessdate=25 November 2014|year=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-4058-4|page=935}}</ref> under the name ''Christiania Adresseblad''. The following year it was renamed ''Aftenposten''. Since 1885 the paper has printed two daily editions. A Sunday edition was published until 1919, and was reintroduced in 1990. The Friday morning edition carries the ''A-magasinet'' supplement, featuring articles on science, politics, and the arts. In 1886 ''Aftenposten'' bought a [[rotary press]], being the first Norwegian newspaper in this regard.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Svennik Hoyer|title=The Political Economy of the Norwegian Press|journal=Tidsskrift|url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/spso/spso_0003-PDF/spso_0003_95928.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref>

Historically, ''Aftenposten'' labelled itself as "independent, [[Conservatism|conservative]]",<ref name=Cook2001/> most closely aligning their editorial platform with the Norwegian [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]]. This manifested itself in blunt anti-communism during the inter-war era. During [[World War II]] ''Aftenposten'', due to its large circulation, was put under the directives of the German occupational authorities, and a Nazi editorial management was imposed.

''Aftenposten'' is based in [[Oslo]].<ref name=Cook2001/><ref>{{cite web|title=Annual report 2012|url=http://www.schibsted.com/global/annualreport/annual_report_2012_low%20ok.pdf|work=Schibsted Media Group|accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref> In the late 1980s Egil Sundar served as the [[editor-in-chief]] and attempted to transform the paper into a nationally distributed newspaper.<ref name=sigurda>{{cite journal|author=Sigurd Allern|title=Journalistic and Commercial News Values. News Organizations as Patrons of an Institution and Market Actors|journal=Nordicom Review|date=2002|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/242189101_Journalistic_and_Commercial_News_Values_News_Organizations_as_Patrons_of_an_Institution_and_Market_Actors/links/02e7e52a041ab22c4a000000.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> However, he was forced to resign from his post due to his attempt.<ref name=sigurda/>

==Editions==
In addition to the morning edition, ''Aftenposten'' publishes a separate evening edition called ''Aften'' (previously ''Aftenposten Aften''). This edition was published on weekdays and Saturdays until the Sunday morning edition was reintroduced in 1990. The evening edition is only circulated in the central eastern part of Norway, i.e. Oslo and [[Akershus]] counties. Thus, it focuses on news related to this area, in contrast with the morning edition, which focuses on national and international news. The evening edition was converted to tabloid format in 1997. From April 2006, the Thursday edition of ''Aften'' also includes a special edition with news specific to a part of Oslo or [[Akershus]], called ''Lokal Aften'' ("Local Evening"). There are eight versions of this edition, each subscriber receives the version which is most relevant to the area in which he or she lives. In areas that are not covered by any of the eight versions (for example [[Romerike]] and [[Follo]]), the version for central Oslo is distributed. From May 2009 ''Aften'' is only printed and distributed 3 days a week, Tuesday to Thursday.

''Aftenposten'' started its [[Online journalism|online edition]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Online Journalism Atlas: Norway|url=http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2008/01/25/online-journalism-atlas-norway/|accessdate=13 January 2015|work=Online Journalism|date=25 January 2008}}</ref>

==Controversies==
''Aftenposten'' opposed the [[Nobel peace prize]] to German pacifist [[Carl von Ossietzky]] in 1935.

In 1945, ''Aftenposten'' published an [[Knut Hamsun's obituary of Adolf Hitler|obituary of Adolf Hitler]] in which the 86 year old Nobel laureate novelist [[Knut Hamsun]] referred to Hitler as “a warrior for humankind and a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations”.<ref name="Gibbs2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/books/28hams.html|title=Norwegian Nobel Laureate, Once Shunned, Is Now Celebrated|work=The New York Times|date=27 February 2009|page=C1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208004621/www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/books/28hams.html|archive-date=8 December 2014|dead-url=no|first=Walter|last=Gibbs|issn=0362-4331|quote={{bracket|I}}n Oslo last week .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at the National Library was the 7 May 1945, edition of a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. newspaper whose lead article on Hitler’s death was by Knut&nbsp;Hamsun. As most collaborators lay low, preparing alibis, Hamsun wrote, ‘He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations’.}}</ref> However, ''Aftenposten'' was at the time under the censorship of the German occupying forces.

Historically, ''Aftenposten'' did not receive the same amount of lawsuits and attention from the [[Norwegian Press Complaints Commission]] as some of the larger tabloids.{{cn|date=April 2016}} However, there are exceptions. In 2007 ''Aftenposten'' alleged that [[Julia Svetlichnaja]], the last person to interview the murdered Russian national [[Alexander Litvinenko]], was a Kremlin agent. London correspondent [[Hilde Harbo]] admitted to have let herself be fed disinformation from the Russian emigrant community, without investigating the matter properly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1972241.ece |title=Svetlichnaja and Litvinenko: Clarifications|work=Aftenposten|date=9 December 2006|accessdate=1 February 2009}}</ref>  ''Aftenposten'' eventually had to apologize, and pay Svetlichnaja's legal costs.

==Editorial line==
''Aftenposten'' has a conservative stance and supported the political party [[Høyre]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rolf Werenskjold|title=The Dailies in Revolt|journal=Scandinavian Journal of History|date=2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=417|doi=10.1080/03468750802423094|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03468750802423094|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> until the breakdown of party press system in the country.<ref name=stiga/> Following this the paper redefined itself as an independent [[centre-right]].<ref name=stiga/>

Right-leaning critics have often pointed out that the paper has become mainstream social-democratic after the end of the [[Cold War]], thus in essence politically aligned with a large majority of Norway's press.

==Language==
True to its conservative line, ''Aftenposten'' is published in the unofficial Norwegian written norm [[Riksmål]], which keeps closer ties to the [[Danish language]] than more commonly used norms. In 1990, ''Aftenposten'' adopted the latest Riksmål spelling standard of 1986 as its language guideline. This language standard is maintained by a private organization called [[Riksmålsforbundet]], and not by the Norwegian language council [[Norsk språkråd]]. Since it is largely compatible with the most conservative form of the officially sanctioned, and more common norm [[Bokmål]], this is somewhat less controversial than one would assume. However, ''Aftenposten'' has been under criticism for its strict editorial policy on this matter, mainly because it converts every contribution to the newspaper, including letters from readers, into this language standard - even if they were correctly written according to official language guidelines.

The online version of the paper had a large [[English language|English]] section. To cut costs, ''Aftenposten'' stopped publishing English-language articles in early November 2008. Archives of past material are still available online.<ref>{{cite news|title=So long, farewell ...|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2741143.ece |work=Aftenposten|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=20 November 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081208103416/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2741143.ece|archivedate=8 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>
