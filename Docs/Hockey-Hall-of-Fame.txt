The '''Hockey Hall of Fame''' is located in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Dedicated to the [[history of ice hockey|history]] of [[ice hockey]], it is both a museum and a [[hall of fame]]. It holds exhibits about players, teams, [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) records, memorabilia and [[National Hockey League awards|NHL trophies]], including the [[Stanley Cup]]. Originally founded in [[Kingston, Ontario]], the Hockey Hall of Fame was first established in 1943 under the leadership of [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first class of honoured members was inducted in 1945, before the Hall of Fame had a permanent location. It moved to Toronto in 1958 after the NHL withdrew its support for the [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]] in Kingston, Ontario. Its first permanent building opened at [[Exhibition Place]] in 1961. In 1993, the Hall was relocated to a former [[Bank of Montreal]] building in [[Downtown Toronto]], where it is now located.

An 18-person committee of players, coaches and others meets annually in June to select new honourees, who are inducted as players, [[List of members of the Hockey Hall of Fame#Builders|builders]] or on-ice officials. In 2010, a subcategory was established for female players. The builders' category includes [[Coach (ice hockey)|coach]]es, [[List of National Hockey League General Managers|general manager]]s, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. Honoured members are inducted into the Hall of Fame in an annual ceremony held at the Hall of Fame building in November, which is followed by a special "Hockey Hall of Fame Game" between the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and a visiting team. As of 2015, 268&nbsp;players (including four women), 104&nbsp;builders and 16&nbsp;[[Official (ice hockey)|on-ice officials]] have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame has been criticized for focusing mainly on players from the National Hockey League and largely ignoring players from other North American and international leagues.

==History==
[[File:Hockey Hall of Fame, Toronto.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Hockey Hall of Fame is located at the corner of Front and Yonge Streets in [[Downtown Toronto|downtown]] [[Toronto]]. The same building also houses the [[IIHF Hall of Fame]].]]
The Hockey Hall of Fame was established through the efforts of [[James T. Sutherland]], a former President of the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA). Sutherland sought to establish it in [[Kingston, Ontario]] as he believed that the city was the birthplace of hockey.<ref name="p1">''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 1</ref> In 1943, the NHL and CAHA reached an agreement that a Hall of Fame would be established in Kingston.<ref name="p1"/>  Originally called the "International Hockey Hall of Fame", its mandate was to honour great hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location. The first nine "honoured members" (players [[Hobey Baker]], [[Charlie Gardiner (ice hockey)|Charlie Gardiner]], [[Eddie Gerard]], [[Frank McGee (ice hockey)|Frank McGee]], [[Howie Morenz]], [[Tommy Phillips]], [[Harvey Pulford]], [[Hod Stuart]] and [[Georges Vézina]]) were inducted on April 30, 1945, although the Hall of Fame still did not have a permanent home.<ref name="torstar-45">{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Hockey Hall of Fame Receives Names of First Nine Immortals |date=May 1, 1945 |page=10}}</ref> The first board of governors consisted of [[Red Dutton]], [[Art Ross]], Frank Sargent (president of the CHA), [[Lester Patrick]], Abbie E. H. Coo, Wes McKnight, Basil E. O'Meara, J. P. Fitzgerald and W. A. Hewitt.<ref name="torstar-45"/>

[[File:Hhof olympics2.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The "World of Hockey Zone", which opened in 1998, is dedicated to [[International Ice Hockey Federation|international ice hockey]].]]

Kingston lost its most influential advocate as permanent site of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955.<ref name="p25"/> By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. [[Clarence Campbell]], then President of the NHL, grew tired of waiting for the construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support to situate the Hall in Kingston.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/gi20300.shtml|title=The History of the Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref> In the same year, the NHL and the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE) reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto, in the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] located at [[Exhibition Place]]. The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair.<ref name="p25">''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 25</ref> Due to the success of the exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the [[Exhibition Place]] was needed.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 33</ref> The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 35</ref> The first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame, which shared a building with the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, was opened on August 26, 1961, by Canadian Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]].<ref name = p39/> Over 750,000 people visited the Hall in its inaugural year.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 47</ref> Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Expanded hockey hall will charge admission |publisher=''The Globe and Mail'' |date=1980-06-06 |last=Patton|first=Paul}}</ref>
[[File:Hockey hall of fame former Bank of Montreal in Toronto.jpg|left|thumb|The building now used for the Hall, as a Bank of Montreal branch in the 1890s]]
By 1986, the Hall of Fame was running out of room in its existing facilities and the Board of Directors decided that a new home was needed.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 155</ref> The Hall vacated the Exhibition Place building in 1992, and its half was taken over by the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. The building was eventually demolished — a portion of the building's facade was preserved as an entrance to [[BMO Field]] stadium. Development of the new location, the former [[Bank of Montreal]] at the corner of Yonge and Front Streets in Toronto, began soon after. The building, now part of [[Brookfield Place (Toronto)|Brookfield Place]], was designed by [[Frank Darling (architect)|Frank Darling]] and [[S. George Curry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://canada.archiseek.com/ontario/toronto/hockeyhalloffame.html |title=Hockey Hall of Fame (Former Bank of Montreal) |publisher=Archiseek |accessdate=2007-12-08| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071117102831/http://canada.archiseek.com/ontario/toronto/hockeyhalloffame.html| archivedate = November 17, 2007}}</ref> The new Hockey Hall of Fame officially opened on June 18, 1993.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hall Marks its 10th Anniversary |publisher=''[[Toronto Sun]]'' |date=2003-06-15|last=Breslin|first=Lauren}}</ref> The new location has {{convert|4700|m2|sqft|-2|abbr=on}} of exhibition space, seven times larger than that of the old facility.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Hockey Hall of Fame brilliant mix of the old and new |publisher=The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec) |date=1993-06-08|last=Ormsby|first=Mary}}</ref> The Hockey Hall of Fame now hosts more than 300,000 visitors each year.<ref name="steed">{{cite news |title=Canada's pride designed as a story |publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' |date=2002-06-10|last=Steed|first=Judy}}</ref><ref name="arace">{{cite news |title=Canada's Centerpiece |publisher=''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'' |date=1999-11-28 |last=Arace|first=Michael}}</ref>

==Operations and organization==
The first curator of the new Hall of Fame was [[Bobby Hewitson]]. Following Hewitson's retirement in 1967, [[Lefty Reid]] was appointed to the position. Reid was curator of the Hockey Hall of Fame for the next 25&nbsp;years, retiring in 1992.<ref name="Founders">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/gi20400.shtml|title=Founders & Leaders|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref> Following Reid's retirement, former NHL referee-in-chief [[Scotty Morrison]], who was the president of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1986, was appointed curator.<ref name="Founders"/> Morrison supervised the relocation of the Hall of Fame and its exhibits.<ref name="About"/>  The current curator is Phil Pritchard.

The Hockey Hall of Fame is led by Pat Quinn, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Denommé. The Hockey Hall of Fame is operated as a non-profit business called the "Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum" (HHFM), independent of the National Hockey League. The Hall of Fame was originally sponsored by the NHL and [[Hockey Canada]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/6/8/3/3/index1.shtml|title=History of Hockey Canada|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=[[Hockey Canada]]}}</ref> and revenue is generated mainly through admissions.<ref name="steed"/><ref name="About">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/gi200.shtml|title=About Us|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref>

==Exhibits==
[[File:Hhof be a player1.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The "Be a Player" exhibit]]

The Hall of Fame induction ceremony is annually held in the Great Hall.<ref name="Great Hall"/>

The ''NHL Zone'' is a large area featuring displays relating to the NHL. Current teams and players are highlighted in the ''NHL Today'' area, while the ''NHL Retro'' displays include memorabilia and information about every NHL team past and present. The ''NHL Legends'' area features rotating exhibits focusing on honoured members; and ''NHL Milestones'' displays exhibits of noteworthy records including [[Darryl Sittler]]'s ten-point game and [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s all-time points record.<ref name="NHL Zone">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exNHLZone.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101202175128/http://www.hhof.com/html/exNHLzone.shtml|archivedate=December 2, 2010|title=NHL Zone|accessdate=2015-11-22|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref> The ''Stanley Cup dynasties'' exhibit features displays that include memorabilia from the rosters of nine teams considered to be dynasties because they dominated the NHL for several years at a time.<ref name="Dynasties"/> This area also has a replica of the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' dressing room as it existed at the old [[Montreal Forum]].<ref name="Dynasties">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exCupDyn.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110425223333/http://www.hhof.com/html/exCupDyn.shtml|archivedate=April 25, 2011|title=Stanley Cup dynasties|accessdate=2015-11-22|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref> The ''Panasonic Hometown Hockey'' section is dedicated to grass roots hockey in North America; it includes exhibits about various leagues and sections on women's and disabled hockey leagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exphth00.shtml|title=Panasonic Hometown Hockey|accessdate=2007-12-28|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref> Special exhibits in the past included an exhibit in 2000 showcasing Gretzky memorabilia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Toronto's Hockey Hall of Fame Shoots and Scores |publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' |date=2000-04-23|last=Mandernach|first=Mark}}</ref>

===Selection process===
As of 2009, new members can be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players, builders or on-ice officials. The builders' category includes coaches, [[List of National Hockey League General Managers|general manager]]s, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game.<ref name="Committee">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/indselect.htm|title=Selection Committee By-Laws|accessdate=2012-06-26|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|work=Legends of Hockey}}</ref> The category for on-ice officials was added in 1961<ref name=p39>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 39</ref> and a "veteran player" category was established in 1988. The purpose of the category was to "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players".<ref name="Facts"/> Eleven players were inducted into that category, but in 2000, the Board of Directors eliminated it; the players who had been inducted under this category were merged into the player category.<ref name="Facts"/>

Candidates for membership in the Hockey Hall of Fame are nominated by an 18-person selection committee. The committee consists of Hockey Hall of Fame members, hockey personnel and media personalities associated with the game; the membership is representative of "areas throughout the world where hockey is popular",<ref name="Committee"/> and includes at least one member who is knowledgeable about international hockey and one member who is knowledgeable about amateur hockey. Committee members are appointed by the Board of Directors to a three-year term. The terms of the committee members are staggered so that each year there are six newly appointed or reappointed members.<ref name="Committee"/> As of 2015, the selection committee consists of: chairman [[John Davidson (ice hockey)|John Davidson]], [[Jim Gregory (ice hockey)|James M. Gregory]] (Chairman Emeritus), and committee members [[Scotty Bowman]], [[David Branch]], [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]], [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]], [[Bobby Clarke|Bob Clarke]], [[Eric Duhatschek]], [[Mike Emrick]], Michael Farber, Marc de Foy, [[Mike Gartner]], [[Anders Hedberg]], [[Igor Larionov]], [[Lanny McDonald]], [[David Poile]], [[Luc Robitaille]], [[Peter Šťastný|Peter Stastny]] and [[Bill Torrey]].<ref name="Selection Committee">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlInduct/indselect.shtml#members|title=Selection Committee By-Laws|accessdate=2015-04-05|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|work=Legends of Hockey}}</ref>

Each committee member is allowed to nominate one person in each category per year. Nominations must be submitted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors by April 15 of the nomination year. The committee then meets in June where a series of Secret ballot votes is held; any player with the support of 75% of the members of the committee present is inducted. If the maximum number of players does not receive 75% after the first round of voting, then run-off votes are held. Players with less than 50% are dropped from consideration for that year and voting continues until either the maximum number of inductees is reached or all remaining nominees receive between 50% and 75%. In any given year, a maximum of four players, two builders, and one on-ice official are inducted as members. Player and on-ice officials must have not participated in a professional or international game for a minimum of three years to be eligible for nomination. [[List of members of the Hockey Hall of Fame#Builders|Builders]] may be "active or inactive".<ref name="Bylaws">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlInduct/indelection.shtml|title=Summary of Nomination and Election Procedures|accessdate=2015-06-28|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|work=Legends of Hockey}}</ref>

The waiting period was waived for ten players deemed exceptionally notable; [[Dit Clapper]] (1947), [[Maurice Richard]] (1961), [[Ted Lindsay]] (1966), [[Red Kelly]] (1969), [[Terry Sawchuk]] (1971), [[Jean Béliveau]] (1972), [[Gordie Howe]] (1972), [[Bobby Orr]] (1979), [[Mario Lemieux]] (1997), and [[Wayne Gretzky]] (1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DB113DF933A05757C0A96F958260|title=Committee Approves Waiver for Gretzky |date=1999-04-30|accessdate=2007-12-25|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Following Gretzky's induction, the Board of Directors determined that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under "certain humanitarian circumstances".<ref name="Facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind02facts.htm|title=Induction facts & figures |accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|work=Legends of Hockey}}</ref> Three Hall of Fame members came out of retirement after their induction and resumed a career in the National League: [[Gordie Howe]], [[Guy Lafleur]] and [[Mario Lemieux]].<ref name="Facts"/> [[Chris Pronger]] was inducted while still technically an active player; in his case, he had signed a contract that would have caused severe hardship to his team had he formally retired, so, after suffering career-ending injuries, he instead spent three years on the NHL's [[injured reserve list]] waiting for the contract to expire.

On March 31, 2009, the Hall of Fame announced new by-law additions which will be implemented on January 1, 2010. Starting in 2010, male and female players are considered for induction separately and a maximum of two women can be inducted as players per year.<ref name="Women">{{Cite web|title=Hockey Hall of Fame changes rules for female candidates|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/03/31/hhf-female-rules.html|date=2009-03-31|accessdate=2009-04-03|publisher=CBC Sports}}</ref> The by-law also clarifies that a builder does not need to have been a coach, manager or executive to be inducted. Although they remain separate categories, the builders and on-ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of two can be inducted each year. The Board of Directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits.<ref name="Newbylaw">{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind09press.htm|title=Hockey Hall Of Fame Introduces New Voting Procedures For Honoured Membership|date=2009-03-31|accessdate=2009-04-03|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|work=Legends of Hockey}}</ref>

There is also a category for "Media honourees". The [[Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award]] is awarded by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association to "distinguished members of the newspaper profession whose words have brought honour to journalism and to hockey".<ref name="Ferguson">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/leg_writers.htm|title=Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award winners|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|work=Legends of Hockey}}</ref> The [[Foster Hewitt Memorial Award]] is awarded by the NHL Broadcasters' Association to "members of the radio and television industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession and the game during their career in hockey broadcasting".<ref name="Hewitt">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/leg_broadcasters.htm|title=Foster Hewitt Memorial Award winners|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|work=Legends of Hockey}}</ref> The voting for both awards is conducted by their respective associations.

===Induction ceremony===
The induction ceremony was held at the Hall of Fame from 1959 until 1974. In 1975, it was held at the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] in Toronto and would be held there until 1979. From 1980 to 1992, the ceremony was held at various different locations in Toronto, except for 1986, 1987 and 1991 when the ceremonies were held in [[Vancouver]], [[Detroit]] and [[Ottawa]] respectively. Since 1993, it has been held at the current Hall of Fame building.<ref name="Facts"/> The ceremony was first broadcast by [[The Sports Network]] in 1994.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 194</ref> In 1999 the "Hockey Hall of Fame game" was established, a contest between the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and a visiting team, with a special ceremony honouring that year's inductees held before the game.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 207</ref> Robert Tychkowski of the ''[[Edmonton Sun]]'' reports that many, including [[Edmonton Oilers]] president [[Kevin Lowe]], believe the induction ceremony should be held on a night when there are no NHL games scheduled. This would allow a more representative portion of the hockey world to attend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calsun.canoe.ca/Sports/Hockey/2008/11/10/7360771-sun.html|title=Lowe traveling to T.O. for Andy|author=Tychkowski, Robert|accessdate=2008-11-10|date=2008-11-10|publisher=[[Sun Media]]|work=[[Calgary Sun]]}}</ref>

===Criticism===
The Hall of Fame has been criticised for inducting several lacklustre candidates in the early 2000s decade due to "a shortage of true greatness".<ref name="Ulmer"/> Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive.<ref name="Ulmer"/> The Hall of Fame has also been criticised for failing to induct international players and critics have claimed that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League.

One of the most discussed potential nominees is [[Paul Henderson]], who scored the winning goal in the final moments of the deciding eighth game of the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] between Canada and the Soviet Union. This is one of the best-known moments in hockey and Canadian sports history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hall of one-hit wonders |publisher=''Nanaimo Daily News'' |date=2006-06-29|author=Brown, Scott}}</ref> While there is little question of the historical significance of that goal, Henderson's NHL statistics are not at a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction. His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists.<ref name="Henderson">{{cite web|url=http://www.1972summitseries.com/hendersoninthehall.html|title=Does Paul Henderson Belong In The Hockey Hall of Fame?|accessdate=2007-05-04|publisher=1972summitseries.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Hunt/2005/06/07/1075130.html|title=Chuvalo truly deserving of Walk of Fame honour |date=2005-06-07|author=Hunt, Jim|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=Slam!

===Controversy===

[[Conn Smythe]] served as the Hall's chairman for several years, but resigned in June 1971 when [[Busher Jackson|Harvey "Busher" Jackson]] was posthumously elected into the Hall. Smythe said that it made him sick to think of Jackson alongside such Toronto Maple Leafs players as "Apps, Primeau, Conacher, Clancy and Kennedy. If the standards are going to be lowered I'll get out as chairman of the board."<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |title=Conn Smythe critical of Busher's selection |date=June 10, 1971 |page=3}}</ref> Jackson was notorious for his off-ice lifestyle of drinking and broken marriages.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |date=June 10, 1971 |page=3 |author=Beddoes, Dick |title=By Dick Beddoes}}</ref> Smythe would not condone the induction and even tried to block it because he considered Jackson a poor role model.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 91</ref> [[Frank J. Selke]], head of the selection committee defended the selection on the belief that a man should not be shut out "because of the amount of beer he drank".<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |date=November 20, 1980 |title=Conn Smythe was heart, soul of Leafs |author=Burke, Tim |page=13}}</ref>

On March 30, 1993, it was announced that [[Gil Stein (ice hockey)|Gil Stein]], who at the time had been president of the National Hockey League for nine months but had been bypassed for the new job of commissioner in favor of [[Gary Bettman]], would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors. Due to these allegations, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman hired two independent lawyers, Arnold Burns and [[Yves Fortier (lawyer)|Yves Fortier]], to lead an investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DA1139F937A25754C0A965958260&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=Stein Investigators Need More Time|date=1993-07-14|accessdate=2008-01-10|publisher=''The New York Times''}}</ref> They concluded that Stein had "improperly manipulated the process" and "created the false appearance and illusion" that his nomination was the idea of [[Bruce McNall]].<ref name="Stein"/> They concluded that Stein pressured McNall to nominate him and had refused to withdraw his nomination when asked to do so by Bettman.<ref name="Stein">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DD1E3BF93BA2575BC0A965958260|title=Stein Is Scratched as N.H.L.

In 1989, [[Alan Eagleson]], a longtime executive director of the [[NHL Players Association|National Hockey League Players Association]], was inducted as a builder. He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to [[Mail and wire fraud|mail fraud]] and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] pension funds.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 167</ref> His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine if he should be expelled from the Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/186055|title=Eagleson puts hockey memorabilia on block|date=2007-02-27|last=Hunter|first=Paul|accessdate=2008-01-10|publisher=''Toronto Star''}}</ref> Originally, the Hall of Fame was not going to become involved in the issue, but was forced to act when dozens of inductees, including [[Bobby Orr]], [[Ted Lindsay]] and [[Brad Park]], campaigned for Eagleson's expulsion, even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed. He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DD1E3BF93BA2575BC0A965958260|title=Eagleson Resigns Under Pressure |date=1998-03-26|last=Lapointe|first=Joe|accessdate=2008-01-10|publisher=''New York Times''}}</ref>
