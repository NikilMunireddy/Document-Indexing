The '''2006 [[Commonwealth Games]]''', officially the '''XVIII Commonwealth Games''', were held in [[Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia between 15 and 26 March 2006. It was the largest sporting event to be staged in Melbourne, eclipsing the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in terms of the number of teams competing, [[Sportsperson|athletes]] competing, and events being held.

The site for the opening and closing ceremonies was the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] which was also used during [[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne's 1956 Olympic Games]]. The [[mascot]] for the games was [[Karak (mascot)|Karak]], a [[red-tailed black cockatoo]] (a [[threatened species]]).<ref>[http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Karak+the+Mascot/Karak+the+Mascot.htm M2006 > Karak the Mascot > Display]</ref> For the first time in the history of the Games the Queen's Baton visited every single Commonwealth nation and territory taking part in the Games, a journey of 180,000&nbsp;km (112,500 miles). The relay ended when the Governor of Victoria, and former Commonwealth Games medallist, John Landy delivered the baton to Her Majesty the Queen at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the opening ceremony.

==Organisation==

===Bidding===
During the [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998 Games]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], two cities initially expressed interest in hosting the event; [[Melbourne]] and [[Wellington]], New Zealand. [[Wellington]] withdrew its bid, citing the costs involved with matching the bid plan presented by [[Melbourne]], which became the default host without members of the Federation going to vote.<ref>{{cite news|title=COMMONWEALTH GAMES: Melbourne looks set to host 2006 Commonwealth Games|publisher=The Independent|date=1999-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Sports around the World: History, Culture, and Practice|author=edited by John Nauright & Charles Parrish|page=371|date=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}</ref>

===Cost and development===
{{2006 Commonwealth Games}}
Early concerns arose about the large cost of staging the Games, with projected costs likely to be over 1 billion Australian dollars and a high likelihood the Victorian taxpayer would have to cover the expense. The cost was described in some local media as excessive. [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] leader [[Peter Ryan (politician)|Peter Ryan]] said that the Labor government should win "gold (medal) for burning money" [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/commonwealth-games-spending-within-budget/2006/09/14/1157827093063.html] However, not all of this money was wasted. The actual costs for hosting the games was 1.144 billion dollars & prior to the Games, accountants at KPMG were estimating that the gross income generated by this event could be as high as 1.5 billion dollars.

Melbourne's premier sporting ground, the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG), was redeveloped in preparation for the Games. An athlete's village in the inner suburb of [[Parkville, Victoria|Parkville]] housed approximately 7,000 athletes and support staff during the Games, and has been transformed into commercial housing with a distinctly eco-friendly image. The creation of this village attracted controversy, with critics claiming it was created by alienating public parkland, while proponents maintained that it represented the renewal of an otherwise derelict inner-city area.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/23/1034561548343.html Battlelines drawn as Parkville site chosen]</ref>

The change from [[Daylight Saving Time]] to Standard Time in Australian states that follow it was delayed from 26 March to 2 April for 2006 to avoid affecting the games. In addition, state and private schools amended their usual term times so as to allow the first term holidays to coincide with the Games.<ref>[http://www.det.vic.gov.au/det/schooled/schooldates.htm] {{wayback|url=http://www.det.vic.gov.au/det/schooled/schooldates.htm |date=20050616111614 |df=y }}</ref>

Melbourne's public transport system – train, tram and bus – ran to altered timetables with some amended or substituted services for the duration of the Games. For the most part, timetabled services were unchanged but suffered due to higher loads.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/commonwealth-games/the-city/2006/03/28/1143441133896.html Public Transport]</ref>

For the first time ever, the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games appointed a Goodwill Partner, [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International Australia]].<ref>[http://www.plan.org.au/contents/aboutus/GoodwillPartner.asp Plan Australia]</ref>

===Broadcasting===
*[[File:VH-VYE 'Karak' Boeing 737-838 Qantas sporting the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Livery (9003318564).jpg|thumb|Qantas Airlines showcasing the logo of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.]]The host broadcaster was [[Trans World International]], while the domestic rights-holding broadcaster was the [[Nine Network]] in Australia. They showed rolling coverage, except for a break for the evening news and overnight.
* In Australia [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] broadcast the Games on eight dedicated digital [[Pay-TV]] channels. These were available on the [[Foxtel]], [[Austar]] and [[Optus Vision]] networks.
* The [[BBC]] covered the Commonwealth Games in the UK on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]]. [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]] included a choice of two extra video streams on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and four streams on Digital [[Satellite]] and [[Cable]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/4719492.stm]. Users with broadband in the UK could also view all 5 video streams on [[bbc.co.uk]], and the BBC Sport website.
*[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[CBC Newsworld]], and [[CBC Country Canada]] aired a daily one-hour highlights show of the Commonwealth Games in Canada. Compared to past games, the CBC's coverage was minimally staffed, with commentary from other broadcasting partners. At first, they did not even consider bidding for the broadcasting rights [http://www.theage.com.au/news/Commonwealth-Games/Blow-to-Games-prestige/2005/03/24/1111525290735.html] due to scheduling conflicts with events Canadians are more interested in, such as the [[Tim Hortons Brier]], [[World Figure Skating Championships]], and the [[2006 Winter Paralympics]] ''(which itself had been reduced to five-to-ten-minute daily coverage)''. None of Canada's metropolitan newspapers sent any journalists to report on the Games, instead relying on news agencies
* [[TVNZ]] covered the games for the residents of [[New Zealand]]
* In [[Malaysia]], [[TV1 (Malaysia)|TV1]] broadcast live coverage of the Games for three hours starting at 10&nbsp;am Malaysian time and for two hours starting at 3&nbsp;pm, with highlights at 12:30&nbsp;am. Satellite provider [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]] included three dedicated channels to broadcast the Games live to its Sports package subscribers, in addition to delayed broadcast 24 hours later.
* Singapore's [[MediaCorp]] TV had supposedly not broadcast the games due to the high cost of [[Broadcasting|telecast]] rights, [[satellite]] charges and the lack of [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]]. However, on 17 March, the MediaCorp found other sponsors which is the [[Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports]] and the [[Singapore Sports Council]]. Broadcast started from 18 March till the end of the games. [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/198361/1/.html]
* In the United States, selected coverage was carried by [[Fox College Sports]].
* Altogether an estimated 4 billion viewers watched the 2006 Commonwealth Games worldwide.

==Missing athletes==
On 20 March 2006 it was reported that two athletes had gone missing from the Commonwealth Games village: [[Tanzania]]n boxer [[Omari Idd Kimweri]] and [[Bangladesh]]i runner Mohammad Tawhidul Islam.<ref>{{cite news | first=Ellen | last=Whinnett |url=http://heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,18556695%255E2862,00.html | title=Mystery of missing athletes | work=[[Herald Sun]] | date=22 March 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=sportsNews&storyID=2006-03-23T042811Z_01_SYD317188_RTRUKOC_0_US-COMMONWEALTH-MISSING.xml&archived=False | title=Nine athletes vanish from Commonwealth Games | work=[[Reuters]] | date=22 March 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref>

On 22 March 2006 it was reported that seven athletes from [[Sierra Leone]] (three women and four men) had also disappeared. A further seven Sierra Leonean athletes also went missing during the course of the Games, bringing the total runaway count to fourteen (two-thirds of the team). [[Victoria Police]] believed that they had fled to Sydney where the Sierra Leonean community is much larger than Melbourne's.

Two hours before the Closing Ceremony on 26 March, officials from the [[Cameroon]] team reported to police that nine of their members had also vanished.

These incidents were not without precedent: 27 athletes similarly disappeared from the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester, England (21 from Sierra Leone, 5 from Bangladesh and one from [[Pakistan]]), and over 80 athletes and officials overstayed their visas after the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4835826.stm | title=Athletes 'go missing from Games' | work=[[BBC News Online]] | date=23 March 2006}}</ref>

On request of Sierra Leone officials, the Commonwealth Games Federation cancelled those athletes' Games accreditation, allowing the [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Australia)|Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs]] (DIMA) to cancel their visas at midnight on 27 March, and begin investigating their disappearance.
{{wikinews|Australia grants temporary asylum to 12 Commonwealth Games athletes}}
At 7.20&nbsp;am on that day, [[New South Wales Police]] located six of the Sierra Leonean athletes in a house at [[Freshwater, New South Wales|Freshwater]] near [[Manly Beach]] in Sydney. All six indicated they wished to seek [[political asylum in Australia]], and were granted bridging visas by DIMA while their refugee applications were arranged. The athletes claimed to have been subjected to violence and torture in their home country; seventeen-year-old Isha Conteh stated she could be forced into [[female genital cutting]] if she returned.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2006/s1602299.htm ABC]</ref> On Tuesday 28 March, six further Sierra Leoneans turned themselves in to immigration authorities in Sydney and were also granted bridging visas.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/visas-for-second-group-of-athletes/2006/03/28/1143441127017.html | title=Visas for second group of athletes | work=[[The Age]] | date=28 March 2006}}</ref>

Two of the missing Cameroonian athletes were later found in [[Perth, Western Australia]].
