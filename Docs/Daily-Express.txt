As a result of Desmond's purchase of the paper, many staff including the then editor, [[Rosie Boycott]], and columnist [[Peter Hitchens]] departed the company,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12148240.Boycott_and_her_deputy_quit_porn_mogul_apos_s_Daily_Express_Editor_says_parting_is_amicable_despite_rift_with_new_owner/ | title=Boycott and her deputy quit porn mogul's Daily Express Editor says parting is amicable despite rift with new owner | publisher=Herald & Times Group | accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref> with Hitchens moving on to ''[[The Mail on Sunday]],'' saying that working for the new owner was a moral conflict of interest since he had always attacked the type of magazines Desmond published.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1061015.stm | title=Veteran columnist quits Express | publisher=BBC | accessdate=3 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204164207/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1061015.stm|archivedate=4 February 2016}}</ref> Despite her different politics, Boycott had an unlikely respect for Hitchens.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Hitchens |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/139233/ |title=Rosie Boycott hugs me: "Everything you write is complete ****," she says, "but I like you" |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=18 December 2000 |accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> Stars of old Fleet Street, like the showbiz interviewer and feature writer [[Paul Callan]], were brought in to restore some of the journalistic weight enjoyed by the paper in its peak years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Express group lost an unusually large number of high-profile libel cases in 2008–2009; it was forced to pay damages to people involved in the [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann]] case (see below), a member of the [[Muslim Council of Great Britain]], footballer [[Marco Materazzi]], and sports agent [[Willie McKay]]. The string of losses led the media commentator [[Roy Greenslade]] to conclude that Express Newspapers (which also publishes the ''Star'' titles) paid out more in libel damages over that period than any other newspaper group. Although most of the individual amounts paid were not disclosed, the total damages were recorded at £1,570,000.<ref name="Greenslade">{{cite news

This led to comment that the ''Express'' has become "the Ryanair of Fleet Street", in that it is a "frequent offender" which pays little heed to the ASA's criticisms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brook |first=Stephen |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2010/jan/27/express-banned-advertising-desmond |title=Daily Express is the Rynair of Fleet Street |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=27 January 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010 }}</ref>

In May 2010, Desmond announced a commitment of £100&nbsp;million over the next five years to buy much-needed new equipment for the printing plants, beginning with the immediate purchase of four new presses, amid industry rumours that he was going to establish a new printing plant in the north of London, at Luton.

On 31 December 2010, the ''Daily Express'', along with all the media titles in Desmond's [[Northern & Shell]] group, were officially excluded from the [[Press Complaints Commission]] after withholding payment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/jan/11/richard-desmond-pcc|title=Desmond's papers excluded from system of press self-regulation|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|date=11 January 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> [[Lord Guy Black]], chairman of [[Press Standards Board of Finance|PressBof]], the PCC's parent organisation, called this "a deeply regrettable decision".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/jan/11/richard-desmond-pcc | title=Desmond's papers excluded from system of press self-regulation | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>

According to ''Press Gazette'', as of May 2015, circulation figures showed gross sales of its long-standing rival the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' are at 1,657,867 compared with 432,076 for the ''Daily Express''.<ref name="Circ"/>

==Controversies==

===John Bodkin Adams===
Suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]] was arrested in 1956 suspected of murdering up to 400 of his wealthy patients in [[Eastbourne]], England.<ref name=Cullen>{{cite book|last1=Cullen|first1=Pamela V. Halliday|title=A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams|date=2006|publisher=Elliott & Thompson|location=London|isbn=1-904027-19-9}}</ref> The press, egged on by police leaks, unanimously declared Adams guilty, except for [[Percy Hoskins]], chief crime reporter for the ''Express''.<ref name=Hoskins>''Two Men Were Acquitted: The trial and acquittal of Doctor John Bodkin Adams'', Secker & Warburg, 1984</ref> Hoskins was adamant that Adams was merely a naive doctor prosecuted by an overzealous detective, [[Herbert Hannam]], whom Hoskins disliked from previous cases.<ref name=Hoskins/> The ''Express'', under Hoskins's direction, was therefore the only major paper to defend Adams, causing [[Lord Beaverbrook]] to question Hoskins's stance on the matter frequently.<ref name=Hoskins/> Adams was tried for the murder of [[Edith Alice Morrell]] in 1957 and found not guilty (a second count was withdrawn controversially). After the case, a jubilant Beaverbrook phoned Hoskins and said: "Two people were acquitted today", meaning Hoskins as well.<ref name=Hoskins/> The ''Express'' then carried an exclusive interview with Adams, who was interviewed by Hoskins for two weeks after the trial in a safe house away from other newspapers. According to archives released in 2003, Adams was thought by police to have killed 163 patients.<ref name=Cullen/>

===Dunblane===
{{Main|Sunday Express Dunblane controversy}}

On 8 March 2009, the Scottish edition of the ''Sunday Express'' published a front page article critical of survivors of the 1996 [[Dunblane massacre]], entitled "Anniversary Shame of Dunblane Survivors". The article criticized the 18-year-old survivors for posting "shocking blogs and photographs of themselves on the internet", revealing that they drank alcohol, made rude gestures and talked about their sex lives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/23/scottish-sunday-express-dunblane-apology | title=Scottish Sunday Express apologises for Dunblane survivors story | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>  The article provoked several complaints, leading to the printing of a front-page apology a [[fortnight]] later,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/90417|title=Dunblane: We're Sorry|work=Sunday Express|date=22 March 2009|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> and a subsequent adjudication by the [[Press Complaints Commission]] described the article as a "serious error of judgement" and stated, "Although the editor had taken steps to resolve the complaint, and rightly published an apology, the breach of the Code was so serious that no apology could remedy it".

===Diana, Princess of Wales===
The ''Daily Express'' has a reputation for consistently printing [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] as front page news, earning it the nickname the ''Daily Ex-Princess'';{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} this has been satirised in ''[[Private Eye]]'', the newspaper being labelled the ''Diana Express'' or the ''Di'ly Express'', and has been attributed to Desmond's close friendship with regular ''Eye'' target [[Mohamed Al Fayed|Mohamed Fayed]].<ref group=note>For instance in the "Hackwatch" column of ''Private Eye'' #1174, 19 December 2006.</ref> For a long period in 2006 and 2007, these front-page stories would consistently appear on Mondays; this trend ceased only when the paper focused instead on the [[Madeleine McCann]] story (see below). Even on 7 July 2006, the anniversary of the [[7/7|London bombings]] (used by most other newspapers to publish commemorations) the front page was given over to Diana. This tendency was also mocked on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' when on 6 November 2006, the day other papers reported the death sentence given to [[Saddam Hussein]] on their front pages, the ''Express'' led with “SPIES COVER UP DIANA 'MURDER'”.

According to ''[[The Independent]]'' "The Diana stories appear on Mondays because Sunday is often a quiet day."<ref name="Independent Hill">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/peter-hill-an-appetite-for-battle-467118.html|title=Peter Hill: An appetite for battle|date= 20 February 2006|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first1=Raymond|last1=Snoddy|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref> In February and March 2010 the paper returned to featuring Diana stories on the front page on Mondays.

In September 2013, following an allegation raised by the estranged wife of an [[Special Air Service|SAS]] operative, the ''Daily Express'' once again returned to running daily Princess Diana cover stories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/428276/SAS-quizzed-over-Diana-death|title=SAS quizzed over Diana death|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 10 September 2013|first1=John|last1=Twomey|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429017/Army-slated-for-not-taking-allegations-of-SAS-aided-Diana-death-seriously|title=Army slated for not taking allegations of SAS aided death seriously|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 13 September 2013|accessdate=11 June 2014|first1=John|last1=Twomey}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429312/EXCLUSIVE-How-David-Cameron-knew-of-Princess-Diana-murder-plot|title=How David Cameron knew of Princess Diana murder plot|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 14 September 2013|accessdate=11 June 2014|first1=John|last1=Twomey}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429536/EXCLUSIVE-SAS-s-lamping-unit-used-laser-to-dazzle-Princess-Diana-s-driver|title=SAS's lamping unit used laser to dazzle Diana's driver|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 15 September 2013|accessdate=11 June 2014|first1=Donal |last1=MacIntyre}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429799/Soldier-s-claim-SAS-ordered-to-kill-Princess-Diana-ups-pressure-for-murder-investigation|title=Soldier's claim SAS ordered to kill Princess Diana ups pressure for murder investigation|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 16 September 2013|accessdate=11 June 2014|first1=Giles|last1= Sheldrick}}</ref>

===Madeleine McCann===
In the second half of 2007 the ''Daily Express'' gave a large amount of coverage to the [[disappearance of Madeleine McCann]]. From 3 August 2007, the ''Express'' dedicated at least part of the next 100 front pages to Madeleine in a run that lasted until 10 November 2007. 82 of these 100 front page articles used the headline to feature the details of the disappearance (often stylised by "MADELEINE" in red block capitals, plus a picture of the child).

Though the family initially said that some journalists may have "overstepped their mark" they acknowledged the benefits in keeping the case in the public eye,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=3587167&page=4 | title=From Victims to Villains | publisher=ABC News | date=12 September 2007}}</ref> but argued that the coverage needed to be toned down since daily headlines are not necessarily helpful.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1644291.0.i_dont_think_necessarily_having_newspaper_headlines_with_the_image_of_madeleine_being_thrust_on_to_people_every_single_day_helps_clearly_we_have_seen_irresponsible_reporting.php | title=I don’t think necessarily having newspaper headlines with the image of Madeleine being thrust on to people every single day helps. Clearly we have seen irresponsible reporting. | work=Sunday Herald | date=26 August 2007}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> However, in March 2008, the McCanns launched a [[libel]] suit against the ''Daily Express'' and its sister newspaper, the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', as well as their Sunday equivalents, following the newspapers' coverage of the case. The action concerned more than 100 stories across the four newspapers, which accused the McCanns of causing their daughter's death and covering it up.<ref name="Damages due"/> One immediate consequence of the action was that Express Newspapers pulled all references to Madeleine from its websites.<ref>{{cite news

  | accessdate =17 March 2008}}</ref>

In a settlement reached at the [[High Court of Justice]], the newspapers agreed to run a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, publish another apology on the front pages of the Sunday editions of 23 March and make a statement of apology at the High Court. The newspapers also agreed to pay costs and substantial damages, which the McCanns said they would use to fund the search for their daughter.<ref name="Damages due">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7303801.stm | title=Damages due over McCann stories |publisher=BBC News | date=18 March 2008}}</ref> ''Guardian'' media commentator [[Roy Greenslade]] said it was "unprecedented" for four major newspapers to offer front-page apologies, but also said that it was more than warranted given that the papers had committed "a substantial libel" that shamed the entire British press.<ref>{{cite news |author=Roy Greenslade |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2008/mar/19/expressandstarapologiesto |title=Express and Star apologies to McCanns bring all journalism into disrepute |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> Craig Silverman of ''Regret the Error'',  a blog that reports media errors, argued that given how many of the stories appeared on the front page, anything less than a front page apology would have been "unacceptable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regrettheerror.com/2008/03/19/daily-express-daily-star-issue-front-page-apologies-pay-damages |title=Poynter |work=Regret the Error |date= |accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>

In its apology, the ''Express'' stated that "a number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up. We acknowledge that there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/38490 | title=Kate and Gerry McCann: Sorry |work=Daily Express |location=UK | date=19 March 2008}}</ref> This was followed in October by an apology and payout (forwarded to the fund again) to a group who had become known as the "[[Tapas Seven]]" in relation to the case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7673148.stm |title=Libel payout for McCann friends |publisher=BBC News |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>

==='Crusade for Freedom'===
This was the newspaper's own campaign to give the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to add their names to a petition addressed to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in favour of Britain's withdrawal from the [[European Union]]. Each edition of 8 January 2011 issue had four cut-out vouchers where readers could sign the pledge and send them to the paper's HQ where the petition was being compiled, there were also further editions with the same voucher included.<ref>'A crusade for freedom', ''Daily Express'', page 55, 8 January 2011</ref> The campaign attracted the support of many celebrities including sportsman/TV personality Sir [[Ian Botham]]<ref>'Botham backs our drive for public vote on Europe', ''Daily Express'', page 59, 8 January 2011</ref> and Chairman of [[J D Wetherspoon]] [[Tim Martin (businessman)|Tim Martin]]<ref>'Euro red tape is strangling UK enterprise', ''Daily Express'', page 69, 8 January 2011</ref> who both gave interviews for 8 January's special edition of the paper. The first week of the campaign saw a response of around 370,000 signatures being received (just over 50% of daily readership or around 0.6% of the UK population).
