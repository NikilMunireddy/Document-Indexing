==Etymology==
Amman derives its name from the 13th century BC when the [[Ammon]]ites named it "Rabbath Ammon", with the term ''Rabbath'' meaning the "Capital" or the "King's Quarters". Over time, the term "Rabbath" was no longer used and the city became known as "Ammon". The influence of new civilizations that conquered the city gradually changed its name to "Amman".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/gam/about.asp| title=About GAM => History| work=Greater Amman Municipality| accessdate=2015-09-22}}</ref> In the [[Hebrew Bible]], it is referred to as "Rabbat ʿAmmon" ([[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian Hebrew]] ''Rabbaṯ ʿAmmôn''). However, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the Macedonian ruler of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city to "Philadelphia" ([[Ancient Greek]]: Φιλαδέλφεια; literally: "brotherly love") after occupying it. The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname, Philadelphus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mansaf.org/catholic/misdar.htm|accessdate=2015-09-22|title=MISDAR|work=mansaf.org}}</ref>

===Ancient period===

[[File:20100923 amman37.JPG|thumb|right|One of the oldest human statues ever made by human civilization from [['Ain Ghazal]] on display at [[The Jordan Museum]].

In the outskirts of Amman, one of the largest known ancient settlements in the [[Near East]] was discovered. The site, known as [['Ain Ghazal]] which is situated on a valley-side, dates back to 7250 BC and spans an area of 15 hectares. It was a typical average sized [[aceramic]] [[Neolithic]] village that accommodated around 3,000 inhabitants. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Settlements of the Middle East|url=http://docslide.us/documents/prehistoric-settlements-of-the-middle-east.html|accessdate=2015-09-22|work=bhavika1990|date=2014-11-08}}</ref> The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982 when the excavations started, around {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of 'Ain Ghazal provided wealthy information.<ref name=gard/>

'Ain Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found buried in pits which were discovered in 1983, when local archaeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} containing plaster statues.<ref>{{cite book| editor1-first = Chris | editor1-last = Scarre | title = The Human Past | publisher = Thames & Hudson | year = 2005 | page = 222}}</ref> These statues are human figures made with white plaster. The figures have painted clothes, hair, and in some cases ornamental tattoos. 32 figures were found in two caches, 15 of them full figures, 15 busts, and two fragmentary heads. Three of the busts were two-headed, the significance of which is not clear.<ref name=gard>{{cite book | first1=Fred S. | last1=Kleiner | last2=Mamiya | first2=Christin J. | year=2006 | title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective: Volume 1 | edition=Twelfth | publisher=Wadsworth Publishing | location=[[Belmont, California]] | isbn=0-495-00479-0 | pages=11–2

[[File:Rujm Al-Malfouf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rujm Al-Malfouf]] Ammonite watch tower built around 50 BC.]]
In the 13th century BC Amman was known as "Rabbath Ammon" by the [[Ammon]]ites. Ammon provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone. Along with a productive agricultural sector, which made Ammon a vital location along the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], the ancient trade route connecting [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Anatolia]]. As with the [[Edomites]] and [[Moabites]], trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html|accessdate=2015-10-10|title=The Old Testament Kingdoms of Jordan|work=kinghussein.gov.jo|publisher=kinghussein.gov.jo}}</ref> Ammonites worshiped an ancient [[deity]] called [[Moloch]]. Excavations by archaeologists near [[Amman Civil Airport]] uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a [[pyre]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.biblestudywithrandy.com/2014/08/temple-human-sacrifice-amman-jordan| accessdate=2015-09-22| title=Temple of Human Sacrifice: Amman Jordan| work=Randy McCracken| date=2014-08-22}}</ref>

Today, several Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as [[Qasr Al-Abd]], [[Rujm Al-Malfouf]] and some parts of the [[Amman Citadel]]. The ruins of Rujm Al-Malfouf consist of a surveillance stone tower that was used to ensure protection of their capital and several store rooms east of it.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.livius.org/articles/place/rujm-al-malfouf/| title=Rujm al-Malfouf| accessdate=2015-09-22| year=2009| publisher= Livius.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/services/histdetails.asp?id=5| title=Rujom Al Malfouf (Al Malfouf heap of stones / Tower)| accessdate=2015-09-22| publisher=Greater Amman Municipality}}</ref> The city was later conquered by the [[Assyrian Empire]], followed by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].

===Classical period===
[[File:Qasr Al Abid 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Qasr Al-Abd]] Hellenistic castle built around 200 BC.]]

Conquest of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] firmly consolidated the influence of [[Hellenistic period#Culture|Hellenistic culture]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_hellenistic.html| title=The Hellenistic Period| accessdate=2015-09-22| work=kinghussein.gov.jo}}</ref> The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including [[Umm Qays]], [[Jerash]] and Amman. [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, who occupied and rebuilt the city, named it "Philadelphia", which means "brotherly love" in [[Greek language|Greek]]. The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname, Philadelphus.<ref name="Cohen2006">{{cite book|author=Getzel M.

One of the most original monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of [[Iraq Al-Amir]] in the valley of [[Wadi Al-Seer|Wadi Al-Sir]], southwest of Amman, which is home to [[Qasr Al-Abd]] (Castle of the Slave). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, all of which are barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit the region in the year 362.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.jo/books?id=fsoipziOWpYC&pg=PA98&dq=hyrcanus+iraq+al+amir&hl=ar&sa=X&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAGoVChMIyOz79deoyAIVyasaCh3tNwhR#v=onepage&q=hyrcanus%20iraq%20al%20amir&f=false| accessdate=2015-09-22| author=Andreas J.

Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered [[Jerusalem]], ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.openedition.org/ifpo/4894?lang=en|title=The Hellenistic Age – (323 – 30 BC)|author=de l’Institut français du Proche-Orient|publisher= Presses de l’Ifpo|accessdate=2015-09-22}}</ref> The Tobiads fought the Arab [[Nabateans]] for twenty years until they lost the city to them.

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered much of the [[Levant]] in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted for four centuries. In the northern modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), [[Jerash|Gerasa]], [[Umm Qays|Gedara]], [[Pella]] and [[Irbid|Arbila]] joined with other cities in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]]; [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]], [[Hippos]], [[Capitolias]], [[Qanawat|Canatha]] and [[Damascus]] to form the [[Decapolis|Decapolis League]], a fabled confederation linked by bonds of economic and cultural interest.<ref name="doa.gov.jo">{{cite web|url=http://www.doa.gov.jo/En/inside.php?src=sublinks&SlID=5024&MlID=8|title=The History of a Land| accessdate=2015-09-30| work=Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities| publisher=Department of Antiquities}}</ref> Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from [[Aqaba|Ailah]] to Damascus that was built by Emperor [[Trajan]] in 106 AD. This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time. During the late [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era in the 7th century, several bishops and churches were based in the city.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/tourism1.html| title=Tourism| work=kinghussein.gov.jo| publisher=kinghussein.gov.jo| accessdate=2015-10-16}}</ref>

Roman rule in Jordan left several ruins across the country, some of which exist in Amman, such as the [[Temple of Hercules (Amman)|Temple of Hercules]] at the [[Amman Citadel]], the [[Roman theater (Amman)|Roman Theatre]], the [[Odeon theater (Amman)|Odeon]], and the [[Nymphaeum (Amman)|Nymphaeum]]. The two theatres and the Nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] around 161 AD. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small [[Odeon (building)|odeon]]. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a 600-square meter pool which was three meters deep and was continuously refilled with water.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/tourism1.html| title=Amman| publisher=kinghussein.gov.jo| accessdate=2015-09-22}}</ref>

===Early Islamic era===
{{see also|Desert castles}}
[[File:Umayyad Palace020.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Umayyad Palace]] on top of the [[Amman Citadel]] built around 800 AD.]]
In the 630s, the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun army]] conquered the region from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed "Amman" by the Muslims and became part of the district of [[Jund al-Urdunn]]. A large part of the population already spoke [[Arabic]], which facilitated integration into the [[caliphate]], as well as several conversions to [[Islam]]. Under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous [[desert castle]]s were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the [[Amman Citadel]] hill, known today as the [[Umayyad Palace]]. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 747. The Umayyads were overthrown by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] three years later.<ref name="doa.gov.jo"/>

Amman's importance declined by the mid-8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable.<ref name="Ifpo">{{cite book |title=The Exclusion of Amman from Jordanian National Identity |work=Cities, Urban Practices and Nation Building in Jordan |series=Cahiers de l'Ifpo Nr. 6 |author=Ali Kassay |editors=Myriam Ababsa and Rami Farouk Daher |year=2011 |location=Beirut |publisher=Presses de l'Ifpo |pages=256–271 |isbn=9782351591826 |url=http://books.openedition.org/ifpo/1748?lang=en |accessdate=25 December 2015 }}</ref> Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of [[kiln]]s from the time of the Abbasids (750-696) and the Fatimids (969-1099).<ref name="Arce">{{cite journal |title=Early Islamic lime kilns from the Near East.

===Middle Ages===
The occupation of the Citadel Hill by the [[Crusades|Crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] annexed the region of Amman in 1516, but for much of the Ottoman period, [[al-Salt]] functioned as the virtual political centre of Transjordan. Amman was only resettled starting from 1878, when hundreds of [[Circassians]] arrived following their exodus from the [[Caucasus]] during the rule of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].<ref name="Web.archive.org">{{cite web |url=http://ammancity100.gov.jo/en/content/story-amman/end-ummayad-era-till-1878 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212032543/http://ammancity100.gov.jo/en/content/story-amman/end-ummayad-era-till-1878 |archivedate=2010-02-12 |title=Amman Centennial &#124; From the end of the Umayyad era till 1878 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> Between 1872–1910, tens of thousands of Circassians were forcibly relocated to [[Ottoman Syria]] from historical [[Circassia]] by the [[Russian Empire]] during the events of the [[Russo-Circassian War]].<ref name="Natho2009">{{cite book| author=Kadir I.

They said that 500 of them had arrived here about three months previously, but that the majority had speedily become discontented with their prospects and had gone away; 150, including women and children, were all that remained, and these had decided to settle here. The spot had been selected, in the first instance, on account of the shelter which the caverns and old rock-cut tombs afforded... It seems never to have been occupied either by the Saracens or Turks, and consequently from the date of the Arab wars in the seventh century has remained a desolation and a wilderness. It has been reserved for the Circassians to be the first settled population, after an interval of more than a thousand years, to take possession of these crumbling remains of former greatness. It is marvellous that during all that time Ammon should have resisted all attempts permanently to change its name, and be known among the Arabs of the present day by the identical appellation it bore when we first heard of it, 1500 years before the Christian era, as being the repository of the great iron bedstead of [[Og]] the king of [[Bashan]]..."</ref>

Ottoman records from 1906 show around 5,000 Circassians living in Amman and virtually no inhabitants who spoke Arabic. The city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision to construct the [[Hejaz Railway]], which linked [[Damascus]] and [[Medina]], and facilitated the annual [[Hajj]] pilgrimage and trade. Because of its location along the railway, Amman was transformed from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.doa.gov.jo/En/inside.php?src=map&SlID=5101&city=amman| title=Amman Governorate| accessdate=2015-09-22| publisher=Department of Antiquities| work=Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities}}</ref>

The [[First Battle of Amman|First]] and [[Second Battle of Amman]] were part of the [[Middle Eastern theater of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]] of [[World War I]] and the [[Arab Revolt]], taking place in 1918. Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway; its capture by British forces and the [[Sharifian Army|Hashemite Arab army]] facilitated the British advance towards [[Damascus]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.jo/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=what+is+the+result+of+the+second+battle+of+amman&source=bl&ots=BSf5QfYO0H&sig=b4Dtlpspc42a5MuhLB1XqRfziQ0&hl=ar&sa=X&ved=0CFQQ6AEwCGoVChMI3rLLtrWPyAIVirYUCh0gKA0O#v=onepage&q=what%20is%20the%20result%20of%20the%20second%20battle%20of%20amman&f=false| title=Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social, and Military History| accessdate=2015-09-24| author1=Spencer C.

In 1921, the Hashemite emir and later king, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]], designated Amman instead of al-Salt to be the capital of the newly created state, the [[Emirate of Transjordan]], which became the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] in 1950. Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the [[Jordan River]] at the time. The early settlers who came from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] were overwhelmingly from [[Nablus]], from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country, particularly [[Al Karak]] and [[Madaba]]. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.<ref name="HistoryP">{{cite book |author1=Reem Khamis-Dakwar |author2=Karen Froud |date=2014 |title=Perspectives on Arabic Linguistics XXVI: Papers from the annual symposium on Arabic Linguistics.

Jordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country's capital. Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries, beginning with the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. A second wave arrived after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, and a third wave of Palestinian and Jordanian refugees arrived in Amman from [[Kuwait]] after the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the 1991 Gulf War, with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Most recently a wave of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]] have arrived in the city during the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War]] which began in 2011. Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/09/18/jordan-s-refugee-crisis/ihwc| title=Jordan's Refugee Crisis| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2015-09-21| publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]]| author=Alexandra Francis}}</ref>

In 1970, Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordanian Army]] known as [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]].

During the last ten years the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning. Today, Amman is known as a modern, liberal and westernized Arab city,<ref name="Rt.com">{{cite web| url=http://rt.com/news/media-jordan-breaking-taboos/ |title=Westernized media in Jordan breaking old taboos&nbsp;— RT |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref> with major mega projects such as the [[Abdali Urban Regeneration Project]] and the [[Jordan Gate Towers]].

Amman's position on the mountains near the Mediterranean climate zone places it under the [[semi-arid climate]] classification ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate]]: BSk). Summers are mildly hot and breezy, however, one or two heat waves may occur during summer. Spring is brief and warm, where highs reach {{convert|28|°C|0|abrr=on}}. Spring usually starts between April and May, and last about a month. Around the end of November is the period in which winter usually starts and continues from early to mid March. Temperatures are usually near or below {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with snow occasionally falling once or twice a year. Rain averages about {{convert|300|mm|0|abbr=on}} a year and periodic droughts are common, where most rain fall between October and April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weatherspark.com/averages/32846/10/Amman-Jordan |title=Average Weather In October For Amman, Jordan |publisher=WeatherSpark |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> At least 120 days of heavy fog per year is usual.<ref name="cityscape.jo">{{cite web|url=http://cityscape.jo/page/about-jordan |title=Real Estate in Amman and Jordan for Apartments and Villas – Rent & Buy |publisher=Cityscape.jo |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref> Difference in elevation plays a major role in the different weather conditions experienced in the city, snow may accumulate in the western and northern parts of Amman (an average altitude of {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) while at the same time it could be raining at the city centre (elevation of {{convert|776|m|ft|abbr=on}}).  ({{convert|900|to|1100|m|ft}}).

==Local government==
{{Main|Greater Amman Municipality}} 
Amman is governed by a 41-member city council elected in five-year term direct elections. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/gam/about.asp| title=About GAM| publisher=Greater Amman Municipality| accessdate=2015-09-23}}</ref> In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian [[Ismael Babouk]] who became the first ever Mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district centre was founded.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/ar/gam/council.asp| title=GAM council| accessdate=2015-09-23| publisher=Greater Amman Municipality}}</ref>

The Greater Amman Municipality has been investing towards making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. 'Green Amman 2020' was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a [[environmentally friendly|green metropolis]] by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is [[urban open space|green space]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/editorial/greener-amman| title=For a greener Amman| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2015-09-09| publisher=The Jordan News| work=[[The Jordan Times]]}}</ref> In 2015, (GAM) and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 different locations, including [[Wakalat Street]], [[Rainbow Street]], [[The Hashemite Plaza]], Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Centre, Al Hussein Cultural Center, [[Al Hussein Public Parks]] and others.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/amman-have-free-wi-fi-service-15-selected-locations| title=Amman to have free Wi-Fi service in 15 selected locations| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2015-05-25| publisher=The Jordan News| work=The Jordan Times}}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
{{see also|:Category:Districts of Amman}}
[[Jordan]] is divided into twelve administrative divisions, each called a governorate. [[Amman Governorate]] divides into nine [[Nahias of Jordan|nahias]], five of which are divided into districts and are further divided into neighborhoods. The other four nahias lying in the suburbs are either divided into villages or towns.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://moi.gov.jo/arabic/pages/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9.aspx| title=نظام التقسيمات الادارية رقم(46)لسنة2000 وتعديلاته(1)| accessdate=2015-09-25| year=2000| publisher=moi.gov.jo |language=Arabic| work=Ministry of Interiors Jordan}}</ref>

==Economy==

[[File:RJ bld, Amman, Jordan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Royal Jordanian Airlines]] headquarters in Amman]]

===Banking sector===
The [[bank]]ing sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector currently consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the [[Amman Stock Exchange]]. Amman is the base city for the international [[Arab Bank]], one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by [[market capitalization]] on the exchange.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.awraq.com/uploads/research/b7e73be8b70e8bd319cbf637c046d178e431ccdb.pdf| title=Jordan Banking Sector Brief| accessdate=2015-09-23}}</ref>

===Tourism===
Amman is the 4th most visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city.<ref>{{cite web| author=MasterCard Worldwide | url=http://www.slideshare.net/MasterCardNews/global-destination-cities-index-slideshare-final |title=MasterCard Worldwide's Global Destination Cities Index |publisher=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref> The expansion of [[Queen Alia International Airport]] is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.<ref name="capacity">{{cite news |last=Maslen |first=Richard |date=27 March 2013 |title=New Terminal Opening Boosts Queen Alia Airport's Capacity |url=http://www.routesonline.com/news/29/breaking-news/190852/new-terminal-opening-boosts-queen-alia-airports-capacity-/ |newspaper=Routesonline |location=Manchester, United Kingdom |publisher=[[UBM Information]] Ltd |accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref>

Amman, and Jordan in general, is the Middle East's hub for [[medical tourism]]. Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world. Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and over $1 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://jordantimes.com/jordan-remains-medical-tourism-hub-despite-regional-unrest |title=Jordan remains medical tourism hub despite regional unrest |publisher=[[The Jordan Times]] |date=2012-03-18 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref>

===Business===
Amman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the [[2003 Iraq War]]. Jordan's main airport, [[Queen Alia International Airport]], is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier [[Royal Jordanian]], a major airline in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2010/august/i_bca01.pdf|title=Royal Jordanian was the first airline in the Middle East to order the 787 Dreamliner|work=boeing.com|publisher=boeing.com|accessdate=2015-09-30}}</ref> The airline is headquartered in [[Zahran district]]. [[Rubicon Group Holding]] and [[Maktoob]], two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as [[Hikma Pharmaceuticals]], one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and [[Aramex]], the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.<ref name="iraq-businessnews.com"/><ref>{{cite web| author=Hussein Hachem |url=http://www.busmanagementme.com/article/aramex-middle-easts-biggest-courier-firm/ |title=Aramex MEA: the Middle East's biggest courier firm&nbsp;– Lead Features&nbsp;– Business Management Middle East &#124; GDS Publishing |publisher=Busmanagementme.com |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref>

Population of city reached 4,007,526 in 2015, Amman contains about 42% of Jordan's entire population.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> It has a land area of {{convert|648.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} which yields a population density of about {{convert|2380|PD/km2}}.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.permaculturenews.org/files/ipc10/Lancaster_Water_Harvesting_Jordan-9-2011.pdf| title=Turning Drains Into Sponges and Water Scarcity Into Water Abundance| work=Brad Lancaster| publisher=permaculturenews.org| accessdate=2015-09-30}}</ref> The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city.<ref name="D&S34">Dumper and Stanley, p. 34.</ref> Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of [[Circassians]] settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity.<ref>Albala, p. 267.</ref> After Amman became a major hub along the [[Hejaz Railway]] in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city.<ref>Richmond, p. 124.</ref> A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Circassians comprise about 2% of the population. Tthere are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.<ref>Dakwar, pp. 31–32.</ref>

New arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947.<ref name="Suleiman101">Suleiman, p. 101.</ref> About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from [[Safad]], [[Haifa]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]].<ref name="Plascov33"/> Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from [[Nablus]].<ref>Dakwar, p. 31.</ref> The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from [[Jaffa]], [[Ramla]] and [[Lod|Lydda]], to Amman,<ref name="Plascov33">Plascov, p. 33.</ref> whose population swelled to 110,000.<ref name="Suleiman101"/> With Jordan's capture of the [[West Bank]] during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the [[Six-Day War|1967 War]]. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000.<ref name="Suleiman101"/> A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. Several large [[Palestinian refugee camp]]s exist around the centre of Amman.<ref name="D&S35">Dumper and Stanley, p. 35.</ref>

Because Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic [[dialect]], although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming.<ref>Owens, p. 260.</ref> The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as "Ammani", unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.<ref>Jones, p. 64.</ref>

Its expansion was recently done and modified, including the decommissioning of the old terminals and the commissioning of new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16 million passengers annually.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.albawaba.com/accelerating-passenger-growth-jordan%E2%80%99s-qaia-suggests-confidence-returning-386395| title=Accelerating passenger growth at Jordan's QAIA suggests confidence returning |publisher=Al Bawaba |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref> It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was rewarded 'the best airport by region: [[Middle East]]' and 'the best improvement by region: Middle East' by 2014 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aig.aero/en/content/1st-place-service-quality-rankings-qaia-named-best-airport-region-middle-east-and-best| accessdate=2015-09-23| title=1st Place Service Quality Rankings: QAIA Named 'Best Airport by Region – Middle East' and 'Best Improvement by Region – Middle East'| date=2015-02-23}}</ref>

===Roads===
{{see also|List of roads in Amman}}
[[File:Abdoun Bridge (7).jpg|thumb|right|[[Abdoun Bridge]], considered one of Amman's landmarks]]
Amman has an extensive road network, although the mountainous terrain of the area has prevented the connection of some main roads, which are instead connected by bridges and tunnels. The [[Abdoun Bridge]] spans [[Wadi Abdoun]] and connects the [[List of roads in Amman#Circles|4th Circle]] to [[Abdoun Circle]]. It is considered one of Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/tourism1.html| title=Tourism in Amman| accessdate=2015-09-02}}</ref>

There are eight circles, or [[roundabout]]s, that span and connect west Amman. Successive waves of immigrants to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/amman-residents-complain-about-daylong-car-jams| title=Amman residents complain about daylong car jams| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2014-06-08| publisher=The Jordan News| work=[[The Jordan Times]]}}</ref> The municipality began construction on a bus rapid transit (BRT) system as a solution in 2015.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/gam-closes-princess-basma-street-brt-work| title=GAM closes Princess Basma street for BRT work| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2015-07-04| publisher=The Jordan News| work=The Jordan Times}}</ref> In 2015, a [[ring road]] encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/pm-inaugurates-second-phase-amman-road-project| title=PM inaugurates second phase of Amman road project| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2012-02-05| publisher=The Jordan News| work=The Jordan Times}}</ref>

===Bus rapid transit===
{{Main|Amman Bus Rapid Transit}}
[[File:Bus.JPG|thumb|right|Public transport buses in Amman]]

Currently under construction are dedicated lanes for bus services which will operate as part of the new urban rapid transit network ([[bus rapid transit]]). The system includes high-quality stations and stops; express buses that can carry more than 120 passengers and will run on a three-minute frequency during peak hours along Amman's busiest corridors; terminals and park-n-ride facilities; and an integrated fare collection system allowing passengers to pay the fare at stations before embarking on the bus.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://english.business.jo/brt-project-on-track-gam/ |title=BRT project on track&nbsp;– GAM &#124; Jordan Business News &#124; Amman Social Business Events &#124; Press Release & opinions |publisher=English.business.jo |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref> The BRT is planned to run along three major corridors. The first one connects Sweileh with Mahatta via Sport City, with a major underground station at the [[University of Jordan]]. The second corridor connects Sport City with [[Downtown Amman]] at Ras El-Ain. The third corridor connects Customs Square with Mahatta.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ammanbrt.jo/maps.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830223758/http://www.ammanbrt.jo/maps.asp |archivedate=2010-08-30 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref>

===Bus and taxi===
The city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the [[King Abdullah I Mosque|King Abdullah Mosque]], the [[Parliament of Jordan|Parliament]] and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theatre in the city centre. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://studiesabroad.com/programs/country/jordan/city/amman/cultureCorner/transportation |title=Transportation in Amman |accessdate=2015-09-02}}</ref>

==Education==

[[File:University of Jordan Monuments and Buildins 114.JPG|thumb|right|[[University of Jordan]] library]]
According to Jordan Department of Statistics, Amman has the highest [[literacy]] percentage in Jordan: 95.2% (97.3% among males and 93.1% among females).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-marks-int%E2%80%99l-literacy-day-today| title=Jordan marks Int'l Literacy Day today| accessdate=2015-10-02| date=2013-09-07| work=The Jordan Times| publisher=The Jordan News}}</ref> There are 20 universities in Amman.
