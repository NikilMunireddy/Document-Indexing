'''Assamese''' or '''Asamiya''' or '''Axomiya''' or '''Oxomiya''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|æ|s|ə|ˈ|m|iː|z}};<ref>{{cite web|title=Assamese - definition of Assamese in English from the Oxford dictionary|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/assamese?q=Assamese|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref> {{lang-as|অসমীয়া, ''Ôxômiya''}}, {{IPA-as|ɔˈxɔmija|pron|Pronunciation of Ôxômiya.ogg}}) is an Eastern [[Indo-Aryan language]] ({{lang|as|পূৰ্বীয় ইণ্ডো-আৰ্য ভাষা / পূৰ্বীয় ভাৰতীয়-আৰ্য ভাষা}}) used mainly in the [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Assam]] ({{lang|as|অসম ৰাজ্য}}), where it is an [[official language]] ({{lang|as|অসমৰ ৰাজ্যিক ভাষা}}). The easternmost of the Indo-Aryan languages, it is spoken by over 13 million native speakers,<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.htm 2001 Indian Census report]</ref> and serves as a ''lingua franca'' ({{lang|as|সংযোগী ভাষা}}) in the region.<ref>"Asamiya is the major language spoken in Assam, and serves almost as a lingua franca among the different speech communities in the whole area." {{harvcol|Goswami|2003|pp=394}}</ref>  It is also spoken in parts of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] ({{lang|as|অৰুণাচল প্ৰদেশ}}) and other [[North-East India|northeast]] Indian states ({{lang|as|উত্তৰ-পূবৰ ৰাজ্যসমূহ}}). [[Nagamese creole|Nagamese]] ({{lang|as|নাগামিজ}}), an Assamese-based [[Creole language]] ({{lang|as|মিশ্ৰ ভাষা / সংমিশ্ৰেতি ভাষা / ক্ৰে'য়ল ভাষা}}) is widely used in [[Nagaland]] ({{lang|as|নাগালেণ্ড}}) and parts of Assam.  [[Nefamese]] ({{lang|as|নেফামিজ}}) is an Assamese-based pidgin used in [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. Small pockets of Assamese speakers can be found in [[Bangladesh]]. In the past, it was the court language of the [[Ahom kingdom]] from the 17th century.

Along with other [[Eastern Indo-Aryan languages]], Assamese evolved at least before 7th century A.D<ref>Sen, Sukumar (1975), ''Grammatical sketches of Indian languages with comparative vocabulary and texts, Volume 1'', P 31</ref> from the [[Magadhi Prakrit]], which developed from dialects similar to, but in some ways more archaic than Vedic Sanskrit ({{lang|as|ৱেদ সংস্কৃত}}).{{Sfn|Oberlies|2007|p=163}} Its sister languages include [[Bengali language|Bengali]] ({{lang|as|বঙালী ভাষা}}), [[Odia language|Odia]] ({{lang|as|ওড়িয়া ভাষা}}), [[Maithili language|Maithili]] ({{lang|as|মৈথিলী ভাষা}}), [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]] ({{lang|as|চিত্তাগংইয় ভাষা}}), [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] (Cilôţi) ({{lang|as|চিলেটি ভাষা}}), [[Angika]] ({{lang|as|অংগিকা ভাষা}}) and [[Bihari languages]] ({{lang|as|বিহাৰি ভাষাসমূহ}}). It is written in the [[Assamese script]] ({{lang|as|অসমীয়া লিপি}}), an [[abugida]] system, from left to right, with a large number of [[typographic ligature]]s.

The word Assamese is an English formation built on the same principle as [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] ({{lang|as|সিংহলী ভাষা}}) or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ({{lang|as|জাপানী ভাষা}}) etc. It is based on the English word Assam by which the tract consisting of the [[Brahmaputra Valley]] ({{lang|as|ব্ৰহ্মপুত্ৰ উপত্যকা}}) and its adjoining areas are known.<ref>Sarma, Satyendranath (1976), ''Assamese Literature'', Page 43</ref> The people call their state ''{{lang|as-Latn|Ôxôm}}'' and their language ''{{lang|as-Latn|Ôxômiya}}''.

==History==
[[File:Silver rupee of Rudra Simha.jpg|thumb|<center>''Silver coin of issued during the reign of [[Rudra Singha|Rudra Sinha]] with Asamiya inscriptions''.</center>]]
Assamese originated in [[Indo-Aryan languages#Old Indo-Aryan|Old Indo-Aryan]] ({{lang|as|ইণ্ডো-আৰ্য}}) dialects, though the exact nature of its origin and growth in not clear yet.<ref>"Asamiya has historically originated in Old Indo-Aryan dialects, but the exact nature of its origin and growth is not very clear as yet." {{harvcol|Goswami|2003|pp=394}}</ref> It is generally believed that Assamese (Assam) and the [[Kamatapuri lects]] (North Bengal and Assam) derive from the [[Old Kamrupi|Kamarupa dialect]] ({{lang|as|কামৰূপৰ উপভাষা}}) of Eastern [[Magadhi Prakrit]] ({{lang|as|মগধ অঞ্চলৰ প্রাকৃত ভাষা}})  and Apabhramsa,<ref>"Dr [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|S. K. Chatterji]] basing his conclusion on the materials of accumulated by LSI Vol 1 and other monographs on the Bangali dialects divides eastern Mag. Pkt. and Ap. into four dialect groups. (1) ''Radha'' dialects which comprehend Western Bengali which gives standard Bangali dialect and Oriya in the South West. (2) ''Varendra'' dialects of North Central Bengal. (3) ''Kamarupa'' dialects which comprehend Assamese and the dialects of North Bengal. (4) ''Vanga'' dialects which comprehend the dialects of East Bengal (ODBL Vol. I. p140)"  {{harv|Kakati|1941|p=6}}</ref> by keeping to the north of the [[Ganges]];<ref>Goswami, Golockchandra (1982), ''Structure of Assamese'', Page 3</ref> though some authors contest a close connection of Assamese with [[Magadhi Prakrit]].<ref>There is evidence that the Prakrit of the [[Kamarupa kingdom]] differed enough from the [[Magadhi Prakrit]] to be identified as either a parallel [[Kamrupi Prakrit]] or at least an eastern variety of the Magadha Prakrit {{Harvcol|Sharma|1990|pp=0.24–0.28}}</ref>  The Indo-Aryan language in [[Kamarupa]] ({{lang|as|কামৰূপ}}) had differentiated by the 7th-century, before it did in Bengal or Orissa.<ref>"It is curious to find that according to ([[Xuanzang|Hiuen Tsang]]) the language of Kamarupa 'differed a little' from that of mid-India.  Hiuen Tsang is silent about the language of Pundra-vardhana or Karna-Suvarna; it can be presumed that the language of these tracts were identical with that of Magadha." {{harv|Chatterji|1926|p=78}}</ref> These changes were likely due to non-Indo-Aryan speakers adopting the language.<ref>"Perhaps this 'differing a little' of the Kamarupa speech refers to those modifications of Aryan sounds which now characterise Assamese as well as North- and East-Bengali dialects." {{harv|Chatterji|1926|pp=78–89}}</ref><ref>"When [the Tibeto-Burman speakers] adopted that language they also enriched it with their vocabularies, expressions, affixes etc." {{harv|Saikia|1997|p=4}}</ref>{{Sfn|Moral|1997|pp=43-53}} The evidence of this language is found in the Prakritisms of the [[Kamarupa inscriptions]] ({{lang|as|কামৰূপৰ শিলালিপি}}).<ref>"... (it shows) that in Ancient Assam there were three languages viz. (1) Sanskrit as the official language and the language of the learned few, (2) Non-Aryan tribal languages of the Austric and Tibeto-Burman families, and (3) a local variety of Prakrit (ie a MIA) wherefrom, in course of time, the modern Assamese language as a MIL, emerged." {{harv|Sharma|1978|pp=xxiv-xxviii}}</ref>{{Sfn|Medhi|1988|pp=67–63}} The earliest forms of Assamese in literature ({{lang|as|অসমীয়া সাহিত্য}}) are found in the ninth-century Buddhist verses called [[Charyapada]] ({{lang|as|চৰ্যাপদ}}), and in 12-14th century works of Ramai Pundit (''Sunya Puran''), Boru Chandidas (''Krishna Kirtan''), Sukur Mamud (''Gopichandrar Gan''), Durllava Mullik (''Gobindachandrar Git'') and Bhavani Das (''Mainamatir Gan''). In these works, Assamese features coexist with features from other Modern Indian Languages.

A fully distinguished literary form (poetry) appeared first in the fourteenth century&mdash;in the courts of the [[Kamata kingdom]] ({{lang|as|কামাতা ৰাজ্য}}) and in the courts of an eastern Kachari king ({{lang|as|কছাৰী ৰজা}}) where [[Madhav Kandali]] ({{lang|as|মাধৱ কন্দলী}}) translated the Ramayana into the Assamese ([[Saptakanda Ramayana]]) ({{lang|as|কৃত্তিবাসী ৰামায়ণ}}). From the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, songs – ''[[Borgeet]]s'' ({{lang|as|বৰগীত}}), dramas – ''[[Ankia Naat|Ankiya Naat]]'' ({{lang|as|অংকীয়া নাট}}) and the first prose writings (by Bhattadeva) were composed. The literary language, based on the western dialects of Assam moved to the court of the [[Ahom kingdom]] ({{lang|as|আহোম ৰাজ্য}}) in the seventeenth century,{{Sfn|Guha|1983|p=9}} where it became the state language. This period saw the widespread development of prose infused with colloquial forms.

According to {{Harvcoltxt|Goswami|2003}}, this included "the colloquial prose of religious biographies, the archaic prose of magical charms, the conventional prose of utilitarian literature on medicine, astrology, arithmetic, dance and music, and above all the standardized prose of the [[Buranji]]s.{{Sfn|Goswami|2003|p=434}} The literary language, having become infused with the eastern idiom, became the standard literary form in the nineteenth century, when the British adopted it for state purposes. As the political and commercial center shifted to Guwahati after the mid-twentieth century, the literary form moved away from the eastern variety to take its current form.
==Phonology==
The Assamese phonemic inventory consists of eight vowels, ten [[diphthongs]], and twenty-one consonants.<ref name="iitg">[http://www.iitg.ernet.in/rcilts/assamese.html Assamese], Resource Centre for Indian Language Technology Solutions, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati.</ref>

===Alveolar stops===
The Assamese phoneme inventory is unique in the Indic group of languages in its lack of a dental-retroflex distinction among the [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] stops.<ref>"Assamese, alone among NIA languages except for Romany, has also lost the characteristic IA dental/retroflex contrast (although it is retained in spelling), reducing the number of articulations, with the loss also of {{IPA|/c/}}, to three." {{harv|Masica|1993|p=95}}</ref> Historically, the [[Dental consonant|dental]] and [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] series merged into [[Alveolar plosive|alveolar stops]]. This makes Assamese resemble non-Indic languages of Northeast India (such as languages from the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]).{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=45}} The only other language to have fronted retroflex stops into alveolars is the closely related eastern dialects of Bengali (although a contrast with dental stops remains in those dialects). Note that {{IPA|/r/}} is normally realized as {{IPA|[ɹ]}} or as a [[retroflex approximant]].
===Voiceless velar fricative===
Assamese and [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] are unusual among Eastern Indo-Aryan languages for the presence of the {{IPA|/x/}} (which, phonetically, varies between velar ({{IPAblink|x}}) and a uvular ({{IPAblink|χ}}) pronunciations, depending on the speaker and speech register), historically the MIA sibilant has [[lenition|lenited]] to {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} (non-initially).<ref>The word "hare", for example: ''śaśka'' (OIA) > ''χɔhā'' (hare).  {{harv|Masica|1993|p=206}}</ref> The derivation of the velar fricative from the coronal sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} is evident in the name of the language in Assamese; some Assamese prefer to write {{angle bracket|Oxomiya}} or {{angle bracket|Ôxômiya}} instead of {{angle bracket|Asomiya}} or {{angle bracket|Asamiya}} to reflect the sound change.<ref>Whereas most fricatives become sibilants in Eastern Goalpariya (''sukh'', ''santi'', ''asa'' in Eastern Goalpariya; ''xukh'', ''xanti'', ''axa'' in western Kamrupi) {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=286}}; some use of the fricative is seen as in the word ''xi'' (for both "he" and "she") {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=287}} and ''xap khar'' (the snake) {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=288}}. The {{IPAslink|x}} is completely absent in Western Goalpariya {{harv|Dutta|1995|p=290}}</ref> The voiceless velar fricative is absent in the West Goalpariya dialects<ref>B Datta (1982), ''Linguistic situation in north-east India'', the distinctive h sound of Assamese is absent in the West Goalpariya dialect</ref> though it is found in lesser extent in East Goalpariya and Kamrupi,<ref>Goswami, Upendranath (1970), ''A Study on Kamrupi'', p.xiii {{IPA|/x/}} does not occur finally in Kamrupi. But in St. Coll. it occurs. In non-initial positions O.I.A sibilants became {{IPA|/kʰ/}} and also {{IPA|/h/}} whereas in St. Coll. they become {{IPA|/x/}}.</ref> otherwise used extensively further east. The change of {{IPA|/s/}} to {{IPA|/h/}} and then to {{IPA|/x/}}; all these have been attributed to Tibeto-Burman influence by [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|Dr. Chatterjee]].<ref>Chatterjee, Suniti Kumar, ''Kirata Jana Krti'',p.54</ref>
===Velar nasal===
Assamese and Bengali, in contrast to other Indo-Aryan languages, use the [[velar nasal]] (the [[English language|English]] ''ng'' in ''sing'') extensively. In many languages, while the velar nasal is commonly restricted to preceding velar sounds, in Assamese it can occur intervocalically.<ref name="iitg"/>  This is another feature it shares with other languages of Northeast India, though in Assamese the velar nasal never occurs word-initially.{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=46}}
===Vowel inventory===
Eastern Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], and Oriya do not have a vowel length distinction, but have a wide set of [[Roundedness|back rounded vowels]]. In the case of Assamese, there are four back rounded vowels that contrast phonemically, as demonstrated by the minimal set: কলা ''kôla'' {{IPA|[kɔla]}} ('deaf'), ক'লা ''kola'' {{IPA|[kola]}} ('black'), কোলা ''kûla'' {{IPA|[kʊla]}} ('lap'), and কুলা ''kula'' {{IPA|[kula]}} ('winnowing fan').  The [[near-close near-back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ʊ/}} is unique in this branch of the language family.
==Writing system==
Modern Assamese uses the [[Assamese script]] and historically [[Kamrupi script]] ({{lang|as|কামৰূপী লিপি}}), a variant that traces its descent from the [[Gupta script]] ({{lang|as|গুপ্ত লিপি}}). It very closely resembles the [[Mithilakshar]] script of the [[Maithili language]], as well as to the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]].{{Sfn|Bara|1981|p=?}} There is a strong literary tradition from early times.  Examples can be seen in edicts, land grants and copper plates of medieval kings.  Assam had its own system of writing on the bark of the ''saanchi'' tree in which religious texts and chronicles were written.  The present-day spellings in Assamese are not necessarily phonetic. ''[[Hemkosh]]'' ({{lang|as|হেমকোষ}}), the second Assamese dictionary, introduced spellings based on [[Sanskrit]] ({{lang|as|সংস্কৃত}}), which are now the standard.
==Morphology and grammar==
The Assamese language has the following characteristic morphological features:{{Sfn|Kommaluri|Subramanian|Sagar K|2005}}
* Gender and number are not grammatically marked.
* There is lexical distinction of gender in the third person pronoun.
* Transitive verbs are distinguished from intransitive.
* The agentive case is overtly marked as distinct from the accusative.
* Kinship nouns are inflected for personal pronominal possession.
* Adverbs can be derived from the verb roots.
* A passive construction may be employed idiomatically.
===Negativization process===
Verbs in Assamese are negativized by adding {{IPA|/n/}} before the verb, with {{IPA|/n/}} picking up the initial vowel of the verb. For example:{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=47}}
* {{IPA|/na laɡe/}} 'do(es) not want' (1st, 2nd and 3rd persons)
* {{IPA|/ni likʰu/}} 'will not write' (1st person)
* {{IPA|/nukutu/}} 'will not nibble' (1st person)
* {{IPA|/nɛlɛkʰɛ/}} 'does not write' (3rd person)
* {{IPA|/nɔkɔɹɔ/}} 'do not do' (2nd person)

===Classifiers===
Assamese has a huge collection of classifiers, which are used extensively for different kinds of objects, acquired from [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].{{Sfn|Moral|1997|pp=49-51}}

In Assamese, classifiers are generally used in the ''numeral + classifier + noun'' (e.g. {{IPA|/ezɔn manuh/}} 'one man') or the ''noun + numeral + classifier'' (e.g. {{IPA|/manuh ezɔn/}} 'one man') forms.
===Nominalization===
Most verbs can be converted into nouns by the addition of the suffix {{IPA|/ɔn/}}.  For example, {{IPA|/kʰa/}} ('to eat') can be converted to /kʰaɔn/ ('good eating').{{Sfn|Moral|1997|p=48}}
==Dialects==
{{Assamese/Asamiya literature}}
===Regional dialects===
The language has quite a few regional variations. Banikanta Kakati ({{lang|as|বাণীকান্ত কাকতি}}) identified two broad [[dialect]]s which he named (1) Eastern and (2) Western dialects,<ref>"Assamese may be divided dialectically into Eastern and Western Assamese" {{harv|Kakati|1941|p=16}}</ref> of which the eastern dialect is homogeneous, and prevalent to the east of Guwahati, and the western dialect is heterogeneous. However, recent linguistic studies have identified four dialect groups listed below from east to west:<ref name="iitg"/>
* '''Eastern group''' in and around [[Sivasagar district|Sivasagar District]], i.e., the regions of the former undivided Sivasagar district, areas of the present day [[Golaghat]], [[Jorhat]] and Sivasagar
* '''Central group''' in [[Nagaon]], [[Sonitpur]], Morigaon districts and adjoining areas
* '''[[Kamrupi dialect|Kamrupi]] group''' primarily in the [[Kamrup region]] ({{lang|as|কামৰূপী উপভাষা}})
* '''[[Goalpariya dialect|Goalpariya]] group''' in the [[Goalpara region]] ({{lang|as|গুৱালপাৰীয়া উপভাষা}})
===Non-regional dialects===
Assamese does not have caste- or occupation-based dialects. In the nineteenth century, the Eastern dialect became the standard dialect because it witnessed more literary activity and it was more uniform from east of Guwahati to Sadiya,{{Sfn|Kakati|1941|p=14-16}} whereas the western dialects were more heterogeneous.{{Sfn|Goswami|2003|p=436}} Since the nineteenth century, the center of literary activity (as well as of politics and commerce) has shifted to Guwahati; as a result, the standard dialect has evolved considerably away from the largely rural Eastern dialects and has become more urban and acquired western dialectal elements.<ref name="Dutta2003p106">{{harv|Dutta|2003|p=106}}</ref> Most literary activity takes place in this dialect, and is often called the ''likhito-bhaxa'', though regional dialects are often used in novels and other creative works.

In addition to the regional variants, sub-regional, community-based dialects are also prevalent, namely:
* '''Standard dialect''' influenced by surrounding centers.
* '''''Bhakatiya'' dialect''' highly polite, sattra-based dialect with a different set of nominals, pronominals and verbal forms, as well as a preference for euphemism; indirect and passive expressions.{{Sfn|Goswami|2003|pp=439-440}} Some of these features are used in the standard dialect on very formal occasions.
* The fisherman community has a dialect that is used in the central and eastern region.

==Literature==
{{main|Assamese literature}}
There is a growing and strong body of literature in this language.  The first characteristics of this language are seen in the [[Charyapada]]s composed in between the eighth and twelfth centuries.  The first examples emerged in writings of court poets in the fourteenth century, the finest example of which is Madhav Kandali's [[Saptakanda Ramayana]]. The popular ballad in the form of Ojapali is also regarded as well-crafted.  The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw a flourishing of [[Vaishnavite]] literature, leading up to the emergence of modern forms of literature in the late nineteenth century.
