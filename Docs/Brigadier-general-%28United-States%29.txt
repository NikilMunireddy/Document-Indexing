In the [[United States Armed Forces]], '''brigadier general''' ('''BG''', '''Brig Gen''', or '''BGen''') is a [[1 star rank|one-star]] [[general officer]] with the [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|pay grade]] of O-7 in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. Brigadier general ranks above a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and below [[Major general (United States)|major general]]. The rank of brigadier general is equivalent to the rank of [[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral (lower half)|rear admiral (lower half)]] in the other [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]].

==History==
The rank of brigadier general has existed in the U.S. military since the inception of the [[Continental Army]] in June 1775. To prevent mistakes in recognizing officers, a general order was issued on July 14, 1775, establishing that brigadier generals would wear a ribband, worn across the breast, between coat and waistcoat, pink in color.<ref name=TIOH-OfficerRanks>{{cite web|title=Officer Insignia of Rank - Origin|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Insignia_Rank/insignia_origin.aspx|work=The Institute of Heraldry|publisher=Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army|accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>  Later, on June 18, 1780, it was prescribed that brigadier generals would instead wear a single silver star on each epaulette.<ref name=TIOH-OfficerRanks/>  At first, brigadier generals were [[infantry]] officers who commanded a [[brigade]]; however, over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the responsibilities of the rank expanded significantly.

During the period from March 16, 1802, to January 11, 1812, the rank of major general was abolished and brigadier general became the highest rank in the U.S. Army.  Foreseeing the need for an expanded general staff in case of war, which seemed imminent, Congress restored the rank of major general in January 1812.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=169 Memory.loc.gov],</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=708 Act of January 11, 1812, ch. 14, 2 Stat. 671]</ref>

The first brigadier general in the U.S. Marine Corps was [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] [[Archibald Henderson]], [[Brevet (military)|brevetted]] to the rank of brigadier general in the 1830s for his service in the [[Second Seminole War]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The first non-brevet brigadier general in the Marines was Commandant [[Jacob Zeilin]] who was promoted to the rank in 1874, but when he retired in 1876, colonel once again became the highest rank in the Marines until March 1899 when Commandant [[Charles Heywood]] was promoted. Ever since then the office of commandant has been held by a general officer, with the permanent rank of the commandant raised to major general in 1908, then to lieutenant general, then to general during World War II, which rank it has held ever since.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The insignia for a brigadier general is one silver star worn on the shoulder or collar, and has not changed since the creation of the rank two centuries ago. Since the [[Mexican-American War]], however, the lower rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] has been the normal rank appointed to command a brigade that is organic to a division (''e.g.'', the 1st Brigade of the [[94th Infantry Division (United States)|94th Infantry Division]], vice the [[187th Infantry Brigade (United States)|187th Infantry Brigade]]).

Today, an [[United States Army|Army]] or [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] "BG" or "BGen," respectively, typically serves as deputy commander to the commanding general of a [[division (military)|division]] or division-sized units and assists in overseeing the planning and coordination of a mission. In an infantry brigade not organic to a division, a brigadier general serves as the unit's commander, while a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] serves as [[executive officer|deputy commander]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} An [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] brigadier general typically commands a large [[wing (air force unit)|wing]]. Additionally, one-star officers of all services may serve as high-level staff officers in large military organizations.

==Statutory limits==
U.S. Code of law explicitly limits the total number of general officers who may be on active duty. The total of active duty general officers is capped at 230 for the Army, 60 for the Marine Corps, and 208 for the Air Force. The President or Secretary of Defense may increase the number of general slots in one branch, so long as they subtract an equal number from another.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/usc_sec_10_00000526----000-.html 10 U.S.C. ยง 526. Authorized strength: general and flag officers on active duty]</ref> Some of these slots are reserved by statute.

==Promotion, appointment and tour length==
For promotion to the permanent grade of brigadier general, eligible officers are screened by a promotion board consisting of general officers from their branch of service.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000611----000-.html Law.cornell.edu], 10 U.S.C. 611. Convening of selection boards</ref> This promotion board then generates a list of officers it recommends for promotion to general rank.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000616----000-.html Law.cornell.edu], 10 U.S.C. 616. Recommendations for promotion by selection boards</ref> This list is then sent to the service secretary and the joint chiefs for review before it can be sent to the [[President of the United States|President]], through the defense secretary, for consideration.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000618----000-.html Law.cornell.edu], 10 U.S.C. 618. Action on reports of selection boards</ref> The President nominates officers to be promoted from this list with the advice of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the service secretary, and if applicable, the service's chief of staff or commandant.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000624----000-.html Law.cornell.edu], 10 U.S.C. 624. Promotions: how made.</ref> The President may nominate any eligible officer who is not on the recommended list if it serves in the interest of the nation, but this is uncommon.<ref>[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00005149----000-.html Law.cornell.edu], 10 U.S.C. 5149. Office of the Judge Advocate General: Deputy Judge Advocate General; Assistant Judge Advocates General</ref> The Senate must then confirm the nominee by a majority vote before the officer can be promoted. Once the nominee is confirmed, they are promoted to that rank once they assume or hold an office that requires or allows an officer of that rank. For positions of office reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For all three uniformed services, because the grade of brigadier general is a permanent rank, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board. The rank does not expire when the officer vacates a one-star position. Tour length varies depending on the position, by statute, or when the officer receives a new assignment.  The average tour length per one-star billet is two to four years.

== Retirement ==
Other than voluntary retirement, statute sets a number of mandates for retirement. All brigadier generals must retire after five years in grade or 30 years of service, whichever is later, unless selected or appointed for promotion, or reappointed to grade to serve longer.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/10/subtitles/a/parts/ii/chapters/36/subchapters/iii/sections/section_635.html Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com], 10 U.S.C. 635. Retirement for years of service: regular brigadier generals and rear admirals (lower half).</ref> Otherwise all general and flag officers must retire the month after their 64th birthday.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:h5122: thomas.loc.gov], 10 U.S.C. 1253. Age 64: regular commissioned officers in general and flag officer grades; exception.</ref> However, the Secretary of Defense can defer a general or flag officer's retirement until the officer's 66th birthday and the President can defer it until the officer's 68th birthday. Because there are a finite number of General officer positions, one officer must retire before another can be promoted. As a result, General and flag officers typically retire well in advance of the statutory age and service limits, so as not to impede the upward career mobility of their juniors.<ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=529 Defenselink.mil], DoD News Briefing on Thursday, June 6, 1996. Retirement of Admiral [[Leighton W. Smith, Jr.|Leighton W. Smith Jr.]]</ref>
