==History==

===The Olive Tree===
{{Main|The Olive Tree (Italy)}}
In the early 1990s, following ''[[Tangentopoli]]'', the end of the so-called [[History of the Italian Republic|First Republic]] and the transformation of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) into the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] (PDS), a process aimed at uniting left-wing and centre-left forces into a single political entity was started.

In 1995 [[Romano Prodi]], a former [[Italian Minister of Economic Development|minister of Industry]] on behalf of the left-wing faction of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC), entered politics and founded [[The Olive Tree (Italy)|The Olive Tree]] (''L'Ulivo''), a centre-left coalition including the PDS, the [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI), the [[Federation of the Greens]] (FdV), [[Italian Renewal]] (RI), the [[Italian Socialists]] (SI) and [[Democratic Union (Italy)|Democratic Union]] (UD). The coalition, in alliance with the [[Communist Refoundation Party]] (PRC), won the [[Italian general election, 1996|1996 general election]] and Prodi became Prime Minister.

In February 1998 the PDS merged with minor centre-left parties to become the [[Democrats of the Left]] (DS), while in March 2002 the PPI, RI and [[The Democrats (Italy)|The Democrats]] (Prodi's own party, launched in 1999) became [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]] (DL). In the summer of 2003, Romano Prodi suggested that the centre-left forces would participate in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Italy)|2004 European Parliament election]] with a common list. Whereas the [[Union of Democrats for Europe]] (UDEUR) and the far-left parties refused the offer, four parties accepted it: the DS, DL, the [[Italian Democratic Socialists]] (SDI) and the [[European Republicans Movement]] (MRE). They launched a joint list named "United in the Olive Tree" (''Uniti nell'Ulivo'') which ran in the election and garnered 31.1% of the vote. The project was later abandoned in 2005 by the SDI.

In the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]] the list obtained 31.3% of the vote for the Chamber of Deputies.

===Road to the new party===
[[File:Romano Prodi in Nova Gorica (2c).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Romano Prodi]]]]

The project of a "Democratic Party" was often mentioned by Prodi as the natural evolution of The Olive Tree and was envisioned in a 2003 appeal in ''[[Il Foglio]]'' by [[Michele Salvati]], a former centrist deputy of the DS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partitodemocratico.info/UserFiles/File/Documenti/appello_per_un_partito_democratico.pdf |title=Appello |publisher=Partito Democratico|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> The term ''Partito Democratico'' was used for the first time in a formal context by the DL and DS members of the [[Regional Council of Veneto|Regional Council]] of [[Veneto]], who chose to form a joint group named The Olive Tree – Venetian Democratic Party (''L'Ulivo – Partito Democratico Veneto'') in March 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italiadeivalori.antoniodipietro.com/elezioni/europee/curriculum/cv%20franchetto.pdf |title=Franchetto |publisher=Antonio di Pietro|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>

The 2006 election result, anticipated by the 2005 [[Primary elections in Italy|primary election]] in which over four million voters endorsed Prodi as candidate for Prime Minister, gave a push to the project of a unified centre-left party. [[Francesco Rutelli]] and [[Piero Fassino]], party leaders of DL and the DS respectively, scheduled their parties' congresses for April 2007 in order to formally approve the merger.

On 19 April 2007 the DS held their final party congress, during which approximately 75% of party members voted in support of the merger into the PD. The left-wing opposition, led by [[Fabio Mussi]], obtained just 15% of the support within the party. A third motion, presented by [[Gavino Angius]] and supportive of the PD only within the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES), obtained 10% of the vote. During and following the congress, both Mussi and Angius announced their intention not to join the PD and founded a new party called [[Democratic Left (Italy)|Democratic Left]] (SD).

On 22 May 2007 the composition of the organising committee of the nascent party was announced. It featured 45 members, mainly politicians from the two major parties involved in the process, but included also external figures such as [[Marco Follini]], [[Ottaviano Del Turco]], [[Luciana Sbarbati]], [[Renato Soru]], [[Giuliano Amato]], [[Gad Lerner]] and [[Tullia Zevi]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Pd, è nato il comitato dei 45.

Prodi announced each voter would choose between a number of lists, each of them associated with a candidate for secretary.

Eight parties agreed to merge into the PD:
*[[Democrats of the Left]] ([[Social democracy|social-democratic]])
*[[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]] ([[Centrism|centrist]]).
*[[Southern Democratic Party]] (centrist);
*[[Sardinia Project]] (social-democratic);
*[[European Republicans Movement]] ([[Social liberalism|social-liberal]]);
*[[Democratic Republicans (Italy)|Democratic Republicans]] (social-liberal);
*[[Middle Italy (political party)|Middle Italy]] (centrist);
*[[Reformist Alliance]] (social-democratic).

===Party foundation===
{{Main|Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election, 2007}}
All candidates interested in running for the PD leadership had to be associated with one of the founding parties and present at least 2,000 valid signatures by 30 July 2007. A total of ten candidates officially registered their candidacy: [[Walter Veltroni]], [[Rosy Bindi]], [[Enrico Letta]], [[Furio Colombo]], [[Marco Pannella]], [[Antonio Di Pietro]], [[Mario Adinolfi]], [[Pier Giorgio Gawronski]], [[Jacopo Schettini Gherardini|Jacopo Schettini]], [[Lucio Cangini]] and [[Amerigo Rutigliano]]. Of these, Pannella and Di Pietro were rejected because of their involvement in external parties (the Radicals and [[Italy of Values]] respectively), whereas Cangini and Rutigliano did not manage to present the necessary 2,000 valid signatures for the 9pm deadline, and Colombo's candidacy was instead made into hiatus in order to give him 48 additional hours to integrate the required documentation; Colombo later decided to retire his candidacy citing his impossibility to fit with all the requirements.<ref name="colombo_retired">{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/news/ired/ultimora/2006/rep_nazionale_n_2412819.html?ref=hpsbdx3|language=Italian|accessdate=1 August 2007|date=1 August 2007|title= Pd: colombo ritira candidatura|publisher=[[La Repubblica]]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> All rejected candidates had the chance against the decision in 48 hours' time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_128024177.html|language=Italian|accessdate=31 July 2007|date=31 July 2007|title=PD: BOCCIATE CANDIDATURE DI PIETRO E PANNELLA|newspaper=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> with Pannella and Rutigliano being the only two candidates to appeal against it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/news/ired/ultimora/2006/rep_nazionale_n_2417555.html?ref=hpsbdx|language=Italian|accessdate=3 August 2007|date=2 August 2007|title= Pd: collegio garanti decidera' domani su pannella|newspaper=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Both were rejected on 3 August.<ref>[http://www.unionesarda.it/DettaglioCategorizzato/?contentId=11794 L'Unione Sarda<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{wayback|url=http://www.unionesarda.it/DettaglioCategorizzato/?contentId=11794 |date=20070927011856 |df=y }}</ref>

On 14 October 2007 Veltroni was elected leader with about 75% of the national votes in an [[Primary election|open primary]] attended by over three million voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJgxTPLO8A4ALrle9SUxqf_vDDLQ|work=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|title=Italy's Veltroni elected new centre-left party's leader: projections|date=14 October 2007|accessdate=14 October 2007}}</ref> Veltroni was proclaimed secretary during a party's constituent assembly held in [[Milan]] on 28 October 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/27/europe/EU-GEN-Italy-Left-Leader.php|title=Rome Mayor Walter Veltroni pronounced leader of Italy's new Democratic Party|accessdate=28 October 2007|date=27 October 2007|newspaper=International Herald Tribune}}</ref>

On 21 November, the new logo was unveiled; it depicts the party acronym PD with colours reminiscent of the [[Flag of Italy|Italian tricolour flag]] (green, white and red) and features an [[olive branch]], the historical symbol of The Olive Tree. In the words of [[Ermete Realacci]], green represents the ecologist and social-liberal cultures, white is for the Catholic solidarity and red for the socialist and social-democratic traditions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/politica/partito-democratico-15/simbolo/simbolo.html|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|language=Italian|title=Tricolore e ramoscello di ulivo.

===Walter Veltroni===
[[File:Walter Veltroni cropped.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Walter Veltroni]]]]

After the premature fall of the [[Prodi II Cabinet]] in January 2008, the PD decided to run in the next general election alone or at the head of a less diverse coalition. The party proposed to the Radicals and the [[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|Socialist Party]] (PS) to join its lists, but only the Radicals accepted, and formed an alliance with Italy of Values (IdV), which was set to join the PD after the election. The party included many notable candidates and new faces in its lists and [[Walter Veltroni]], who tried to present the PD as the party of the renewal in contrast both with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and the previous centre-left government, ran an intense and modern campaign, which led him to visit all [[provinces of Italy]], but that was not enough.

In the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]] on 13–14 April 2008 the PD–IdV coalition won 37.5% of the vote and was defeated by the [[centre-right coalition]], composed of [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL), [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Movement for the Autonomy]] (46.8%). The PD was able to absorb some votes from the parties of the far left (as also IdV did), but lost voters to the [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre]] (UdC), ending up with 33.2% of the vote, 217 deputies and 119 senators. After the election Veltroni, who was gratified by the result, formed a [[Shadow Cabinet of Italy (2008)|shadow cabinet]]. IdV, excited by its 4.4% which made it the fourth largest party in Parliament, refused to join both the Democratic groups and the shadow cabinet.

The early months after the election were a difficult time for the PD and Veltroni, whose leadership was weakened by the growing influence of internal factions, because of the popularity of Berlusconi and the dramatic rise of IdV in opinion polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archivio.sondaggipoliticoelettorali.it/asp/visualizza_sondaggi.asp?ordine=data|language=Italian|title=List of present electoral political polls|publisher=[[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy]] - Department for Media and Publishing}}</ref> IdV became a strong competitor of the PD and the relations between the two parties became tense. In the [[Abruzzo regional election, 2008|2008 Abruzzo regional election]] the PD was forced to support IdV candidate [[Carlo Costantini]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asca.it/moddettnews.php?idnews=786879&canale=ORA&articolo=ABRUZZO/ELEZIONI:%20IL%20CENTROSINISTRA%20PUNTA%20TUTTO%20SU%20COSTANTINI%20(IDV)|newspaper=[[ASCA (news agency)|ASCA]]|language=Italian|title=ABRUZZO/ELEZIONI: IL CENTROSINISTRA PUNTA TUTTO SU COSTANTINI (IDV)|date=28 October 2008}}</ref> In October Veltroni, who distanced from Di Pietro many times, declared that "on some issues he [Di Pietro] is distant from the democratic language of the centre-left".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_ottobre_19/veltroni_fine_alleanza_dipietro_fc8b7390-9dfb-11dd-b589-00144f02aabc.shtml|newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]]|language=Italian|title=Veltroni: con Di Pietro alleanza finita|date=19 October 2008}}</ref>

===Dario Franceschini===
[[File:Dario Franceschini daticamera.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Dario Franceschini]]]]

In February 2009, after a crushing defeat in the [[Sardinian regional election, 2009|Sardinian regional election]], [[Walter Veltroni]] resigned as party secretary and was replaced by his deputy [[Dario Franceschini]] on an interim basis to guide the party toward the selection of a new stable leader.<ref name=sec>{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090221-italys-left-gets-new-leader-|title=Italy's Left gets new leader|date=22 February 2009|work=[[France 24]]|accessdate=22 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=opposition>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7904052.stm|title=Italian opposition elects leader|accessdate=21 February 2009|date=21 February 2009|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name="opposition"/> Franceschini was elected by the party's national assembly with 1,047 votes out of 1,258. His only opponent [[Arturo Parisi]] won just 92 votes.<ref name=sec/><ref name=opposition/> Franceschini was the first former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] to lead the party.

The [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Italy)|2009 European Parliament election]] was an important test for the PD. Prior to the election, the PD considered offering hospitality to the Socialist Party (PS) and the [[Federation of the Greens|Greens]] in its lists, and proposed a similar pact to [[Democratic Left (Italy)|Democratic Left]] (SD).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asca.it/moddettnews.php?idnews=782165&canale=ORA&articolo=EUROPEE:%20VICINO%20ACCORDO%20PD-VERDI-SOCIALISTI.%20SD%20E%20PRC%20IN%20DIFFICOLTA%27|work=[[ASCA (news agency)|ASCA]]|language=Italian|title=EUROPEE: VICINO ACCORDO PD-VERDI-SOCIALISTI. SD E PRC IN DIFFICOLTA'|date=6 October 2008}}</ref> However, the Socialists, the Greens and Democratic Left decided instead to contest the election together as a new alliance called [[Left Ecology Freedom|Left and Freedom]], which failed to achieve the 4% threshold required to return any MEPs, but damaged the PD, which gained 26.1% of the vote, returning 21 MEPs.

The national congress and the subsequent leadership primary were announced for October. By July three candidates announced their bid: [[Pier Luigi Bersani]], [[Ignazio Marino]] and the outgoing secretary Dario Franceschini.

===Pier Luigi Bersani===

On 8 October 2009 the party's electoral commission released the results of the vote among party members. In the local congresses a 56.4% of party members voted.

In reaction to the election of Bersani, perceived by some moderates as an old-style social democrat, [[Francesco Rutelli]], a long-time critic of the party's course, and other centrists and liberals within the PD left in order to form a new centrist party, named [[Alliance for Italy]] (ApI).

In March 2010 a [[Italian regional elections, 2010|big round of regional elections]], involving eleven regions, took place. The PD lost four regions to the centre-right ([[Piedmontese regional election, 2010|Piedmont]], [[Lazio regional election, 2010|Lazio]], [[Campania regional election, 2010|Campania]] and [[Calabrian regional election, 2010|Calabria]]), and maintained its hold on six ([[Ligurian regional election, 2010|Liguria]], [[Emilia-Romagna regional election, 2010|Emilia-Romagna]], [[Tuscan regional election, 2010|Tuscany]], [[Marche regional election, 2010|Marche]], [[Umbrian regional election, 2010|Umbria]] and [[Basilicata regional election, 2010|Basilicata]]), plus [[Apulian regional election, 2010|Apulia]], a traditionally conservative region where, due to divisions within the centre-right, [[Nichi Vendola]] of SEL was re-elected with the PD's support.

On 16 September 2011 Bersani was invited by [[Antonio Di Pietro]]'s IdV to take part to its annual late summer convention in [[Vasto]], [[Abruzzo]].

===Road to 2013===
{{Main|Italian centre-left primary election, 2012}}
A year after the "pact of Vasto", the relations between the PD and IdV had become tense. IdV and its leader, Antonio Di Pietro, were thus excluded from the coalition talks led by Bersani. To these talks were instead invited SEL, led by [[Nichi Vendola]], and the [[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), led by [[Riccardo Nencini]]. The talks resulted, on 13 October 2012, in the "Pact of Democrats and Progressives" (later known as [[Italy. Common Good]]) and produced the rules for the upcoming [[Italian centre-left primary election, 2012|centre-left primary election]], during which the PD–SEL–PSI joint candidate for Prime Minister in the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general election]] would be selected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/ottobre/14/Via_all_alleanza_Vendola_Monti_co_0_20121014_4443eeb2-15bf-11e2-903c-b15753a44d23.shtml|title=Via all'alleanza Pd-Vendola E su Monti nasce un caso|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=14 October 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/ottobre/13/centrosinistra_ignora_premier_co_0_20121013_ca0569ec-14f5-11e2-9dda-01d6c4c8cc2e.shtml|title=Il centrosinistra "ignora" il premier|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=13 October 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>

In the primary the strongest challenge to Bersani was posed by a fellow Democrat, the 37-year-old mayor of [[Florence]] [[Matteo Renzi]], a [[liberalism|liberal]] moderniser, who had officially launched his leadership bid on 13 September 2012 in [[Verona]], [[Veneto]].<ref name="archiviostorico.corriere.it">{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/settembre/14/Renzi_una_nuova_Italia_cerca_co_8_120914040.shtml |title=Renzi: si fa una nuova Italia E cerca i voti dei delusi pdl|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=14 September 2012|accessdate=2013}}</ref> Bersani launched his own bid on 14 October in his hometown [[Bettola]], north-western [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/ottobre/15/Tortelli_officina_Bersani_ecco_chi_co_0_20121015_b4d02050-1688-11e2-83a6-575099e83361.shtml|title=Tortelli e officina, Bersani: ecco chi sono|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=15 October 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/ottobre/15/Commozione_ricordi_Bettola_dove_segretario_co_0_20121015_b955730a-1688-11e2-83a6-575099e83361.shtml |title=Commozione e ricordi Bettola, dove il segretario è ancora "il Gigi"|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=15 October 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/ottobre/15/sceglie_miti_del_passato_per_co_0_20121015_e0913af8-1688-11e2-83a6-575099e83361.shtml|title=Il Pd sceglie i miti del passato per costruire una nuova identità|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=15 October 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> Other candidates included Nichi Vendola (SEL),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/ottobre/03/Vendola_litigare_Bersani_Casini_co_0_20121003_8fb03318-0d1a-11e2-97d9-0947592124f8.shtml |title=Vendola fa litigare Bersani e Casini|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> [[Bruno Tabacci]] (ApI), and [[Laura Puppato]] (PD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partitodemocratico.it/doc/245681/riscrivi-litalia-parte-la-campagna-per-le-primarie.htm |title="Riscrivi l'Italia": parte la campagna per le primarie|publisher=Partito Democratico|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>

In the meantime, in the [[Sicilian regional election, 2012|2012 regional election]] [[Rosario Crocetta]], a Democrat, was elected President with 30.5% of the vote thanks to the support of the UdC, but the coalition failed to secure an outright majority in the Regional Assembly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/ottobre/30/Sicilia_Crocetta_Balzo_dei_Cinque_co_0_20121030_8dfb8744-2259-11e2-91b3-ea8283365095.shtml|title=La Sicilia a Crocetta Balzo dei Cinque Stelle|newspaper=Corriere Della Sera|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/static/speciale/2012/elezioni/regionali/sicilia.html#risultati|title=Sicilia - Elezioni Regionali 28 ottobre 2012|newspaper=La Repubblica|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> For the first time in 50 years, a man of the left had the chance to govern Sicily.

===2013 general election===
{{Main|Italian general election, 2013|Italian presidential election, 2013|Letta Cabinet}}
[[File:Enrico Letta 2013.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Enrico Letta]]]]

In the election the PD and its coalition fared much worse than expected and according to pollsters predictions. The PD won just 25.4% of the vote for the Chamber of Deputies (–8.0% from 2008) and the centre-left coalition narrowly won the majority in the house over the centre-right coalition (29.5% to 29.3%). Even worse, in the Senate the PD and its allies failed to get an outright majority, due to the rise of the [[Five Star Movement]] (M5S) and the centre-right's victory in key regions, such as [[Lombardy]], [[Veneto]], [[Campania]], [[Apulia]], [[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]] (the centre-right was awarded of the majority premium in those regions, leaving the centre-left with just a handful of elects there). As a result, Bersani, who refused any agreement with the PdL and was rejected by the M5S, failed to form a government.

On 17 April, after an agreement with the centre-right parties, Bersani put forward [[Franco Marini]] as his party's [[Italian presidential election, 2013|candidate for President]] to succeed to [[Giorgio Napolitano]]. However, Renzi, several Democratic delegates and SEL announced that they would not support Marini.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/458388/20130417/italys-bersani-proposes-ex-senate-speaker-as-president.htm |title=Italy's Bersani proposes ex-Senate speaker as president|newspaper=IB Times|date=17 April 2013|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> On 18 April Marini received just 521 votes in the first ballot, short of the 672 needed,<ref name="Parlamento">{{cite web|url=http://parlamento17.camera.it/61|title=Parlamento in seduta comune|publisher=Camera|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> as more than 200 centre-left delegates rebelled.

On 28 April [[Enrico Letta]], the party's deputy secretary and former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]], was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] at the head of a [[Letta Cabinet|government]] based around a [[grand coalition]] including the PdL, [[Civic Choice]] (SC) and the UdC. Letta was the first Democrat to become Prime Minister.

After Bersani's resignation from party secretary on 20 April 2013, the PD remained without a leader for two weeks.

On 11 May 2013 at the national assembly of the party [[Guglielmo Epifani]] was elected secretary with 85.8% of vote. Epifani, secretary-general of the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour]] (CGIL), Italy's largest trade union, from 2002 to 2010, was the first former [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist]] to lead the party. Epifani's mission was to lead the party toward a national congress in October.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://it.reuters.com/article/topNews/idITMIE94A00F20130511|title=Pd, Epifani eletto segretario.

A few weeks after Epifani's election as secretary, the PD had a success in the [[Italian local election, 2013|2013 local elections]], winning in 69 ''[[comune|comuni]]'' (including [[Rome]] and all the other 14 [[Provinces of Italy|provincial]] capitals up for election), while the PdL won 22 and the M5S 1.<ref>[http://www.interno.gov.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/sezioni/sala_stampa/notizie/elezioni/2013_04_15_elencocomuni.html Ministero Dell'Interno - Notizie].

On 9 November Epifani announced that the PD would organise the next congress of the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES) in Rome in early 2014, sparking protests among some of the party's Christian democrats, who opposed PES membership.<ref>{{cite web|author=Redazione Il Fatto Quotidiano |url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/11/09/pd-epifani-organizziamo-congresso-pse-fioroni-allora-torna-la-margherita/772031/ |title=Pd, Epifani: "Organizziamo congresso Pse".

Epifani was however little more than a secretary ''pro tempore'' and, in fact, he frequently repeated that he was not going to run for a full term as secretary in the leadership race that would take place in late 2013, saying that a candidacy by him would be a betrayal of his mandate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://it.ibtimes.com/articles/49828/20130531/guglielmo-epifani-congresso-pd-accuse-grillo-rodota-sono-volgari-e-inammissibili.htm |title=Epifani non si candiderà al Congresso.

In January 2015 [[Sergio Mattarella]], a veteran [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] and founding member of the PD, whose candidacy had been proposed by Renzi and unanimously endorsed by the party's delegates, was elected [[President of Italy]] during a [[Italian presidential election, 2015|presidential election]] triggered by President [[Giorgio Napolitano]]'s resignation.

During Renzi's first year as Prime Minister, several MPs defected from other parties to join the PD. They comprised splinters from SEL (most of whom led by [[Gennaro Migliore]], see [[Freedom and Rights]]), SC (notably including [[Stefania Giannini]], [[Pietro Ichino]] and [[Andrea Romano (politician)|Andrea Romano]]), and the M5S. Consequently, the party increased its parliamentary numbers to 311 deputies and 114 senators by April 2015.<ref name="Camera">{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/leg17/1083|title=Camera.it - XVII Legislatura - Deputati e Organi- Composizione gruppi Parlamentari|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="Senato">{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/Leg17/4244|title=senato.it - Senato della Repubblica senato.it - Variazioni nei Gruppi parlamentari|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> Otherwise, [[Sergio Cofferati]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/15_gennaio_17/cofferati-lascia-partito-democratico-89fe3d22-9e52-11e4-a48d-993a7d0f9d0e.shtml|title=Cofferati lascia il Partito Democratico "Inaccettabile il silenzio del partito"  - Corriere.it|work=Corriere della Sera|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> Giuseppe Civati<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2015/maggio/07/Civati_lascia_non_preoccupa_Ora_co_0_20150507_8f102de6-f47b-11e4-84c6-67555e21b242.shtml|title=Civati lascia.

In the [[Italian regional elections, 2015|2015 regional elections]] Democratic Presidents were elected (or re-elected) in five regions out of seven: [[Enrico Rossi (politician)|Enrico Rossi]] in [[Tuscan regional election, 2015|Tuscany]], [[Luca Ceriscioli]] in [[Marche regional election, 2015|Marche]], [[Catiuscia Marini]] in [[Umbrian regional election, 2015|Umbria]], [[Vincenzo De Luca]] in [[Campania regional election, 2015|Campania]] and [[Michele Emiliano]] in [[Apulian regional election, 2015|Apulia]]. As a result, 16 regions out of 20, including all those of central and southern Italy, were governed by the centre-left, while the opposition Lega Nord led Veneto and Lombardy, and propped up a centre-right government in Liguria.

==Ideology==
[[File:Festa dell'Unità Bologna 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Festa de l'Unità]] in [[Bologna]], 2014.]]

The PD is a [[big tent]] [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] party, influenced by the ideas of [[social democracy]] and the [[Christian left]]. The common roots of the founding components of the party reside in the [[Italian resistance movement]], the writing of [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] and the [[Historic Compromise]], all three events which saw the [[Italian Communist Party]] and [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (the two major forerunners of the [[Democrats of the Left]] and [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]], respectively) cooperate. The [[United States]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]] are also important sources of inspiration.<ref>[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/256172,veltroni-quits-as-leader-of-italys-opposition-democratic-party.html Veltroni quits as leader of Italy's opposition Democratic Party], The Earth Times</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-italy.org/5133/italy-everybody-crazy-obama |title=Italy.

The party stresses national and social cohesion, [[progressivism]], a moderate [[social liberalism]], [[green politics|green]] issues, [[progressive tax]]ation and ([[pro-Europeanism|pro]]-)[[Europeanism]]. In this respect, the party's precursors strongly supported the need of balancing budgets in order to comply to [[Euro convergence criteria|Maastricht criteria]]. Under Veltroni and, more recently, Renzi, the party took a strong stance in favour of constitutional reform and of a new electoral law, on the road toward a [[two-party system]].

===Ideological trends===
The PD is a plural party, including several distinct ideological trends:<ref>{{cite web|author=Sab 17/05/2014 |url=http://politica.nanopress.it/articolo/iscritti-pd-renzi-vince-col-46-7-cuperlo-al-38-4/27451/ |title=Iscritti Pd: Renzi vince col 46,7%, Cuperlo al 38,4% &#124; NanoPress Politica |publisher=Politica.nanopress.it |date=2013-11-18 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref>
*'''[[Social democracy]].''' The bulk of the party, including many former [[Democrats of the Left]], is social-democratic and emphasizes [[labour movement|labour]] and [[social issue]]s. There are however traditional social democrats, led by [[Massimo D'Alema]] (hence ''[[Dalemiani]]'') and [[Pier Luigi Bersani]] (hence ''[[Bersaniani]]''), and [[Third Way]] types, led by [[Walter Veltroni]] (hence ''[[Veltroniani]]'', organised in the [[Democratic Movement (Italy)|Democratic Movement]]). While the former are supportive of [[democratic socialism]] (and thus in favour of a close cooperation with [[Left Ecology Freedom]]), the latter are strongly influenced by [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]] and [[New Labour]] ideas.
*'''[[Christian left]].''' The party includes many [[Christianity|Christian]]-inspired members, most of whom come from the left-wing of the late [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (having later joined [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]]). "Democratic Catholics" are organised in several factions, including [[Enrico Letta]]'s [[360 Association]] (also ''[[Lettiani]]'', mainly [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and [[centrism|centrists]]), [[Giuseppe Fioroni]]'s [[The Populars|Populars]], [[Rosy Bindi]]'s [[Democrats Really]] and the [[Social Christians]] (who adhere to [[Christian socialism]]).
*'''[[Social liberalism]].''' It is endorsed mainly by former members of the [[Italian Republican Party]] and the [[Italian Liberal Party]], who are organised in the [[Liberal PD]] faction.
*'''[[Green politics]].''' It is endorsed mainly by former members of the [[Federation of the Greens]] and other greens, who have jointly formed the [[Democratic Ecologists]].

It is not an easy task to include the trend represented by [[Matteo Renzi]], whose supporters have been known as "Big Bangers", "Now!" or, more frequently, ''[[Renziani]]'', in any of the categories above. The nature of Renzi's [[progressivism]] is a matter of debate and has been linked both to [[liberalism]] and [[populism]].<ref name="ricerca.repubblica.it">{{cite web|author=Concita De Gregorio |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2011/10/31/il-populista-di-centro.html |title=IL POPULISTA DI CENTRO - la Repubblica.it |language=it|publisher=Ricerca.repubblica.it |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref><ref name="ricerca.repubblica.it"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaquotidiano.it/2013/09/06/la-cura-omeopatica-renzi-per-battere-berlusconi/ |title=La cura omeopatica Renzi per battere Berlusconi &#124; Europa Quotidiano |publisher=Europaquotidiano.it |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaquotidiano.it/2013/09/07/troppi-pregiudizi-renzi-non-e-un-populista/ |title=Troppi pregiudizi: Renzi non è un populista &#124; Europa Quotidiano |publisher=Europaquotidiano.it |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studiodostuni.it/index.php/sections/renzi-ovvero-la-svolta-populista-della-sinistra-italiana-di-antonio-dostuni/ |title=BLOG - Renzi, ovvero la svolta populista della sinistra italiana, di Antonio Dostuni - Studio Dostuni |publisher=Studiodostuni.it |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaquotidiano.it/2013/09/27/il-populista-democratico-e-i-suoi-nemici/ |title=Il populista democratico e i suoi nemici &#124; Europa Quotidiano |publisher=Europaquotidiano.it |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref> According to Maria Teresa Meli of ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', Renzi "pursues a precise model, borrowed from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]", comprising "a strange mix (for Italy) of liberal policies in the economic sphere and populism.

===International affiliation===
International affiliation was quite a controversial issue for the PD in its early days and, in fact, it was settled only in 2014.

The debate on which [[European political party]] to join saw the former [[Democrats of the Left]] generally in favour of the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES) and most former members of [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]] in favour of the [[European Democratic Party]] (EDP), a component of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) Group. After the party's formation in 2007, the new party's MEPs continued to sit with the PES and ALDE groups to which their former parties had been elected during the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Italy)|2004 European Parliament election]]. Following the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Italy)|2009 European Parliament election]], the party's 21 MEPs chose to unite for the new term within the [[Political groups of the European Parliament|European parliamentary group]] of the PES, which was renamed the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] (S&D).<ref name="Viola2015">{{cite book|author=Donatella M.

On 15 December 2012 PD leader [[Pier Luigi Bersani]] attended in Rome to the founding convention of the [[Progressive Alliance]] (PA), a nascent [[political international]] for parties dissatisfied with the continued admittance and inclusion of authoritarian movements into the [[Socialist International]] (SI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spd.de/presse/Pressemitteilungen/84228/20121212_gabriel_in_rom.html |title=Sigmar Gabriel in Rom|language=de|publisher=SPD|date=12 December 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/807483.sozialdemokraten-gruenden-neue-internationale.html |title=Sozialdemokraten gründen neue Internationale|newspaper=Neues|date=16 December 2012|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> On 22 May 2013 the PD was a founding member of the PA at the international's official inauguration in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] on the eve of the 150th anniversary of the formation of the [[General German Workers' Association]], the oldest of the two parties which merged in 1875 in order to form the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20130522/49847|title=Social Democrats seek revival on 150th b-day|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>

==Factions==
The PD includes several internal factions, most of which trace the previous allegiances of party members. Factions form different alliances depending on the issues and some party members have multiple factional allegiances.

===2007 leadership election===
{{Main|Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election, 2007}}
After the election, which saw the victory of [[Walter Veltroni]],  the party's internal composition was as follows:
;Majority led by [[Walter Veltroni]] (75.8%)
Three national lists supported the candidacy of Veltroni. The bulk of the former [[Democrats of the Left]] (''[[Veltroniani]]'', ''[[Dalemiani]]'', ''[[Fassiniani]]''), the ''[[Rutelliani]]'' of [[Francesco Rutelli]] (including the [[Theo-Dem]]), [[The Populars]] of [[Franco Marini]], [[Liberal PD]], the [[Social Christians]] and smaller groups ([[Middle Italy (political party)|Middle Italy]], [[European Republicans Movement]], [[Reformist Alliance]] and the [[Reformists for Europe]]) formed a joint-list named "Democrats with Veltroni" (43.7%). The [[Democratic Ecologists]] of [[Ermete Realacci]], together with [[Giovanna Melandri]] and [[Cesare Damiano]], formed "Environment, Innovation and Labour" (8.1%). The [[Democrats, Laicists, Socialists]], [[Say Left]] and the [[Labour Federation (Italy)|Labourites – Liberal Socialists]] presented a list named "[[To the Left]]" (7.7%). Local lists in support of Veltroni got 16.4%.

;Minorities led by [[Rosy Bindi]] (12.9%) and [[Enrico Letta]] (11.0%)
The [[Olivists]], whose members were staunch supporters of [[Romano Prodi]], divided in two camps. The largest one, including [[Arturo Parisi]], endorsed [[Rosy Bindi]], while a smaller one, including [[Paolo De Castro]], endorsed [[Enrico Letta]], as [[Paolo De Castro]]. Bindi benefited also from the support of [[Agazio Loiero]]'s [[Southern Democratic Party]], while Letta was endorsed by [[Lorenzo Dellai]]'s [[Daisy Civic List]], [[Renato Soru]]'s  [[Sardinia Project]] and [[Gianni Pittella]]'s social democrats.

===2009 leadership election===
{{Main|Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election, 2009}}
After the election, which saw the victory of [[Pier Luigi Bersani]],  the party's internal composition was as follows:
;Majority led by [[Pier Luigi Bersani]] (53.2%)
*'''''[[Bersaniani]]''''' and '''''[[Dalemiani]]''''': the social-democratic groups around Bersani and [[Massimo D'Alema]] (who wants the PD to be a traditional centre-left party in the European social-democratic tradition); D'Alema organized his faction as '''[[Reformists and Democrats]]''', welcoming also some ''Lettiani'' and some Populars.
*'''''[[Lettiani]]''''': the centrist group around [[Enrico Letta]], known also as '''[[360 Association]]'''; its members are keen supporters of an alliance with the [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre]], similarly to what also D'Alema proposes.
*'''[[To the Left]]''': the social-democratic and democratic-socialist internal left led by [[Livia Turco]];
*'''[[Democrats Really]]''': the group around [[Rosy Bindi]] and composed mainly of the left-wing members of the late [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]].
*'''[[Social Christians]]''': a Christian social-democratic group, that was a founding component of the [[Democrats of the Left]].
*'''[[Democracy and Socialism]]''': a social-democratic group of splinters from the [[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|Socialist Party]] led by [[Gavino Angius]].

;[[Democratic Area]], minority led by [[Dario Franceschini]] (34.3%)
*'''''[[Veltroniani]]''''': followers of [[Walter Veltroni]], basically social democrats coming from the [[Democrats of the Left]] who support the so-called "majoritarian vocation" of the party, the selection of party candidates and leaders through primaries and a [[two-party system]].
*'''[[The Populars|Populars]]/[[Fourth Phase]]''': heirs of the [[Christian left]] tradition of the [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]] and of the left wing of the late [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]].
*'''''[[Rutelliani]]''''': centrists and liberals gathered around [[Francesco Rutelli]], known also as '''[[Free Democrats (Italy)|Free Democrats]]'''; most of them left after Bersani's victory to form the [[Alliance for Italy]], while a minority ([[Paolo Gentiloni]], [[Ermete Realacci]], etc.) chose to stay.
*'''[[Simply Democrats]]''': a list promoted by a diverse group of leading Democrats ([[Debora Serracchiani]], [[Rita Borsellino]], [[Sergio Cofferati]], [[David Sassoli]] and [[Francesca Barracciu]]) who were committed to renewal in party leadership and cleanliness of party elects.
*'''[[Liberal PD]]''': the liberal (mostly social-liberal) faction of the PD led by [[Valerio Zanone]]; its members have been close to Veltroni and Rutelli.
*'''[[Democratic Ecologists]]''': the green faction of the PD led by [[Ermete Realacci]]; its members have been close to Veltroni and Rutelli.
*'''[[Theo-Dems]]''': a tiny Christian-democratic group representing the right-wing of the party on social issues, albeit being progressive on economic ones; most Theo-Dems, including their leader [[Paola Binetti]], left the PD in 2009–2010 in order to join the UdC or the ApI, while others, led by [[Luigi Bobba]], chose to stay.

;Minority led by [[Ignazio Marino]] (12.5%)
*un-affiliated social liberals, social democrats and supporters of a broad alliance including [[Italy of Values]], the [[Italian Radicals|Radicals]] and the parties to the left of the PD; after the election, most of them joined Marino in an association named [[Change Italy]].
*'''[[Democrats in Network]]''': a social-democratic faction of former ''Veltroniani'' led by [[Goffredo Bettini]].

;Non-aligned factions
*'''[[Olivists]]''': followers of [[Romano Prodi]] who want the party to be stuck in the tradition of [[The Olive Tree (Italy)|The Olive Tree]]; the group, which includes both Christian left exponents and social democrats is led by [[Arturo Parisi]]. Most Olivists supported Bersani, while Parisi endorsed Franceschini.

===2010–2013 developments===
In the summer of 2010 [[Dario Franceschini]], leader of [[Democratic Area]] (the largest minority faction), and [[Piero Fassino]] re-approached with [[Pier Luigi Bersani]] and joined the party majority.<ref name="Corriere 16-09-2010">{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/settembre/16/documento_forse_movimento_Veltroni_scossa_co_9_100916011.shtml |title=Un documento e (forse) un movimento Veltroni dà la scossa ai democratici|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=24 December 2009|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> As a response, [[Walter Veltroni]] formed [[Democratic Movement (Italy)|Democratic Movement]] to defend the "original spirit" of the PD.<ref name="Corriere 16-09-2010"/> In doing this he was supported by 75 deputies: 33 ''[[Veltroniani]]'', 35 [[The Populars|Populars]] close to [[Giuseppe Fioroni]] and 7 former ''[[Rutelliani]]'' led by [[Paolo Gentiloni]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/settembre/17/Veltroni_Bersani_sul_ring_senza_co_8_100917018.shtml |title=Veltroni e Bersani sul ring "Pd senza bussola".

Veltroni and D'Alema had been long-time rivals within the centre-left.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/settembre/24/obiettivo_della_nuova_maggioranza_fare_co_9_100924008.shtml|title=L' obiettivo della nuova maggioranza: fare fuori i due eterni rivali|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=24 December 2009|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>

As of September the party's majority was composed of those who supported Bersani since the beginning (divided in five main factions: ''[[Bersaniani]]'', ''Dalemiani'', ''[[Lettiani]]'', ''[[Democrats Really|Bindiani]]'' and the party's left-wing) and Democratic Area of Franceschini and Fassino. Then, there were two minority coalitions: Veltroni's Democratic Movement (''Veltroniani'', Fioroni's Populars, ex-''Rutelliani'', [[Democratic Ecologists]] and a majority of [[Liberal PD]] members) and [[Change Italy]] of [[Ignazio Marino]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/settembre/19/Mozione_sfiducia_premier_Veltroni_Parisi_co_8_100919040.shtml |title="Mozione di sfiducia al premier" Sì di Veltroni a Parisi, Bersani cauto|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=24 December 2009|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>

According to ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', in November 2011 the party was divided mainly in three ideological camps battling for its soul:
*a [[democratic socialism|socialist]] left: the [[Remake Italy|Young Turks]] (mostly supporters of Bersani, as [[Stefano Fassina]] and [[Matteo Orfini]]);

===Current factions===
As of mid 2015 the main factions within the PD are as follows:
*'''''[[Renziani]].''''' The group around [[Matteo Renzi]], PD leader and Prime Minister, and a [[liberalism|liberal]], [[Third Way]]-oriented and modernising faction. It is thus considered the right-wing of the party, but also represents its majority. ''Renziani'' support a [[two-party system]] and the so-called "majoritarian vocation" of the PD, through the formation of a "party of the nation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/10/22/pd-renzi-vuole-partito-della-nazione-sondaggisti-ma-somma-delle-percentuali-non-vale/1163780/|title=Pd, Renzi punta al Partito della Nazione. "Ma somma delle percentuali non basta" - Il Fatto Quotidiano|author=Giuseppe Alberto Falci|work=Il Fatto Quotidiano}}</ref> Prominent members of the faction are [[Maria Elena Boschi]], [[Graziano Delrio]], [[Lorenzo Guerini]], [[Debora Serracchiani]] and [[Stefano Bonaccini]]. The faction has a [[Christian democracy|Christian-democratic]] section, [[Democratic Space]], which is led by Delrio and Guerini. 
*'''[[Democratic Area]].''' A [[Christian left]]ist faction, whose roots are in the left-wing of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] and the [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]]. Its leader is [[Dario Franceschini]]. 
*'''[[Remake Italy]].''' A social-democratic faction loyal to Renzi. Its most prominent members are [[Matteo Orfini]] and [[Andrea Orlando]].
*'''[[Reformist Area]]/Left.''' Inspired by traditional [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]], it is the main left-wing of the party. It was formed by the majority of ''[[Bersaniani]]'', loyalists former secretary [[Pier Luigi Bersani]]. The faction's leader is [[Roberto Speranza]], who served as the PD's leader in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] from 2013 to 2015; the Reformists often oppose Renzi's politicies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/Pd-a-Roma-iniziativa-sinistra-riformista-speranza-non-diventiamo-struzzi-renzi-sbaglia-64de392a-7c0a-45de-a9df-5081007b50a1.html|title=Pd, assemblea della sinistra riformista a Roma. Speranza: "Matteo sbagli"|work=rainews}}</ref> Other than Speranza and Bersani, the faction notably includes [[Guglielmo Epifani]] and [[Rosy Bindi]].
*'''[[Left is Change]].''' A social-democratic faction led by [[Maurizio Martina]]. Most of its members were affiliated with Reformist Area, but split in order to support Renzi.
*'''[[LeftDem]].''' Led by [[Gianni Cuperlo]], it is the faction to the left of Reformist Area/Left.

==Popular support==
[[File:Italian Regions Party.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Regions of Italy]]: the 15 (out of 20) regions governed by Democratic Presidents are in red.]]

The PD, as previously the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), has its strongholds in [[Central Italy]] and big cities.

The party runs fifteen [[regions of Italy|regions]] out of twenty and the cities of [[Rome]], [[Turin]], [[Bologna]], [[Florence]] and [[Bari]]. It also takes part to the government of the region of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], as well as the cities of [[Milan]] and [[Genoa]].

In the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008]] and [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general elections]] the PD obtained its best results in [[Tuscany]] (46.8% and 37.5%), [[Emilia-Romagna]] (45.7% and 37.0%), [[Umbria]] (44.4% and 32.1%), [[Marche]] (41.4% and 27.7%), [[Liguria]] (37.6% and 27.7%) and [[Lazio]] (36.8% and 25.7%). Democrats are generally stronger in the [[Northern Italy|North]] than the [[Southern Italy|South]], with the sole exception of [[Basilicata]] (38.6% in 2008 and 25.7% in 2013),<ref>http://elezionistorico.interno.it/</ref> where the party has drawn most of its personnel from [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC).<ref>http://www.corriere.it/extra-per-voi/2016/04/19/basilicata-quei-cavalli-tiro-eredi-dc-tutti-potere-giovanissimi-tutti-indagati-74fd36dc-062d-11e6-98ad-d281ab178a74_preview.shtml?reason=unauthenticated&cat=1&cid=tLZcV2L6&pids=FR&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.corriere.it%2Fextra-per-voi%2F2016%2F04%2F19%2Fbasilicata-quei-cavalli-tiro-eredi-dc-tutti-potere-giovanissimi-tutti-indagati-74fd36dc-062d-11e6-98ad-d281ab178a74.shtml</ref>

The [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Italy)|2014 European Parliament election]] gave a thumping 40.8% of the vote to the party, which was the first Italian party to get more than 40% of the vote in a nationwide election since DC won 42.4% of the vote in the [[Italian general election, 1958|1958 general election]]. In 2014, as usual, the PD did better in Tuscany (56.6%), Emilia-Romagna (52.5%) and Umbria (49.2%), but made significant gains in [[Lombardy]] (40.3%, +19.0% from 2009), [[Veneto]] (37.5%, +17.2%) and the South.
