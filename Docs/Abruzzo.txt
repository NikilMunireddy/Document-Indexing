'''Abruzzo''' ({{IPA-it|aˈbruttso|pron}}) is a region of [[Italy]], with an area of 10,763 square km (4,156 sq mi) and a population of 1.3 million. Its western border lies {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Rome]]. The region is divided into the four provinces of [[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], [[Province of Teramo|Teramo]], [[Province of Pescara|Pescara]], and [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]]. Abruzzo borders the region of [[Marche]] to the north, [[Lazio]] to the west and south-west, [[Molise]] to the south-east, and the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the east. Geographically, Abruzzo is divided into a mountainous area to the west, which includes the [[Gran Sasso D'italia]], and a coastal area to the east with beaches on the [[Adriatic sea]]. Abruzzo is considered culturally, linguistically, and historically a region of [[Southern Italy]], although geographically it may also be considered [[Central Italy|central]].<ref name=Felice>Paradosso evidenziato da [[Ignazio Silone]], cfr. {{cite book| author=Costantino Felice| title=Le trappole dell'identità: l'Abruzzo, le catastrofi, l'Italia di oggi | year=2010 | editor=Donzelli | location=Rome | chapter=Quadri ambientali e identità regionale|url = https://books.google.it/books?id=KmB44oQjN2cC&pg=PA85&dq=abruzzo+geografia&hl=it&ei=e7RpTdKJK-Kg4QaBqp3fCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=%22italia%20centrale%22&f=false |accessdate=3 September 2012|page=41|ISBN=978-88-6036-436-4}}</ref> The Italian Statistical Authority ([[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]) deems it to be part of [[Southern Italy]], partially because of Abruzzo's historic association with the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].<ref name=Felice/>

Abruzzo is known as "the greenest region in Europe" as one third of its territory, the largest in [[Europe]],<ref>http://www.laquilacapitale.eu/it/abruzzo-regione-verde-europa.html</ref> is set aside as national parks and protected nature reserves: there are three national parks, one regional park, and 38 protected nature reserves. These ensure the survival of 75% of Europe's living species including rare species, such as the small wading dotterel, [[golden eagle]], Abruzzo chamois, [[Apennine wolf]], and [[Marsican brown bear]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parcoabruzzo.it/pagina.php?id=46|title=Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo Lazio e Molise - Natura - Fauna|publisher=}}</ref> Abruzzo is also home to [[Calderone glacier|Calderone]], Europe's southernmost [[glacier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abruzzoverdeblu.it/?id=9|title=I parchi in Abruzzo|publisher=}}</ref>

Visiting nineteenth-century Italian diplomat and journalist Primo Levi said that “forte e gentile” (strong and gentle) best describes the beauty of the region and the character of its people. "Forte e gentile" has since become the motto of the region and its inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vastospa.it/html/vastesi_nel_%20mondo/abruzzo_forte_e_gentile.htm|title=Abruzzo: Forte e Gentile, definizione di Primo Levi, giornalista e diplomatico, nel sito di vastospa|publisher=}}</ref>

Humans have inhabited Abruzzo since [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] times.  A skeleton from Lama dei Peligni in the province of Chieti has been radiometrically dated to 6,540 bp.<ref>Journal of Anthropological Sciences, "Towards a re-appraisal of the Early Neolithic skeleton from Lama dei Peligni (Abruzzo, Italy" by Miliano Bruner and Giorgio Manzi,  Vol. 81 (2003),  pp. 69–78 (Abruzzo, Italy)</ref>
The name Abruzzo appears to derive from the Latin "[[Praetutii|Aprutium]]", although in [[Outline of ancient Rome|Roman times]] the region was known at various times as Picenum, Sabina et Samnium, Flaminia et Picenum and Campania et Samnium.<ref name = "Wine">{{cite web |url=http://winecountry.it/regions/abruzzo/ |title=WineCountry.it – Abruzzo wine region of Italy |publisher=winecountry.it |accessdate=8 October 2009 }}</ref> This region was known as Aprutium in the Middle Ages arising from four possible sources: it is a corruption of Praetutium, or rather of the name of the people Praetutii, applied to their chief city, Interamnaes, the old [[Teramo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.comuni-italiani.it/13/|title=Italy Guide: Abruzzo Region|work=Comuni-Italiani.it}}</ref>

Until 1963 it was part of the ''[[Abruzzi e Molise|Abruzzi]]'' region with [[Molise]]. The term ''Abruzzi'' derives from the time when the region was part of  the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] and the territory was administered as ''Abruzzo Citeriore'' (Nearer Abruzzo) and ''Abruzzo Ulteriore'' I and II (Farther Abruzzo I and II), that being nearer and farther from Naples, the capital of the kingdom.<ref name = "Wine"/>  Abruzzo Citeriore is present day [[province of Chieti|Chieti province]]. Abruzzo Ulteriore I comprised the [[province of Teramo|Teramo]] and [[province of Pescara|Pescara]] provinces; Abruzzo Ulteriore II is now the Province of [[L'Aquila]]. In this province is found the city of [[Corfinio]] (known as Corfinium in ancient Italy), the chief city of the Paeligni, 7 m. N. of [[Sulmona]] in the valley of the Aternus. The site of the original town is occupied by the village of Pentima. It probably became subject to [[Rome]] in the 4th century BC, though it does not appear in Roman history before the [[Social War (91–88 BC)]], in which it was at first adopted by the allies as the capital and seat of government. It appears also as a fortress of importance in the Civil War, though it resisted [[Caesar]]'s attack for a week (49 BC). These people were honored by [[Caesar]] as citizens of [[Rome]]. It is said that the name "Italia" came from this region because of ancient coins that have been found here that date from about the 1st century BC. These coins have the name "[[Italia]]" on them and are apparently proof of this fact. This theory of the origin of the name "[[Italia]]" is debated by scholars, archaeologists and history itself. There is much consensus however that the name "[[Italia]]" was originally given to the region of modern [[Calabria]] by the ancient [[Greeks]] during their foundation of [[Magna Graecia]] (Greater Greece) in southern Italy around the 8th century BC. It is also said by the Italian Government that Calabria was once called "Italia" by the ancient Greeks in honour of its inhabitants who were known as the "Itali". This occurred hundreds of years before the coins of [[Corfinio]] (Corfinium) were apparently minted. The late archaeologist Massimo Pallottino also claimed that the name was derived from the Italic tribes that settled in modern [[Calabria]]. But it was not until the time of the Roman conquests that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula.

==Geography==
Geographically, Abruzzo is located in [[central Italy]] and [[southern Italy]], stretching from the heart of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]], and includes mainly mountainous and wild land. The mountainous inland is occupied by a vast plateau including [[Gran Sasso]], at {{convert|2912|m|ft}} the highest peak of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and [[Majella|Mount Majella]] {{convert|2793|m|ft}}. The [[Adriatic]] coastline is characterized by long sandy beaches to the north and pebbly beaches to the south.
Abruzzo is well known for its landscapes and natural beauties, parks and nature reserves, characteristic hillside areas rich in vineyards and olive groves, and one of the highest densities of [[Blue Flag beach|blue flag beaches]].<ref>http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/img/depliant/en_AmbienteNatura.pdf</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Lungomare giulianova.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Giulianova]] seaside]]

The Abruzzo region has two types of climate that are strongly influenced by the [[Apennine Mountains]], dividing the climate of the coastal and sub-Apennine hills from the interior's high mountain ranges. Coastal areas have a [[Mediterranean]] climate with hot dry summers and mild winters and rainy hills with a sublittoral climate where temperatures progressively decrease with increasing altitude and precipitation with altitude.<ref>://www.lifeinabruzzo.com/abruzzo-annual-weather-forecast/</ref> Precipitation is also strongly affected by the presence of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] mountain ridges of the region increases with the proportion being more abundant in the field and on the slopes exposed to the west, instead of decreasing towards the east and east-facing slopes. Often the [[Adriatic]] coast are sidelined rainfall from the west to the barrier effect of the Apennines undergoing the action of gentle winds descending from it (or [[Libeccio]]).<ref name="italy-schools.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.italy-schools.com/italy/abruzzo.html|title=The Region Abruzzo|publisher=}}</ref> The minimum annual rainfall, however, are found in some inland valleys, sheltered from much disturbance to the blocking action of mountain ridges, such as the Peligna Valley, or the valley of the river Tirino, which in some places ([[Ofena]], [[Capestrano]]) showed barely {{convert|500|mm|1|abbr=off}}, and not along the coast where it never falls below {{convert|600|mm|1|abbr=off}}, for if [[Teramo]] is relatively little watered by rain ([[Teramo]] less than 800&nbsp;mm), the metre is exceeded in [[Chieti]], reaching maximum levels in the [[Adriatic]], while between [[Ortona]] and [[Vasto]] in [[Costa dei Trabocchi]] decrease again.<ref name="italy-schools.com"/>
The highest rainfall occurs in upland areas on the border with [[Lazio]]; they are especially vulnerable to [[Atlantic]] disturbances. Around {{convert|1500|to|2000|mm|0|abbr=off}} of precipitation is typical (Pescara in 2010 showed a value close to 2800&nbsp;mm).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resources.immobiliarecaserio.com/region-abruzzo/|title=Region Abruzzo|work=Immobiliare Caserio resources}}</ref>

==Flora and fauna==

[[File:Il Gran Sasso d'Italia, il paretone nord.JPG|thumbnail|[[Gran Sasso d'Italia]]]]

As with many Mediterranean regions, Abruzzo's vegetation is characterized by the presence of different Mediterranean ecosystems. The coast and the surrounding areas are characterized by  the presence of typical plants of [[Mediterranean shrubland]], such as myrtle, heather and mastic, while in the hilly areas other species  grow, including olive, pine, willow, oak, poplar, alder, arbutus, broom, acacia, capers, rosemary, hawthorn, licorice and almond trees, interspersed with oak trees. At elevations between {{convert|600|and|1000|m|ft}} there is sub-montane vegetation, mainly characterized by mixed forests of oak and turkey oak, maple and [[hornbeam]]; shrubs include [[dog rose]]  and [[red juniper]]. Elevations between {{convert|1000|and|1900|m|ft}} are dominated by beech trees. In the [[Apennine Mountains]] at elevations above {{convert|2000|m|ft}} species include alpine [[orchid]], mountain juniper, [[Abies alba|silver fir]], black cranberry  and  the Abruzzo [[edelweiss]].

The fauna of Abruzzo is highly varied, including the region's symbol, the  Abruzzo chamois (''[[Rupicapra pyrenaica]] ornata''), which has recovered after risking extinction. Another animal typical of this region is the [[marsican brown bear]], along with [[Canis lupus italicus|Italian wolf]], deer, lynx, roe deer, snow vole, fox, porcupine, wild cat, wild boar, badger, otter and viper.

The natural parks of the region include the [[Abruzzo National Park]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.abruzzo/Eindex.php|title=Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo (in English)|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref> the [[Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park]],<ref>[http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/tourism/index.php?area=1&sez=4&ss=26&lan=en#verde_blu ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> the [[Maiella National Park]]<ref>[http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/tourism/index.php?area=1&sez=4&ss=27&lan=en#verde_blu ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> and the [[Sirente-Velino Regional Park]],<ref>[http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/tourism/index.php?area=1&sez=4&ss=29&lan=en#verde_blu ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> as well as numerous others natural reserves and protected areas.<ref>[http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/tourism/index.php?area=1&sez=4&lan=en&i=1#main ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{See also|Abruzzo (wine)|Tourism in Abruzzo}}

Until a few decades ago, Abruzzo was a region of poverty in [[Southern Italy]]; over the past decades, however, it has developed to such an extent that it has escaped from the spiral of underdevelopment to become the 'first' region of the 'Italian Mezzogiorno'. This confirms its pivotal role in the national [[economic system]]. Since the 1950s, Abruzzo has had steady economic growth.  In 1951, Abruzzo per capita income or GDP was 53% of that of [[Northern Italy]], the nation's richest region. By 1971, Abruzzo was at 65% and, by 1994, per capita income was at 76% of [[Northern Italy]]'s per capita income, giving Abruzzo the highest per capita GDP of [[Southern Italy]] and surpassing the growth of  every other [[Regions of Italy|region of Italy]]. The construction of superhighways from Rome to [[Teramo]] ([[Autostrada A24 (Italy)|A24]]) and [[Rome]] to [[Pescara]] ([[Autostrada A25 (Italy)|A25]]) opened Abruzzo to easy access, state and private investment in the region increased, and Abruzzo  attained higher per capita education levels and greater productivity growth than the rest of the South. As of 2003, Abruzzo's per capita GDP was €19,506 or 84% of the national average of €23,181 and well outpacing that of the South (€15,808).<ref name="bancaditalia.it">http://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/econo/ecore/2012/analisi_s_r/1215_abruzzo;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en</ref> The region's average GDP per capita was approximately 20,100 EUR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT/09/23&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |title=EUROPA – Press Releases – Regional GDP per inhabitant in the EU27, GDP per inhabitant in 2006 ranged from 25% of the EU27 average in Nord-Est in Romania to 336% in Inner London |publisher=Europa.eu |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> 
[[File:Montepulciano d Abruzzo 03 (RaBoe).jpg|left|thumb|150px|Montepulciano grapes.]]
The [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake]] led to a sharp economic slowdown. However, according to statistics at the end of 2010, it seems that the economy of Abruzzo is recovering, despite the negative data regarding employment.<ref name="bancaditalia.it"/> In fact, at the end of 2010, Abruzzo's growth was 1.47%, which placed it fourth among the Italian regions with the highest annual growth rates after [[Lazio]], [[Lombardy]] and [[Calabria]].<ref>http://www.autorita.energia.it/allegati/inglese/annual_report/annual_report_2006.pdf</ref> In 2011 Abruzzo's economic growth was +2.3%, the highest  percentage among the regions of [[Southern Italy]].<ref>http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/44799/1/319155617.pdf</ref> The region is also the richest region of Southern Italy, with a GDP per capita higher than any other region of southern Italy (€21,574).<ref name="italy-schools.com"/> 
[[File:Abruzzo, travel poster for ENIT (LOC cph.3g12505).jpg|thumb|150px|Travel poster from the 1920s.]]
Abruzzo's [[Secondary sector of the economy|industrial sector]] expanded rapidly, especially in [[mechanical engineering]], transportation equipment  and telecommunications.<ref name="eib.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.eib.org/attachments/efs/eibpapers/eibpapers_2000_v05_n01/eibpapers_2000_v05_n01_a03_en.pdf |title=Abruzzo and Sicily: Catching up and lagging behind, EIB Papers vol. 5, No. 1 (2000) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> The structure of production in the region reflects the transformation of the economy from agriculture to industry and services. Although industry has developed strongly, it retains weak points due to the existence of only a few large businesses alongside a huge fabric of small and medium-sized businesses. Both pure and [[research|applied research]] are carried out in the region, where there are major institutes and factories involved in research in the fields of [[pharmaceutics]], [[biomedicine]], [[electronics]], [[aerospace]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The industrial infrastructure is spread throughout the region in industrial zones which have already been mentioned, the most important of which are Val Pescara, Val Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino. A further activity worthy of note is seaside and mountain tourism, which is of considerable importance to the economy of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf1_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> Agriculture, involving small holdings, has succeeded in modernising and offering high-quality products. The mostly small, agricultural holdings produce wine, [[cereals]], [[sugar beet]], potatoes, [[olives]], vegetables, fruit and [[dairy product]]s. Traditional products are [[saffron]] and [[liquorice]]. Most famous in the world is Abruzzo's wine [[Montepulciano d'Abruzzo]]; in the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as being one of the most widely exported DOC classed wine in Italy.<ref name="Vino Italiano">J. Bastianich & D. Lynch ''Vino Italiano'' pg 280–283 Crown Publishing 2005 ISBN 1-4000-9774-6</ref>

In the past decade, tourism has increased, in particular concerning internal and European arrivals. Abruzzo is world famous for his wildlife parks ([[Abruzzo National Park]], [[Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park]], [[Maiella National Park]]) and regional park (Sirente Velino) and 38 protected areas between oasis, regional reserves and state reserves and also in the inland mountainous region has several ski resorts equipped; also coastal tourism and resort is very developed, in particular be mentioned the [[Trabocchi Coast]], a very picturesque stretch of coastline known for the ancient fishing machines that can still be seen by tourists. Abruzzo's wealth of castles and medieval towns, especially around the town of [[L'Aquila]], has earned it in some quarters the nickname of "Abruzzoshire", by analogy with the "[[Chiantishire]]", nickname sometimes used to refer to the [[Chianti]] area of [[Tuscany]], but Abruzzo is still off the beaten path for most visitors to Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/abruzzo.html|title=Abruzzo|work=Italian Tourism Official Website}}</ref>

Although the population density of Abruzzo has increased over the last decades, it is still well below the Italian national average: in 2008, 123.4 inhabitants per km2, compared to 198.8. At the province level, the density is varied: {{As of|2008|lc=y}} [[Province of Pescara|Pescara]] is the most densely populated with 260.1 inhabitants per km2, whereas L'Aquila is the least densely populated with 61.3 inhabitants per km2, although it has the largest area. After decades of emigration from the region, the main feature of the 1980s is the immigration from third world countries. The population increase is due to the positive net migration, as since 1991 more deaths than births were registered in Abruzzo (except for 1999, when their number was equal).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/index.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref>  In 2008, the Italian [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|national institute of statistics]] ISTAT estimated that 59,749 foreign-born immigrants live in Abruzzo, equal to 4.5% of the total regional population.

The most serious demographic imbalance is between the mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, [[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement of the population of Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanisation of the entire coastal strip especially in the [[province of Teramo]] and [[province of Chieti|Chieti]]. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and a demographic ageing, reflected by an activity rate in the [[province of L'Aquila]] which is the lowest of the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation as a result of the absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, on the other hand, there is such a jumble of accommodation and activities that the environment has been changed with negative effects. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which ([[Vasto]], [[Avezzano]], [[Carsoli]], [[Gissi]], [[Val Vibrata]], [[Val di Sangro]]) have made genuine progress, while others ([[Val Pescara]], [[L'Aquila]]) have run into trouble after initial success. The zones of [[Sulmona]] and [[Guardiagrele]] have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

===Main settlements===
[[L'Aquila]] is both the capital city of the Abruzzo region and of the [[Province of L'Aquila]] and second largest city (pop. 73,000).  [[L'Aquila]] was hit by an [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|earthquake]] on 6 April 2009 which destroyed much of the city centre. The other provincial capitals are  [[Pescara]], which is Abruzzo's largest city and major port (pop. 123,000); [[Teramo]] (pop. 55,000) and [[Chieti]] (pop. 55,000). Other large municipalities in Abruzzo include  [[Avezzano]] (pop.41,000), an industrial and [[high tech]]nology center, [[Vasto]] (population 40,636), [[Lanciano]] (population 36,000), and [[Sulmona]] (population 25,000) are three important industrial and touristic centers.

===Airports===
*[[Abruzzo International Airport]] is the only international airport in the region. Open to civilian traffic since 1996, has seen over the years more and more increase the number of transit passengers thanks to the airlines and low-cost flights. Today, the airport has a catchment area of over 500,000 passengers annually and connects the city of [[Pescara]] and the entire region with many [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Europe]]an destinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abruzzoairport.com/default.aspx?lang=en |title=Abruzzo International Airport - flights information Pescara, Abruzzo, Italy |publisher=Abruzzoairport.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

===Ports===

[[File:Pescara Porto 2002 by-RaBoe 01.jpg|The [[port of Pescara]]. | thumb | 280px | right]]
There are four main ports in Abruzzo: [[Port of Pescara|Pescara]], [[Ortona]], [[Vasto]] and [[Giulianova]].

Over the years the [[Port of Pescara]] became one of the most important tourist ports of [[Italy]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Heavily damaged in World War II, it underwent some 60 years of major restoration and was reborn as a modern marina with advanced moorings and shipbuilding facilities. It has been honored with the [[European Union]]'s blue flag for the quality of services offered. The [[port of Pescara]] has lost passenger traffic because of its shallowness and silting, but its fishery and [[aquaculture]] activities are thriving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinape.com/eng/index.aspx |title=Marina of Pescara |publisher=Marinape.com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

===Railways===
There is a significant disparity between the railways of the Abruzzo coast and the inland areas, which badly need modernisation to improve the service, in particular the [[Rome]]-[[Pescara]] line. Some services have schedules similar to those of a century ago. The situation is so bad that often it is faster to travel by road, normally bus.

Existing railway lines:

* '''[[Adriatic railway]]''' (through the whole of Italy from north to south, along the [[Adriatic Sea]]): The question that interests the Abruzzo region is included in the Towns of [[Martinsicuro]] and [[San Salvo]]. Unless, that delimit the borders with [[Marche]] and [[Molise]] regions, namely, the {{convert|113|km|2|abbr=on}} between the stations of intercurrent [[Alba Adriatica]]-[[Nereto]]-[[Controguerra]] and [[San Salvo]]. The interchanges are made by the respective railway lines [[Giulianova]] [[Teramo]] and [[Pescara]]-[[Rome]].
* '''Train [[Rome]] – [[Sulmona]] – [[Pescara]]''': [[Pescara]]-[[Rome]] railway line is along the railway line [[Bologna]]-[[Bari]] on the [[Adriatic|Adriatic sea]] other line is important because through the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] coast, passing through the provinces of [[Pescara]], [[Chieti]] and [[L'Aquila]] and ends the path to [[Roma Tiburtina railway station]]. The railway, which covers the Abruzzo Region, extends for  {{convert|170|km|mi}}, ranging from municipalities to the province of [[Pescara]] [[Carsoli]], [[Oricola]] and [[Pereto]]. The infrastructure in question is the following interchanges: [[Sulmona]], [[Isernia]], [[Terni]] - [[Sulmona]], [[Avezzano]]- [[Roccasecca]], [[Bologna]] and [[Bari]].
* '''[[Sulmona]] – [[Carpinone]]''': the infrastructure in question is a continuation to the south of [[Terni]]-[[Sulmona]], as part of the intermediate cross-[[Pescara]] - [[Naples]]. After that [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]] is the highest railway station in [[Italy]], whose tortuous path, characterized by steep slopes, passing through the station [[Rivisondoli]]-[[Pescocostanzo]] and wedges in the [[Abruzzo National Park]] and the [[Maiella]]. The line is the interchanges of railway lines [[Rome]]-[[Pescara]] and [[Sulmona]] – [[L'Aquila]] – [[Rieti]] – [[Terni]]. Reached [[Carpinone]], divides west to east to [[Benevento]] and [[Caserta]].
* '''[[Sulmona]] – [[Terni]]''': Trafficking in question connects the regions of [[Umbria]], [[Lazio]], Abruzzo and [[Molise]] and then along the line-[[Carpinone]] [[Sulmona]]. It therefore crosses the inner Abruzzo, finding interchanges [[Avezzano]] and [[Pescara]]-[[Rome]]-[[Roccasecca]], in their respective provinces of [[L'Aquila]], [[Terni]] and [[Rieti]]. It concerns a type of regional traffic in that, across the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] perpendicular colleague Abruzzo, [[Umbria]], [[Lazio]] and [[Molise]]. The question of interest is included in the Abruzzo town of [[Sulmona]] and [[Tornimparte]] and more precisely in the stations {{convert|75|km|mi}} intercurrent [[Sulmona]] and saddle horn.
* '''[[Avezzano]] railroad – [[Roccasecca]]''': infrastructure test starts on the track in the town of Avezzano, crosses the territory of Marsica, passes through the valley and Bush get into the [[Lazio]] region, in the town of [[Sora, Lazio|Sora]]. Her journey ends in the town of Roccasecca which marks the end of [[Lazio]] and the entry in the [[Campania]] region towards [[Cassino]]. Therefore, the only online exchange that meets the railway line is [[Pescara]] – [[Rome]] station [[Avezzano]].
* '''[[Giulianova]] – [[Teramo]]''' (a branch railway line [[Adriatic]] you forward towards the interior until [[Teramo]]) railway line [[Giulianova]] - [[Teramo]], the network is complementary to the [[Adriatic]], fulfilling a liaison function between the capital and the coast. Therefore, the only rail interchange is characterized by the Adriatic railway line [[Bologna]] – [[Bari]], Abruzzo is [[Martinsicuro]] rail-Broad-[[San Salvo]]. With its {{convert|24|km|mi}} journey infrastructure is the result, a SS80 along the path to the location of the industrial districts of [[Teramo]], before merging the SS 16 that accesses the port [[Giulianova]].
*'''Sangritana ([[Lanciano]] – [[Castel di Sangro]])''': The infrastructure in question are an important transition between the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] and [[Adriatic Sea]], as in [[Pescara]] station meets the respective points of connection of the FS [[Bologna]] – [[Bari]] and [[Pescara]] – [[Rome]], while that of [[Sulmona]], [[L'Aquila]] lines FS – [[Terni]] and [[Sulmona]] – [[Carpinone]]. This position transition, attributed to the infrastructure an important strategic military role in [[World War II]], a stage when the bombing of the German armed forces air, marked the temporary suspension of the subject line of repair work. Like other regional railways direct [[L'Aquila]], [[Sulmona]] and [[Roccasecca]], through a circuitous route mountain typically characterized by steep slopes, although in terms of localization of production facilities is to signal the passage of the railway in the industrial area of Valle del Sangro .

===Highways===
[[File:Ponte Salinello.jpg|thumb|Salinello Bridge on the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14]] ]]

Road and motorway networks in the Abruzzo region are relatively well developed, there are three highways that serve the region:
* '''[[Autostrada A24 (Italy)|Highway A24]] [[Rome]] – [[L'Aquila]] – [[Teramo]]''', was built in the 70s and connects [[Rome]] with [[Lazio]] and more specifically to the Abruzzo [[Teramo]] via [[L'Aquila]], performs an important liaison function of the region, both [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] to the [[Adriatic]], due to the presence of several knots of connection roads and highways. The [[Traforo del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso tunnel]], the longest road tunnel entirely on Italian territory, was opened in 1984. It connects [[L'Aquila]] and [[Teramo]] on the [[Autostrada A24 (Italy)|A24]] making the northern Abruzzo coast reachable within two hours from [[Rome]].
Numerous infrastructure connecting adjacent junction as directional Torano it branches in the [[Autostrada A25 (Italy)|A25]] to [[Pescara]], [[Teramo]] to [[Giulianova]] on SS80, SS81 to [[Chieti]] and on the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14]] [[Bologna]]-[[Taranto]], exit on the freeway [[Rieti]] Valley Jump -[[Terni]], exit west on SS80 to [[L'Aquila]]-[[Teramo]], near [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]] and the connection to the [[Autostrada A1 (Italy)|A1]] motorway allows easy connections with [[Naples]] and [[Milan]], the highway construction has contributed greatly to the economic development of the region .
* '''[[Autostrada A25 (Italy)|Highway A25]] Torano – [[Avezzano]] – [[Pescara]]''' allows the connection between [[Rome]] and [[Pescara]], as of the release of Torano begins its journey where it intersects with the [[Autostrada A24 (Italy)|A24]], flows in the Conca del Fucino exceeds the [[Apennine Mountains|Abruzzo Apennines]] coming to Peligna Valley and ends at 'exit [[Pescara]]-Villanova to join the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14]].
* '''[[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|Motorway A14]] [[Bologna]] – [[Taranto]]''' said the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14]] "Adriatica" includes {{convert|743|km|2|abbr=on}} of route, including the cities of [[Bologna]] and [[Taranto]]. Inaugurated in 1965 is now a major tourist infrastructure, as through the coastal towns of [[Emilia Romagna]], [[Marche]], Abruzzo, [[Molise]] and [[Puglia]]. Abruzzo is the infrastructure in question, including the toll of South Broad and Val Vibrata, which mark the border with the [[Marche]] and [[Molise]]. Regarding the links, the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14]] meets the SS16 and the SS652 Bottom Sangro Valley near Broad and SS80 in [[Giulianova]].

[[File:Castello di Roccascalegna.JPG|thumb|left|[[Roccascalegna]] fortress]]
[[File:Borgo di scanno.jpg|thumb|Medieval village of [[Scanno, Abruzzo|Scanno]]]]
Abruzzo holds many of Italy's best-preserved medieval and Renaissance hill towns that rival those in [[Umbria]] and [[Tuscany]]. Abruzzo boasts indeed twenty of [[The most beautiful villages in Italy]],  2nd only to [[Umbria]] which has 22.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borghitalia.it/?lang=en|title=I Borghi più belli d'Italia|publisher=}}</ref> These awards are not just for aesthetic beauty but also are for art and culture, historical importance and livability. The abrupt decline of Abruzzo's agricultural economy in the early to mid-20th-century saved some of the region’s most beautiful hill towns from the onslaught of modern development. Many lie entirely within regional and [[national park]]s.
Among the most well preserved  are [[Castel del Monte (Abruzzo)|Castel del Monte]] and [[Santo Stefano di Sessanio]], which lie in the  [[Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park|Gran Sasso National Park]]  on the edge of the high plain of [[Campo Imperatore]] and nestled beneath the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]’ highest peaks; both hill towns, which were ruled by the [[House of Medici|Medicis]] for over a century-and-a-half, have relatively little tourism. Between the two towns sits [[Rocca Calascio]], the ruin of an ancient fortress popular with film makers. Both [[Monteferrante]] and [[Roccascalegna]] are two best-representing Abruzzo villages in the [[province of Chieti]]. Within the [[Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park|Gran Sasso National Park]] is also found [[Castelli (Teramo)|Castelli]], an ancient pottery center whose artisans produced ceramics for most of the [[dynasty|royal house]]s of [[Europe]]. [[Civitella del Tronto]] played a crucial role in the history of the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]]. The fortress of [[Civitella del Tronto|Civitella]] is today the most visited monument in the whole Abruzzo region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cultura/speciali/2010/visioni-d-italia/notizie/3civitella-del-tronto-Serenissimi-e-borbonici-insieme-per-disfare-l-Italia_b3bc7456-550c-11df-a414-00144f02aabe.shtml|title=Serenissimi e borbonici insieme per disfare l'Italia|publisher=}}</ref> Other medieval hill towns located fully within Abruzzo's [[park system]] are [[Pacentro]] in the [[Maiella National Park]] and [[Pescasseroli]] in the [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo National Park]]. [[Pacentro]], which features a 14th-century castle with two intact towers, has been little touched by modernization. The Shrine of [[Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows]], in the [[province of Teramo]], with average of 2 million visitors per year is one of the 15 most visited sanctuaries in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turismo.provincia.teramo.it/art-and-culture/churches/shrine-of-saint-gabriele-dell92addolorata-96-isola-del-gran-sasso/?set_language=en|title=Shrine of Saint Gabriele dell’Addolorata – Isola del Gran Sassoo|publisher=turismo.provincia.teramo.it}}</ref> [[Capestrano]], a small characteristic town in the [[province of L'Aquila]], is the hometown of Saint [[John of Capistrano]], [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan]] [[friar]] and [[Catholic priest]], as well as the namesake of the Franciscan [[List of Spanish missions|mission]]s  [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|San Juan Capistrano]] in [[Southern California]], the mission [[Mission San Juan Capistrano (Texas)]] and the city of [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]] in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].

The proximity to [[Rome]], the protected natural reserves and landscapes which award the region as the greenest in [[Europe]], the presence of some of the most beautiful Italian villages, its rich and heterogeneous gastronomy along with a long history of deep-rooted local tradition and authentic [[Italian culture]] make Abruzzo rank fifth among the Italian regions by tourist arrivals after [[Calabria]], [[Marche]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Trentino]]. In 2010, arrivals totalled 6,381,067 Italian and 925,884 foreign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/48501 |title=Movimento dei clienti negli esercizi ricettivi – Dati definitivi |deadurl=no |accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref>

In 2015, the [[United States of America|American]] organization [http://www.liveandinvestoverseas.com Live and Invest Overseas] included Abruzzo in the list of [http://www.liveandinvestoverseas.com/retirement-living/our-editors-picks-for-best-places-to-retire-overseas.html World's Top 21 Overseas Retirement Havens].

===Universities===
[[File:Chieti 2011 by-RaBoe 001.jpg|thumb|right|Campus of University "Gabriele d'Annunzio"]]
There are three universities in the Abruzzo region:
* [[University of L'Aquila]]
* [[University of Chieti|University "G. d'Annunzio" of Chieti and Pescara]]
* [[University of Teramo]]

[[Harvard University]] bases an intensive summer Italian language and culture program in [[Vasto]], a [[resort town]] on Abruzzo's southern coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.summer.harvard.edu/programs/abroad/abruzzo/|title=Harvard Summer Program in Umbria and Abruzzo, Italy|publisher=}}</ref>

===Dialects===
The regional accents of Abruzzo include Teramano, Abruzzese Orientale Adriatico and Abruzzese Occidentale. The first two form part of the dialect of [[southern Italy]] also known simply as "Neapolitan" due to the region having been part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]], while the Italian of [[province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila Province]] is related to the Osco-Umbro dialect of [[central Italy]], including the one of [[Rome]].
The dialects spoken in the Abruzzo region can be divided into three main groups:

* Sabine dialect, in the province of [[L'Aquila]] (central Italian dialects)
* Abruzzo Adriatic dialect, in the province of [[Teramo]], [[Pescara]] and [[Chieti]], that is virtually abandoned in the province of [[Ascoli Piceno]] (southern Italian dialects)
* Abruzzo western dialect, in the province of [[L'Aquila]] (southern Italian dialects)

Renowned for its variety and richness due to the heterogeneity of its territory, Abruzzo's cuisine is among the best in [[Italy]]. In 2013 an Italian organization [[Confesercenti]] survey of foreign tourists showed that Abruzzo is the best Italian region to eat in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bompensaoliveoil.com/e-labruzzo-la-regione-dove-si-mangia-meglio/|title=È l’Abruzzo la regione dove si mangia meglio - Bompensa Oleificio e Azienda Agricola|work=Bompensa Oleificio e Azienda Agricola}}</ref> Both the agricultural and coastal aspects of Abruzzo have contributed to its cuisine. Due to the mountains, much of Abruzzo was isolated from international influence until the 20th century. As a result, the region’s cuisine remained unique.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mariobatali.com/abruzzo/|title=Abruzzo|work=MarioBatali.com}}</ref>

===Popular dishes===
One of the most popular regional dishes is [[List of Italian dishes#Abruzzo and Molise|maccheroni alla chitarra]] which is made by pressing or cutting [[pasta]] through a ''chitarra'', an implement to form long thin noodles similar to [[spaghetti]]. The pasta is served with a tomato-based sauce, often flavored with [[Bell pepper|peppers]], [[pork]], [[goose]], or [[Lamb and Mutton|lamb]].  This dish is complimented by regional [[side dish]]es, such as the bean and noodle soup, ''sagne e fagioli''. This soup is traditionally flavored with [[tomato]]es, [[garlic]], oil, and [[peperoncini]].

Other popular dishes include:
* ''[[gnocchi|Gnocchi carrati]]'', flavored with [[bacon]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[pecorino|pecorino cheese]]
*''Scrippelle'', a rustic French-style [[crêpe]] served either ''mbusse'' (a type of soup) or used to form a sort of [[soufflé]] with some [[ragù]] and stuffed with chicken liver, [[meatball]]s, hard-boiled eggs, and cheese
* ''Pastuccia'', a [[polenta]] stew with sausage, eggs, and cheese

Across the region, roast lamb is enjoyed in several variations. Some of these variations include:
* ''[[Arrosticini]]'', a skewered lamb dish
* ''Pecora al cotturo'', lamb stuffed with a variety of mountain [[herb]]s and cooked in a copper pot
* Lamb cooked whole in a [[masonry oven|bread oven]]
* ''Agnello cacio e ovo'', a lamb-based [[fricassee]]

Seafood is also popular, especially in coastal areas. The variety of fish available to the area has resulted in several fish-based ''Brodetti'' (broths), coming from such places as [[Vasto]], [[Giulianova]], and [[Pescara]]. These broths are often made by cooking fish, flavored with tomatoes, herbs, and peperoncino, in an earthenware pot. 
Rustic pizzas are also very common. Some of these are:
* ''Easter Pizza'', a rustic cake with cheese and pepper from the [[Teramo]] area
* ''Fiadoni'' from [[Chieti]], dough of eggs and cheese well risen, cooked in the oven in a thin casing of pastry
* A rustic tart pastry filled with everything imaginable: eggs, fresh cheeses, [[ricotta]], vegetables, and all sorts of flavorings and spices.

Also from [[Teramo]] are the spreadable sausages flavored with nutmeg, liver sausages tasting of garlic and spices. The [[ventricina]] from the Vasto area is made with large pieces of fat and lean pork, pressed and seasoned with powdered sweet peppers and [[fennel]] and all encased in the dehydrated stomach of the pig itself. Atri and [[Rivisondoli]] are famous for cheeses. [[Mozzarella]], either fresh or seasoned, made from ewe's milk, although a great number of lesser known varieties of these cheeses can be found all over Abruzzo and Molise.

===Sweets===
The sweets of Abruzzo are world famous and include:
* ''Confetti'', sugar-coated almonds, from [[Sulmona]]
* ''Torrone Nurzia'', a chocolate [[nougat]] from [[L'Aquila]]
