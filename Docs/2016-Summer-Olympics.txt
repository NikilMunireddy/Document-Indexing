The '''2016 Summer Olympics''' ({{lang-pt|Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016}}),<ref>The [[Brazilian Portuguese]] pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|ˈʒogos ɔlimˈpikus dʒi vɛˈɾɐ̃w dʒi ˈdojz ˈmiw i dʒezeˈsejz|}}, in Brazil's standard pronunciation.</ref> officially known as the '''Games of the XXXI Olympiad''', and commonly known as '''Rio 2016''', is a major international [[multi-sport event]] in the tradition of the [[Olympic Games]] due to take place in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Record numbers of countries are participating in a record number of sports. More than 10,500 athletes from 206 [[National Olympic Committees]] (NOCs), including first time entrants [[Kosovo]] and [[South Sudan]], will take part.<ref name="Rio2016">{{cite web|url=http://rio2016olympicswiki.com/about-rio-2016-summer-olympics/|title=About Rio 2016 Summer Olympics|work=Rio 2016 Olympics Wiki|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref> With 306 sets of medals, the games will feature 28 [[Olympic sports]] — including [[rugby sevens]] and [[golf]], which were added by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2009. These sporting events will take place at 33 venues in the host city and at 5 venues in the cities of [[São Paulo]] (Brazil's largest city), [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brasília]] (Brazil's capital), and [[Manaus]].

These will be the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of [[Thomas Bach]].<ref name="Rio2016"/> The host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] was announced at the [[121st IOC Session|121st]] [[List of IOC meetings|IOC Session]] held in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], on 2 October 2009. Rio will become the first South American city to host the Summer Olympics. These will be the first games to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first to be held in the host country's winter season, the first since [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] to be held in Latin America, and the first since [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] (third overall) to be held in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].<ref>http://www.livescience.com/43084-winter-olympics-northern-hemisphere.html</ref>

==Bidding process==
{{main|Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:Cidade Candidata (Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Olympic Games).JPG|thumbnail|A young girl adds her signature in support of Rio de Janeiro's candidacy to host the 2016 Olympic Games (January 2009).]]
The bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games was officially launched on 16 May 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=2157|title=2016 Bid Process Launched|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=16 May 2007}}</ref> The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files, containing answers to a 25-question IOC form, were to be submitted by each applicant city by 14 January 2008. Four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist on 4 June 2008: [[Chicago]], [[Madrid]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Tokyo]] (which hosted the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] and will host again in [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020]]). The IOC did not promote [[Doha]] to the Candidature phase, despite scoring higher than selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, due to their intent of hosting the Olympics in October, outside of the IOC's sporting calendar. [[Prague]] and [[Baku]] also failed to make the cut.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7435215.stm |title=Four on 2016 Olympics short-list |publisher=BBC News |date=4 June 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>

[[Nawal El Moutawakel]] of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the [[Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics bids]]. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=3110 |title=Olympic News – Official Source of Olympic News |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>

Many restrictions are in place designed to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or influencing directly the 115 voting members. Cities may not invite any IOC member to visit nor may they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invest large sums in their PR and media programs in an attempt to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support, support from sports media and general international media. {{Blockquote|Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.|Jon Tibbs, a consultant on the Tokyo bid<ref>[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=277:rings-around-the-world&catid=60:april-2009&Itemid=112 Rings Around the World] Communicate magazine, April 2009</ref>}}

The final voting was held on 2 October 2009, in Copenhagen with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro perceived as favourites to land the games. Chicago and Tokyo were eliminated after the first and second rounds of voting, respectively, while Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid heading into the final round. The lead held and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of 2016 Summer Olympics. Failed bids from other South American cities include [[Buenos Aires]] ([[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]), [[Cali]] ([[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]), and [[Brasília]], which withdrew during the [[Bids for the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympic bidding process]].

On 26 June 2011 it was reported on [[AroundTheRings.com]] that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This comes just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=40436|title=Around the Rings - Articles Archive|publisher=aroundtherings.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref> Pestana withdrew later during the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].

===Venues and infrastructure===
{{Main|Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics}}
In [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Barra da Tijuca]] will host most of the venues of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016. The rest will be located in three other zones of the host city: [[Copacabana Beach]], [[Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro|Maracanã]] and [[Deodoro Military Club|Deodoro]]. Barra da Tijuca will also house the [[Olympic Village]].

Rio's historical [[Centro (Rio de Janeiro)|downtown]] is undergoing a large-scale urban waterfront revitalization project called ''Porto Maravilha''.<ref>[http://portomaravilha.com.br/ Porto Maravilha] Rio de Janeiro City Hall. Retrieved 10 August 2012. {{pt icon}}.</ref> It covers {{convert|5|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} in area. The project aims to redevelop the port area increasing the city center's attractiveness and enhancing Rio’s competitiveness position in the global economy. The urban renovation involves: {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} of tunnels; {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads; {{convert|650|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of sidewalks; {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} of bike path; 15,000&nbsp;trees; three sanitation treatment plants.  As part of this renovation, a new tram will be built and will run from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio. It was due to open in April 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/news/cs-america/single-view/view/rio-tram-starts-test-running.html|title = Rio tram starts test running|date = 26 November 2015|accessdate = 1 January 2016|website = Railway Gazette|publisher = Railway Gazette|last = Railway|first = Gazette}}</ref>

While the whole city is undergoing major infrastructure improvements, there are concerns that some of the projects will never materialise.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/major-sports-events-brought-progress-rio-there-lot-more-do|title = Between hope and despair|date = 29 April 2016|accessdate = 25 May 2016|publisher = D+C, development and cooperation|last = Jaroschewski|first = Julia}}</ref>

====Football====

===Security===
Since the award of the 2016 Olympics to Rio de Janeiro, the city's crime problems have received more attention. A police helicopter was shot down over a [[favela]] during one of the city's many drug wars, and the pilot was killed in the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=109012&sectionid=351020706 |title=Rio gang violence amid Olympics safety concerns |publisher=Press TV |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref> Rio's mayor has admitted that there are "big issues" facing the city in securing the Games from violence. However, he also said that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/national/story.aspx?storyid=187690&catid=28 |title=Rio's mayor expresses safety concerns for 2016 Olympics , ksdk.com , St. Louis, MO |publisher=ksdk.com |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref> The governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a [[7 July 2005 London bombings|terrorist attack]] occurring on the day following the IOC session that chose the city to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]].

The IOC, however, has expressed optimism regarding the ability of the city and the nation of Brazil to address these concerns,  saying that seven years is enough time for Rio de Janeiro to clean up its crime problem.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Stephen|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/olympics/articles/2009/10/20/ioc_confident_in_rio_despite_new_wave_of_violence/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026104847/http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/olympics/articles/2009/10/20/ioc_confident_in_rio_despite_new_wave_of_violence/|archivedate=26 October 2009|title=IOC confident in Rio despite new wave of violence|date=20 October 2009|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=30 July 2012|deadurl=yes }}</ref> IOC spokesman Mark Adams told The Associated Press, "we have confidence in their capacity to deliver a safe Games in seven years.

Rio de Janeiro is planning to pacify local neighbourhoods, or favelas. Community-based Police Pacification Units (UPPs) will be used to build trust in individual communities through the use of street patrols and civic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latintelligence.com/2010/12/06/pacifying-rios-favelas/ |title=Pacifying Rio’s Favelas |publisher=latintelligence.com |accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> Moreover, The Regional Institute of Public Safety reported that the homicide rate of Rio de Janeiro for the first five months of 2012 was at its lowest in the past 21 years, with 10.9 homicides for every 100,000 habitants.<ref name=insight>{{cite news|last=Knott|first=Tracey|title=Rio de Janeiro Homicides Reach 21-Year Low|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2838-rio-de-janeiro-homicides-reach-21-year-low|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=29 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Homicidios en Río de Janeiro llegan a su nivel más bajo desde 1991|url=http://www.lanueva.com/elmundo/nota/4147298732/1/124472.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=La Nueva Provincia|date=27 June 2012|language=es}}</ref> Nonetheless, despite the decline in homicides and human rights abuses, [[Human Rights Watch]] urged Brazil to investigate [[extrajudicial killing]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Hannah|title=Human Rights Watch Praises, Criticizes Rio Govt|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2792-human-rights-watch-praises-criticizes-rio-govt|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=19 June 2012}}</ref>

On 9 May 2014, the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' reported IOC vice-president John Coates calling Brazil’s preparations "the worst I’ve experienced" and went on to claim that construction and infrastructure projects were severely behind schedule. "The IOC has formed a special task force to try to speed up preparations but the situation is critical on the ground," the paper quoted him as saying, concluding that such an intervention was "unprecedented".<ref name="Moore-Bridger">{{cite news|last=Moore-Bridger|first=Benedict|title=Could Rio games come to London?

Despite these initial worries, the Rio Olympics Committee reported on 29 December 2015 that most venues are complete except the Rio Olympic Velodrome (76%) and the Youth Arena (75%).<ref>{{Cite journal|title = 2016 Summer Olympics|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2016_Summer_Olympics&oldid=697816499}}</ref>

The ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, and all will be sold in [[Brazilian Real]]s (BRL). A total of 7.5 million tickets will be sold; 200,000 tickets less compared to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], because the size of many arenas is smaller. Ticket prices range from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8 million of these tickets will be available for BRL 70 or less.<ref>{{cite news|title=Prijzen tickets Olympische Spelen 2016 in Rio bekend|url=http://www.olympischespelenrio.nl/tickets/prijzen-tickets-olympische-spelen-2016-rio-bekend/|accessdate=6 October 2014|publisher=olympischespelenrio.nl|date=16 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Olympic Games ticket prices September 2014| url=http://www.rio2016.com/sites/all/themes/rio2016_agosto_14/doc/pdf/Ticket_prices_for_the_Rio_2016_Olympic_Games.pdf |accessdate=6 October 2014|publisher=Rio 2016|date=16 September 2014}}</ref> The street events such as road cycling, race walk, and the marathon can be watched along their routes for free.

===Torch relay===

The Olympic flame was lit at the temple of Hera in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] on 21 April 2016, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. On 27 April the flame was handed over to the Brazilian organizers at a ceremony at the [[Panathenaic Stadium]] in [[Athens]]. A brief stop was made in [[Switzerland]] to visit the IOC headquarters and the [[Olympic Museum]] in [[Lausanne]] as well as the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]].<ref name=starts>{{cite news|title=Greek fire lights up Rio 2016 Games...

There were two open spots for sports and initially seven sports began the bidding for inclusion in the 2016 program. Baseball and [[softball]], which were dropped from the program in 2005, [[karate]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[golf]], [[roller sports]], and [[rugby union]] all applied to be included. Leaders of the seven sports held presentations in front of the IOC executive board in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=3366295 |title=Golf among seven sports seeking inclusion in 2016 Games |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=20 August 2008|date=25 April 2008}}</ref>

In August, the executive board initially gave its approval to [[rugby sevens]]—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote, thus removing baseball, roller sports, and squash from contention. Among the remaining three—golf, karate, and softball, the board approved golf as a result of consultation. The final decision regarding the remaining two sports was made on 9 October 2009, the final day of the 121st IOC Session. A new system was in place at this session; a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympic Leaders Approve Golf and Rugby for 2016 Summer Games|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,539269,00.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Olympics-2016-IOC-Approves-Golf-And-Rugby-Sevens-To-Be-Included-In-Rio-De-Janeiro-Games/Article/200910215402514?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_9&lid=ARTICLE_15402514_Olympics_2016%3A_IOC_Approves_Golf_And_Rugby_Sevens_To_Be_Included_In_Rio_De_Janeiro_Games |title=Olympics 2016: IOC Approves Golf And Rugby Sevens To Be Included In Rio De Janeiro Games.|publisher=Sky (United Kingdom) |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref> International Golf Federation executive director Antony Scanlon said that the top players, including [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Annika Sörenstam]], would show their continued support of golf's Olympic involvement by participating in the events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=37197|title=Around the Rings - Articles Archive|publisher=aroundtherings.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Rio 2016 Olympics offices.jpg|thumb|250px|Rio 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics Head offices]]
The official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by the Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and unveiled on 31 December 2010.<ref name=adweek>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Nudd|title=Hated the London 2012 Logo?

The logo was based on four concepts: contagious energy, harmonious diversity, exuberant nature, and Olympic spirit. The Rio firm Tatíl designed the winning entry for the logo in a competition involving 139 agencies.<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 Summer Olympics Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.us/2016-summer-olympics-logo/|publisher=Famouslogos.us|accessdate=28 July 2011|date=28 July 2011}}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}</ref>

The logo has been noted as evoking [[Henri Matisse]]'s painting ''[[Dance (Matisse)|Dance]]''. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own. While also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This is not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] celebrations in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]. Tatíl agency director Fred Gelli defended the design, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original as it was "an ancient reference" and "in the collective unconscious". Gelli cited ''Dance'' as an influence of the logo's concept, and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.<ref name="denverpost-telluride">{{cite web|title=Telluride Foundation says Brazil stole its logo for Olympics|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_28493662/telluride-foundation-says-brazil-stole-its-logo-olympics|website=The Denver Post|accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref>

The [[List of Olympic mascots|official mascots]] of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 24 November 2014. Named after musician [[Vinicius de Moraes]] and representing Brazilian wildlife, the Olympic mascot Vinicius carries design traits of [[mammal]]s.

Brand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots are intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people. The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes, whose results were announced on 14 December 2014.<ref name=bbc-riomascot>{{cite web|title=Rio 2016: Olympic and Paralympic mascots launched|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/30176137|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=reuters-riomascots>{{cite news|title=Rio 2016 mascots inspired by animals and plants of Brazil|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/24/us-olympics-brazil-mascot-idUSKCN0J802V20141124?feedType=RSSfeedName=sportsNews|accessdate=15 December 2014|agency=Reuters|date=15 December 2014}}</ref>

==Concerns and controversies==

=== Zika virus ===
An [[2015–16 Zika virus epidemic|ongoing outbreak]] of the mosquito-borne [[Zika virus]] in Brazil has raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. Organizers plan to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues to prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zika virus: Olympic venues to be inspected daily before and during Games|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/35444254|accessdate=30 January 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 January 2016}}</ref>

There have been numerous calls for the Games to be postponed, warning that the anticipated attendance of 500,000 international visitors could cause the virus to rapidly spread outside of the country.<ref name="nyt-zikarisks">{{cite web|title=Researchers Weigh Risks of Zika Spreading at Rio Olympics|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/world/americas/brazil-zika-rio-olympics.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> In the first quarter of 2016, there were also more cases of the mosquito-borne [[Dengue fever]] than in 2015 alone.<ref name="quartz-goahead"/><ref name="wp-150experts"/> Dr. Amir Attaran of the [[University of Ottawa]], writing for the ''Harvard Public Health Review'', noted that Rio had the highest concentration of Zika infections out of all Brazilian states. He argued that the Games could result in a "global catastrophe" of Zika outbreaks, and asserted that it was "socially irresponsible" and "ethically questionable" to allow the Games to continue. On the other hand, it has been argued that the threat of Zika will not be as high during the games, citing computer models and simulations, as well as the fact that the Games will be held during [[Southern Hemisphere]] [[winter]], which may lessen mosquito activity. However, the initial outbreak of Zika in Brazil also occurred during the Winter months.

In May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the [[World Health Organization]], calling upon them to, according to co-author [[Arthur Caplan]], have "an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that "cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics will not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus", and that there was "no public health justification" for postponing them.<ref name="quartz-goahead"/><ref name="wp-150experts"/><ref name="bbc-whono">{{cite web|title=Zika crisis: WHO rejects 'move Rio Olympics' call|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36401150|website=BBC News|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref>

=== Sanitation ===
{{anchor|Water pollution}}
[[File:Marina_da_Glória_1.jpg|thumb|[[Marina da Glória]], locale of [[sailing]] competitions]]

The [[Guanabara Bay]], whose waters will be used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted; among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the Bay via polluted rivers and [[wikt:shanty|shanty]] towns along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue; although officials promised at the [[Earth Summit]] in 1992 that they would begin to address the pollution, previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio committed, once again, to making efforts towards cleaning the Bay.<ref name="nyt-pollution">{{cite web|title=Note to Olympic Sailors: Don’t Fall in Rio’s Water|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/world/americas/memo-to-olympic-sailors-in-rio-dont-touch-the-water.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-25686805 |title=Rio's Olympic waters blighted by heavy pollution |last1=Carneiro |first1=Julia |last2= |first2= |date=10 January 2014 |website=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues.<ref name="guardian-fundingclean">{{cite web|last1=Baich|first1=Oliver|title=Funding problems hit plan to clean Rio's polluted waterways ahead of Olympics|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/01/funding-problems-hit-plan-clean-rios-polluted-waterways-olympics|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>

Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated;<ref name="guardian-germannfect"/> this [[raw sewage]] also leaked into the Bay. In 2011, a new consortium took over the operations of Rio's sewage system in its western "AP5" zone as a legacy project for the Games. The consortium committed to building out upgrades to the sewage system that would reduce the amount of sewage flowing into the Bay by 17 million gallons by the end of 2016. However, adoption of the new system has been slow and inconsistent due to concerns by residents over installation costs.<ref name="wp-sewagerio">{{cite web|title=Rio planned Olympic-scale sewerage project.

The pollution has led to concerns over how it will affect competitions and the health of athletes; in 2014, sailors training in the Bay told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that they had to contend with dodging various forms of trash floating in its waters, ranging from [[tyre (wheel)|tyre]]s to dog carcasses.<ref name="nyt-pollution"/> That December, researchers from the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]] found drug-resistant "super bacteria"—KPC enzymes—in samples of water from the [[Carioca River]].

===Political instability and economic crisis===
[[File:Protestos de 15 de março de 2015 no Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|right|Political instability affects Brazil's initial climate of enthusiasm for the Olympics]]

In 2014, [[Operation Car Wash]], an investigation by the [[Federal Police of Brazil]] uncovered unprecedented [[money laundering]] and corruption at the state-controlled oil company [[Petrobras]], where executives allegedly accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms at inflated prices. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President [[Dilma Rousseff]] began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], resulting in massive demonstrations all over the country involving millions of protesters.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Flynn|first1=Daniel|last2=Soto|first2=Alonso|title=Record Brazil protests put Rousseff's future in doubt|url=http://reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0WF0IX|accessdate=14 March 2016|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=14 March 2016}}</ref>

At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared for the Games against such a volatile political and economic backdrop. The IOC stated that they were "very closely" watching political developments. On 14 April 2016, the Olympic Security Coordination assured that the economic and political crises would not affect the security and operation of the Games.<ref>[http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/olimpiadas/rio2016/noticia/2016/04/crise-no-rj-e-no-pais-nao-afetara-rio-2016-dizem-autoridades.html], Globo.com, 14 April 2016. Accessed on 24 April 2016.</ref>

In his speech during the ceremony in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], IOC President [[Thomas Bach]] commented on Brazil's political situation: "This will be Brazilian games. Despite the difficulties facing the country, the event will bring a message of hope to every corner of its territory and worldwide.  The Games will take place in a moment that the world is shaken by crises. I want to pay tribute to the Brazilian people, who, in a few weeks, welcome the world with enthusiasm and will leave you amazed with his joy and his passion for the sport."<ref>[http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/esporte/rio-2016-tocha-olimpica-e-acesa-em-cerimonia-na-grecia], Veja.com.br, 21 April 2016. Accessed on 24 April 2016.</ref>

President Rousseff, who is under [[impeachment]], will not be invited to attend any event during the Games. Instead, the main invitation as head of state is to Vice President [[Michel Temer]].<ref>[http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/politica/impeachment/rio-2016-convidara-temer-e-nao-dilma-para-abertura-dos-jogos-olimpicos,90f4dbc7d60efe0654d93b6ecbe719fbypfk9fkd.html], Terra.com.br, 29 April 2016. Accessed on 30 April 2016.</ref> On 12 May, President Rousseff's powers and duties were suspended for 180 days, after a session in the [[Federal Senate]], thus Vice President Temer will be acting president during the games.<ref>[http://g1.globo.com/politica/processo-de-impeachment-de-dilma/noticia/2016/05/processo-de-impeachment-e-aberto-e-dilma-e-afastada-por-ate-180-dias.html], Globo.com, 12 May .

==Broadcasting==
{{main|List of 2016 Summer Olympics broadcasters}}
In August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights to the 2016 Summer Olympics to [[Grupo Globo]]. Replacing [[Rede Record]], the deal covers free-to-air coverage on [[Rede Globo]], [[Globosat|pay TV]], and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sub-licensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with [[Rede Bandeirantes]]. IOC board member [[Richard Carrión]] described the agreement as "unprecedented", touting that "by working with Brazil’s leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games."<ref>{{cite news|title=IOC reaches agreement for 2014 & 2016 broadcast rights in Brazil|url=http://www.olympic.org/tv-rights-new-media-commission?articlenewsgroup=-1&articleid=72509|accessdate=2 May 2011|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=27 August 2009}}</ref>
