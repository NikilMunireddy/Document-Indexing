==Etymology==
[[File:Geology of Cyprus-SkiriotissaMine.jpg|thumb|left|A copper mine in Cyprus. In antiquity, Cyprus was a major source of copper.]]
The earliest attested reference to ''Cyprus'' is the 15th century BC [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀓𐀠𐀪𐀍}}, ''ku-pi-ri-jo'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Strange|first=John|title=Caphtor : Keftiu : a new investigation|year=1980|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-06256-6|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9QUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA154}}</ref> meaning "Cypriot" (Greek: {{lang|grc|Κύπριος}}), written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages</ref>
The classical Greek form of the name is {{lang|grc|Κύπρος (''Kýpros'')}}.

The etymology of the name is unknown.
Suggestions include:
* the Greek word for the [[Cupressus|Mediterranean cypress tree]] (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]''), ''κυπάρισσος'' (''kypárissos'')
* the Greek name of the [[henna]] plant (''Lawsonia alba''), ''κύπρος'' (''kýpros'')
* an [[Eteocypriot]] word for [[copper]]. Georges Dossin, for example, suggests that it has roots in the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word for copper (''zubar'') or for [[bronze]] (''kubar''), from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island.

Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the [[Classical Latin]] word for copper through the phrase ''aes Cyprium'', "metal of Cyprus", later shortened to ''Cuprum''.<ref>Fisher, Fred H. ''Cyprus: Our New Colony And What We Know About It''. London: George Routledge and Sons 1878, pp. 13–14.</ref>

Cyprus, more specifically the seashore at [[Paphos]], was also one of the birthplaces given in Greek mythology for [[Aphrodite]], who was known as ''Kýpria''. This was because [[Astarte]], goddess of love and beauty in [[Canaanite religion|Phoenician mythology]], for whom Cyprus was an important cult centre, was later [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] Aphrodite.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The standard [[demonym]] relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is ''[[Cypriot (disambiguation)|Cypriot]]''. The terms ''Cypriote'' and ''Cyprian'' are also used, though less frequently.

[[File:Nicosia by Giacomo Franco.jpg|thumb|The [[Venetian walls of Nicosia]] were built by the Venetians to defend the city in case of an Ottoman attack]]
[[File:Kyrenia Castle2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kyrenia Castle]] was originally built by the Byzantines and enlarged by the Venetians]]
When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 395, Cyprus became part of the East Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]], and would remain so until the [[Crusades]] some 800 years later. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

Beginning in 649, Cyprus [[Arab–Byzantine wars|suffered from devastating raids launched by Muslim armies]] from the [[Levant]], which continued for the next 300 years.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> Many were quick piratical raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period; thousands of people were killed, and many cities – such as [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] – were destroyed and never rebuilt.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] scored decisive victories on land and sea.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

In 1191, during the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I of England]] captured the island from [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus]]<ref>Riddle, J.M. ''A History of the Middle Ages.'' Lanham, MD, USA: Rowman & Littlefield 2008. p. 326. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&pg=PA326]</ref> He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the [[Saracen]]s. A year later Richard sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]], who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. His brother and successor [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric]] was recognised as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

Following the death in 1473 of [[James II of Cyprus|James II]], the last Lusignan king, the [[Republic of Venice]] assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]], reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> The Venetians fortified [[Nicosia]] by building the [[Venetian walls of Nicosia|Venetian Walls]], and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the [[Ottoman Empire]] frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed [[Limassol]] and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified [[Famagusta]] and [[Kyrenia]].<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

During the almost four centuries of Latin rule, there existed two societies on Cyprus. The first consisted of [[Francia|Frankish]] nobles and their retinue, as well as [[Italians|Italian]] merchants and their families. The second, the majority of the population, consisted of [[Greek Cypriots]], serfs and laborers. Although a determined effort was made to supplant native traditions and culture, the effort failed.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

The Ottomans abolished the [[feudal]] system previously in place and applied the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] to Cyprus, under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [[Church of Cyprus]] was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/Embassies/Embassy_Madrid.nsf/all/6A33D29D666143A6C1257A36002ECA14/$file/ChipreUnaVisionHistorica.pdf?openelement|title=Cyprus a Historical Overview (Chipre Una Visión Historica) |work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cyprus website |first=William |last=Mallinson |format=PDF |language=Spanish |accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials, and the island began over 250 years of economic decline.<ref name="Cyprus - OTTOMAN RULE">[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/7.htm Cyprus – OTTOMAN RULE], ''U.S. Library of Congress''</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the [[Congress of Berlin]], Cyprus was [[Cyprus Convention|leased]] to the [[British Empire]] which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of sovereignty, Cyprus remained a ''[[de jure]]'' Ottoman territory until 5 November 1914, together with [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]])<ref name=Lausanne-Egypt-Sudan-Cyprus>{{cite web |url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne|title=Treaty of Lausanne|publisher=}}</ref> in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [[Suez Canal]], the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]], on 5 November 1914 the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus and declared the Ottoman ''[[Khedive|Khedivate]]'' of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]] a [[Sultanate of Egypt|''Sultanate'' and British protectorate]].<ref name=Lausanne-Egypt-Sudan-Cyprus/><ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to [[Constantine I of Greece]] on condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British, which he declined. In 1923, under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the nascent Turkish republic relinquished any claim to Cyprus,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title='Cypriot Muslims among Ottomans, Turks and British|journal=Bogazici Journal|year=2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=109–120|url=http://www.bujournal.boun.edu.tr/docs/13330942935.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref> and in 1925 it was declared a British [[crown colony]].<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> Many Greek and Turkish Cypriots fought in the [[British Army]] during both [[world war]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author= Ertl, Alan W. |title= Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration |publisher= Universal-Publishers|year= 2008 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=X9PGRaZt-zcC&dq= | page = 418 |isbn= 978-1-59942-983-0}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2015}} During the [[Second World War]], many enlisted in the [[Cyprus Regiment]].

The Greek Cypriot population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to ''enosis''.

On 16 August 1960, Cyprus attained independence after the [[Zürich and London Agreement]] between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. Cyprus had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turks, and 27,108 (4.7%) others <ref name="countrystudies.us">[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/21.htm Eric Solsten, ed.

However, the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of Greece and Turkey respectively. The Greek Cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to Turkish Cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the [[Akritas plan]], which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of Greek Cypriots, persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating Turkish Cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan.<ref name="country12">[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/12.htm Eric Solsten, ed.

After the restoration of constitutional order and the return of Archbishop Makarios III to Cyprus in December 1974, Turkish troops remained, occupying the northeastern portion of the island. In 1983, the leader of Turkish Cypriots proclaimed the [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), which is only recognised by Turkey.

The events of the summer of 1974 dominate the [[Cyprus dispute|politics]] on the island, as well as [[Greco-Turkish relations]].

[[File:Cyprus - Cave of 318 Fathers view.JPG|thumb|Mount Olympus.]]

Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after the Italian islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] (both in terms of area and population). It is also the [[List of islands by area|world's 81st largest by area]] and [[List of islands by population|world's 51st largest by population]]. It measures {{convert|240|km|mi|0}} long from end to end and {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} wide at its widest point, with Turkey {{convert|75|km|mi|0}} to the north. It lies between latitudes [[34th parallel north|34°]] and [[36th parallel north|36° N]], and longitudes [[32nd meridian east|32°]] and [[35th meridian east|35° E]].

[[File:Petra tou romiou beach.jpg|thumb|left|[[Petra tou Romiou]] ("Rock of the Greek").]]

Other neighbouring territories include Syria and Lebanon to the east ({{convert|105|and|108|km|mi|0}}, respectively), Israel {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} to the southeast, Egypt {{convert|380|km|mi|0}} to the south, and Greece to the northwest: {{convert|280|km|mi|0}} to the small [[Dodecanese|Dodecanesian]] island of [[Kastellorizo]] (Megisti), {{convert|400|km|mi|0}} to [[Rhodes]] and {{convert|800|km|mi|0}} to the Greek mainland.

The physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the [[Troodos Mountains]] and the smaller [[Kyrenia Mountains|Kyrenia Range]], and the central plain they encompass, the [[Mesaoria]]. The Mesaoria plain is drained by the [[Pedieos River]], the longest on the island. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The highest point on Cyprus is [[Mount Olympus (Cyprus)|Mount Olympus]] at {{convert|1952|m|abbr=on}}, located in the centre of the Troodos range. The narrow Kyrenia Range, extending along the northern coastline, occupies substantially less area, and elevations are lower, reaching a maximum of {{convert|1024|m|abbr=on}}. The island lies within the [[Anatolian Plate]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Erdik|first1=Mustafa|title=Strong Ground Motion Seismology|date=2013|page=469}}</ref>

[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], the island is subdivided into four main segments. The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] occupies the northern third (34.85%), and the United Nations-controlled [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] provides a [[buffer zone]] that separates the two and covers 2.67% of the island. Lastly, [[Sovereign Base Areas|two bases under British sovereignty]] are located on the island: [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], covering the remaining 2.74%.

Cyprus suffers from a chronic shortage of water. The country relies heavily on rain to provide household water, but in the past 30 years average yearly precipitation has decreased.<ref name=meteo>{{cite web |author1=Department of Meteorology|title=The Climate of Cyprus|url=http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/MS/MS.nsf/DMLcyclimate_en/DMLcyclimate_en?OpenDocument|accessdate=8 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614000827/http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/ms/ms.nsf/DMLcyclimate_en/DMLcyclimate_en?opendocument|archivedate=14 June 2015|quote="Statistical analysis of rainfall in Cyprus reveals a decreasing trend of rainfall amounts in the last 30 year[s]."}}</ref> Between 2001 and 2004, exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up, with supply exceeding demand, allowing total storage in the island's reservoirs to rise to an all-time high by the start of 2005.
However, since then demand has increased annually – a result of local population growth, foreigners moving to Cyprus and the number of visiting tourists – while supply has fallen as a result of more frequent droughts.<ref name=meteo />

Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use; Cyprus has a total of 107 dams (plus one currently under construction) and reservoirs, with a total water storage capacity of about {{convert|330000000|m3|-9|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/wdd/Wdd.nsf/All/F1C37F7EC2249715C2256CC50039DDD5?OpenDocument&highlight=108%20dams Dams of Cyprus] Water Development Department, Republic of Cyprus.</ref> Water [[desalination]] plants are gradually being constructed to deal with recent years of prolonged drought.
The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.

Turkey is building a water pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from [[Anamur]] on its southern coast to the northern coast of Cyprus, to supply Northern Cyprus with potable and irrigation water ''(see [[Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project]])''.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Cyprus}}
[[File:Parlanet cyprus.jpg|thumb|left|The Presidential Palace in [[Nicosia]]]]
[[File:Nicos Anastasiades at EPP HQ.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Nicos Anastasiades]], President of Cyprus since 2013.]]
Cyprus is a [[presidential republic]]. The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.

The 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.

Since 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the [[Turkish Cypriot]] seats in the House remain vacant. In 1974 Cyprus was divided ''de facto'' when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] but were recognised only by [[Turkey]]. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.

The House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian]], [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latin]] and [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community but remain vacant since 1964. The political environment is dominated by the communist [[Progressive Party of Working People|AKEL]], the liberal conservative [[Democratic Rally]], the [[centrism|centrist]]<ref>{{cite web |author=DotNetNuke |url=http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070611174508/http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archivedate=11 June 2007 |title=Ιδεολογική Διακήρυξη του Δημοκρατικού Κόμματος |publisher=Diko.org.cy |accessdate=6 January 2009}}</ref> [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]], the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Movement for Social Democracy|EDEK]] and the centrist [[European Party (Cyprus)|EURO.KO]].
In 2008, [[Dimitris Christofias]] became the country's first Communist head of state. Due to his involvement in the [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis]], Christofias did not run for re-election in 2013. The Presidential election in 2013 resulted in [[Democratic Rally]] candidate [[Nicos Anastasiades]] winning 57.48% of the vote. As a result, Anastasiades was sworn in on and has been President since 28 February 2013.

===Exclaves and enclaves===
[[File:Dhekelia Power Station.jpg|thumb||[[Dhekelia Power Station]]]]

Cyprus has four [[exclave]]s, all in territory that belongs to the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia]]. The first two are the villages of [[Ormidhia]] and [[Xylotymvou]]. The third is the [[Dhekelia Power Station]], which is divided by a British road into two parts. The northern part is the [[Electricity Authority of Cyprus|EAC]] refugee settlement. The southern part, even though located by the sea, is also an exclave because it has no [[territorial waters]] of its own, those being U.K. waters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/dhekelia.htm|title=Dhekelia |publisher=Geosite.jankrogh.com |date=  30 January 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>

The [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|UN buffer zone]] runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off [[Ayios Nikolaos, SBA|Ayios Nikolaos]] and is connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin land corridor. In that sense the buffer zone turns the [[Paralimni]] area on the southeast corner of the island into a ''de facto'', though not ''[[de jure]]'', exclave.

{{Main|Cypriot National Guard}}
The [[Cypriot National Guard]] is the main military institution of the Republic of Cyprus. It is a <!-- all Greek : If it is Greek then refs must be provided. I suspect that this is meant to say ethnic Greek.-->[[combined arms]] force, with land, air and naval elements. The National Guard is a required 24-month service for all men after their 17th birthday. The land forces of the Cypriot National Guard comprise the following units:
* First Infantry Division (Ιη Μεραρχία ΠΖ)
* Second Infantry Division (ΙΙα Μεραρχία ΠΖ)
* Fourth Infantry Brigade (ΙVη Ταξιαρχία ΠΖ)
* Twentieth Armoured Brigade (ΧΧη ΤΘ Ταξιαρχία)
* Third Support Brigade (ΙΙΙη Ταξιαρχία ΥΠ)
* Eighth Support Brigade (VIIIη Ταξιαρχία ΥΠ)

The air force includes the 449th Helicopter Gunship Squadron (449 ΜΑΕ) – operating [[Aérospatiale Gazelle|Aérospatiale SA-342L]] and [[Bell 206]] and the 450th Helicopter Gunship Squadron (450 ME/P) – operating [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-35P]] helicopters and the [[Britten-Norman Islander|Britten-Norman BN-2B]] and [[Pilatus PC-9]] fixed-wing aircraft.

In the early 21st century the Cypriot economy has diversified and become prosperous.<ref name=econ/> However, in 2012 it became affected by the [[European sovereign-debt crisis|Eurozone financial and banking crisis]]. In June 2012, the Cypriot government announced it would need €{{Nowrap|1.8 billion}} in foreign aid to support the [[Cyprus Popular Bank]], and this was followed by [[Fitch Group|Fitch]] downgrading Cyprus's credit rating to [[junk status]].<ref name=BBCJune>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18577983 |title=Cyprus's credit rating cut to junk status by Fitch |date=25 June 2012 |work= |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> Fitch said Cyprus would need an additional €{{Nowrap|4 billion}} to support its banks and the downgrade was mainly due to the exposure of [[Bank of Cyprus]], Cyprus Popular Bank and [[Hellenic Bank]], Cyprus's three largest banks, to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek financial crisis]].<ref name=BBCJune/>

In return for a €10 billion [[bailout]] from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], often referred to as the "troika", the Cypriot government was required to impose a significant [[haircut (finance)|haircut]] on [[deposit insurance|uninsured deposits]], a large proportion of which were held by wealthy [[Russians]] who used Cyprus as a [[tax haven]].

A third airport, [[Ercan International Airport]], operates in the Turkish Cypriot administered area with direct flights only to [[Turkey]] (Turkish Cypriot ports are closed to international traffic apart from Turkey). [[Nicosia International Airport]] has been closed since 1974.

The main [[harbour]]s of the island are [[Limassol Port|Limassol]] and [[Larnaca]], which service cargo, passenger and [[cruise ship]]s.

===Communications===

[[Cyta]], the [[Public ownership|state-owned]] telecommunications company, manages most telecommunications and Internet connections on the island. However, following deregulation of the sector, a few private telecommunications companies emerged, including [[MTN Group|MTN]], [[Cablenet]], [[OTEnet Telecom]], [[Omega Telecom]] and [[PrimeTel]]. In the Turkish-controlled area of Cyprus, three different companies are present: [[Turkcell]], [[KKTC Telsim]] and [[Turk Telekom]].

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Cyprus}}
[[File:NICOSIA, 11 AUGUST, 2011 186.jpg|thumb|left|[[Faneromeni School]] is the oldest all-girl primary school in Cyprus.]]

Cyprus has a highly developed system of primary and secondary education offering both public and private education. The high quality of instruction can be attributed in part to the fact that nearly 7% of the GDP is spent on education which makes Cyprus one of the top three spenders of education in the EU along with Denmark and Sweden.<ref>[http://www.childinfo.org/files/IND_Cyprus.pdf UNICEF, Division of Policy and Practice, Statistics and Monitoring Section] childinfo.org, May 2008.</ref>

[[State school]]s are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to private-sector institutions. However, the value of a state high-school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25% of the final grade for each topic, with the remaining 75% assigned by the teacher during the semester, in a minimally transparent way. Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes. While a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take.

The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek, British, Turkish, other European and North American universities. It is noteworthy that Cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of [[Legal working age|working age]] who have higher-level education in the EU at 30% which is ahead of Finland's 29.5%. In addition, 47% of its population aged 25–34 have tertiary education, which is the highest in the EU. The body of Cypriot students is highly mobile, with 78.7% studying in a university outside Cyprus.

==Culture==
[[File:Carnival in Limassol 2014 (12887788193).jpg|thumb|Limassol Carnival Festival in 2014]]

Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots share a lot in common in their culture but also have differences. Several traditional food (such as [[souvla]] and [[halloumi]]) and beverages are similar, as well as expressions and ways of life. Hospitality and buying or offering food and drinks for guests or others are common among both. In both communities, music, dance and art are integral parts of social life and many artistic, verbal and nonverbal expressions, traditional dances such as [[tsifteteli]], similarities in dance costumes and importance placed on social activities are shared between the communities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fong|first1=Mary|last2=Chuang|first2=Rueyling|title=Communicating Ethnic and Cultural Identity|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780742517394|page=286|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ue4CCUhRYa4C&pg=PA286&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> However, the two communities have distinct religions and religious cultures, with the Greek Cypriots traditionally being [[Church of Cyprus|Greek Orthodox]] and Turkish Cypriots traditionally being [[Sunni Muslims]], which has partly hindered cultural exchange.<ref name="CyprusinEurope">{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-35-number-1/download.aspx?id=2001 |title=Cyprus in Europe: Seizing the Momentum of Nice |author=Patrick R.

The [[Limassol Carnival Festival]] is an annual [[carnival]] which is held at [[Limassol]], in Cyprus. The event which is very popular in Cyprus was introduced in the 20th century.{{Sfn|Merin|Burdick1979|p=82}}

===Art===
[[File:Classic aristocratic houses in Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Typical Cypriot architecture in old part of [[Nicosia]], Cyprus]]

The art history of Cyprus can be said to stretch back up to 10,000 years, following the discovery of a series of [[Chalcolithic]] period carved figures in the villages of [[Khoirokoitia]] and [[Lempa (Lemba)|Lempa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcl.ed.ac.uk/arch/lemba/homepage.html |title=Lemba Archaeological Research Centre |publisher=Arcl.ed.ac.uk |accessdate=25 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117041553/http://www.arcl.ed.ac.uk/arch/lemba/homepage.html |archivedate=2013-01-17}}</ref> The island is the home to numerous examples of high quality religious [[icon painting]] from the [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] as well as [[List of painted churches in Cyprus|many painted churches]]. Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] and Italian [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination (1191–1571).

In modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883–1958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice.<ref>Chrysanthos Christou, ''A short History of Modern and Contemporary Cypriot Art,'' Nicosia 1983.</ref> Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900–1994) who studied at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and Christopheros Savva (1924–1968) who also studied in London, at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]].<ref>Ministry of Education and Culture, ''State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art'' (Nicosia: MOEC,1998)</ref> In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day. In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in England<ref>Michael Paraskos, 'The Art of Modern Cyprus', in ''Sunjet,'' Spring 2002, 62f</ref> while others train at art schools in [[Greece]] and local art institutions such as the [[Cyprus College of Art]], [[University of Nicosia]] and the [[Frederick Institute of Technology]].

One of the features of Cypriot art is a tendency towards figurative painting although [[conceptual art]] is being rigorously promoted by a number of art "institutions" and most notably the Nicosia Municipal Art Centre. Municipal art galleries exist in all the main towns and there is a large and lively commercial art scene. Cyprus was due to host the international art festival [[Manifesta]] in 2006 but this was cancelled at the last minute following a dispute between the Dutch organizers of Manifesta and the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture over the location of some of the Manifesta events in the Turkish sector of the capital [[Nicosia]].<ref name="schools out">{{cite web | url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/schools_out | title= Schools Out | date=September 2006 | publisher=www.frieze.com]}}</ref><ref name="Manifestaartnet">{{cite web | url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/zenakos/zenakos6-5-06.asp | title= Manifesta no more |publisher=www.artnet.com]}}</ref> <!-- The ensuing furore over this event resulted in questions in Cyprus as to whether Manifesta was a [[CIA]]-backed plot to undermine the Greek Cypriot side in on-going negotiations over the reunification of Cyprus.<ref>Michael Paraskos, 'Was Manifesta a CIA Plot?' in ''Artcyprus,'' issue 2, Autumn 2006, 2</ref>{{Dead link|date=February 2011}} : see chat-->

Other notable Greek Cypriot artists include [[Helene Black]], [[Kalopedis family]], [[Panayiotis Kalorkoti]], [[Nicos Nicolaides]], [[Stass Paraskos]], [[Arestís Stasí]], [[Telemachos Kanthos]], [[Konstantia Sofokleous]] and [[Chris Achilleos]], and Turkish Cypriot artists include [[İsmet Güney]], [[Ruzen Atakan]] and [[Mutlu Çerkez]].

There is also a form of musical poetry known as ''chattista'' which is often performed at traditional feasts and celebrations. The instruments commonly associated with Cyprus folk music are the [[bouzouki]], [[oud]] ("outi"), violin ("fkiolin"), [[lute]] ("laouto"), [[accordion]], Cyprus [[flute]] ("pithkiavlin") and percussion (including the "[[goblet drum|toumperleki]]"). Composers associated with traditional Cypriot music include [[Evagoras Karageorgis]], [[Marios Tokas]], Solon Michaelides and Savvas Salides. Among musicians is also the acclaimed pianist [[Cyprien Katsaris]] and composer and artistic director of the European Capital of Culture initiative [[Marios Joannou Elia]].

Literary production of the antiquity includes the [[Cypria]], an [[epic poetry|epic poem]], probably composed in the late 7th century BC and attributed to [[Stasinus]]. The Cypria is one of the very first specimens of Greek and European poetry.<ref>"An indication that at least the main contents of the ''Cypria'' were known around 650 BC is provided by the representation of the [[Judgment of Paris]] on the [[Chigi vase]]" (Burkert 1992:103).

Examples of Cyprus in foreign literature, include the works of Shakespeare, with the majority of the play ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] set on the island of Cyprus. British writer [[Lawrence Durrell]] lived in Cyprus from 1952 until 1956, during his time working for the British colonial government on the island, and wrote the book [[Bitter Lemons]] concerning his time in Cyprus which won the second [[Duff Cooper Prize]] in 1957.

Cypriot cinema was born much later than that of other countries. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[George Filis]] produced and directed ''Gregoris Afxentiou'', ''Etsi Prodothike i Kypros'' (''Cyprus Betrayal''), and ''The Mega Document''.

In 1994, cinematographic production received a boost with the establishment of the Cinema Advisory Committee. As of the year 2000, the annual amount set aside in the national budget stands at Cy Pounds 500,000 (about 850,000 Euros). In addition to government grants, Cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the [[Council of Europe]]'s Eurimages Fund, which finances European film co-productions. To date, four feature-length films in which a Cypriot was executive producer have received funding from [[Eurimages]]. The first was ''[[I Sphagi tou Kokora]]'' (1992), completed in 1996, ''Hellados'' (''[[And the Trains Fly to the Sky]]'', 1995), which is currently in post-production, and [[Costas Demetriou]]'s ''O Dromos gia tin Ithaki'' (''[[The Road to Ithaka]]'', 1997) which premiered in March 2000. The theme song to ''The Road to Ithaka'' was composed by [[Costas Cacoyannis]] and sung by [[Alexia Vassiliou]]. In September 1999, ''[[To Tama]]'' (''The Promise'') by [[Andreas Pantzis]] also received funding from the Eurimages Fund.<ref>"[http://www.filmbirth.com/cyprus.html Film Birth – History of Cinema – Cyprus]".</ref> In 2009 the Greek director, writer and producer [[Vassilis Mazomenos]] filmed in Cyprus [[Guilt (movie)|Guilt]]. The film was awarded in 2012 with the Best Screenwriting and Best Photography award in [[London Greek Film Festival]] (UK) and was official selection in [[Montreal World Film Festival]], [[Cairo International Film Festival]], [[India International Film Festival]], [[Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival]], [[Fantasporto]] and opening film in the Panorama of European Cinema in Athens. In 2010 the film was Nominated for the best film from the [[Hellenic Film Academy]].

Only a small number of foreign films have been made in Cyprus. This includes [[Incense for the Damned]], filmed in 1969 and starring [[Patrick Macnee]], [[Patrick Mower]] and [[Peter Cushing]]. In 1970 [[The Beloved (1970 film)|The Beloved]], starring [[Raquel Welch]] was also filmed in Cyprus, as was the 1973 British comedy movie [[Ghost in the Noonday Sun]], directed by [[Peter Medak]], starring [[Peter Sellers]], [[Anthony Franciosa]] and [[Spike Milligan]].<ref>Roger Lewis, ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'' (London: Arrow, 1995) p.130</ref> Parts of the 1962 film ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', starring [[John Wayne]] were also filmed on Cyprus.
