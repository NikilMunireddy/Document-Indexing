'''Ice hockey''' is a [[contact sport|contact]] [[team sport]] played on [[ice]], usually in a [[Ice hockey rink|rink]], in which two teams of [[Ice skating|skaters]] use their [[Ice hockey stick|sticks]] to [[Shot (ice hockey)|shoot]] a [[vulcanized]] rubber [[hockey puck|puck]] into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one [[goaltender]], and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a [[Goal (ice hockey)|goal]] against the opposing team.

A fast-paced, physical sport, ice hockey is most popular in areas of [[North America]] (particularly [[Canada]] and the northern [[United States]]) and northern and eastern [[Europe]]. Ice hockey is the official [[National sport|national winter sport]] of Canada,<ref>[[s:National Sports of Canada Act|National Sports of Canada Act]]</ref> where the game enjoys immense popularity. In North America, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) is the highest level for men's hockey and the most popular. The [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) is the highest league in [[Russia]] and much of [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) is the formal governing body for international ice hockey. The IIHF manages international tournaments and maintains the [[IIHF World Ranking]]. Worldwide, there are ice hockey federations in 74 countries.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=IIHF |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/ |title=The IIHF |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>

Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th century [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as "[[shinny]]" and "[[ice polo]]". The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in [[Montreal]], where the [[first indoor hockey game]] was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and [[professional ice hockey]] originated around 1900. The [[Stanley Cup]], emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time in the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] in the [[1920 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games of 1920]].

In international competitions, the national teams of six countries (The "[[Big Six (hockey)|Big Six]]") predominate: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[United States men's national ice hockey team|the United States]]. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only six medals were not awarded to one of those countries. In the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the "Big Six" have won only five medals in either competition since 1953:<ref>Including former incarnations of them, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]].</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/men.html |title=Men |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> All 12 Women's Olympic and 36 [[IIHF World Women's Championships]] medals have been awarded to one of these six countries, and every gold medal in both competitions has been won by either the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian national team]] or the [[United States women's national ice hockey team|United States national team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/women.html |title=Women |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/olympics/women.html |title=Women |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

In Canada, the United States, and some European countries such as [[Latvia]] and [[Sweden]], it is known simply as "hockey"; the name "ice hockey" is used in places where "hockey" more often refers to [[field hockey]], such as [[South America]], [[Asia]], [[Ice hockey in Africa|Africa]], [[Australasia]], and some European countries like [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]] and the United Kingdom. In Russia and [[Ukraine]], where "hockey" also can refer to [[bandy]], ice hockey is often called "hockey with puck".

==History==

==={{anchor|Naming}}Name===
The name "hockey" has no clear origin. Its first known mention is from the 1773 book ''Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education'', by Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled "New Improvements on the Game of Hockey".<ref name=OnTheOriginOfHockey>{{cite book|last=Gidén|first=Carl|last2=Houda|first2=Patrick|last3=Martel|first3=Jean-Patrice|title=On the Origin of Hockey|year=2014}}</ref> The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by [[Edward III of England|King Edward III of England]] is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam". The English historian and biographer [[John Strype]] did not use the word "hockey" when he translated the proclamation in 1720.

The 1573 Statute of Galway banned a sport called "'hokie' — the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves".<ref>See the Wikipedia entry on [[Gaelic Football]]</ref>  A form of this word was thus being used in the 16th century, though much removed from its current usage.

According to the Austin Hockey Association, the word "puck" derives from the Scots [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] ''puc'' or the Irish ''poc'' (to poke, punch or deliver a blow). "...The blow given by a hurler to the ball with his caman or hurley is always called a puck."<ref>{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=Patrick Weston|title=English As We Speak It in Ireland|year=1910}}</ref>

===Precursors===
[[File:Avercamp-ijsvermaak.png|thumb|Winter landscape, with skaters playing Golf ([[Hendrick Avercamp]], 17th-century Dutch painter)|alt=Many people on the ice, doing different things.]]
Stick-and-ball games date back to pre-Christian times. In Europe, these games included the Irish game of [[hurling]], the closely related Scottish game of [[shinty]] and versions of [[field hockey]] (including "[[bandie]] ball," played in England). [[IJscolf]], a game resembling [[Kolven|colf]] on an ice-covered surface, was popular in the [[Low Countries]] between the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. It was played with a wooden curved bat (called a ''colf'' or ''kolf''), a wooden or leather ball and two poles (or nearby landmarks), with the objective to hit the chosen point using the least number of strokes. A similar game (''[[knattleikr]]'') had been played for a thousand years or more by the [[Norsemen|Norse]], as documented in the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic sagas]]. In England, evidence of games of 'hockey on ice' (the name replaced "bandie ball"), played with a "[[bung]]" (a plug of cork or oak used as a stopper on a barrel) date back to the 1700s. William Pierre Le Cocq stated, in a 1799 letter written in [[Chesham]], England:

<blockquote>I must now describe to you the game of Hockey; we have each a stick turning up at the end. We get a bung. There are two sides one of them knocks one way and the other side the other way. If any one of the sides makes the bung reach that end of the churchyard it is victorious.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sihrhockey.org/new/pdfs/sihr_timeline_Preview.pdf |title=Stick and Ball Game Timeline |page=4 |publisher=Society for International Hockey Research |last=Gidén |first=Carl |last2=Houda |first2=Patrick |year=2010}}</ref></blockquote>

A 1797 engraving unearthed by Swedish sport historians Carl Gidén and Patrick Houda shows a person on [[ice skate|skates]] with a stick and bung on the [[River Thames]], probably in December 1796.<ref name="cancom">{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/travel/Hockey+researchers+puck+back+1796+earliest+known+portrait+player/6639066/story.html |title=Hockey researchers rag the puck back to 1796 for earliest-known portrait of a player |publisher=Canada.com |date=May 17, 2012 |accessdate=June 2, 2014}}</ref>

British soldiers and immigrants to Canada and the United States brought their stick-and-ball games with them and played them on the ice and snow of winter. In 1825, [[John Franklin]] wrote "The game of hockey played on the ice was the morning sport" on [[Great Bear Lake]] during one of his [[Arctic]] expeditions. A mid-1830s watercolour portrays New Brunswick lieutenant governor Archibald Campbell and his family with British soldiers on skates playing a stick-on-ice sport. Captain R.G.A. Levinge, a British Army officer in New Brunswick during Campbell's time, wrote about "hockey on ice" on Chippewa Creek (a tributary of the Niagara River) in 1839. In 1843 another British Army officer in [[Kingston, Ontario]] wrote, "Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice."<ref name="queens">{{cite web | title=Hockey night in Kingston| url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2005-10-04/features/hockey-night-kingston/ | accessdate=June 21, 2006}}</ref> An 1859 ''Boston Evening Gazette'' article referred to an early game of hockey on ice in Halifax that year.<ref name="origin" /> An 1835 painting by John O'Toole depicts skaters with sticks and bung on a frozen stream in the American state of [[West Virginia]].<ref name="cancom"/>

In the same era, the [[Mi'kmaq]], a [[First Nations]] people of [[Nova Scotia]], also had a stick-and-ball game. Canadian [[oral history|oral histories]] describe a traditional stick-and-ball game played by the Mi'kmaq in eastern Canada, and [[Silas Tertius Rand]] (in his 1894 ''Legends of the Micmacs'') describes a Mi'kmaq ball game known as ''tooadijik''. Rand also describes a game played (probably after European contact) with [[hurley (stick)|hurleys]], known as ''wolchamaadijik''.<ref name="Raddall">Dalhousie University (2000).

Early 19th-century paintings depict [[shinney]] (or "shinny"), an early form of hockey with no standard rules which was played in Nova Scotia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Many of these early games absorbed the physical aggression of what the Mi'kmaq in Nova Scotia called ''dehuntshigwa'es'' ([[lacrosse]]). Shinney was played on the [[St. Lawrence River]] at [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]], and in Kingston, Ontario<ref name="queens"/> and [[Ottawa]], Ontario. The number of players was often large. To this day, shinney (derived from "shinty") is a popular Canadian<ref>{{cite web|title=About Shinny USA|url=http://shinnyusa.com/about|publisher=Shinny USA|accessdate=October 16, 2011}}</ref> term for [[Pond hockey|an informal type of hockey]], either ice or [[street hockey]].

[[Thomas Chandler Haliburton]], in ''The Attache: Second Series'' (published in 1844) imagined a dialogue, between two of the novel's characters, which mentions playing "hurly on the long pond on the ice". This has been interpreted by some historians from [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]] as reminiscence of the days when the author was a student at [[King's-Edgehill School|King's College School]] in that town in 1810 and earlier.<ref name="origin">{{cite web |last=Vaughan |first=Garth |year=1999 |url=http://www.birthplaceofhockey.com/origin/overview.html  |title=Quotes Prove Ice Hockey's Origin |publisher=Birthplace of Hockey |accessdate=May 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010806073610/http://www.birthplaceofhockey.com/origin/overview.html |archivedate=August 6, 2001}}</ref><ref name="Raddall" /> Based on Haliburton's quote, claims were made that modern hockey was invented in Windsor, Nova Scotia, by King's College students and perhaps named after an individual ("Colonel Hockey's game").{{sfn|Vaughan|1996|p=23}} Others claim that the origins of hockey come from games played in the area of Dartmouth and Halifax in Nova Scotia. However, several references have been found to hurling and shinty being played on the ice long before the earliest references from both Windsor and Dartmouth/Halifax,<ref name="early-reference">{{cite web |last=Gidén |first=Carl |last2=Houda |first2=Patrick |year=2016 |url=http://www.sihrhockey.org/__a/public/horg.cfm |title=The Birthplace or Origin of Hockey |publisher=Society for International Hockey Research |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}</ref> and the word "hockey" was used to designate a stick-and-ball game at least as far back as 1773, as it was mentioned in the book ''Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education'' by Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled "New Improvements on the Game of Hockey".<ref>{{cite book |last=Gidén |first=Carl |last2=Houda |first2=Patrick |last3=Martel |first3=Jean-Patrice |title=On the Origin of Hockey|year=2014 |publisher=Hockey Origin Publishing |isbn=9780993799808}}</ref>

[[File:McGill hockey match.jpg|thumb|Hockey at McGill University, Montreal, 1901|alt=Photograph of outdoor hockey game]]

While the game's origins lie elsewhere, Montreal is at the center of the development of the sport of contemporary ice hockey. On March 3, 1875, the [[First indoor hockey game|first organized indoor game]] was played at Montreal's [[Victoria Skating Rink]] between two nine-player teams, including [[James Creighton (ice hockey)|James Creighton]] and several [[McGill University]] students. Instead of a ball or bung, the game featured a "flat circular piece of wood"<ref name=gazette18750303>{{cite news

}}</ref> (to keep it in the rink and to protect spectators). The goal posts were {{convert|8|ft|m}} apart<ref name = gazette18750303/> (today's goals are six feet wide).

In 1876, the first game played in Montreal was reportedly "conducted under the 'Hockey Association' rules";<ref>{{cite news

The number of teams grew, enough to hold the first "world championship" of ice hockey at Montreal's annual [[Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments|Winter Carnival]] in 1883. The McGill team won the tournament and was awarded the "Carnival Cup."<ref>The trophy for this tournament is on display at the Musee [[McCord Museum]] in Montreal.

In 1888, the [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley of Preston]] (whose sons and daughter were hockey enthusiasts), first attended the Montreal Winter Carnival tournament and was impressed with the game. In 1892, realizing that there was no recognition for the best team in Canada (although a number of leagues had championship trophies), he purchased a silver bowl for use as a trophy. The Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup (which later became known as the [[Stanley Cup]]) was first awarded in [[1893 AHAC season|1893]] to the [[Montreal Hockey Club]], champions of the AHAC; it continues to be awarded annually to the [[National Hockey League]]'s championship team.<ref>{{cite book | last=Podnieks | first=Andrew|author2=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]  | title=Lord Stanley's Cup | year=2004 | publisher=Triumph Books| isbn=1-55168-261-3}}</ref> Stanley's son Arthur helped organize the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], and Stanley's daughter [[Lady Isobel Gathorne-Hardy|Isobel]] was one of the first women to play ice hockey.

By 1893, there were almost a hundred teams in Montreal alone; in addition, there were leagues throughout Canada. [[Winnipeg]] hockey players used [[cricket]] pads to better protect the [[goaltender]]'s legs; they also introduced the "scoop" shot, or what is now known as the wrist shot. Goal nets became a standard feature of the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] (CAHL) in 1900. Left and right defence began to replace the point and cover-point positions in the OHA in 1906.{{sfn|Selke|1962|p=21}}

In the United States, "ice polo", played with a ball rather than a puck, was popular during this period; however, by 1893 [[Yale University]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] held their first ice hockey matches.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hockey (Ice) |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historical Foundation of Canada |year=2006 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ice-hockey/}}</ref>  American financier [[Malcolm Greene Chace]] is credited with being the father of hockey in the United States.<ref name=MalcolmChaseObit>{{citation|title=Malcolm G.

Professional hockey has existed since the early 20th century. By 1902, the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]] was the first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional league—the [[International Professional Hockey League]] (IPHL)—in 1904. The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with amateurs). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).

In 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.

Professional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss [[National League A]], founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], the [[Czech Extraliga]], the Finnish [[Liiga]] and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].

==Game==
[[File:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]

While the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used. The two most important codes are those of the IIHF<ref>{{cite book | last=International Ice Hockey Federation | authorlink=International Ice Hockey Federation | title= Official Rule Book 2002–2006 |date=September 2002 |url=http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf|format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319080459/http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2006}}</ref> and the NHL.<ref>{{cite book | last=National Hockey League | authorlink=National Hockey League | title=Official Rules 2006–07 | publisher=Triumph Books |year=2006 | location=Chicago, USA |url=http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf|isbn=1-894801-03-2|format=PDF}}</ref> Both of the codes, and others, originated from Canadian rules of ice hockey of the early 20th Century.

Ice hockey is played on a ''[[hockey rink]]''. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.

Within certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates, unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though intentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.

Hockey is an "[[Offside (ice hockey)|off-side]]" game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a truly team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.{{sfn|Dryden |2005 |p=246}}

Between the six players on the ice, they are typically divided into three forwards and two defensemen and a goaltender. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Center (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A substitution of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[shorthanded]]'' or on a ''[[Power play (sporting term)|power play]]''. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the ''crease'' in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005–2006 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.

The boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to "[[bodycheck]]" opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are "in play" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a "[[faceoff]]". Two players "face" each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.

The three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: "offside", "icing", and the puck going out of play. A player is "offside" if he enters his [[Hockey rink#Zones|opponent's zone]] before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not "ice the puck", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes "out of play" whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the "glass," or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.

Under IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defenceman. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward; this seventh defenceman might sometimes play on the [[fourth line]] as a forward.{{elucidate|reason=see Talk page|date=January 2016}}

===Periods and overtime===
A professional game consists of three ''periods'' of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.

Various procedures are used if a game is tied. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999–2000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation).

From 1999–2000 until 2003–04, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four players (plus a goalie) per side to "open-up" the game. In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an 'empty net' goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Starting in the 2015-16 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session will consist of three players plus a goalie.<ref>http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf</ref>

International play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 99–00 – 03–04 followed by a [[Shootout (hockey)|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]'' format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.

The overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins them the match.

===Penalties===
{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}
[[File:Hockeyfight.JPG|thumb|upright|Altercations often occur near the goal after a stoppage of play, since defensive players are highly concerned with protecting their [[goaltender]].]]

In ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a ''penalty'' to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the "[[penalty box]]" and their team has to play with one fewer player on the ice for a designated amount of time. ''Minor'' penalties last for two minutes, ''major'' penalties last for five minutes, and a ''double minor'' penalty is two ''consecutive'' penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing "short-handed" while the opposing team is on a "[[power play (sport)|power play]]."

A two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as "[[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]]", "[[elbow (strike)|elbowing]]", "[[roughing]]", "[[high-sticking]]", "[[delay of game|delay of the game]]", "[[too many men|too many players on the ice]]", "[[boarding (ice hockey)|boarding]]", illegal equipment, "[[charging (ice hockey)|charging]]" (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), "holding", holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), "interference", "[[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]]", "[[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]]", "kneeing", "unsportsmanlike conduct" (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), "butt-ending" (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick—a very rare penalty), "spearing", or "[[cross-checking]]". As of the 2005–2006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for "[[diving (ice hockey)|diving]]", where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a "minor" penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of "boarding" (defined as "check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |title=NHL Rulebook |publisher=nhlofficials.com}}</ref> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.

Some varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned "two-and-ten"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.

A "[[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]" is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a "[[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]". A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.

[[File:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]
Officials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).

In the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the "corners" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) the goalie can play the puck.

An additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the "[[Two-line pass|two-line offside pass]]." Prior to the 2005–06 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team's defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.

The NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past where illegal hits, fights, and "clutching and grabbing" among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game ("zero tolerance").

In men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called "[[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]." Not all physical contact is legal&nbsp;— in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.

A ''delayed penalty call'' occurs when a penalty offense is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signaled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the [[NCAA]] for [[college hockey|college level hockey]] in the United States. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH14.pdf |page=HR–33}}</ref>

===Officials===
{{Main|Official (ice hockey)}}
A typical game of hockey is governed by two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|officials]]'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are mainly responsible for calling "offside" and "[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008–2010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR–53}}</ref> and one or two ''referees'',<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008–2010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR–52}}</ref> who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008–2010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR–54}}</ref> The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.

The most widespread system in use today is the "three-man system," that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the "four-official system," where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], the [[Olympics]] and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.

Officials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hockey Canada Officiating Department|title=How to Get Started – Officials |url= http://hockeycanada.com/index.php/ci_id/63557/la_id/1.htm}}</ref> USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.<ref>{{cite web |author=USA Hockey Officiating Program |title=USA Hockey officials registration program |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093248/http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>

===Equipment===
[[File:Wallinheimo Sinuhe JYP.jpg|thumb|left|Goaltenders use more protective equipment than other players.]]

{{Main|Ice hockey equipment}}
Since ice hockey is a full contact sport in men's hockey, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet (cage worn if certain age or clear plastic visor can be worn), shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.

[[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|Goaltenders]] use different equipment. With [[hockey puck]]s approaching them at speeds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialty goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Ice hockey goaltending equipment|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ice_hockey_goaltending_equipment&oldid=678345161}}</ref>

Ice hockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and maneuverability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall maneuverability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. Most skate's width are about an 1/8 of an inch (3&nbsp;mm) thick.

The [[ice hockey stick]] consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong "whip-back" which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.

==Injury==
{{Cleanup|reason="Both sections are closely related"|date=January 2016}}
Ice hockey is a full contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately {{convert|20|–|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulders, hips, and hockey pucks all contribute. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players can have contact but are not allowed to body check. There are many injuries in women's ice hockey too. Some common injuries are concussions, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains.

===Head injuries===
According to the Hughston Health Alert, "Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey]." <ref>http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx</ref> Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood. Not only are lacerations common, "it is estimated that direct trauma accounts for 80% of all [hockey] injuries. Most of these injuries are caused by player contact, falls and contact with a puck, high stick and occasionally, a skate blade." <ref>http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx</ref> One of the causes of head injury is checking from behind. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty (called "boarding"). Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called "head contact"). A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player's head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player's head. The most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion. Most concussions occur during player-to-player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention. Studies show that, ice hockey causes 44.3% of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.<ref>Cusimano, MD. Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, n.d. Web. March 4, 2015.</ref> In severe cases, the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death. Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare, but occur all too much in a variety of sports.

==Tactics==
[[File:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|left|thumb|Winning the [[faceoff]] can be the key to some strategies. A game between [[Saginaw]] and [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]'s [[Ontario Hockey League]] teams.]]

===Checking===
{{main|Checking (ice hockey)}}
An important defensive tactic is checking—attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The ''[[neutral zone trap]]'' is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally "in possession" of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.

===Offensive tactics===
[[File:Peter Bondra scoring.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Bondra]] of the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] [[Shot (hockey)|shoots the puck]] and scores against [[Roberto Luongo]] of the [[Florida Panthers]] during the [[2005–06 NHL season]]]]
{{main|Shot (ice hockey)|Slapshot|Wrist shot|Snap shot (ice hockey)|Backhand slapshot|Offside (ice hockey)|Extra attacker|Deke (ice hockey)}}

Offensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. [[National Hockey League rules|NHL rules]] instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to "shoot" the puck.

A ''deflection'' is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''[[one-timer]]'' is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. ''Headmanning the puck'', also known as  ''breaking out'', is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. ''[[Loafing (ice hockey)|Loafing]]'', also known as ''[[cherry picking (basketball)|cherry-picking]]'', is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defense, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.

A team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.

One of the most important strategies for a team is their ''[[forecheck]]''. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the ''[[dump and chase]]'' strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: [[2-1-2 Forecheck|2–1–2]], 1–2–2, and 1–4. The 2–1–2 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1–2–2 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1–4 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the [[left wing lock]], which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.

There are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. ''[[Cycling (ice hockey)|Cycling]]'' moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a [[scoring chance]] by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. ''Pinching'' is when a defencemen pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A ''[[saucer pass]]'' is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.

A [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], short for "decoy," is a [[feint]] with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Patrick Kane]], have picked up the skill of "dangling," which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.

===Fights===
{{Main|Fighting in ice hockey}}
Although fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. [[enforcer (ice hockey)|Enforcers]] and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone gets hit by what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |title=KAHC Suspended Players |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813154239/http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |archivedate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> Crowds seem to like fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thestar.com/sports/2009/03/17/hockey_fans_love_fighting_survey_says.html |title=Hockey fans love fighting, survey says |work=Toronto Star |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref>

The chief difference between women's and men's hockey is that body checking is not allowed in women's hockey. After the 1990 Women's World Championship, body checking was eliminated in women's hockey. In current IIHF women's competition, body checking is either a minor or major [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]], decided at the referee's discretion.<ref name="IIHF Rules Section 6">{{cite web|work=International Ice Hockey Federation Official Rule Book|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]|title=Section 6 – Specific Rules|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/rules/img/sec6.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 28, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061021194221/http://www.iihf.com/hockey/rules/img/sec6.pdf |archivedate = October 21, 2006}}</ref> In addition, players in women's competition are required to wear protective full-[[hockey mask|face masks]].<ref name="IIHF Rules Section 6" />

In Canada, to some extent [[ringette]] serves as the female counterpart to ice hockey, in the sense that in many families, the boys play hockey while the girls play ringette.

===History===
{{See also|Canadian women's ice hockey history|History of women's ice hockey in the United States}}
Women are known to have played the game in the 19th century. Several games were recorded in the 1890s in [[Ottawa]], Canada. The women of Lord Stanley's family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at [[Rideau Hall]], the residence of Canada's Governor-General.

The game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres was billed as the first championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th Century and numerous women's teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons existed. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the  Ladies Ontario Hockey Association, and later, the Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association. Starting in the 1960s, the game spread to universities. Today, the game is played from youth through adult leagues, and in the universities of North America and internationally. There are two major women's hockey leagues, the [[National Women's Hockey League (2015–)|National Women's Hockey League]] with teams in the Northeastern United States which is a professional league and the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] with teams in Canada and the United States, which is semi-professional and is developing toward becoming a fully professional league.

The first women's world championship tournament, albeit unofficial, was held in 1987 in [[Toronto]], Canada. This was followed by the first IIHF World Championship in 1990 in Ottawa. Women's ice hockey was added as a medal sport at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano, Japan]]. The United States won the gold, Canada won the silver and Finland won the bronze medal.<ref name="Hunter 1998 Olympics">{{cite web|author=Andria Hunter|title=1998 Winter Olympics|url=http://www.whockey.com/int/olympics/1998/|accessdate=December 28, 2006}}</ref>

The [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) welcomed the first female professional hockey player in 1969–70, when the Marquette Iron Rangers signed [[Karen Koch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marquetteironrangers.com/kar.htm |title=Karen Koch |publisher=Marquette Iron Rangers |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> One woman, [[Manon Rhéaume]], has played in the NHL, as a goaltender for the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in pre-season games against the [[St. Louis Blues]] and the Boston Bruins. In 2003, [[Hayley Wickenheiser]] played with the [[Kirkkonummi]] [[HC Salamat|Salamat]] in the Finnish men's [[Suomi-sarja]] league. Several women have competed in North American minor leagues, including Rhéaume, goaltenders [[Kelly Dyer]] and Erin Whitten and defenceman [[Angela Ruggiero]].

===North America===

====National Hockey League (NHL)====
The NHL is by far the best attended and most popular ice hockey league in the world. The league's history began after Canada's [[National Hockey Association]] decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12 team league, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. As of 1979, the NHL had grown to 17 teams and merged with the WHA. This created a 21 team league.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/ice-hockey|title=Britannica|last=Fischler|first=Shirley|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> By 1999, the NHL had expanded to 30 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Hockey-League|title=National Hockey League (NHL)|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>

====Minor Leagues====
The [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), sometimes referred to as "The A,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/|title=Five AHL players to watch the rest of the season|publisher=}}</ref> is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 30 teams from the United States and Canada. It is run as a "farm league" to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The [[ECHL]] (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003–04 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams. The [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL) is a developmental minor league in the United States with no NHL affiliations. Most undrafted players get their start in the ECHL or SPHL.

====University Competitions====
In the United States especially, [[college hockey]] is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. 

====Junior Leagues====
In Canada, the [[Canadian Hockey League]] is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. It attracts players from Canada, the United States and Europe. 
In the United States, the [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are strictly amateur, so that they may play college hockey if they wish.

===Eurasia=== 
[[File:HC LEV Record O2.jpg|thumb|[[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]] match]]

====Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)====
The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in [[Eurasia]]. The league is the direct successor to the [[Russian Super League]], which in turn was the successor to the [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet League]], the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was [[2008–09 KHL season|launched in 2008]] with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other [[post-Soviet states]]. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the [[2011–12 KHL season|2011–12 season]], with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The number of teams has since increased to 28 from eight different countries.

====Minor Leagues====
The second division of hockey in Eurasia is the [[Supreme Hockey League]] (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL's function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the [[Russian Hockey League]], which features only teams from Russia. The [[Asia League Ice Hockey|Asia League]], an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the [[Japan Ice Hockey League]].

====Junior Leagues====
The highest junior league in Eurasia is the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|Junior Hockey League]] (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the [[Junior Hockey League Championships]] (MHL-B). 

===Europe===

Several countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The [[National League A]] in Switzerland, [[Swedish Hockey League]] in Sweden, [[Liiga]] in Finland, and [[Czech Extraliga]] in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries. 

====Champions Hockey League====
Beginning in the 2014–15 season, the [[Champions Hockey League]] was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams' domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the [[European Trophy]] and is related to the 2008-09 [[Champions Hockey League (2008–09)|tournament of the same name]].

====Other====
There are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. [[Season (sports)|Pre-season]] tournaments include the [[European Trophy]], [[Tampere Cup]] and the [[Pajulahti Cup]]. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the [[Spengler Cup]], held every year in [[Davos]], Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The [[Memorial Cup]], a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.

International club competitions organized by the IIHF include the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] and the European Women's Champions Cup. The [[World Junior Club Cup]] is an annual tournament of [[junior ice hockey]] clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.

===National Team Competitions===
[[File:Finlande Russie.jpg|thumb|Finland vs Russia in the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics 2006 in Turin]].]]

[[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Ice hockey]] has been played at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924 (and was played at the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|summer games in 1920]]). Canada won six of the first seven [[gold medal]]s to [[Ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics|1952]], the exception occurring in [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]] when Great Britain won. The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] won all but two gold medals from [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] to [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] as well as a final time as the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville Olympics]]. The United States won their first gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]]. On the way to winning the gold medal at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]] amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad – an event known as the "[[Miracle on Ice]]" in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1998 games in Nagano. The Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games. The [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games in Vancouver]] were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.

[[File:Eroeffnungsspiel eishockey wm 2010.jpg|thumb|[[2010 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|Ice Hockey World Championships 2010]] in Germany]]
National teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in the 1970s. Players are not paid to play in the tournament, but insurance and expenses are covered from the tournament revenues.

The [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] and [[1974 Summit Series]], two series pitting the best Canadian and [[Soviet]] players without IIHF restrictions were major successes, and established a rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]] tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and [[Rendez-vous '87]]. The Canada Cup tournament later became the [[World Cup of Hockey]], played in 1996 and 2004. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004.

Since the initial women's world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments.<ref name="IIHF WWC list" /> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name="Hunter 1998 Olympics" /> The [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden marked the only time the women's world championship or Olympic final did not involve both Canada and the United States.

Other ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World U20 Championship]], the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World U18 Championships]], the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]], the [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament]], the [[IIHF World Women's U18 Championships|World Women's U18 Championships]] and the [[4 Nations Cup]]. The annual [[Euro Hockey Tour]], an unofficial European championship between the national men's teams of the [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]] and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] have been played since 1996–97.

===Miscellaneous===

====Oceania====
The [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] and [[New Zealand Ice Hockey League]] are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the [[Trans-Tasman Champions League]].

====Pond hockey====
{{Main|Pond hockey}}
Pond hockey is a form of ice hockey played generally as pick-up hockey on lakes, ponds and artificial outdoor rinks during the winter. Pond hockey is commonly referred to in hockey circles as shinny. Its rules differ from traditional hockey because there is no hitting and very little shooting, placing a greater emphasis on skating, puckhandling and passing abilities. Since 2002, the [[World Pond Hockey Championship]] has been played on Roulston Lake in [[Plaster Rock]], New Brunswick, Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpondhockey.com/content/24959 |title=World Pond Hockey Championship – History of the World Pond Hockey Championships |publisher=Worldpondhockey.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Since 2006, the [[U.S. Pond Hockey Championships]] have been played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the [[Canadian National Pond Hockey Championships]] have been played in Huntsville, Ontario.

==Ice hockey in popular culture==
{{Main|Ice hockey in popular culture}}
Ice hockey is the [[Sports in Canada#Official sports|official winter sport of Canada]]. Ice hockey, partially because of its popularity as a major professional sport, has been a source of inspiration for numerous films, television episodes and songs in North American popular culture.

==Attendance records==
{{Main|List of ice hockey games with highest attendance}}
