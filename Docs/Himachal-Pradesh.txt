== History ==
{{Main||History of Himachal Pradesh}}
The history of the area that now constitutes Himachal Pradesh dates back to the time when the [[Indus valley civilisation]] flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE.<ref name="nichist">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tour/history.htm| title = History of Himachal Pradesh| accessdate = 31 March 2008| publisher = National informatics center, Himachal Pradesh |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121013200/http://himachal.nic.in/tour/history.htm |archivedate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Tribes such as the Koilis, Halis, Dagis, Dhaugris, Dasa, Khasas, Kinnars, and Kirats inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. During the [[Vedic period]], several small republics known as "Janapada" existed which were later conquered by the [[Gupta Empire]]. After a brief period of supremacy by King [[Harshavardhana]], the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some [[Rajput]] principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by [[Delhi Sultanate]] a number of times.<ref name="nichist" /> [[Mahmud Ghaznavi]] conquered [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] at the beginning of the 10th century. [[Timur]] and [[Sikander Lodi]] also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles.<ref name="nichist" /> Several hill states acknowledged [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] suzerainty and paid regular tribute to the Mughals.{{sfn|Verma|1995|pp = 28–35, ''Historical Perspective''}}

[[File:Sansar chand.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sansar Chand]] (c. 1765–1823)]]

The [[Gurkha]]s, a [[martial tribe]], came to power in [[Nepal]] in the year 1768.<ref name=nichist/> They consolidated their military power and began to expand their territory.<ref name=nichist/> Gradually, the Gorkhas annexed [[Sirmour]] and [[Shimla]]. Under the leadership of [[Amar Singh Thapa]], Gorkhas laid siege to Kangra. They managed to defeat [[Sansar Chand]] [[Katoch]], the ruler of Kangra, in 1806 with the help of many provincial chiefs. However, Gurkhas could not capture Kangra fort which came under [[Maharaja Ranjeet Singh]] in 1809.  After the defeat, the Gurkhas began to expand towards the south of the state.  However, Raja Ram Singh, Raja of Siba State managed to capture the fort of Siba from the remnants of Lahore Darbar in Samvat 1846,<ref name=nichist/> during the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]]. They came into direct conflict with the British along the ''[[tarai]]'' belt after which the British expelled them from the provinces of the [[Satluj]].<ref name=nichist/> The British gradually emerged as the paramount power.<ref name=nichist/> In the revolt of 1857, or first [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian war of independence]], arising from a number of grievances against the British,<ref name=nichist/> the people of the hill states were not as politically active as were those in other parts of the country.<ref name=nichist/> They and their rulers, with the exception of Bushahr, remained more or less inactive.<ref name=nichist/> Some, including the rulers of [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]], [[Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh|Bilaspur]], Bhagal and Dhami, rendered help to the British government during the revolt.

[[File:ROCK CUT TEMPLES, MASROOR.JPG|thumb|Rock Cut Temple, Masroor]]
The British territories came under the British Crown after [[Queen Victoria]]'s proclamation of 1858. The states of Chamba, [[Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India|Mandi]] and Bilaspur made good progress in many fields during the British rule.<ref name=nichist/> During [[World War I]], virtually all rulers of the hill states remained loyal and contributed to the British war effort, both in the form of men and materials. Among these were the states of [[Kangra district|Kangra]], Jaswan, Datarpur, Guler, [[Nurpur State|Nurpur]], Chamba, Suket, Mandi, and Bilaspur.<ref name=nichist/>

After independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudal princes and ''zaildars'') in the promontories of the western [[Himalaya]], known in full as the Simla Hills States and four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged into Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the [[Constitution of India]] and the Lieutenant Governor was appointed. The Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a [[union territory]] on 1 November 1956.<ref name=nichist/> Some areas of Punjab State—namely Simla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Kanungo circle of Pathankot tehsil of Gurdaspur District—were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament, and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the 18th state of the Indian Union.<ref name=nichist/>

== Geography and climate ==
Himachal is in the western [[Himalayas]]. Covering an area of {{convert|55673|km2|mi2}},<ref name=area/> it is a mountainous state. Most of the state lies on the foothills of the [[Dhauladhar]] Range. At 6,816 m [[Reo Purgyil]] is the highest mountain peak in the state of Himachal Pradesh.<ref name="wikimapia">{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/1468421/Reo-Purgyil-6816-m|title=Reo Purgyil, 6816 m|publisher=}}</ref>

The [[drainage]] system of Himachal is composed both of rivers and [[glacier]]s. Himalayan rivers criss-cross the entire mountain chain.
Himachal Pradesh provides water to both the [[Indus]] and [[Ganges]] [[Drainage basin|basins]].<ref name="geo3" /> The drainage systems of the region are the Chandra Bhaga or the [[Chenab]], the [[Ravi River|Ravi]], the [[Beas River|Beas]], the [[Sutlej]], and the [[Yamuna]]. These rivers are [[Perennial stream|perennial]] and are fed by snow and rainfall. They are protected by an extensive cover of natural vegetation.<ref name="geo3">{{cite web| url = http://www.webindia123.com/himachal/land/rivers.htm#R| title = Rivers in Himachal Pradesh| accessdate = 28 April 2006| publisher = Suni Systems (P)}}</ref>

Due to extreme variation in elevation,  great variation occurs in the climatic conditions of Himachal . The climate varies from hot and subhumid tropical in the southern tracts to, with more elevation, cold, alpine, and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges.<ref name="geo1">{{cite web| url = http://www.himachalpradesh.us/geography/himachal_climate.php| title = Climate of Himachal Pradesh| accessdate = 26 October 2006| publisher = himachalpradesh.us}}</ref> The state has areas like [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] that receive very heavy rainfall, as well as those like [[Lahaul and Spiti]] that are cold and almost rainless. Broadly, Himachal experiences three seasons: summer, winter, and rainy season. Summer lasts from mid-April till the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in the [[Alpine climate|alpine]] zone which experiences a mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from {{convert|28|to|32|°C|°F|0}}. Winter lasts from late November till mid March. [[Snowfall]] is common in alpine tracts (generally above {{convert|2200|m|ft|0}} i.e. in the higher and trans-Himalayan region).

The [[Legislative Assembly of Himachal Pradesh]] has no pre-Constitution history. The State itself is a post-Independence creation. It came into being as a centrally administered territory on 15 April 1948 from the integration of thirty erstwhile princely states.<ref name="gov1">{{cite web| url = http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/States/Himachal/himachal_w.htm| title = Himachal Pradesh (gov) Introduction| accessdate = 3 May 2007| work = National informatics center| publisher = Computer Centre, Lok Sabha Secretariat}}</ref>

Himachal Pradesh is governed through a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]], a feature the state shares with other Indian states. [[Universal suffrage]] is granted to residents. The legislature consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The [[judiciary]] is composed of the [[Himachal Pradesh High Court]] and a system of lower courts. [[executive (government)|Executive authority]] is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the [[:Category:Chief Ministers of Himachal Pradesh|Chief Minister]], although the titular head of government is the [[Governors of Himachal Pradesh|Governor]]. The Governor is the [[head of state]] appointed by the [[President of India]]. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is [[unicameral]] with 68 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLA).<ref name="295mla">{{cite web

The era of planning in Himachal Pradesh started in 1948 along with the rest of India. The first [[Five-year plans of India|five-year plan]] allocated {{INR}}52.7&nbsp;million to Himachal. More than 50% of this expenditure was incurred on road construction since it was felt that without proper transport facilities, the process of planning and development could not be carried to the people, who mostly lived an isolated existence in faraway areas. Himachal now ranks fourth in per capita income among the states of the [[Indian Union]].

[[Agriculture in Himachal Pradesh|Agriculture]] contributes over 45% to the net state domestic product. It is the main source of income and employment in Himachal.
