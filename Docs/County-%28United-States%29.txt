{{Administrative divisions of the United States}}

In the [[United States]], a '''county''' is a political and geographic subdivision of a [[U.S. state|state]], usually assigned some level of governmental authority.<ref name=NACO>{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/Overview.aspx|title=An Overview of County Government|work=[[National Association of Counties]]|accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> The term "county" is used in 48 of the 50 U.S. states.<ref name=NACO/> The exceptions are [[Louisiana]] and [[Alaska]], where the functionally equivalent subdivisions are called, respectively, [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parishes]] and [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]. Numerous [[Consolidated city–county|consolidated city–counties]] exist throughout the U.S. in which a city has merged with its county to form one unified jurisdiction with the governmental powers of both entities.

The [[U.S. federal government]] uses the term "county equivalent" to describe non-county administrative or statistical areas that are comparable to counties. Louisiana parishes; the organized boroughs of Alaska<!-- No, not the boroughs of New York City. These are coextensive with counties and are therefore by definition not county equivalents. -->; the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]; and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent cities]] of the states of [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], and [[Nevada]] are equivalent to counties for administrative purposes. Alaska's [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]] is divided into [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|11 census areas]] that are statistically equivalent to counties. As of 2013, the United States has 3,007 counties and 137 county equivalents for a total of 3,144 counties and county equivalents.<ref name=PopEstCounties>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2012/CO-EST2012-alldata.html|title=County Totals Datasets: Population, Population Change and Estimated Components of Population Change: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|work=2012 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=March 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref>

The number of counties per state ranges from the [[List of counties in Delaware|3 counties]] of [[Delaware]] to the [[List of counties in Texas|254 counties]] of [[Texas]].

Counties still have significant governmental functions in all states except [[Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut]], where all county governments have been abolished. The [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] has removed most government functions from [[List of counties in Massachusetts|eight of its 14 counties]].

The county with the largest population, [[Los Angeles County]] (10,170,292),<ref name=popest>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2015/PEPANNRES/0400000US06.05000|title=American Fact Finder - Results|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> and the county with the largest land area ([[San Bernardino County]]) border each other in Southern California.

==History==
Counties were among the earliest units of local government established in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would become the United States. [[Virginia]] created the first counties in order to ease the administrative workload in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. The [[House of Burgesses]] divided the colony first into four "incorporations" in 1617 and finally into [[Shires of Virginia|eight shires]] (or counties) in 1634: [[James City County, Virginia|James City]], [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico]], [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City]], [[York County, Virginia|Charles River]], [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Warrosquyoake]], [[Accomack County, Virginia|Accomac]], [[Elizabeth City County, Virginia|Elizabeth City]], and [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick River]].<ref name="Virginia">Harch, Charles E., The First Seventeen years, Virginia, 1607-1624, Jamestown 350th Anniversary Historical, 1957, p.20, pp.75-76, http://www.virginiaplaces.org/vacount/howstart.html.</ref> America's oldest intact county court records can be found at [[Eastville, Virginia]], in [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton (originally Accomac) County]], dating to 1632.<ref name="Eastville">http://www.co.northampton.va.us/gov/oldcourthouse.html.</ref> [[Maryland]] established its first county, [[Saint Mary's County, Maryland|St. Mary's]], in 1637, and [[Massachusetts]] followed in 1643. [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York]] delegated significant power and responsibility from state government to county governments and thereby established a pattern for most of the United States, although counties remained relatively weak in [[New England]].<ref name="Reynolds">Osborne M. Reynolds, Jr., ''Local Government Law'', 3rd ed. (St. Paul: West, 2009), 19.</ref>

When [[Independence Day (United States)|independence]] came, "the [[framers of the Constitution]] did not provide for local governments. Rather, they left the matter to the states. Subsequently, early state constitutions generally conceptualized county government as an arm of the state." In the twentieth century, the role of local governments strengthened and counties began providing more services.<ref>{{cite web |title=Learn About What Counties Do |url=http://www.naco.org/counties/learn-about-what-counties-do |work=National Association of Counties |accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>

==County variations==

===Consolidated city-counties===
{{main|Consolidated city-county}}
A consolidated city-county is simultaneously a city, which is a [[municipality]] (municipal corporation), and a county, which is an [[administrative division]] of a state, having the powers and responsibilities of both types of entities. There are 40 consolidated city-counties in the U.S.,<ref name=NACO/> including [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]; [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]; [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; and [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]].

Similarly, some of [[Alaska|Alaska's]] boroughs have merged with their principal cities creating unified city-boroughs. Some such consolidations and mergers have created cities that rank among the geographically largest cities in the world, though often with population densities far below those of most urban areas.

===County equivalents===
The term ''county equivalents'' is used to describe divisions whose organization differs from that of most counties:

* Alaska [[census areas]]: Most of the land area of Alaska is not contained within any of Alaska's 19 organized boroughs. This vast area, larger than [[France]] and [[Germany]] combined, is officially referred to by the Alaska state government as the ''[[Unorganized Borough]]'', and, outside of other incorporated borough limits, has no independent "county" government, although several incorporated city governments exist within its boundaries; the majority of it is governed and run by the State of Alaska as an extension of state government.{{Cref|A}} The [[United States Census Bureau]], in cooperation with the Alaska state government for census and electoral districting purposes, has divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas for statistical purposes only.{{Cref|B}}
*[[independent city (United States)|Independent cities]]: These are cities that legally belong to no county. They differ from consolidated city-counties—where a city and county have been merged into one unified [[jurisdiction]]. {{as of|2013|7}}, there are 41 such cities in the United States, including [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Carson City, Nevada]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; and all 38 cities in [[Virginia]], where any area incorporated as a city is outside of the county jurisdiction.<ref name="VaPop">[http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/CommissiononLocalGovernment/PDFs/Locality-Populations.pdf "Population and Area of All Virginia Local Governments, 1790-2010".] Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development website. 19 April 2012. Retrieved 25 January 2013.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/co_metadata.html | title=County & County Equivalent Areas |work= [[United States Census Bureau]] |date= April 19, 2005 |accessdate= 2007-12-08}}</ref>
*[[Washington, D.C.]],<ref>http://www.census.gov/geo/www/fips/fips65/download.html  {{wayback|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/fips/fips65/download.html |date=20090429034204 }}</ref> outside the jurisdiction of any state, has a special status. The city of Washington comprises the entirety of the [[District of Columbia]], which, in accordance with Article 1, Section 8 of the [[U.S. Constitution]], is under the jurisdiction of the [[U.S. Congress]]. When founded, the District was in fact divided into two counties and two independent cities. [[Alexandria County, Virginia|Alexandria County]] (which now forms [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] and a portion of the independent city of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]) was given back to Virginia in 1846, while the three remaining entities (the City of Washington, [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown City]], and [[Washington County, D.C.|Washington County]]) were merged into a consolidated government by an act of Congress in 1871 and Georgetown was formally abolished as a city entity by another act in 1895.

[[Consolidated city-county|Consolidated city-counties]] are not designated county-equivalents for administrative purposes; since both the city and the county at least nominally exist, they are properly classified as counties in their own right. The same is true of the [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs of New York City]], each of which is coextensive with a county of New York State.

====Territories====

There are no counties per se in U.S. territories, most are directly divided into municipalities or similar units, which are sometimes treated as equivalent of counties for statistical purposes:

* [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico]]
* [[List of populated places in Guam|Villages of Guam]]
* [[Districts and sub-districts of the United States Virgin Islands|Districts of the United States Virgin Islands]]
* [[Administrative divisions of American Samoa|Districts and unorganized atolls of American Samoa]]

==Organization==
The site of a county's administration, and often the county [[courthouse]], is called the [[county seat]] ("parish seat" in Louisiana, or "borough seat" in Alaska). Several [[New England]] counties use the term "[[shire town]]" for the county seat.

Many counties are divided into smaller political or governmental units. In Northeastern and Midwestern states, counties are divided into [[civil townships]] (or "towns" in New England, New York, and Wisconsin), which may provide governmental or public services.

==County names==
{{see also|Lists of U.S. county name etymologies}}
Common sources of county names are names of people, geographic features, places in other states or countries, Native American tribes, and animals. Quite a few counties bear names of French or Spanish origin.<ref name="Kane 2004 vii-xii">{{cite book |title=The American Counties: Origins of County Names, Dates of Creation, and Population Data, 1950-2000  |last=Kane |first=Joseph Nathan |authorlink= |author2=Charles Curry Aiken |year=2004 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc |location= |isbn=978-0-8108-5036-1 |oclc= |page=vii-xii |url= |accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>

Counties are most often named for people, often political figures or early settlers, with over 2,100 of the 3,140 total so named. The most common county name, with 31, is [[Washington County (disambiguation)|Washington County]], for America's first president, [[George Washington]]. Up until 1871, there was a [[Washington County, D.C.|Washington County]] within the [[District of Columbia]], but it was dissolved by the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|District of Columbia Organic Act]]. Jefferson County, for [[Thomas Jefferson]], is next with 27. The most recent president to have [[Harding County, New Mexico|a county]] named for him was [[Warren G. Harding]], reflecting the slowing rate of county creation since [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] became states in 1912. The most common names for counties not named after presidents are [[Franklin County (disambiguation)|Franklin]] (25), [[Clay County (disambiguation)|Clay]] (18), and [[Montgomery County (disambiguation)|Montgomery]] (18).

After people, the next most common source of county names are geographic features and locations, with some counties even being named after counties in other states, or for places in countries such as the United Kingdom. The most common geographic county name is [[Lake County (disambiguation)|Lake]]. Native American tribes and animals lend their names to some counties. Quite a few counties bear names of French or Spanish origin, such as [[Marquette County (disambiguation)|Marquette County]] being named after French missionary [[Jacques Marquette|Father Jacques Marquette]].<ref name="Kane 2004 vii-xii"/>

The county's equivalent in the state of Louisiana, the [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] (Fr. ''paroisse civile'' and Sp. ''parroquia'') took its name during the state's French and Spanish colonial periods. Before the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and granting of statehood, government was often administered in towns where major church [[parish]]es were located. Of the original 19 civil parishes of Louisiana that date from statehood in 1807, nine were named after the Roman Catholic parishes from which they were governed.

==County government==
The powers of counties arise from state law and vary widely.<ref>Osborne M. Reynolds, Jr., ''Handbook of Local Government Law'', 2nd ed. (St. Paul, MN: West Group, 2001), 26.</ref>

counties are geographic entities, but not governmental jurisdictions.

In most Midwestern and Northeastern states, counties are further subdivided into [[Civil township|townships]] or [[New England town|towns]], which sometimes exercise local powers or administration. Throughout the United States, counties may contain other independent, self-governing [[municipality|municipalities]].

Counties are usually governed by an elected body, variously called the [[county commission]], [[board of supervisors]], [[commissioners' court]], [[county council]], [[board of chosen freeholders]], [[county court]], or [[Administrative divisions of New York#County|county Legislature]]. In some counties, there is a [[county executive]]. In cases in which a [[consolidated city-county]] or [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] exists, a [[City Council]] usually governs city/county or city affairs.

In many states, the board in charge of a county holds powers that transcend all three traditional branches of government. It has the legislative power to enact ordinances for the county; it has the executive power to oversee the executive operations of county government; and it has quasi-judicial power with regard to certain limited matters (such as hearing appeals from the planning commission if one exists).

The day-to-day operations of the county government are sometimes overseen by an elected [[county executive]] or by a chief administrative officer or [[county administrator]] who reports to the board, the mayor, or both.

In many states, several important officials are elected separately from the board of commissioners or supervisors and cannot be fired by the board. These positions may include [[Clerk (municipal official)|county clerk]], county [[treasurer]], county surrogate, [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], and others. 

[[District attorney]]s or state attorneys are usually state-level as opposed to county-level officials, but in many states, counties and state judicial districts have coterminous boundaries.

==Scope of power==
The power of county governments varies widely from state to state, as does the relationship between counties and incorporated cities. The government of the county usually resides in a municipality called the county seat. However, some counties may have multiple seats or no seat. In some counties with no incorporated municipalities, a large settlement may serve as the county seat.

===Minimal scope===
In New England, counties function at most as judicial court districts and [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff's departments]] (presently, in [[Connecticut]] only as judicial court districts—and in [[Rhode Island]], they have lost both those functions and all others), and most of the governmental authority below the state level is in the hands of [[New England town|towns and cities]]. In several of Maine's sparsely populated counties, small towns rely on the county for law enforcement, and in [[New Hampshire]] several social programs are administered at the state level. In Connecticut, parts of Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, counties are now only geographic designations, and they do not have any governmental powers. All government is either done at the state level or at the municipal level. In Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts, regional councils have been established to partially fill the void left behind by the abolished county governments.<ref>Unlike in Massachusetts, Connecticut's regional councils do not conform to the old county lines, but rather, they are composed of towns that share the same geographic region and have similar demographics.</ref> The regional councils' authority is limited compared with a county government—they have authority only over infrastructure and land use planning, distribution of state and federal funds for infrastructure projects, emergency preparedness, and limited law enforcement duties.

===Moderate scope===
In the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Midwest]], counties typically provide, at a minimum, courts, [[public utility|public utilities]], libraries, hospitals, [[public health]] services, parks, roads, law enforcement, and jails. There is usually a county registrar, recorder, or clerk (the exact title varies) who collects [[Vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]], holds elections (sometimes in coordination with a separate elections office or commission), and prepares or processes certificates of births, deaths, marriages, and dissolutions (divorce decrees). The county recorder normally maintains the official record of all real estate transactions. Other key county officials include the [[coroner]]/[[medical examiner]], [[treasurer]], [[assessor (property)|assessor]], [[auditor]], [[Comptroller|controller]], and [[district attorney]].

In most states, the [[Sheriffs in the United States|county sheriff]] is the chief law enforcement officer in the county. However, except in major emergencies where clear chains of command are essential, the county sheriff normally does not directly control the police departments of city governments, but merely cooperates with them (e.g., under [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] pacts). Thus, the most common interaction between county and city law enforcement personnel is when city police officers deliver suspects to sheriff's deputies for detention or incarceration in the county jail.

In virtually all U.S. states, the [[State court (United States)|state court]]s and local law enforcement are organized and implemented along county boundaries, but nearly all of the substantive and procedural law adjudicated in state trial courts originates from the state legislature and state appellate courts. In other words, most criminal defendants are prosecuted for violations of state law, not local ordinances, and if they, the district attorney, or police seek reforms to the criminal justice system, they will usually have to direct their efforts towards the state legislature rather than the county (which merely implements state law). A typical criminal defendant will be arraigned and subsequently indicted or held over for trial before a trial court in and for a particular county where the crime occurred, kept in the county jail (if he is not granted bail or cannot make bail), prosecuted by the county's district attorney, and tried before a jury selected from that county. But long-term incarceration is rarely a county responsibility, execution of [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] is never a county responsibility, and the state's responses to prisoners' appeals is the responsibility of the [[state attorney general]], who has to defend before the state appellate courts the prosecutions conducted by locally elected district attorneys in the name of the state. Furthermore, county-level trial court judges are officers of the judicial branch of the state government rather than county governments.

In many states, the county controls all [[unincorporated area|unincorporated lands]] within its boundaries. In states with a township tier, unincorporated land is controlled by the townships. Residents of unincorporated land who are dissatisfied with county-level or township-level resource allocation decisions can attempt to vote to incorporate as a [[city]], [[town]], or [[village]].

A few counties directly provide [[public transport]]ation themselves, usually in the form of a simple bus system. However, in most counties, public transportation is provided by one of the following: a [[special-purpose district]] that is coterminous with the county (but exists separately from the county government), a multi-county regional transit authority, or a state agency.

===Broad scope===
In [[Western United States|western]] and [[Southern United States|southern]] states, more populated counties provide many facilities, such as airports, [[convention center]]s, museums, [[Community centre|recreation centers]],
beaches, harbors, zoos, clinics, [[law library|law libraries]], and [[public housing]]. They provide services such as child and family services, elder services, mental health services, welfare services, veterans assistance services, [[Animal control officer|animal control]], [[probation]] supervision, historic preservation, food safety regulation, and environmental health services. They have many additional officials like [[public defender]]s, arts commissioners, human rights commissioners, and planning commissioners. Finally, there may also be a county fire department and even a county police department (as distinguished from fire and police departments operated by individual cities, special districts, or the state government). For example, [[Gwinnett County, Georgia]], and its county seat, the city of [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville]], each have their own police departments. (A separate county sheriff's department is responsible for security of the county courts and administration of the county jail.) In several southern states, [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] systems are organized and administered at the county level.

==Statistics==
{{as of|2013|07|01|alt=As of 2013}}, there were 3,007 counties, [[List of parishes in Louisiana|64 parishes]], [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|19 organized boroughs]], [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|11 census areas]], [[Independent city (United States)|41 independent cities]],<ref>Prior to July 1, 2013, there were 42 independent cities.

[[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states generally tend to have more counties than [[Western United States|Western]] or [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] states, as many Northeastern states are not large enough in area to warrant a large number of counties, and many Western states were sparsely populated when counties were created. The [[List of counties in Rhode Island|five counties]] of [[Rhode Island]], the [[List of counties in Connecticut|eight counties]] of [[Connecticut]], and [[List of counties in Massachusetts|eight of the 14 counties]] of [[Massachusetts]] no longer have functional county governments, but continue to exist as legal and census entities.

At the [[2000 U.S. Census]], the [[median]] land area of U.S. counties was {{convert|622|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, which is two-thirds of the median land area of a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county of England]], and a little more than a quarter of the median land area of a French ''[[département]]''. Counties in the western United States typically have a much larger land area than those in the eastern United States. For example, the median land area of counties in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] is {{convert|343|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, whereas in [[Utah]] it is {{convert|2,427|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.

The most extensive county or county-equivalent is the [[Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska]], with a land area of 145,505&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (376,856&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). All nine of the most extensive county-equivalents are in Alaska. The most extensive county is [[San Bernardino County, California]], with a land area of 20,057&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (51,947&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). The least extensive county is [[Kalawao County, Hawaii]], with a land area of 11.991&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (31.058&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). The least extensive county-equivalent is the [[independent city|independent]] [[Falls Church, Virginia|City of Falls Church, Virginia]], with a land area of 1.999&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (5.177&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).<ref name=NACO/>

==Geographic relationships between cities and counties==

In some states, a municipality may reside in only one county and may not annex territory in adjacent counties, but in the majority of states, the state constitution or state law allows municipalities to extend across county boundaries. At least 32 states include [[List of U.S. cities in multiple counties|municipalities in multiple counties]]. [[Dallas]] and [[Oklahoma City]], for example, both contain portions of five counties. [[New York City]] is an unusual case because it encompasses multiple counties in one city. The city comprises five counties in their entirety, each coextensive with one of the five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of the city: [[Manhattan]] (New York County), [[The Bronx]] (Bronx County), [[Queens]] (Queens County), [[Brooklyn]] (Kings County), and [[Staten Island]] (Richmond County).
