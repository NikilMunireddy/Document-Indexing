The '''Australian Broadcasting Corporation''' ('''ABC''') is [[Australia]]'s state-owned and funded national [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]].  It plays a leading role in the [[history of broadcasting in Australia]].  With a total annual budget of A$1.22&nbsp;billion,<ref name="budgetreport">Retrieved 4 December 2013 [http://www.budget.gov.au/2012-13/content/bp4/html/bp4_ar_04_dbcde.htm Budget Paper No. 4 2012–2013]</ref> the corporation provides television, radio, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia, as well as overseas through the [[Australia Network]] and [[Radio Australia]] and is well regarded for quality and reliability as well as for offering educational and cultural programming that the commercial sector would be unlikely to supply on its own.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brian McNair and Adam Swift|title=What would the Australian media look like without the ABC?|journal=The Conversation|date=18 March 2014|url=https://theconversation.com/what-would-the-australian-media-look-like-without-the-abc-24033|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

Founded in 1929 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], it was subsequently made a state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932, as the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''<ref name="abc-act83" /> changed the name of the organisation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, effective 1 July 1983.<ref name="abc-act83" /> Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains [[editorial independence|editorially independent]] as ensured through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983.<ref name="abc-act83" />

Following a 1927 [[royal commission]] inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations. It also nationalised the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations.<ref name="langdon95" /> On 1 July 1932, the Australian Broadcasting Commission was established, taking over the operations of the National Broadcasting Service and eventually establishing offices in each of Australia's capital cities.<ref name="langdon95" /><ref name=ABC010712>{{cite web |title=ABC celebrates 80 years of broadcasting|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date= 1 July 2012|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-01/abc-celebrates-80-years/4103108

Cater argues that reform was urgently needed in 1945:
: By the end of World War II, the ABC was a decadent, hollow institution.  Its authority had been compromised by a poorly drafted charter and further undermined by timid management, poor governance and creeping wartime censorship. In April 1945, [[Richard Boyer (broadcaster)|Boyer]] refused to accept the post of chairman until [[John Curtin|Prime Minister Curtin]] issued a mandate of independence which Boyer drafted itself.  The ABC under Boyer and general manager [[Charles Moses]] invested as best it could in the cultural capital of the nation, establishing viable symphony orchestras and seizing on the potential of television.... [Boyer's] neutrality was never seriously questioned.<ref>Nick Cater, ''The Lucky Culture and the Rise of an Australian Ruling Class '' (2013) p 201</ref>

[[File:Jamesdibble.jpg|thumb|[[James Dibble]], reading the first [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] television bulletin in NSW, 1956]]
The ABC commenced television broadcasting in 1956, and followed the earlier radio practice of naming the station after the first letter of the base state. [[ABN-2]] (New South Wales) Sydney was inaugurated by Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] on 5 November 1956, with the first broadcast presented by [[Michael Charlton]], and [[James Dibble]] reading the first television news bulletin.<ref>Australian Broadcasting Corporation, [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/history/galpost9.htm "About the ABC: History of the ABC: James Dibble"]. Retrieved 3 September 2008.</ref> [[ABV-2]] (Melbourne, Victoria) followed two weeks later, on 18 November 1956. Stations in other capital cities followed: [[ABQ-2]] (Brisbane, Queensland) (1959), [[ABS-2]] (Adelaide, South Australia) (1960), [[ABW-2]] (Perth, Western Australia) (1960), and [[ABT-2]] (Hobart, Tasmania) (1960). [[ABC-9|ABC-3]] Canberra opened in 1961, and [[ABD-6]] (Darwin, Northern Territories) started broadcasting in 1971, both named after the base city.

Although radio programs could be distributed nationally by [[landline]], television relay facilities were not in place until the early 1960s.<ref name="abc-50s">{{cite web

In 1973 [[New South Wales Rugby League]] boss [[Kevin Humphreys (rugby league)|Kevin Humphreys]] negotiated rugby league's first television deal with the ABC.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rothfield|first1=Phil|title=NRL now generates more money per minute than AFL|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-now-generates-more-money-per-minute-than-afl/story-fndujljl-1226455280731|accessdate=22 August 2014|work=news.com.au|publisher=News Ltd|date=21 August 2012}}</ref>
In 1975, colour television was introduced into Australia, and within a decade the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally. In the same year, the ABC introduced a 24-hour-a-day AM rock station in Sydney, 2JJ ([[Double Jay (radio network)|Double Jay]]), which was eventually expanded into the national [[Triple J]] FM network.<ref name="abc-60s70s" /> A year later, a national classical music network was established on the [[frequency modulation|FM]] band, broadcasting from Adelaide. It was initially known as ABC-FM (now called [[ABC Classic FM]]) – referring both to its 'fine music' programming and radio frequency.<ref name="abc-60s70s">{{cite web

ABC budget cuts began in 1976 and continued until 1985. In 1978 the ABC NSW Staff Association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference. Sydney ABC was off air for four days.<ref>Molomby, Tom, ''Is there a moderate on the roof?

===1980s–90s===
The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''<ref name = "abc-act83"/> changed the name of the organisation from the "Australian Broadcasting Commission" to the "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", effective 1 July 1983.<ref name="abc-act83" /> At the same time, the newly formed Corporation underwent significant restructuring. The ABC was split into separate television and radio divisions, with an overhaul of management, finance, property and engineering.<ref name="abc-80s" /> [[Geoffrey Whitehead (communications)|Geoffrey Whitehead]]<ref>[http://bookstore.iuniverse.com/Products/SKU-000538367/Tending-the-Flame-of-Democracy.aspx 2012 publication by Geoffrey Whitehead "Tending the Flame of Democracy"] retrieved 26 June 2013</ref> was the initial managing director; however, following his resignation in 1986, [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] (at the time chair of the ABC Board) took over his position.

Program production in [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded, while the Corporation's output of drama was boosted.<ref name="abc-80s" /> Local production trebled from 1986–91 with the assistance of co-production, co-financing, and pre-sales arrangements.<ref name="abc-80s">{{cite web | title = About the ABC – The 80s

A new Concert Music Department was formed in 1985 to co-ordinate the corporation's six symphony orchestras, which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs.<ref name="abc-80s" /> Open-air free concerts and tours, educational activities, and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the orchestras' audience reach.<ref name="abc-80s" />

ABC Radio was restructured significantly again in 1985 – Radio One became the Metropolitan network, while Radio 2 became known as [[Radio National]] (callsigns, however, were not standardised until 1990). New programs such as ''The World Today'', ''Australia All Over'', and ''The Coodabeen Champions'' were introduced, while [[ABC Classic FM|ABC-FM]] established an Australian Music Unit in 1989.<ref name="abc-80s" /> [[Radio Australia]] began to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, with coverage targeted at the south west and central Pacific, south-east Asia, and north Asia. Radio Australia also carried more news coverage, with special broadcasts during the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|1987 Fijian coup]], [[Tiananmen Square massacre]], and the [[First Gulf War]].<ref name="abc-80s" />

[[File:ABC Sydney.jpg|thumb|The ABC's Sydney headquarters in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]]]

The ABC Multimedia Unit was established in July 1995, to manage the new ABC website (launched in August). Funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content, as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content. The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results.<ref name="abc-90s" />

By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24-hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters.<ref name="abc-90s" /> Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990.<ref name="abc-90s" /> [[ABC NewsRadio]], a continuous news network broadcast on the [[Parliamentary and News Network]] when parliament is not sitting, was launched on 5 October 1994.<ref name="abc-90s" />

International television service [[Australia Television International]] was established in 1993, while at the same time Radio Australia increased its international reach.<ref name="abc-90s" /> Reduced funding in 1997 for Radio Australia resulted in staff and programming cuts.<ref name="abc-90s" />

''Australia Television'' was sold to the [[Seven Network]] in 1998, however the service continued to show [[ABC News and Current Affairs|ABC news and current affairs programming]] up until its closure in 2001.<ref name="mr">{{cite web

===2000s===
In 2001, digital television commenced after four years of preparation.<ref name="abc-00s" /> In readiness, the ABC had fully digitised its production, post-production and transmission facilities – heralded at the time as "the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour".<ref name="abc-00s" /> The first programmes to be produced in widescreen were drama series ''[[Something in the Air (TV series)|Something in the Air]]'', ''[[Grass Roots (TV series)|Grass Roots]]'' and ''In the Mind of the Architect''.

At the same time, the ABC's Multimedia division was renamed "ABC New Media", becoming an output division of the ABC alongside Television and Radio.<ref name="abc-00s" /> Legislation allowed the ABC to provide 'multichannels' – additional, digital-only, television services managed by the New Media Division. Soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids channel]] launched, showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children.

In 2002, the ABC launched [[Australia Network|ABC Asia Pacific]] – the replacement for the defunct Australia Television International operated previously by the Seven Network. Much like its predecessor, and companion radio network [[Radio Australia]], the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of Fly TV and the ABC Kids channel.

The ABC launched a digital radio service, [[ABC DiG]], in November 2002, available though the internet and digital television, but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until [[DAB+]] became available in 2009.

[[File:Abc2promo.jpg|thumb|[[ABC2]] launched on 7 March 2005]]
[[ABC2]], a second attempt at a digital-only television channel, launched on 7 March 2005.

A high incidence of breast cancer in female staff working at the ABC's offices in Brisbane led to the closure of the site, based in [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]], on 21 December 2006.

===Funding===
The ABC is funded mainly by the Australian government, in addition to some revenue received from [[ABC Commercial|its retail outlets]]. In the 2006–07 [[Australian federal budget|federal budget]], the ABC received [[Australian dollar|A$]]823&nbsp;million of government funding,<ref>{{cite web | title = ABC Budget 2006–2007 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/documents/budget2006-07.pdf | author=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | format = PDF | accessdate =18 June 2007}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> increased to $840&nbsp;million in 2008–09.<ref name="budgetreport" /> In the 2009–10 federal budget, the ABC received funding of $929.9 million.<ref>{{cite web | title = ABC Annual Report 2009–2010 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/corp/annual_reports/ar10/pdf/ar2009_10_financial_statements.pdf | author=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | format = PDF | accessdate =29 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>

Until 1948, the ABC was funded directly by radio licence fees; amendments were also made to the ''Australian Broadcasting Act'' that meant the ABC would receive its funding directly from the federal government. Licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor government, on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.<ref name="whoseabc" />

In relation to impartiality and diversity of perspectives, the current ABC editorial policy requires of the broadcaster that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ABCoverview|title=The ABC: an overview|publisher=Parliament of Australia|date=11 August 2014|accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref>

==== Criticisms ====

As a publicly funded broadcaster, the ABC is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues, and is required to present a range of views with impartiality. Over the decades, accusations of "bias" at the ABC have arisen at different times, and various inquiries undertaken.

Reviews of the ABC are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released.<ref name=Martin>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Fiona|title=What would be the point of yet another ABC inquiry?|url=http://theconversation.com/what-would-be-the-point-of-yet-another-abc-inquiry-21213|publisher=The Conversation|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=12 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=Gordon>{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Michael|title=Canberra refuses to release report on ABC funding|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/canberra-refuses-to-release-report-on-abc-funding-20140305-347l7.html|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=6 March 2014}}</ref> A 2004 [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] media credibility survey found that media professionals regarded [[ABC Radio and Regional Content|ABC Radio]] as the most accurate news source in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20040903.pdf |title=10,13_tr66_media |format=PDF |accessdate=26 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090914061917/http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20040903.pdf |archivedate=14 September 2009 }}</ref> In mid 2013 the [[University of the Sunshine Coast]] released a study of the professional views of journalists.

Dr Rhonda Jolly's 2014 ABC Overview noted that "many commentators have argued consistently that there is a left wing bias which dominates ABC news and programming" and cited a 2005 piece by Paul Gray that the broadcaster was overly influenced by the "narrow middle-class values of the Australian secular Left" and said that "while the national broadcaster had at times offended governments of all persuasions, it had always adopted a 'from the Left' perspective." Jolly also noted however that supporters of the ABC "deny claims that the broadcaster is either intentionally or inadvertently biased" and that "Speaking from opposition, politicians have praised the ABC for its scrutiny of government." The paper noted that, in December 2013, ABC chairman James Spigelman called four independent audits a year in response to the frequent allegations of lack of impartiality in news and current affairs.<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ABCoverview#_Toc395086092 The AVC: An Overview]; http://www.aph.gov.au; 11 August 2014</ref>

Lateline host [[Maxine McKew]] (pictured) ran for Labor against Liberal Prime Minister [[John Howard]] in the 2007 Election.]] 

For much of the [[Howard Government]] years, ABC TV's masthead political programs were anchored by Labor affiliated journalists Kerry O'Brien, [[Barrie Cassidy]] and [[Maxine McKew]]. ''[[7.30 Report]]'' and ''[[Insiders (TV program)|Insiders]]'' were hosted by former Labor staffers Kerry O'Brien and Barrie Cassidy respectively, while the 2007 election saw ''Lateline'' host McKew defeat Liberal Prime Minister [[John Howard]] as the Labor candidate for the seat of Bennelong. At that same election, Liberal front bencher [[Joe Hockey]] was challenged unsuccessfully by ABC Sydney News weatherman turned Labor candidate [[Mike Bailey (weatherman)|Mike Bailey]] in the Seat of North Sydney.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/weatherman-bailey-labors-newest-recruit/2007/05/22/1179601361057.html Weatherman Bailey Labor's newest recruit]; May 22, 2007</ref>

Of the 1996 prime ministerial Election debates between Opposition Leader [[John Howard]] and Labor Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]], Howard later wrote: "I flatly refused to have Kerry O'Brien of the ABC [moderate the debates] because of the way he had handled the second Keating-[[John Hewson|Hewson]] debate in 1993" in which O'Brien "went in to bat" for Keating.<ref>John Howard; ''Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography''; Harper Collins; 2010; pp. 194 & 223</ref> Howard went on to win that election. A decade later, the ABC Media Watch program reported that NSW Liberal Senator [[Concetta Fierravanti-Wells]] had written to her constituents to say that the ABC had "a collective loathing" of [[John Howard]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The ABC of How To Complain |url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1771608.htm |year=2006 |accessdate=8 February 2008}}</ref> At the end of the [[Howard Government]]'s term in 2007, left-wing political commentator [[Robert Manne]] wrote in ''The Monthly'' that the Howard Government had viewed the broadcaster as being run by "left-wing ideologues" who had "supposedly pushed the agenda of the Left on issues like refugees, the republic, multiculturalism, reconciliation, radical feminism, extreme environmentalism, anti-Americanism, gay rights and so on."<ref name=NewTeethForAunty/>

===== Abbott-Turnbull Government =====

Liberal Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] perceived the ABC to be left wing and hostile to [[Abbott Government|his government]], while his successor [[Malcolm Turnbull]] enjoyed better relations with the National Broadcaster. When the ABC co-operated with ''The Guardian'' to publish [[Edward Snowden|stolen documents]] purporting to reveal monitoring of Indonesian officials by Australian spy agencies under the [[Rudd Government (2013)|Rudd Government]], Abbott told 2GB radio: "A lot of people feel at the moment that the ABC instinctively takes everyone's side but Australia's".<ref>{{cite web|last=Pearlman|first=Jonathan|title=Tony Abbott says ABC unpatriotic|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/10604115/Tony-Abbott-says-ABC-unpatriotic.html|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=29 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Australia's Tony Abbott calls broadcaster ABC unpatriotic|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25925312|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=29 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-29/tony-abbott-steps-up-criticism-of-abc/5224676|title=Prime Minister Tony Abbott says ABC not on Australia's side in interview with 2GB|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref>  Abbott reportedly called the ''Q&A'' program a "Lefty Lynch Mob".<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/tony-abbott-calls-qa-a-lefty-lynch-mob-as-abc-agrees-to-external-review-of-the-show/news-story/f2a708455ee73c79a4db75e2563130a5 Tony Abbott reportedly calls Q&A a ‘lefty lynch mob’, as ABC agrees to external review of the show]; news.com.au; 24 June, 2015</ref> When it invited a man convicted of threatening Commonwealth officials to participate in questioning one of his ministers amid a heightened terrorism alert in June 2015, Abbott asks the makers of the program: "whose side are you on?".<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/whose-side-are-you-on-tony-abbott-lashes-abcs-qa-program-20150623-ghvd0l.html#ixzz48n1mfY00 'Whose side are you on?'

In a March 2016 interview with ABC Managing Director Mark Scott, ''Media Watch'' host Paul Barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the ABC. Scott noted that while perhaps the ABC was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices, he did not accept the criticism of bias because "a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the ABC. We don’t do that kind of journalism. We don’t ask questions about our journalists’ voting pattern and where their ideology are.

==Services==

===Radio===
[[File:ABC Building South Bank.jpg|thumb |right|[[612 ABC Brisbane|ABC Brisbane headquarters in South Bank]]]]

{{Main|ABC Radio and Regional Content}}
The ABC operates 54 local radio stations, in addition to four national networks and international service [[Radio Australia]]. In addition, [[ABC DiG|DiG Radio]] launched on digital platforms in 2002, currently offering three separate stations.

[[ABC Local Radio]] is the Corporation's flagship radio station in each broadcast area. There are 54 individual stations, each with a similar format consisting of locally presented light entertainment, news, talk back, music, sport and interviews, in addition to some national programming such as ''AM'', ''PM'', ''[[The World Today (Australian radio programme)|The World Today]]'', sporting events and ''Nightlife''.

[[ABC Radio National]] broadcasts more than 60 special interest programmes per week covering a range of topics including music, comedy, book readings, radio dramas, poetry, science, health, the arts, religion, social history and current affairs.

[[ABC NewsRadio]] is a rolling news service, previously known as the [[Parliamentary and News Network]]. The service was established to broadcast federal parliamentary sittings, to relieve the local ABC radio network from this intermittent task, and to provide a news service at other times. The network broadcasts news on a 24/7 format with updates on the quarter-hour. Much of its news content is produced by the ABC itself, however many programmes are relayed from the [[BBC World Service]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio Netherlands]] and [[CNN Radio]].

[[ABC Classic FM]] was the ABC's first FM radio service. It was originally known simply as "ABC FM", and for a short time{{quantify|eg "until [year] as"|date=April 2013}} "ABC Fine Music". Its format borrowed heavily from community stations that eventually founded the Fine Music Network, as well as [[BBC Radio 3]].

[[Triple J]] is the national youth radio network, and broadcasts contemporary alternative and independent music; it is targeted at people aged 18–35. While the network plays music from around the world, it has a strong focus on local artists. Triple J was formerly known as "Double Jay" when it launched in Sydney on 19 January 1975.

ABC Radio broadcasts regular news bulletins across most of its radio stations.  Many of these bulletins are heralded by the [[Majestic Fanfare]], written by British composer Charles Williams in 1935.

===Television===
{{Main|ABC Television}}

Within Australia, the ABC operates four channels. [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]], the Corporation's original television service, receives the bulk of funding for television and shows first-run comedy, drama, documentaries, and [[ABC News and Current Affairs|news and current affairs]]. In each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] a local [[ABC News (Australia)|news bulletin]] is shown at 7.00&nbsp;p.m. nightly.

In 2001 [[ABC Television|ABC TV]] launched its digital service.

[[ABC2]], launched in 2005, is a [[digital television in Australia|digital-only]] channel that shows repeated programmes from ABC, as well as some original content including news programmes, children's shows, animation, and music shows.

In September 2007, the [[Australian government]] announced a proposal to launch a new digital-only children's channel, to be named [[ABC3]].<ref name="abc3">{{cite news

An experimental Multimedia Unit was established in 1995, charged with developing policy for the ABC's work in web publishing.<ref name="abc-90s" /> This unit continued until 2000, when the New Media division was formed, bringing together the ABC's online output as a division similar to Television or Radio.<ref name="abc-00s" /> The division had over a million pages of material published by late 2003.<ref name="abc-00s" />

In 2001 the New Media division became New Media and Digital Services, reflecting the broader remit to develop content for digital platforms such as [[digital television]]. In addition to ABC Online, the division also had responsibility over the ABC's two digital television services, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids channel]], until their closure in 2003.<ref>{{cite web

In conjunction with the ABC's radio division, New Media and Digital Services implemented the ABC's first [[podcast]]s in December 2004. By mid-2006 the ABC had become an international leader in podcasting with over fifty podcast programmes delivering hundreds of thousands of downloads per week,<ref name="podcasting">{{cite web

There are currently six state symphony orchestras:
* [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Queensland Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]]

The orchestras were corporatised in the 1990s,<ref name="abc-90s" /> and were divested into independent companies on 1 January 2007.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/corp/history/75years/timeline/orchestras.pdf</ref>

== Lissajous curve logo==

[[File:Lissajous-Figur 1 zu 3 (Oszilloskop).jpg|upright|thumb|The Lissajous figure on an oscilloscope, on which Bill Kennard designed the current logo]]

The ABC logo is one of the most recognisable logos in Australia. In the early years of television, the ABC had been using [[Lissajous curve]]s as fillers between programmes. In July 1963, the ABC conducted a staff competition to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles.<ref name="atvh-50s60s">{{cite web |title=AusTVHistory: Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1950s–1960s |url=http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |publisher=Aus TV History |author=Brooklyn Ross-Hulands |accessdate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://replay.web.archive.org/20081007030333/http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |archivedate = 7 October 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Memoirs of a Space Engineer – about Doug Rickard | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 19 October 2000 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/memoirs/about.htm | accessdate =30 January 2008 }}</ref> In 1965, ABC graphics designer Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the [[cathode ray oscilloscope]] displays, submitted a design which was part of the waveform from an oscilloscope. The letters "ABC" were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Kennard was presented with [[Australian pound|£]]25 for his design.<ref name="atvh-50s60s"/>

Since its original introduction in 1965, it has been updated several times, including with the introduction of colour television in 1975. The line was thickened to feature colour in the logo. The 1975 logo is the longest-running logo, with a lifespan of 27 years. In 2001, with the introduction of digital television in Australia, ABC Television adopted a modified version of the logo, featuring a silver 3D look and losing the "over and under" design. However, despite the launch of this logo, the 1975 logo is still used by the corporation. In July 2002, to celebrate the ABC's 70th anniversary, the corporation adopted a new logo across all media. This new logo still used the silver 3D colour but reverted to its "over and under" design. In 2014, as part of ABC1's renaming back into "ABC TV", the 1975 logo was brought back to on-air presentation. Despite this, the 2002 silver logo remains in usage by the corporation.
