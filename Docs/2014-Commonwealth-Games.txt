{{2014 Commonwealth Games}}

The '''2014 Commonwealth Games''' (officially the '''XX Commonwealth Games''') were held in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], from 23 July to 3 August 2014.

It was the largest [[multi-sport event]] ever held in Scotland with around 4,950 athletes from 71 different nations and territories competing in 18 different sports, outranking the [[1970 British Commonwealth Games|1970]] and [[1986 Commonwealth Games|1986]] Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Over the last 10 years, however, Glasgow and Scotland had staged World, Commonwealth, European, or British events in all sports proposed for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, including the [[BWF World Championships|World Badminton Championships]] in 1997.<ref>[http://www.thecgf.com/media/games/2014/G2014_CCF_Vol1-3.pdf Candidate City File: Glasgow's credentials (page 121)]</ref>

The Games received acclaim for their organisation, attendance, and the public enthusiasm of the people of Scotland, with [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] chief executive Mike Hooper hailing them as "the standout games in the history of the movement".<ref>{{cite web |title=Glasgow 2014: Commonwealths hailed best in 84-year history |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/28631639 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Glasgow 2014: Praise heaped on 'best Games ever' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-28630555 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> Held in Scotland for the third time, the Games were notable for the successes of the [[Home Nations]] of the [[United Kingdom]], with [[England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games|England]], [[Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games|Wales]] and hosts [[Scotland at the 2014 Commonwealth Games|Scotland]] achieving their largest ever gold medal hauls and overall medal hauls at a Commonwealth Games.<ref>{{cite web |title=Glasgow 2014: Usain Bolt, Nicola Adams and Tom Daley all win gold |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/286237604 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Glasgow 2014: Wales chief Brian Davies delighted with medal haul |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/28580147 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> [[England]] finished top of the medal table for the first time since the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]], also held in Scotland.

Scotland was the first country to consider hosting the 2014 Commonwealth Games in 2004, with Scottish cities being invited by the [[Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland]] to consider making a bid. In September 2004, Glasgow was announced as the Scottish candidate city over [[Edinburgh]] (which hosted the Games in [[1970 British Commonwealth Games|1970]] and [[1986 Commonwealth Games|1986]], and the inaugural [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] in [[2000 Commonwealth Youth Games|2000]]) following a [[cost-benefit analysis]] by the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland. The [[Scottish Executive]] under then [[First Minister of Scotland]], [[Jack McConnell]], with the support of the [[Her Majesty's Government|United Kingdom government]] and all main parties in the [[Scottish Parliament]], formally announced Glasgow's intention to host the games on 16 August 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4846034.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Blair enjoys Games as tour begins|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="BBC final">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7077966.stm |title=Final push for Glasgow 2014 Games|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2007|work=[[BBC News]]  }}</ref>

In March 2006, the bidding process began, with the [[Glasgow bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games|Glasgow Bidding]] team presenting their case to the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]], along with the other confirmed candidate cities; the Nigerian capital, [[Abuja bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games|Abuja]] and [[Halifax bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games|Halifax]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4154634.stm|title=Glasgow launches Commonwealth bid|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> In October 2006, the first voting delegates arrived in Glasgow, to inspect the city's existing and proposed amenities and facilities. Glasgow announced on 16 January 2007, the 17 sports to be included should its bid be successful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/6267309.stm|title=Glasgow reveal 2014 bid sports|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> Halifax later withdrew its bid on 8 March 2007, following the withdrawal of funding from the municipal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6431603.stm|title=Commonwealth bid city pulls out|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>

[[File:GlasgowIn2011Rooftops.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glasgow]] city centre.]]
That left Abuja and Glasgow as the remaining bidders, with Abuja seen as a likely favourite due to the basis of its campaign that an African nation has never before hosted the Commonwealth Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7086584.stm|title=Nigerians keen to host games|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> The deadline for formal submission of bids to the Commonwealth Games Federation, in the form of a Candidate City File, was set for May 2007.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 2007 |title=The Story so Far |publisher=Glagow 2014 |url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/Our-Bid/The-story-so-far/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624082132/http://www.glasgow2014.com/Our-Bid/The-story-so-far/ |archivedate=24 June 2008}}</ref> Both bids were highly recommended, though Glasgow's bid team had made use of extensive benchmarking against the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester and the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and as a result, its bid was deemed technically superior according to the CGF Evaluation Report that was released in September 2007. The Commonwealth Games Evaluation Commission concluded that: "Glasgow has shown it has the ability to stage the 2014 Commonwealth Games to a standard which would continue to enhance the image and prestige of the Games." This put Glasgow ahead in terms of the technical comprehensiveness of its bid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6977764.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Scotland - Glasgow, Lanarkshire and West - City ahead in Commonwealth race|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>

The final decision on the host city of the 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] on 9 November 2007 at the Commonwealth Games Federation General Assembly, attended by all 71 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Games member associations. Each bid city made a presentation to the General Assembly, the order of which was determined by drawing lots. Glasgow's delegation was led by Louise Martin, chair of the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland, First Minister [[Alex Salmond]], athlete Jamie Quarry and Leader of [[Glasgow City Council]] [[Steven Purcell]]. The presentation also included a promotional film narrated by [[Sean Connery]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=Text of the Presentations from Sri Lanka |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/Media-Centre/News-releases/TEXTOFTHEPRESENTATIONSFROMSRILANKA.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723121116/http://www.glasgow2014.com/Media-Centre/News-releases/TEXTOFTHEPRESENTATIONSFROMSRILANKA.htm |archivedate=23 July 2008}}</ref> Abuja's delegation was led by General [[Yakubu Gowon]], head of the Abuja 2014 Commonwealth Games bid team.

The CGF members later voted for their preferred candidate in a secret ballot. As there were only two bids, the winner was announced by the CGF President, Mike Fennel, after the first round of voting, with the winner only requiring a simple majority. The results of the bidding process were as follows:

There were 71 participating nations at the 2014 Commonwealth Games with approximately 4,950 competing athletes, making it one of the largest Commonwealth Games staged to date. On 7 October 2013, [[The Gambia at the Commonwealth Games|The Gambia]], having withdrawn from the Commonwealth five days earlier, confirmed that it would not be taking part in the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2447730/The-Gambia-withdraw-Glasgow-2014-Commonwealth-Games.html |title=The Gambia withdraw from Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games |work=[[Daily Mail]] |publisher=[[DMG Media]] |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref><!--The number of athletes will be shown in brackets.-->

{{:2014 Commonwealth Games medal table}}

== Games identity ==

=== Bid and interim logo ===
[[File:Glasgow2014logo.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Interim and bid logo.]]
The interim logo for the Games was first used during Glasgow's bid, with the "Candidate City" section removed following 9 November 2007, when the bid was approved. The logo depicts two [[Sprint (running)|sprinters]] woven into a [[tartan]] motif, representing [[Scotland]]. The logo also vaguely resembles the [[Clyde Auditorium]], one of Glasgow's most recognisable landmarks. The pattern, forming the [[Roman numerals]] XX, also represents 20th edition of the Commonwealth Games. The text is more specifically Glaswegian, with its stylised [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh|Mackintosh]] font.
A flag featuring the logo was used extensively during the bid process. The flag was flown above Merchant House in [[George Square]] daily.<ref>[http://www.britishflags.net/Glasgow%20Commonwealth%20Games%202014.html britishflags.net, Glasgow Commonwealth Games Logo] {{wayback|url=http://www.britishflags.net/Glasgow%20Commonwealth%20Games%202014.html |date=19700101000000 |df=y }}</ref>

=== The Games brand identity ===
The full Games brand identity was developed by Glasgow design studio Tangent Graphic, the lead creative agency between 2010 and 2014. Tangent's first major project was the official sport Pictograms, launched on 23 July 2011, and they continued to deliver and influence every aspect of the Glasgow 2014 identity. Tangent inherited the official logo which was designed by Marque Creative. The logo was unveiled on [[Commonwealth Day]], 8 March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/commonwealth-games/2014/9159-glasgow-2014-launches-new-logo|title=Glasgow launches new logo for 2014 Commonwealth Games|work=insidethegames.biz|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> It was inspired by three factors, time, data and measurement. Its rings are proportioned to represent the 20th Commonwealth Games, across 17 sports, over 11 days in 1 city. An animated version of the logo has also been produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/video/glasgow-2014-logo-animation|title=Glasgow 2014 Logo Animation|work=Glasgow 2014|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>

There is also a version of the logo in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. Arthur Cormack, the Chair of [[Bòrd na Gàidhlig]], made the following official statement:
:"''Bòrd na Gàidhlig welcomes the Gaelic version of the logo for the Glaschu 2014 Commonwealth Games and we have been happy to work with the Glaschu 2014 team in helping them develop their identity.  Given the unique importance of Gaelic to Scotland and the many Scots in the diaspora throughout the Commonwealth, we believe it should be seen, heard and spoken as widely as possible."

:"''Given the worldwide interest there will be in the Games when they take place in Glasgow, a city with a large number of Gaelic speakers, we believe they offer an exciting opportunity for Gaelic to be seen and, we hope, heard and appreciated in an international setting.  We hope this is just the start; we wish the Games well and look forward to working further with Glaschu 2014 to enhance the status of Gaelic within this hugely significant event."<ref>[http://www.glasgow2014.com/press-releases/glasgow-2014-unveils-identity Unveils identity | Glasgow 2014&nbsp;– Commonwealth Games]. Glasgow 2014 (8 March 2010). Retrieved on 17 July 2013."</ref>

The official website was built in phases, delivered by Dog Digital and Blonde.

=== Mascot ===
{{main|Clyde (mascot)}}
[[File:Clyde (Mascot).jpg|thumbnail|right|Mascot sculpture in the [[Glasgow Botanic Gardens]]]]
'''[[Clyde (mascot)|Clyde]]''', an anthropomorphic [[thistle]] named after the [[River Clyde|river]] which flows through the centre of [[Glasgow]], was the official mascot of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The mascot was designed by Beth Gilmour, who won a competition run by Glasgow 2014 for children to design the Mascot. Beth's drawing was then brought to life by digital agency Nerv, who turned it into a commercial character, created a full backstory, gave it a name&nbsp;– Clyde&nbsp;– and created a website for him. Clyde was finally revealed in a seven-minute animated film created by Nerv at a ceremony at [[BBC Scotland]]'s headquarters in [[Glasgow]]. The organiser, Glasgow 2014, said the mascot's design was chosen because of its "Scottish symbolism and Glaswegian charm and likeability".<ref>{{cite news |title=Thistle man Clyde is Glasgow Commonwealth Games mascot |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-19651062 |work=BBC News Glasgow and West Scotland |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>

By the final day of the Games, over 50,000 Clyde mascot [[cuddly toy]]s had been sold.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Commonwealth Games - special because they're unique |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/28632068 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>
