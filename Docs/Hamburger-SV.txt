'''Hamburger Sport-Verein e.V.''' {{IPA-de|hamˈbʊʁɡɐ ˌʃpɔʁt fɛɐ̯ˈʔaɪ̯n|}}, commonly known as '''Hamburger SV''', '''Hamburg''' or '''HSV''' {{IPA-de|haː ʔɛs ˈfaʊ̯|}}, is a [[Germany|German]] sport club based in [[Hamburg]], its largest branch being its [[Association football|football]] department. Although the current HSV was founded in June 1919 from a merger of three earlier clubs, it officially traces its origin to 29 September 1887 when the first of the predecessors, [[SC Germania Hamburg|SC Germania]], was founded. HSV's football team has the unique distinction of [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|having played continuously in the top tier]] of the [[German football league system]] since the end of [[World War I]]. It is the only team that has played in every season of the [[Bundesliga]] since its foundation in 1963, at which time the team was led by German national captain [[Uwe Seeler]].<ref name="Forbes1">{{cite news|title=#16 Hamburg SV|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/34/biz_07soccer_Hamburg-SV_340029.html|publisher=Forbes Magazine|date=29 March 2007|accessdate=8 December 2010}}</ref>

HSV has won the German national championship six times, the [[DFB-Pokal]] three times and the League Cup twice. The team's most successful period was from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s when, in addition to several domestic honours, they won the [[1976–77 European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[1982–83 European Cup]]. Their outstanding player was German national star [[Felix Magath]]. To date, HSV's last major trophy was the [[1986–87 DFB-Pokal]].

HSV play their home games at the [[Volksparkstadion]] in [[Bahrenfeld]], a western district of Hamburg. The club colours are officially blue, white and black but the home kit of the team is white jerseys and red shorts. The team's most common nickname is "die Rothosen" (the Red Shorts). As it is one of Germany's oldest clubs, it is also known as ''der Dinosaurier'' (the Dinosaur). HSV have [[List of association football rivalries|rivalries]] with [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], with whom they contest the [[Nordderby]], and Hamburg-based [[FC St. Pauli]], whom they contest the [[Hamburg derby]].

HSV is notable in football as a grassroots organisation with youth development a strong theme. The club had a team in the [[Bundesliga (women)|Women's Bundesliga]] from 2003 to 2012 but it was demoted to Regionalliga level because of financial problems. Other club departments include [[badminton]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[bowling]], [[boxing]], [[cricket]], [[darts]], [[hockey]], [[golf]], [[gymnastics]], [[handball]] and [[cardiopulmonary rehabilitation]] exercises. These departments represent about ten percent of the club membership. HSV is one of the biggest sports clubs in Germany with over 70,000 members in all its departments<ref>[http://www.hsv-sc.de/ueber-uns/mitglieder-entwicklung.html HSV Supporters Club&nbsp;– graph shows "gesamt" (entire membership) as 70,000-plus].

==History==
===Early years===
Hamburger Sport-Verein (HSV) traces its origin to the merger of ''Der Hohenfelder Sportclub'' and ''Wandsbek-Marienthaler Sportclub'' on 29 September 1887 to form [[SC Germania Hamburg|Sport-Club Germania Hamburg]], usually referred to as ''SC Germania''. This was the first of three clubs that merged on 2 June 1919 to create HSV in its present form. HSV in its club statute recognises the founding of SC Germania as its own date of origin.<ref>[http://www.hsv.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Verein/HSV Statute of Hamburger SV, pdf, p.3]. Retrieved 26 October 2013.</ref> The other two clubs in the June 1919 merger were ''Hamburger FC'' founded in 1888 and ''FC Falke Eppendorf'' dating back to 1906. The merger came about because the three clubs had been severely weakened by the impact of the First World War on manpower and finance and they could not continue as separate entities.<ref name="Forbes1"/>

SC Germania was formed originally as an athletics club and did not begin to play football until 1891, when some Englishmen joined the club and introduced it. SC Germania had its first success in 1896, winning the Hamburg-Altona championship for the first of five times. Germania player [[Hans Nobiling]] emigrated to Brazil at the end of the 19th century, where he became an important pioneer of the game, instrumental in the foundation of [[SC Internacional (SP)|SC Internacional]], the third oldest club of the country which became part of [[São Paulo FC]] in 1938 and SC Germânia of São Paulo, which later became [[EC Pinheiros]] one of the major sports clubs of Brazil.

Hamburger SC 1888 was founded by students on 1 June 1888. It later had links with a youth team called FC Viktoria 95 and, during the First World War, was temporarily known as Viktoria Hamburg 88. SC Germania and Hamburger SC 1888 were among 86 clubs who founded the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB; German Football Association) in Leipzig on 28 January 1900. FC Falke was founded by students in [[Hamburg-Eppendorf|Eppendorf]] on 5 March 1906 but it was never a successful team and played in lower leagues.

The newly formed Hamburger SV quickly became competitive and contested the [[1922 German football championship|1922 national final]] against [[1. FC Nuremberg]], who were playing for their third consecutive title. The game was called off on account of darkness after three hours and ten minutes of play, drawn at 2–2.<ref name=ewigefinale>{{Cite news |url=http://www.11freunde.de/artikel/das-ewige-finale-von-1922 |title=Das ewige Finale von 1922: Kein Süßholztennis |language=German |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2013 |work=11freunde}}</ref> The re-match also went into extra time, and in an era that did not allow for substitutions, that game was called off at 2–2 when Nuremberg were reduced to just seven players (two were injured, two had been [[Ejection (sports)#Association football|sent off]]) and the referee ruled they could not continue. Considerable wrangling ensued over the decision. The DFB awarded the win to HSV but urged them to refuse the title in the name of good sportsmanship (which they grudgingly did). Ultimately, the Viktoria trophy was not officially presented that year.<ref name=ewigefinale/>

HSV's first unqualified success was achieved in the [[1923 German football championship]] when they won the national title against [[1. FC Union Berlin|Union Oberschöneweide]]. They failed to defend the title in [[1924 German football championship|1924]], losing the final to Nuremberg, but lifted the Viktoria again in [[1928 German football championship|1928]] when they defeated [[Hertha BSC]] 5–2 at the [[Altonaer Stadion]] in the final.

During the [[Third Reich]], HSV enjoyed local success in the [[Gauliga Nordmark]], also known as the Gauliga Hamburg, winning the [[Gauliga Nordmark#Winners and runners-up of the Gauliga|league championship]] in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941 and 1945. At national level the club was unsuccessful with semi-final losses in [[1938 German football championship|1938]] and [[1939 German football championship|1939]] their best performances in this period. Its main rival in the [[Gauliga]] in those years was [[Eimsbütteler TV]].

===Post war era===
HSV's first post-war season was in the newly formed [[Stadtliga Hamburg]] and they won its championship in 1946. The club also won the championship of the British occupation zone in 1947 and 1948, the only two seasons this competition was staged.<ref>''kicker Almanach 1990'' {{de icon}} publisher: [[Kicker (sports magazine)|kicker]], published: 1989, page: 248 & 249. Retrieved 17 May 2009</ref>

HSV became the first German team to tour the [[United States]] after the [[Second World War]] in May 1950 and came away with a 6–0 record.<ref name=erauwe>{{Cite news|url=http://www.125jahrehsv.de/geschichte/highlights-der-geschichte/aera-uwe/|title=Ära Uwe|accessdate=3 June 2013|work=Hamburger Sport-Verein}}</ref>

Playing in the [[Oberliga Nord (1947-63)|Oberliga Nord]] after the resumption of league play in postwar [[West Germany]] in 1947, HSV became a frighteningly dominant regional club. In sixteen seasons from 1947–48 to 1962–63 they laid claim to the Oberliga title 15 times, only posting an uncharacteristic 11th-place finish in 1953–54. During this period, they scored over 100 goals in each of the 1951, 1955, 1961, and 1962 seasons. In 1953, the club's all-time leading goalscorer [[Uwe Seeler]] debuted. In nine seasons he scored 267 goals in 237 Oberliga matches.<ref name=unsuwe>{{cite news|url=http://www.hsv-history.de/seeler.html|title="Uns Uwe" Seeler&nbsp;– Das große Idol|language=German|accessdate=3 June 2013|work=Hamburger Sport-Verein}}</ref>

However, [[List of German football champions|national titles]] were harder to come by. In 1956, HSV reached the [[1955–56 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final but were beaten by [[Karlsruher SC]].<ref name=erauwe/> This was followed by losses in the finals of the national championship to [[Borussia Dortmund]] in [[1957 German football championship|1957]] and [[FC Schalke 04]] in [[1958 German football championship|1958]].<ref name=erauwe/>

In [[1960 German football championship|1960]], HSV became German champions for the first time since 1928, defeating [[1. FC Köln]] 3–2 in the championship final. Seeler, who scored twice in the final, was named [[Footballer of the Year in Germany|West German player of the year]].<ref name=erauwe/>

As national champions, HSV represented West Germany in the [[1960–61 European Cup]]. The club's first ever match in European competition was a 5–0 defeat of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] club [[BSC Young Boys]] in [[Bern]],<ref name=erauwe/> with HSV winning the tie 8–3 on aggregate. In the quarter-finals they beat [[List of English football champions|English champions]] [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], before being defeated by [[FC Barcelona]] at the semi-final stage in a playoff game after the scores were level over two legs. The crowd of 77,600 at the [[Volksparkstadion]] for the first leg against Barcelona remains the record attendance for a HSV home match.<ref name=erauwe/>

===Entry into the Bundesliga===
{{details|Introduction of the Bundesliga}}

Soon after, Germany's first professional football league, the [[Bundesliga]], was formed and HSV was one of 16 clubs invited to join that first season. Hamburger SV currently holds the distinction of being the only original Bundesliga side to have played continuously in the top flight&nbsp;– without ever having been relegated&nbsp;– since the formation of the league in 1963. They had shared that special status with [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] until [[1995–96 Bundesliga|1996]], and with [[1. FC Köln]] until [[1997–98 Bundesliga|1998]]. Altogether, 49 other sides have come and gone since the league's inception. The Bundesliga celebrated its 40th anniversary on 24 August 2004 with a match between "The Dinosaur", as the club has been affectionately nicknamed due to its old age, and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], the league's most successful side.

In August 1963, HSV defeated [[Borussia Dortmund]] 3–0 at [[Hanover]]'s [[Niedersachsenstadion]] to win the club's first [[1962–63 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]].<ref name=erauwe/> In the same month the club played its first ever [[1963–64 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] match, drawing 1–1 with [[SC Preußen Münster]].<ref name=erauwe/> HSV finished the Bundesliga's first season in sixth place, with [[Uwe Seeler]] scoring thirty goals to secure the [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Torjägerkanone]].<ref name=unsuwe/> He was also named [[Footballer of the Year in Germany|footballer of the year]] for the second time.<ref name=erauwe/> The DFB-Pokal victory enabled HSV to play in the [[1963–64 European Cup Winners' Cup]] and they reached the quarter-final.

In 1967, HSV again reached the final of the [[1966–67 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] where they were defeated 4–0 by [[FC Bayern Munich]].<ref name=erauwe/> However, HSV were admitted to the following season's [[1967–68 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] where they lost to [[A.C. Milan]] in the final.<ref name=erauwe/>

In 1970, Seeler was named [[Footballer of the Year in Germany|footballer of the year]] for the third time.<ref name=seventies>{{Cite news|url=http://www.125jahrehsv.de/geschichte/highlights-der-geschichte/70er/|title=Die 70er Jahre|accessdate=3 June 2013|work=Hamburger Sport-Verein}}</ref> He retired at the end of the [[1971–72 Bundesliga|1971–72 season]] in front of 72,000 fans at the [[Volksparkstadion]].<ref name=seventies/> He ended his career with 137 goals from 239 Bundesliga matches<ref name=unsuwe/> and 507 goals from 587 appearances in all competitions.<ref name=legends>{{Cite news|url=http://www.t-online.de/sport/fussball/bundesliga/id_60869272/sid_40803864/si_0/foto-show-die-legenden-des-hamburger-sv.html|title=Foto-Show: Die Legenden des Hamburger SV|accessdate=3 June 2013|work=T-Mobile}}</ref> In the same season, HSV played in the [[1971–72 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] for the first time but were knocked out in the first round by [[St Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]].

===Golden era===

In 1973, HSV won the [[1972–73 DFB-Ligapokal|first edition]] of the [[DFB-Ligapokal]], beating [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] 4–0 in the final.<ref name=seventies/> A year later, they reached the [[1973–74 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final, where they were beaten by [[Eintracht Frankfurt]].<ref name=seventies/> In 1976, HSV reached another [[1975–76 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final, beating [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] 2–0 to win the trophy for the second time in the club's history.<ref name=seventies/> The following year, HSV achieved its first international success with a 2–0 win over [[Belgium|Belgian]] club [[RSC Anderlecht]] in the final of the [[1976–77 European Cup Winners' Cup]].<ref name=seventies/> The club then signed [[England|English]] superstar [[Kevin Keegan]] from [[1976–77 European Cup|European champions]] [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref name=seventies/> After spending much of the previous decade in mid-table, HSV had achieved their best Bundesliga position in [[1974–75 Bundesliga|1974–75]] by finishing fourth. This was then bettered in [[1975–76 Bundesliga|1975–76]] with a second-place finish. Keegan's first season at the club saw the team slip to a disappointing tenth place, however, the player himself was named [[Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|European Footballer of the Year]].

In 1978, [[Branko Zebec]] was appointed [[Manager (association football)|trainer]] of HSV.<ref name=seventies/> The [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] led the club to its first ever [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga title]] in his [[1978–79 Bundesliga|first season in charge]].<ref name=seventies/> Keegan top scored for ''die Rothosen'' and was awarded the [[Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|Ballon d'Or]] for a second successive year.

[[File:Ernst Happel 1978.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Ernst Happel]], the most successful manager of the club, won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in [[1982–83 European Cup|1983]], the [[Bundesliga]] in [[1981–82 Bundesliga|1982]] and [[1982–83 Bundesliga|1983]], and the [[DFB-Pokal]] in [[1986–87 DFB-Pokal|1987]].]]

In the [[1979–80 European Cup|1979–80 season]], HSV returned to the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time since [[1960–61 European Cup|1960–61]]. As had happened 19 years ago, HSV faced Spanish opposition in the semi-finals. After losing the first leg at the [[Estadio Santiago Bernabéu]] 2–0, HSV thrashed [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League finals|six time winners]] [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] 5–1 at the [[Volksparkstadion]] to qualify for the final.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hsv.de/en/season/meldungen/bundesliga/april-2013/33-years-ago-today-the-hsv-miracle/|title=33 years ago today&nbsp;– The HSV "Miracle"|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=3 June 2013|work=Hamburger Sport-Verein}}</ref> HSV returned to [[Madrid]] to play [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[1980 European Cup Final|final]], where they were beaten 1–0.<ref name=eighties>{{Cite news|url=http://www.125jahrehsv.de/geschichte/highlights-der-geschichte/80er/|title=Die 80er Jahre|language=German|accessdate=3 June 2013|work=Hamburger Sport-Verein}}</ref> In the [[1979–80 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]], HSV missed out on defending their title by two points, finishing in second place behind champions [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].

In December 1980, HSV dismissed Zebec, who had been struggling with a [[Alcoholism|drinking problem]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/1980/53/benutzt-und-dann-gefeuert|title=Benutzt und dann gefeuert|language=German|date=26 December 1980|accessdate=3 June 2013|work=Die Zeit}}</ref> His assistant [[Aleksandar Ristić]] was appointed [[Caretaker manager|caretaker]] for the remainder of the season and secured a creditable second-place finish in the [[1980–81 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]].

In 1981, [[Austria]]n coach [[Ernst Happel]] was appointed as Zebec's permanent replacement.<ref name=eighties/> In his [[1981–82 Bundesliga|first season]], his HSV side regained the Bundesliga title and reached the [[1981–82 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] [[1982 UEFA Cup Final|final]], where they lost 4–0 on aggregate to [[Sweden]]'s [[IFK Göteborg]].<ref name=eighties/>

Between 16 January 1982 and 29 January 1983 HSV went undefeated in the Bundesliga. The run stretched across 36 games and remained a [[Bundesliga#Records|Bundesliga record]] until November 2013, when it was broken by [[FC Bayern Munich]].<ref name=eighties/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/bundesliga-bayern-munich-set-new-record-of-37-games-unbeaten-while-borussia-dortmund-lose-again-8930732.html|title=Bundesliga: Bayern Munich set new record of 37 games unbeaten, while Borussia Dortmund lose again|date=9 November 2013|work=The Independent}}</ref>

A third Meisterschale followed at the end of the [[1982–83 Bundesliga|1982–83 season]], with HSV defending their title against [[Nordderby|local rivals]] [[SV Werder Bremen]] on [[goal difference]].<ref name=eighties/> The same year, HSV recorded its greatest ever success, defeating [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] [[1983 European Cup Final|1–0]] in [[Athens]] to win the club's first [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].<ref name=eighties/>

In December 1983, HSV traveled to [[Tokyo]] where they faced [[1983 Copa Libertadores|South American champions]] [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] in the [[1983 Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]]. The [[Brazil]]ian club took home the trophy with a 93rd minute winning goal.<ref name=eighties/> Back home, they lost the [[1983–84 Bundesliga|league championship]] to [[VfB Stuttgart]] on goal difference.

Both [[1984–85 Bundesliga|1984–85]] and [[1985–86 Bundesliga|1985–86]] were disappointing seasons for HSV; with the club finishing fifth and seventh respectively. In 1986, legendary midfielder [[Felix Magath]], who had played for the club for ten years and scored the winning goal in the [[1983 European Cup Final]], retired from professional football.<ref name=legends/>

In [[1986–87 Bundesliga|1986–87]], HSV finished second in the Bundesliga and won a fourth [[1986–87 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]], beating [[Stuttgarter Kickers]] 3–1 in the final at [[West Berlin]]'s [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]].<ref name=eighties/> After this success, [[Ernst Happel]] left the club to return to [[Austria]]. He remains HSV's most successful trainer with two [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga titles]], one [[DFB-Pokal]] and one [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13681768.html|title=GESTORBEN: Ernst Happel|language=German|date=23 November 1992|accessdate=3 June 2013|work=Der Spiegel}}</ref>

===Modern era===
In the early 1990s, HSV found itself in financial trouble. The sale of [[Thomas Doll]] to [[S.S. Lazio]] for a then record 16 million [[Deutsche Marks]]<ref name=nineties>{{Cite news|url=http://www.125jahrehsv.de/geschichte/highlights-der-geschichte/90er/|title=Die 90er Jahre|accessdate=4 June 2013|work=Hamburger Sport-Verein}}</ref> in June 1991 is credited with ensuring the club's survival.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/interview-mit-thomas-doll-nur-bayern-ist-besser-als-wir-a-342031.html|title=Interview mit Thomas Doll: "Nur Bayern ist besser als wir"|language=German|date=18 February 2005|accessdate=4 June 2013|work=Der Spiegel}}</ref>

On the pitch the team was in decline. After a fifth-place finish in [[1990–91 Bundesliga|1990–91]], HSV finished in the bottom half of the Bundesliga in four consecutive seasons.

In October 1995, [[Felix Magath]] returned to HSV to become the club's [[Manager (association football)|trainer]]. The following month, [[Uwe Seeler]] also returned as the club president.<ref name=nineties/> Under the new regime, HSV finished fifth in the [[1995–96 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]], securing [[1996–97 UEFA Cup|European qualification]] for the first time in six years. The [[1996–97 Bundesliga|following season]], HSV reached the semi-finals of the [[1996–97 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]]. However, in May 1997, Magath was fired after a 4–0 defeat to [[1. FC Köln]] with the team one place above the relegation zone.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-chelsea-sign-channel-5-deal-1262575.html|title=Football: Chelsea sign Channel 5 deal|date=20 May 1997|accessdate=4 June 2013|work=The Independent}}</ref> HSV eventually finished in 13th place under [[Hamburger SV II|reserve team]] coach [[Ralf Schehr]].

In 1997, HSV appointed [[Frank Pagelsdorf]], who would coach the team for over four years, making him the longest serving trainer since [[Ernst Happel]]. A ninth-place finish in [[1997–98 Bundesliga|1997–98]] was followed by seventh in [[1998–99 Bundesliga|1998–99]] and third in [[1999–2000 Bundesliga|1999–2000]],<ref name=nineties/> the team's best performance since [[1986–87 Bundesliga|1986–87]].

On 2 September 2000, the new [[Volksparkstadion]] was officially opened as [[Germany national football team|the national team]] played its first [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;– UEFA Group 9|qualifier]] against [[Greece national football team|Greece]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hsv-sc.de/verein/historie/volkspark.html|title=Volkspark|language=German|accessdate=4 June 2013|work=Hamburger SV Supporters Club}}</ref>

In July 2003, HSV won its first trophy in sixteen years with a 4–2 defeat of [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the [[2003 DFB-Ligapokal|DFB-Ligapokal]] final.<ref name=twothousand>{{Cite news|url=http://www.125jahrehsv.de/geschichte/highlights-der-geschichte/gegenwart/|title=2000 bis zur Gegenwart|language=German|accessdate=4 June 2013|work=Hamburger Sport-Verein}}</ref>

In August 2004, HSV was upset in the early rounds of the [[2004–05 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] by regional league side [[SC Paderborn 07]]. The match became one of the most infamous in recent football history when it was discovered that [[referee (association football)|referee]], [[Robert Hoyzer]], had accepted money from a [[Croatia]]n gambling syndicate to [[match fixing|fix the match]], which he did, awarding two penalties to Paderborn and sending off HSV player [[Emile Mpenza]]. The resulting [[Bundesliga scandal of 2005|scandal]] became the biggest in German football in over 30 years, and was an embarrassment to the country as it prepared to host the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

Another third-place finish in [[2005–06 Bundesliga|2005–06]] saw HSV qualify for the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the second time.<ref name=twothousand/> They finished bottom of [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League group stage|Group G]] with a solitary win against [[Russia]]n club [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]].

Under new coach [[Bruno Labbadia]], HSV reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]] (now renamed the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]]) for the second season in a row.

==Stadium==
[[File:HSHNordBankArenaview.jpg|right|thumb|190px|The [[Volksparkstadion]]]]
Hamburg plays its home games in the [[Volksparkstadion]], which was previously known as the Imtech Arena between 2010 and 2015.<ref>http://www.hsv.de/en/season/meldungen/bundesliga/june-2015/letters-disappearing-the-legend-volksparkstadion-is-back/</ref> Built on the site of the original Volksparkstadion, opened in 1953, the current stadium was opened in 2000, and has a capacity of 57,000&nbsp;– approximately 47,000 seats with another 10,000 spectators standing. The first Volksparkstadion had been a venue for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. The Volksparkstadion is a [[UEFA]] category one stadium, which certifies it to host [[UEFA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]] finals. The stadium was the site of four group matches and a quarter-final in the past [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], hosted by Germany, and was known as ''FIFA World Cup Stadium Hamburg'' during the event. It was also the venue for the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final]].

HSV fans can be buried at a dedicated graveyard near the home stadium, covered in turf from the original Hamburg pitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=319|title=Dead football fans get home ground advantage|publisher=www.meeja.com.au|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=3 September 2008}}</ref>

==Rivals and affinities==
[[File:Elia son.JPG|right|thumb|right|190px|Hamburg against rivals [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the [[Nordderby]]]]
HSV shares a cross-town rivalry with [[FC St. Pauli]] and contests the [[Nordderby]] with fellow [[Northern Germany]] side [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. In the Spring of 2009 HSV faced Werder Bremen four times in only three weeks, and Werder defeated HSV in the UEFA-Cup semi-final, as well as in the DFB-Pokal semi-final.

HSV have an affinity with [[Scottish Football League|Scottish]] club [[Rangers F.C.]] HSV fans unfurl their club logo at Rangers' away European matches. The link between Rangers and Hamburg dates back to 1977 when the Hamburg Rangers Supporters' Club was set up by HSV fans who had visited Rangers matches before and were thrilled by the atmosphere at Ibrox. The links were further strengthened when Rangers signed [[Jörg Albertz]] from Hamburg. The friendship between [[Celtic F.C.]] and Hamburg's rivals FC St. Pauli has no influence on this friendship though. HSV have a friendship bond with [[Hannover 96]], due to both being known as HSV. Their meetings involve the visitors' club song to be played, and fans chanting HSV from each end of the stadium. Furthermore, the Hamburger SV has a friendship bond with [[Arminia Bielefeld]]. Both teams share the same colors, resulting in the popular fan chant "Schwarz, weiß, blau&nbsp;– Arminia und der HSV" (''"Black, white, blue&nbsp;– Arminia and the HSV"''). Especially in the 1990s, multiple players transferred between the two clubs.

==Club kit and colours==
The club colours are officially blue, white and black according to its statute but the fans use the combination "schwarz-weiss-blau" (black-white-blue) in their songs and chants; they also chant "haa-ess-fow" (HSV). The club crest is a black and white diamond on a blue background. These were the colours of SC Germania. The use of the blue background suggests a link with Hamburg's maritime tradition as the ''[[International maritime signal flags|Blue Peter flag]]'' signal (meaning "All Aboard" or "Outward Bound") is a white rectangle on a similar blue background.<ref>Arne Schultchen, ''Zeichen der Zeit (Signs of the Times)'' in ''11 Freunde'', issue 93, August 2009, p.79.</ref>

In contrast, the team's home kit is white jerseys and red shorts, which are the colours of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. As a result, the team's most common nickname is "die Rothosen" (the Red Shorts). Because of its age and having been ever-present in the top flight of German football, HSV is also known as ''der Dinosaurier'' (the Dinosaur) and currently uses a dinosaur mascot called "Hermann" (named after long-time club physiotherapist Hermann Rieger) for marketing purposes.

HSV's kit was made by [[Adidas]] from 1976 to 1995 and the club re-engaged Adidas in 2007 having worked with a number of its competitors in the meantime. The first shirt sponsorship was introduced in 1974. The shirt now carries the ''Fly Emirates'' logo. The following is a list of shirt sponsors by date:

==Hamburger SV in Europe==
HSV's first participation in European competition came after they won the German championship in 1960 and were invited to take part in the [[1960–61 European Cup]]. They had a bye in the preliminary round and their first round opponents were [[BSC Young Boys]]. HSV won the two-legged tie 8–3 on aggregate, beating the Swiss side 0–5 in the away leg on 2 November 1960 and then drawing 3–3 at home on 27 November.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1960/clubs/club=52167/matches/index.html UEFA&nbsp;– Hamburger SV matches in 1960–61]. Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref>

HSV reached the semi-final of the European Cup in 1961. Subsequently, they have twice played in the final, losing 1–0 to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in 1980 and defeating [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] 1–0 in 1983. With [[Borussia Dortmund]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], HSV is one of three German teams who have won the European Cup. HSV won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1976–77 and have been runners-ups in both that competition and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. Their most recent European campaign was the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League]] in which they reached the semi-final.<ref name="UEFAHSV">[http://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/club=52167/profile/history/index.html UEFA&nbsp;– Hamburger SV record in UEFA competitions]. Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref>

HSV's biggest win in a European match occurred on 23 October 1974 when they defeated Romanian team [[FC Braşov]] 8–0 in a UEFA Cup second round tie. Their biggest defeat was in the second leg of the 1977 Super Cup when they lost 6–0 to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]] on 6 December. [[Manfred Kaltz]] with 81 has made the most appearances for HSV in Europe and [[Horst Hrubesch]] with 20 is their leading goalscorer.<ref name="UEFAHSV"/>

==Honours==
[[File:Schatzkammer HSVMuseum.JPG|right|thumb|right|240px|One trophy from all of the competitions Hamburg has won in the HSV-Museum]]
HSV have the record in German football of having won the most regional titles, having won 31 regional titles. The regional titles do however not count as a trophy or even as a title itself. Winning a regional title only guaranteed a club to battle, with other regional winning clubs, for the German Championship.

Hamburg's three Bundesliga championships entitle the club to display one [[Star (football badge)|gold star]] of the ''"Verdiente Meistervereine."'' Under the current award system, their pre-Bundesliga championships are not recognized and so they are not entitled to the second star of a five-time champion.

After the replay of the championship final in 1922 had to be abandoned due to the opponents no longer having enough players on the ground, the German FA requested HSV to renounce the title which the club did.

During his first season with Hamburger SV (2000–01), [[Sergej Barbarez]] became the top scorer for his club with 22 goals and joint top scorer of the Bundesliga with [[Ebbe Sand]].
