In [[biology]] a hybrid, also known as cross breed, is the result of mixing, through [[sexual reproduction]], two animals or plants of different breeds, varieties, species or genera.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hybrid|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hybrid?show=0&t=1402607220|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref> Using [[genetics|genetic]] terminology, it may be defined as follows.<ref>Rieger, R.; Michaelis A.; Green, M. M. (1991). ''Glossary of Genetics'' (5th ed.). Springer-Verlag. ISBN 0-387-52054-6 page 256</ref>
# '''''Hybrid''''' generally refers to any offspring resulting from the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually will result in a high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]] are not, strictly speaking, synonymous.
# a '''''genetic hybrid''''' carries two different [[allele]]s of the same [[gene]]
# a '''''structural hybrid''''' results from the fusion of [[gamete]]s that have differing structure in at least one [[chromosome]], as a result of [[Chromosome abnormality#Structural abnormalities|structural abnormalities]]
# a '''''numerical hybrid''''' results from the fusion of gametes having different [[Ploidy|haploid numbers of chromosomes]]
# a '''''permanent hybrid''''' is a situation where only the heterozygous [[genotype]] occurs, because all homozygous combinations are lethal.

From a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] perspective, hybrid refers to:
# Offspring resulting from the [[interspecies mating|interbreeding between two animal species]] or plant [[species]].<ref>Keeton, William T. 1980. Biological science. New York: Norton. ISBN 0-393-95021-2 page A9.</ref> See also [[hybrid speciation]].
# Hybrids between different [[subspecies]] within a species (such as between the [[Bengal tiger]] and [[Siberian tiger]]) are known as '''''intra-specific''''' hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s) are sometimes known as '''''interspecific''''' hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[goat]]s) are known as '''''intergeneric''''' hybrids. Extremely rare '''''interfamilial''''' hybrids have been known to occur (such as the [[chicken hybrids|guineafowl hybrids]]).<ref name="ghigi">Ghigi A. 1936. "Galline di faraone e tacchini" Milano (Ulrico Hoepli)</ref> No '''''interordinal''''' (between different orders) animal hybrids are known.
# The third type of hybrid consists of crosses between [[population]]s, [[breed]]s or [[cultivar]]s within a single species. This meaning is often used in plant and animal breeding, where hybrids are commonly produced and selected, because they have desirable characteristics not found or inconsistently present in the parent individuals or populations.

==Terminology==
The term hybrid is derived from Latin ''hybrida'', meaning the '''''"offspring of a tame sow and a wild boar"''''', '''''"child of a freeman and slave"''''', etc.<ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/hybrid?view=uk askoxford.com]</ref> The term came into popular use in English in the 19th century, though examples of its use have been found from the early 17th century.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary Online, Oxford University Press 2007.</ref>

There is a popular convention of naming hybrids by forming [[portmanteau word]]s. 
The template for this is the naming of tiger-lion hybrids as [[liger]] and [[tigon]] in the 1920s.<ref>"When the sire is a lion the result is termed a Liger, whilst the converse is a Tigon." Edward George Boulenger, ''World natural history'', B. T. Batsford ltd., 1937, p. 40.</ref>
This was playfully (but unsystematically) extended to a number of other hybrids, or hypothetical hybrids, such as [[beefalo]] (1960s), [[humanzee]] (1980s), [[Cama (animal)|cama]] (1998).

==Types of hybrids==
Depending on the parents, there are a number of different types of hybrids;<ref>Wricke, Gunter, and Eberhard Weber. 1986.
''Quantitative genetics and selection in plant breeding.'' Berlin: W. de Gruyter. Page 257.</ref>
* '''''Single cross hybrids'''&nbsp;''— result from the cross between two [[true breeding organism]]s and produces an F1 generation called an [[F1 hybrid]] (F1 is short for Filial 1, meaning "first offspring"). The cross between two different [[homozygous]] lines produces an F1 hybrid that is [[heterozygous]]; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is [[Dominance relationship#Dominant allele|dominant]] and the other [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive]]. Typically, the F1 generation is also [[phenotype|phenotypically]] homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.
* '''''Double cross hybrids''''' — result from the cross between two different F1 hybrids.<ref>J. O. Rawlings, C. Clark Cockerham ''Analysis of Double Cross Hybrid Populations.'' J. O. Rawlings, C. Clark Cockerham Biometrics, Vol. 18, No. 2 (Jun., 1962), pp. 229-244 {{doi|10.2307/2527461}}</ref>
* '''''Three-way cross hybrids'''''&nbsp;— result from the cross between one parent that is an F1 hybrid and the other is from an inbred line.<ref>Roy, Darbeshwar. 2000. ''Plant breeding analysis and exploitation of variation''. Pangbourne, UK: Alpha Science International. Page 446.</ref>
* '''''Triple cross hybrids'''''&nbsp;— result from the crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids.
* '''''Population hybrids'''''&nbsp;— result from the crossing of plants or animals in a [[population]] with another population. These include crosses between organisms such as interspecific hybrids or crosses between different breeds.
* '''''Stable hybrid'''''&nbsp;– a [[horticultural]] term which typically refers to an [[annual plant]] that, if grown and bred in a small [[monoculture]] free of external [[pollen]] (e.g., an air-filtered greenhouse) will produce offspring that are "true to type" with respect to [[phenotype]]; i.e., a [[true breeding organism]].<ref>Toogood, A.(ed.) (1999). ''Plant Propagation'' (1st American ed.). American Horticultural Society. ISBN 0-7894-5520-X page 21</ref>
* '''''Hybrid species'''''&nbsp;– results from hybrid populations evolving [[Reproductive isolation|reproductive barriers]] against their parent species through [[hybrid speciation]].<ref name=Arnold>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=M.L.|title=Natural Hybridization and Evolution|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509975-1|page=232}}</ref>

==Interspecific hybrids==
Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating two species, normally from within the same [[genus]]. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents. The offspring of an interspecific cross are very often [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]]; thus, hybrid sterility prevents the movement of genes from one species to the other, keeping both species distinct.<ref>Keeton, William T. 1980. ''Biological science''. New York: Norton. ISBN 0-393-95021-2 Page 800</ref> Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes the two species have, for example [[donkey]]s have 62 [[chromosomes]], while [[horse]]s have 64 chromosomes, and [[mule]]s and [[hinny|hinnies]] have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable [[gamete]]s, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during [[meiosis]], meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=3378453|year=1988|author1=Rong|first1=R|title=A fertile mule and hinny in China|journal=Cytogenetics and cell genetics|volume=47|issue=3|pages=134–9|last2=Chandley|first2=A. C.|last3=Song|first3=J|last4=McBeath|first4=S|last5=Tan|first5=P. P.|last6=Bai|first6=Q|last7=Speed|first7=R. M.|doi=10.1159/000132531}}</ref>

Most often other processes occurring in plants and animals keep gametic isolation and species distinction. Species often have different mating or courtship patterns or behaviors, the breeding seasons may be distinct and even if mating does occur antigenic reactions to the sperm of other species prevent fertilization or embryo development. Hybridisation is much more common among organisms that spawn indiscriminately, like [[soft corals]] and among [[plant]]s.

While it is possible to predict the genetic composition of a backcross ''on average'', it is not possible to accurately predict the composition of a particular backcrossed individual, due to random segregation of chromosomes. In a species with two pairs of chromosomes, a twice backcrossed individual would be predicted to contain 12.5% of one species' genome (say, species A). However, it may, in fact, still be a 50% hybrid if the chromosomes from species A were lucky in two successive segregations, and meiotic crossovers happened near the [[telomere]]s. The chance of this is fairly high: <math>\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{(2 \times 2)} = \frac{1}{16}</math> (where the "two times two" comes about from two rounds of meiosis with two chromosomes); however, this probability declines markedly with chromosome number and so the actual composition of a hybrid will be increasingly closer to the predicted composition.

==Hybrid species==
{{Main|Hybrid speciation}}
While not very common, a few animal species have been recognized as being the result of hybridization. The [[Lonicera fly]] is an example of a novel [[animal]] [[species]] that resulted from natural hybridization.  The American [[red wolf]] appears to be a hybrid species between [[gray wolf]] and [[coyote]],<ref name=Hybrid>{{cite news|last=Esch|first=Mary|title=Study: Eastern wolves are hybrids with coyotes|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hIGn3MyVkj3dkd4W2UljCK0y4sVg?docId=787311a8475a4d3aae6e8498aa2edd80|agency=Associated Press}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> although its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic status]] has been a subject of controversy.<ref name=Rutledge>{{cite journal |title=Conservation genomics in perspective: A holistic approach to understanding Canis evolution in North America  |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=155 |year=2012 |pages=186–192|url=http://people.trentu.ca/brentpatterson/index_files/Rutledge%20et%20al%202012%20-%20conservation%20genomics%20in%20perspective.pdf |accessdate=2013-07-01 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.017|last1=Rutledge |first1=Linda Y. |last2=Wilson |first2=Paul J. |last3=Klütsch |first3=Cornelya F.C. |last4=Patterson |first4=Brent R. |last5=White |first5=Bradley N. }}</ref><ref name=Chambers>{{cite journal |title=An account of the taxonomy of North American wolves from morphological and genetic analyses |year=2012 |journal=North American Fauna |volume=77 |pages=1–67 |url=http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/pdf/10.3996/nafa.77.0001 |accessdate=2013-07-02 |doi=10.3996/nafa.77.0001|last1=Chambers |first1=Steven M. |last2=Fain |first2=Steven R. |last3=Fazio |first3=Bud |last4=Amaral |first4=Michael }}</ref><ref name=nceas>Dumbacher, J., [http://www.fws.gov/home/wolfrecovery/pdf/Final_Review_of_Proposed_rule_regarding_wolves2014.pdf Review of Proposed Rule Regarding Status of the Wolf Under the Endangered Species Act], NCEAS (January 2014)</ref> The European [[edible frog]] appears to be a species, but is actually a semi-permanent hybrid between [[pool frog]]s and [[marsh frog]]s.

Hybrid species of [[plant]]s are much more common than animals. Many of the crop species are hybrids, and hybridization appears to be an important factor in speciation in some plant groups.

Contrary to popular belief, boa–python hybrids are not possible due to their differing reproductive functions. Boas only produce hybrids with other species of boas, and pythons only produce hybrids with other species of pythons.

Many hybrids are created by humans, but natural hybrids occur as well. Plant species hybridize more readily than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are more often fertile hybrids and may reproduce, though there still exist sterile hybrids and selective hybrid elimination where the offspring are less able to survive and are thus eliminated before they can reproduce. A number of plant species are the result of hybridization and [[polyploidy]] with many plant species easily cross pollinating and producing viable seeds, the distinction between each species is often maintained by geographical isolation or differences in the flowering period. Since plants hybridize frequently without much work, they are often created by humans in order to produce improved plants. These improvements can include the production of more or improved seeds, fruits or other plant parts for consumption, or to make a plant more winter or heat hardy or improve its growth and/or appearance for use in horticulture. Much work is now being done with hybrids to produce more disease resistant plants for both agricultural and horticultural crops. In many groups of plants hybridization has been used to produce larger and more showy flowers and new flower colors. Hybridization may be restricted to the desired parent species through the use of [[pollination bags]].

Many plant genera and species have their origins in polyploidy. Autopolyploidy results from the sudden multiplication in the number of chromosomes in typical normal populations caused by unsuccessful separation of the chromosomes during meiosis. Tetraploids (plants with four sets of chromosomes rather than two) are common in a number of different groups of plants and over time these plants can differentiate into distinct species from the normal diploid line. In ''Oenothera lamarchiana'' the diploid species has 14 chromosomes, this species has spontaneously given rise to plants with 28 chromosomes that have been given the name ''Oenothera gigas''. When hybrids are formed between the tetraploids and the diploid population, the resulting offspring tend to be sterile triploids, thus effectively stopping the intermixing of genes between the two groups of plants (unless the diploids, in rare cases, produce unreduced gametes).

Another form of polyploidy called [[allopolyploid]]y occurs when two different species mate and produce polyploid hybrids. Usually the typical chromosome number is doubled, and the four sets of chromosomes can pair up during meiosis, thus the polyploids can produce offspring. Usually, these offspring can mate and reproduce with each other but cannot back-cross with the parent species. Allopolyploids may be able to adapt to new habitats that neither of their parent species inhabited.

Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid is often a result of [[chromosome]] number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of [[chromosomes]], leaving them unable to produce chromosomally balanced [[gametes]].<ref>[http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB2150Fall/notes00/L0033.html University of Colorado Principles of Genetics (MCDB 2150) Lecture 33: Chromosomal changes: Monosomy, Trisomy, Polyploidy, Structural Changes]</ref> While this is undesirable in a crop such as [[wheat]], where growing a crop which produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. [[Triploid]] [[banana]]s and [[watermelon]]s are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds (and are [[parthenocarpy|parthenocarpic]]).

===Heterosis===
{{Main| heterosis }}
Hybrids are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon most common with plant hybrids, which when present is known as ''[[heterosis|hybrid vigor]]'' (heterosis) or heterozygote advantage.<ref>{{citation|title=Evaluating the utility of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model for understanding heterosis in hybrid crops

===Examples of plant hybrids===
The multiplication symbol × (not italicised) indicates a hybrid in the Latin [[binomial nomenclature]]. Placed before the binomial it indicates a hybrid between species from different genera (intergeneric hybrid):-
* × ''[[Fatshedera lizei]]'', a hybrid between ''[[Hedera helix]]'' and ''[[Fatsia japonica]]''
* × ''[[Heucherella]]'', a hybrid genus between ''[[Heuchera]]'' and ''[[Tiarella]]''
* × ''Philageria veitchii'' is a hybrid between ''[[Lapageria rosea]]'' and ''[[Philesia magellanica]]''; it is more similar in appearance to the former
* [[Leyland cypress]], [× ''Cupressocyparis leylandii''] hybrid between [[Monterey cypress]] and [[Nootka cypress]]
* [[Triticale]], [× ''Triticosecale''] a [[wheat]]–[[rye]] hybrid
* × ''[[Urceocharis]]'', a hybrid between ''[[Eucharis (plant)|Eucharis]]'' and ''[[Urceolina]]''

Interspecific plant hybrids include:
* ''Dianthus'' × ''allwoodii'' (''[[Dianthus caryophyllus]]'' × ''[[Dianthus plumarius]]'')
* [[Limequat]] ''Citrus'' × ''floridana'', [[key lime]] ''Citrus aurantiifolia'' and [[kumquat]] ''Citrus japonica'' hybrid
* [[Loganberry]] ''Rubus'' × ''loganobaccus'', a hybrid between [[raspberry]] ''[[Rubus idaeus]]'' and [[blackberry]] ''[[Rubus ursinus]]''
* [[London plane]] (''[[Platanus orientalis]]'' × ''[[Platanus occidentalis]]''), thus forming ''Platanus'' × ''acerifolia''
* ''Magnolia'' × ''alba'' (''[[Magnolia champaca]]'' × ''[[Magnolia montana]]'')
* [[Peppermint]], a hybrid between [[spearmint]] and [[water mint]]
* ''Quercus'' × ''warei'' (''[[Quercus robur]]'' × ''[[Quercus bicolor]]'') 'Nadler' (marketed in the United States under the trade name [[Kindred Spirit hybrid oak]])
* [[Tangelo]], a hybrid of a [[Mandarin orange]] and a [[pomelo]] which may have been developed in Asia about 3,500 years ago
* [[Wheat]]; most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids. Bread wheat is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses; [[durum]] (pasta) wheat is a tetraploid hybrid of two wild grasses
* [[Grapefruit]], hybrid between a [[pomelo]] and the Jamaican sweet [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]

Some natural hybrids:
* ''[[Iris albicans]]'', a sterile hybrid which spreads by rhizome division
* [[Oenothera|Evening primrose]], a flower which was the subject of famous experiments by [[Hugo de Vries]] on [[polyploidy]] and [[diploidy]]

==Hybrids in nature==
Hybridization between two closely related species is actually a common occurrence in nature but is also being greatly influenced by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] changes as well.<ref name="Allendorf 2001 613–622">{{cite journal|last=Allendorf|first=Fred W. |author2=R.F.

Hybrids can be either sterile/not viable or viable/fertile. This affects the kind of effect that this hybrid will have on its and other populations that it interacts with.<ref name="Allendorf 2007 421–448">{{cite book|last=Allendorf|first=Fred|title=Conservation and the Genetics of Populations|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|pages=421–448}}</ref> Many [[hybrid zone]]s are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of [[speciation]] ([[Hybrid speciation]]). Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the [[North West Territories]] confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile [[grizzly–polar bear hybrid]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4766217.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=13 May 2006|title=Hybrid bear shot dead in Canada}}</ref>

===Anthropogenic hybridization===
Changes to the environment caused by humans, such as [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] and [[Introduced species]], are becoming more widespread.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ehrlich|first=Paul|author2=John Holdren|title=Impact of population Growth|journal=Science|date=26 March 1971|volume=171|pages=1212–1216| doi=10.1126/science.171.3977.1212|issue=3977 }}</ref> This increases the challenges in managing certain populations that are experiencing [[introgression]], and is a focus of [[conservation genetics]].

====Introduced species and habitat fragmentation====

Humans have [[introduced species]] worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally such as establishing a population to be used as a [[biological control]], and unintentionally such as accidental escapes of individuals out of agriculture. This causes drastic global effects on various populations, including through hybridization.<ref name="Allendorf 2007 421–448"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vitousek|first=Peter|author2=Carla M. D'Antonio |author3=Lloyd L.

When habitats become broken apart, one of two things can occur, genetically speaking. The first is that populations that were once connected can be cut off from one another, preventing their genes from interacting. Occasionally, this will result in a population of one species breeding with a population of another species as a means of surviving such as the case with the [[red wolf|red wolves]]. Their population numbers being so small, they needed another means of survival. Habitat fragmentation also led to the influx of generalist species into areas where they would not have been, leading to competition and in some cases interbreeding/incorporation of a population into another. In this way, habitat fragmentation is essentially an indirect method of introducing species to an area.

===The hybridization continuum===
There is a kind of continuum with three semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without [[Introgression]], hybridization with widespread introgression, and essentially a [[Hybrid swarm]].<ref name="Allendorf 2001 613–622"/> Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within [[Wildlife management]] and habitat management. [[Global warming|Global climate change]] is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.

===Consequences===
Hybridization can be a less discussed way toward [[extinction]] than within detection of where a population lies along the hybrid continuum. The dispute of hybridization is how to manage the resulting hybrids. When a population experiences hybridization with substantial introgression, there still exists parent types of each set of individuals. When a complete hybrid swarm is created, all the individuals are hybrids.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Management of hybrids===
Conservationists disagree on when is the proper time to give up on a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once it becomes a complete mixture, we should look to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss.<ref name="Allendorf 2001 613–622"/> Most leave it as a case-by-case basis, depending on detecting of hybrids within the group. It is nearly impossible to regulate hybridization via policy because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs "naturally" and there is the matter of protecting those previously mentioned hybrid swarms because if they are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.<ref name="Allendorf 2001 613–622"/>

===Expression of parental traits in hybrids===
When two distinct types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one parent has red flowers, the other has white, and the hybrid, pink flowers).<ref name="McCarthy, Eugene M 2006. Pp. 16-17">McCarthy, Eugene M. 2006. ''Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Pp. 16-17.</ref> Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a [[bird hybrid]] might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).<ref name="McCarthy, Eugene M 2006. Pp. 16-17"/>

In a hybrid, any trait that falls outside the range of parental variation is termed [[Heterosis|heterotic]]. Heterotic hybrids do have new traits, that is, they are not intermediate. ''Positive heterosis'' produces more robust hybrids, they might be stronger or bigger; while the term ''negative heterosis'' refers to weaker or smaller hybrids.<ref>McCarthy, Eugene M. 2006. ''Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. P. 17.</ref> Heterosis is common in both animal and plant hybrids. For example, hybrids between a lion and a tigress ("ligers") are much larger than either of the two progenitors, while a tigon (lioness × tiger) is smaller. Also the hybrids between the common pheasant (''[[Phasianus colchicus]]'') and domestic fowl (''[[Gallus gallus]]'') are larger than either of their parents, as are those produced between the common pheasant and hen golden pheasant (''[[Chrysolophus pictus]]'').<ref>Darwin, C. 1868. ''Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,'' vol. II, p. 125</ref> Spurs are absent in hybrids of the former type, although present in both parents.<ref>Spicer, J. W. G. 1854. Note on hybrid gallinaceous birds. ''The Zoologist,'' 12: 4294-4296 (see p. 4295).</ref>

===Genetic mixing and extinction===
{{Main|Genetic pollution}}
Regionally developed [[ecotype]]s can be threatened with [[extinction]] when new [[allele]]s or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This is sometimes called [[genetic mixing]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mooney | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Cleland | first2 = E. E. | year = 2001 | title = The evolutionary impact of invasive species | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=33232 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. | volume = 98 | issue = 10| pages = 5446–5451 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.091093398 | pmid = 11344292 | pmc = 33232 }}</ref> Hybridization and [[introgression]] of new genetic material can lead to the replacement of local [[genotypes]] if the hybrids are more [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population to such a degree that none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rhymer | first1 = JM | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D | year = 1996 | title = Extinction by Hybridization and Introgression | url = http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 83–109 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 }}</ref><ref>Brad M.

===Effect on biodiversity and food security===
{{Main|biodiversity|food security}}
In agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]]'s use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding "[[high-yielding varieties]]". The replacement of locally indigenous breeds, compounded with unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding ([[genetic mixing]]), has reduced the gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds resulting in the loss of [[genetic diversity]].<ref>Devinder Sharma [http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html "Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal"]; Bulletin 28. hosted by www.farmedia.org</ref> Since the indigenous breeds are often well-adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens this can be a significant [[genetic erosion]] of the gene pool for future breeding. Therefore, commercial plant geneticists strive to breed "widely adapted" cultivars to counteract this tendency.<ref>Troyer, A. Forrest. ''Breeding Widely Adapted Cultivars: Examples from Maize.'' Encyclopedia of Plant and Crop Science, 27 February 2004.</ref>

==Limiting factors==
A number of conditions exist that limit the success of hybridization, the most obvious is great genetic diversity between most species. But in animals and plants that are more closely related hybridization barriers can include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In plants, barriers to hybridization include blooming period differences, different pollinator vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and structural differences of the chromosomes.<ref>{{citation|title=Barriers to hybridization of Solanum bulbocastanumDun. and S.

==Mythical, legendary and religious hybrids==
{{main|Mythological hybrid}}
Ancient folktales often contain mythological creatures, sometimes these are described as hybrids (e.g., [[hippogriff]] as the offspring of a [[griffin]] and a [[horse]], and the [[Minotaur]] which is the offspring of [[Pasiphaë]] and a white bull). More often they are kind of [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]], i.e., a composite of the physical attributes of two or more kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and often humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, e.g., [[Harpy|harpies]], [[mermaid]]s, and [[centaur]]s.

In the [[Bible]], the [[Old Testament]] contains several passages which talk about a first generation of hybrid giants who were known as the [[Nephilim]].<ref>[[James L. Kugel]] (2009), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=y8AjDrIkBG4C&printsec=frontcover&hl=es#v=onepage&q&f=false Traditions of the Bible: A Guide to the Bible As It Was at the Start of the Common Era]", [[Harvard University Press]], p. 198</ref> The [[Book of Genesis]] (6:4) states that "the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them". As a result, the offspring was born as hybrid [[giant (mythology)|giants]] who became mighty heroes of old and legendary famous figures of ancient times.<ref>[[James L. Kugel]] (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=i8ppE9olz_AC&printsec=frontcover&hl=es#v=onepage&q&f=false The Bible as it was], [[Harvard University Press]], p. 110</ref>  In addition, the [[Book of Numbers]] (13:33) says that the descendants of [[Anak]] came from the Nephilim, whose bodies looked exactly like men, but with an  enormous height. According to the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Book of Enoch]] the  Nephilim were wicked sons of [[fallen angel]]s who had lusted with attractive women.<ref>Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: The Bible & Spiritual Conflict, p. 177</ref>
