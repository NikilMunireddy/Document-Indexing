{{nihongo|'''Hyōgo Prefecture'''|兵庫県|Hyōgo-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located in the [[Kansai region]] on [[Honshu]] island.<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Hyōgo prefecture" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 363-365|page=363}}; "Kansai" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 477|page=477}}.</ref> The capital is [[Kobe]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Kobe" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 537|page=537}}.</ref>

== History ==
Present-day Hyōgo Prefecture includes the former [[Provinces of Japan|provinces]] of [[Harima Province|Harima]], [[Tajima Province|Tajima]], [[Awaji Province|Awaji]], and parts of [[Tamba Province|Tamba]] and [[Settsu Province|Settsu]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 780|page=780}}.</ref>

In 1180, near the end of the [[Heian Period]], [[Emperor Antoku]], [[Taira no Kiyomori]], and the Imperial court moved briefly to Fukuhara, in what is now the city of Kobe. There the capital remained for five months.

[[Himeji Castle]], a [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is in the city of Himeji.

Southern Hyōgo Prefecture was severely devastated by the 6.9 [[Moment magnitude scale|Mw]] [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] of 1995, which destroyed major parts of Kobe and [[Awaji, Hyōgo|Awaji]], as well as [[Takarazuka, Hyōgo|Takarazuka]] and neighboring [[Osaka Prefecture]], killing nearly 6,500 people.

Hyōgo has coastlines on two seas: to the north, the [[Sea of Japan]], to the south, the [[Seto Inland Sea]]. The northern portion is sparsely populated, except for the city of [[Toyooka]], and the central highlands are only populated by tiny villages. Most of Hyōgo's population lives on the southern coast, which is part of the [[Keihanshin|Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto]] metropolitan area. [[Awaji Island]] is an island that separates the Inland Sea and [[Osaka Bay]], lying between Honshu and [[Shikoku]].

Summertime weather throughout Hyōgo is hot and humid. As for winter conditions in Hyōgo, the north of Hyōgo tends to receive abundant snow, whilst the south receives only the occasional flurry.

Hyōgo borders on [[Osaka Prefecture]], [[Kyoto Prefecture]], [[Tottori Prefecture]] and [[Okayama Prefecture]].

As of March 31, 2008, 20% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Sanin Kaigan National Park|Sanin Kaigan]] and [[Setonaikai National Park|Setonaikai]] National Parks; [[Hyōnosen-Ushiroyama-Nagisan Quasi-National Park]]; and [[Asago Gunzan Prefectural Natural Park|Asago Gunzan]], [[Harima Chūbu Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Park|Harima Chūbu Kyūryō]], [[Inagawa Keikoku Prefectural Natural Park|Inagawa Keikoku]], [[Izushi-Itoi Prefectural Natural Park|Izushi-Itoi]], [[Kasagatayama-Sengamine Prefectural Natural Park|Kasagatayama-Sengamine]], [[Kiyomizu-Tōjōko-Tachikui Prefectural Natural Park|Kiyomizu-Tōjōko-Tachikui]], [[Onzui-Chikusa Prefectural Natural Park|Onzui-Chikusa]], [[Seiban Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Park|Seiban Kyūryō]], [[Seppiko-Mineyama Prefectural Natural Park|Seppiko-Mineyama]], [[Tajima Sangaku Prefectural Natural Park|Tajima Sangaku]], and [[Taki Renzan Prefectural Natural Park|Taki Renzan]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref>
