{{History of Iraq}}
'''Babylonia''' was an ancient [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking [[state (polity)|state]] and [[cultural region]] based in central-southern [[Mesopotamia]] (present-day [[Iraq]]). A small [[Amorite]]-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor city of [[Babylon]].<ref>F. Leo Oppenheim - Ancient Mesopotamia</ref> Babylon greatly expanded during the reign of [[Hammurabi]] in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called ''Māt Akkadī'' "the country of Akkad" in the [[Akkadian language]].<ref>http://www.aliraqi.org/forums/showthread.php?t=69813 Aliraqi - Babylonian Empire</ref><ref>http://www.livius.org/articles/place/babylonian-empire/ Babylonian Empire - Livius</ref>

It was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow Akkadian-speaking state of [[Assyria]] in northern Mesopotamia. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after [[Hammurabi]] (fl. c. 1792 – 1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696&nbsp;– 1654 BC, [[short chronology timeline|short chronology]]) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], and [[Assyria#Old Assyrian Kingdom|Old Assyrian Empire]]; however, the Babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi.

The Babylonian state, like Assyria to the north, retained the written Akkadian language for official use (the language of its native populace), despite its [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite-speaking]] Amorite founders and [[Kassites|Kassite]] successors, who spoke a [[language isolate]]. It retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use (as did Assyria), but by the time Babylon was founded, this was no longer a spoken language, having been wholly subsumed by Akkadian. The earlier Akkadian and Sumerian traditions played a major role in Babylonian and Assyrian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under protracted periods of outside rule.

The earliest mention of the city of Babylon can be found in a [[clay tablet]] from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] (2334–2279 BC), dating back to the 23rd century BC. Babylon was merely a religious and cultural centre at this point and neither an independent state nor a large city; like the rest of Mesopotamia, it was subject to the [[Akkadian Empire]] which united all the Akkadian and Sumerian speakers under one rule. After the collapse of the Akkadian empire, the south Mesopotamian region was dominated by the [[Gutian people]] for a few decades before the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur, which, apart from northern Assyria, encompassed the whole of Mesopotamia, including the city of Babylon.

A modern [[Assyrian nationalism]] is espoused by the [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic-speaking]] peoples known as the [[Assyrian people]]. They are members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], offshoots of the Assyrian Church such as the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]], as well as the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]] (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=George|first=Andrew|title=Babylon and Assyrian: A History of Akkadian|publisher=School Of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|url=https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/3139/1/PAGE_31-71.pdf}}</ref>

===Pre-Babylonian Sumero-Akkadian period in Mesopotamia===
[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|300px|The extent of the Babylonian Empire at the start and end of Hammurabi's reign]]
Mesopotamia had already enjoyed a long history prior to the emergence of Babylon, with [[Sumer]]ian civilisation emerging in the region c. 3500 BC, and the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] - speaking people appearing by the 30th century BC.

During the [[3rd millennium BC|third millennium BC]], there had developed an intimate cultural symbiosis between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name='Deutscher'>{{Cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}</ref> The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name='Deutscher'/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name='Deutscher'/>

Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the third and the second millennium BC (the precise timeframe being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods">Woods C. 2006 "Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian". In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91-120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]</ref> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia as late as the 1st century AD.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

From c. 3500 BC until the rise of the [[Akkadian Empire]] in the 24th century BC, Mesopotamia had been dominated by largely [[Sumer]]ian city states, such as [[Ur]], [[Lagash]], [[Uruk]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Eridu]], [[Gasur]], [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]], [[Hamazi]], [[Akshak]] and [[Umma]], although Semitic Akkadian names began to appear on the king lists of some of these states (such as [[Eshnunna]] and [[Assyria]]) between the 29th and 25th centuries BC. Traditionally, the major religious center of all Mesopotamia was the city of [[Nippur]], and it would remain so until replaced by [[Babylon]] during the reign of [[Hammurabi]] in the mid-18th century BC.

The [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334–2154 BC) saw the Akkadian Semites and Sumerians of Mesopotamia unite under one rule, and the Akkadians fully attain ascendancy over the Sumerians and indeed come to dominate much of the ancient [[Near East]].

The empire eventually disintegrated due to economic decline, climate change and civil war, followed by attacks by the [[Gutians]] from the [[Zagros Mountains]]. The [[Sumerians]] rose up with the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] ([[Third Dynasty of Ur]]) in the late 22nd century BC, and ejected the Gutians from southern Mesopotamia. They also seem to have gained ascendancy over most of the territory of the Akkadian kings of [[Assyria]] in northern Mesopotamia for a time.

Following the collapse of the [[Sumer]]ian "Ur-III" dynasty at the hands of the [[Elam]]ites in 2002 BC, the [[Amorite]]s, a foreign [[Northwest Semitic]] people who spoke a [[Canaanite language]], began to migrate into southern Mesopotamia from the northern [[Levant]], gradually gaining control over most of southern Mesopotamia, where they formed a series of small kingdoms, while the native [[Assyrians]] reasserted their independence in the north. The [[Sumero-Akkadian]] states of the south were unable to stem the Amorite advance.

King [[Ilushuma]] (ca. 2008–1975 BC) of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] in a known inscription describes his exploits to the south as follows: ''"The freedom<ref group=n>Freedom = Akk. ''addurāru''.</ref> of the [[Akkadians]] and their children I established. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and [[Ur]] and [[Nippur]], [[Awal]], and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] of the goddess [[Ishtar]], as far as the City of ([[Ashur]])."''<ref name=grayson>{{ cite book | title = Assyrian Royal Inscriptions, Volume 1 | author = A. K. Grayson | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | year = 1972 | pages = 7–8 }}</ref> Past scholars originally extrapolated from this text that it means he defeated the invading [[Amorites]] to the south, but there is no explicit record of that.  More recently, the text has been taken to mean that Asshur supplied the south with copper from Anatolia and "established freedom" from tax duties.

These policies were continued by his successors [[Erishum I]] and [[Ikunum]].

However, when [[Sargon I]] (1920–1881 BC) succeeded as king in Assyria in 1920 BC, he eventually withdrew Assyria from the region, preferring to concentrate on continuing the vigorous expansion of Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]], and eventually southern Mesopotamia fell to the Amorites, a [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] speaking people from the northern [[Levant]]. During the first centuries of what is called the "Amorite period", the most powerful [[City-state|city states]] in the south were [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]], together with [[Assyria]] in the north.

===First Babylonian Dynasty – Amorite Dynasty 1894–1595 BC===
{{Main|First Babylonian Dynasty}}
One of these Canaanite speaking Amorite dynasties founded a small kingdom which included the then still minor town of [[Babylon]] circa 1894 BC, which would ultimately take over the others and form the short-lived first Babylonian empire, also called the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] Period.

An [[Amorite]] chieftain named [[Sumuabum]] appropriated a tract of land which included the then relatively small city of Babylon from the neighbouring Amorite ruled Mesopotamian city state of [[Kazallu]], of which it had initially been a territory, turning it into a state in its own right. His reign was concerned with establishing statehood amongst a sea of other minor city states and kingdoms in the region. However Sumuabum appears never to have bothered to give himself the title of ''King of Babylon'', suggesting that Babylon itself was still only a minor town or city, and not worthy of kingship.<ref>Robert William Rogers, A History of Babylonia and Assyria, Volume I, Eaton and Mains, 1900.</ref>

He was followed by [[Sumu-la-El]], [[Sabium]], [[Apil-Sin]], each of whom ruled in the same vague manner as Sumuabum, with no reference to kingship of Babylon being made in any written records of the time. [[Sin-muballit]] was the first of these Amorite rulers to be regarded officially as a king of Babylon, and then on only one single clay tablet. Under these kings, the nation in which Babylon lay remained a small nation which controlled very little territory, and was overshadowed by neighbouring kingdoms that were both older, larger, and more powerful, such as; [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Assyria]] to the north and [[Elam]] to the east in [[Ancient Iran]]. The ''pre-Iranian'' [[Language Isolate]] speaking Elamites, in particular, occupied huge swathes of southern Mesopotamia, and the early Amorite rulers were largely held in vassalage to Elam.

====Empire of Hammurabi====
Babylon remained a minor town in a small state until the reign of its sixth Amorite ruler, [[Hammurabi]] (1792–1750 BC, or [[floruit|fl.]] c. 1728&nbsp;– 1686 BC ([[short chronology timeline|short]]). He conducted major building work in Babylon, expanding it from a small town into a great city worthy of kingship. He was a very efficient ruler, establishing a bureaucracy, with taxation and centralized government. Hammurabi freed Babylon from [[Elamites|Elamite]] dominance, and indeed drove them from southern Mesopotamia entirely.  He then gradually expanded Babylonian dominance over the whole of southern Mesopotamia, conquering the cities and states of the region, such as; Isin, Larsa, [[Eshnunna]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Lagash]], [[Nippur]], [[Borsippa]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Umma]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]] and [[Eridu]]. The conquests of Hammurabi gave the region stability after turbulent times and coalesced the patchwork of states of southern and central Mesopotamia into one single nation, and it is only from the time of Hammurabi that southern Mesopotamia came to be known historically as ''Babylonia''.

The armies of Babylonia under Hammurabi were well-disciplined. He turned eastwards and invaded what was a thousand years later to become [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), conquering the ''pre Iranic'' [[Elamites]], [[Gutians]], [[Lullubi]] and [[Kassites]]. To the west, the [[Amorites|Amorite states]] of the [[Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]]) including the powerful kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] were conquered.

Hammurabi then entered into a protracted war with the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] for control of [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Near East]]. Assyria had extended control over [[Hurrian]] and [[Hattians|Hattian]] parts of south east [[Asia Minor]] from the 21st century BC, and from the latter part of the 19th century BC had asserted itself over the north east [[Levant]] and central Mesopotamia also. After a protracted unresolved struggle over decades with the Assyrian king [[Ishme-Dagan]], Hammurabi forced his successor [[Mut-Ashkur]] to pay tribute to Babylon c. 1751 BC, thus giving Babylonia control over Assyria's centuries old Hattian and Hurrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]].<ref>Oppenheim Ancient Mesopotamia</ref>

One of the most important works of this "[[First Dynasty of Babylon]]", as it was called by the native historians, was the compilation of [[Babylonian law|a code of laws]] which were both influenced by and improved upon the much earlier [[written law]]s of [[Sumer]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] and [[Assyria]]. This was made by order of Hammurabi after the expulsion of the [[Elam]]ites and the settlement of his kingdom. In 1901, a copy of the [[Code of Hammurabi]] was discovered on a [[stele]] by [[J. De Morgan]] and [[V. Scheil]] at [[Susa]], where it had later been taken as plunder. That copy is now in the [[Louvre]].

From before 3000 BC until the reign of Hammurabi, the major cultural and religious center of southern Mesopotamia had been the ancient city of [[Nippur]], where the god [[Enlil]] was supreme. However, with the rise of Hammurabi, this honour was transferred to Babylon, and the south Mesopotamian god [[Marduk]] rose to supremacy in the pantheon of southern Mesopotamia (with the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] remaining the dominant deity in the northern Mesopotamian state of Assyria). The city of Babylon became known as a "holy city" where any legitimate ruler of ''southern Mesopotamia'' had to be crowned. Hammurabi turned what had previously been a minor administrative town into a powerful and influential major city, increasing its size and population dramatically, and conducting a number of impressive architectural works.

The Babylonians, like their predecessor [[Sumero-Akkadian]] states, engaged in regular trade with the [[Amorite]] and [[Canaan]]ite city-states to the west; with Babylonian officials or troops sometimes passing to the [[Levant]] and Canaan, with Amorite merchants operating freely throughout Mesopotamia. The Babylonian monarchy's western connections remained strong for quite some time. An Amorite chieftain named Abi-ramu or Abram (possibly the Biblical Abraham) was the father of a witness to a deed dated to the reign of Hammurabi's grandfather;{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Ammi-Ditana]], great-grandson of Hammurabi, still titled himself "king of the land of the Amorites". Ammi-Ditana's father and son also bore Canaanite names: [[Abi-Eshuh]] and [[Ammi-Saduqa|Ammisaduqa]].

====Decline====
However, southern Mesopotamia had no natural, defensible boundaries, making it vulnerable to attack. After the death of Hammurabi, his empire began to disintegrate rapidly. Under his successor [[Samsu-iluna]] (1749–1712 BC) the far south of Mesopotamia was lost to a native Akkadian speaking king called [[Ilum-ma-ili]] who ejected the Amorite ruled Babylonians. The south became the [[Sealand Dynasty]], remaining free of Babylon for the next 272 years.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq">Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''</ref>

Both the Babylonians and their Amorite rulers were driven from [[Assyria]] to the north by an Assyrian-Akkadian governor named [[Puzur-Sin]] c. 1740 BC, who regarded king [[Mut-Ashkur]] as a foreign Amorite and a former lackey of Babylon. After six years of civil war in Assyria, a native king named [[Adasi]] seized power c. 1735 BC, and went on to appropriate former Babylonian and Amorite territory in central Mesopotamia, as did his successor [[Bel-bani]].

Amorite rule survived in a much reduced Babylon, Samshu-iluna's successor [[Abi-Eshuh]] made a vain attempt to recapture the [[Sealand Dynasty]] for Babylon, but met defeat at the hands of king [[Damqi-ilishu II]]. By the end of his reign Babylonia had shrunk to the small and relatively weak nation it had been upon its foundation, although the city itself was far larger than it had been prior to the rise of Hammurabi.

He was followed by [[Ammi-Ditana]] and then [[Ammisaduqa]], both of whom were in too weak a position to make any attempt to regain the many territories lost after the death of Hammurabi, contenting themselves with peaceful building projects in Babylon itself.

[[Samsu-Ditana]] was to be the last Amorite ruler of Babylon. Early in his reign he came under pressure from the [[Kassites]], a [[Language Isolate]] speaking people originating in the mountains of north west [[Ancient Iran]]. Babylon was then attacked by the [[Indo-European]] speaking and [[Asia Minor]] based [[Hittite Empire]] in 1595 BC. Shamshu-Ditana was overthrown following the "sack of Babylon" by the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Mursili I]]. The Hittites did not remain for long, but the destruction wrought by them finally enabled the [[Kassites]] to gain control.

====The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology====
The date of the sack of Babylon by the Hittites under king Mursili I is considered crucial to the various calculations of the early [[chronology of the ancient Near East]], as it is taken as a fixed point in the discussion. Suggestions for its precise date vary by as much as 230 years, corresponding to the uncertainty regarding the length of the "Dark Age" of the ensuing [[Bronze Age collapse]], resulting in the shift of the entire Bronze Age chronology of Mesopotamia with regard to the [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]]. Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are:
*ultra-short chronology: 1499 BC
*short chronology: 1531 BC
*middle chronology: 1595 BC
*long chronology: 1651 BC
*ultra-long chronology: 1736 BC<ref>Eder, Christian., Assyrische Distanzangaben und die absolute Chronologie Vorderasiens, AoF 31, 191–236, 2004.</ref>

===Kassite Dynasty, 1595–1155 BC===
{{Main|Kassites}}
[[File:Kassite Babylonia EN.svg|thumb|300px|The extent of the Babylonian Empire during the Kassite dynasty]]
The Kassite dynasty was founded by [[Gandash]] of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. The Kassites, like the Amorite rulers who had preceded them, were not originally native to Mesopotamia. Rather, they had first appeared in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of what is today northwestern [[Iran]].

The ethnic affiliation of the Kassites is unclear, though like the Sumerian and Akkadian Mesopotamian peoples and the Amorites, the Kassites were [[Caucasoid]] in appearance. However their [[Kassite language]] was not [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], and is thought to have been either a [[language isolate]] or possibly related to the [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian]] family of [[Asia Minor]],<ref name=Schneider>{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Thomas|title=Kassitisch und Hurro-Urartäisch. Ein Diskussionsbeitrag zu möglichen lexikalischen Isoglossen|journal=Altorientalische Forschungen|year=2003|issue=30|pages=372–381|language=German}}</ref> although the evidence for its genetic affiliation is meager due to the scarcity of extant texts. However, several Kassite leaders bore [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] names, and they may have had an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] elite similar to the [[Mitanni]] elite that later ruled over the [[Hurrians]] of central and eastern Asia Minor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/46842/Early-Vedic-period |title=India: Early Vedic period |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293553/Iranian-art-and-architecture/37848/Median-period |title=Iranian art and architecture |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>

The Kassites renamed Babylon [[Karduniash|"Kar-Duniash"]], and their rule lasted for 576 years, the longest dynasty in Babylonian history.

This new foreign dominion offers a striking analogy to the roughly contemporary rule of the [[Hyksos]] in [[ancient Egypt]]. Most divine attributes ascribed to the Amorite kings of Babylonia disappeared at this time; the title "god" was never given to a Kassite sovereign. However, Babylon continued to be the capital of the kingdom and one of the 'holy' cities of western Asia, where the priests of the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] were all-powerful, and the only place where the right to inheritance of the short lived old Babylonian empire could be conferred.

Babylonia experienced short periods of power, but in general proved to be relatively weak under the long rule of the Kassites, and spent long periods under [[Assyria]]n and [[Elam]]ite domination and interference.

It is not clear precisely when Kassite rule of Babylon began, but the [[Indo-European]] Hittites from [[Asia Minor]] did not remain in Babylonia for long after the sacking of the city, and it is likely the Kassites moved in soon afterwards. [[Agum II]] took the throne for the Kassites in 1595 BC, and ruled a state that extended from Iran to the middle Euphrates; The new king retained peaceful relations with [[Erishum III]], the native Mesopotamian king of Assyria, but successfully went to war with the [[Hittite Empire]] of Asia Minor, and twenty four years after the Hittites took the sacred statue of [[Marduk]], he recovered it and declared the god equal to the [[Kassite deities|Kassite deity]] [[Shuqamuna]].

[[Burnaburiash I]] succeeded him and drew up a peace treaty with the Assyrian king [[Puzur-Ashur III]], and had a largely uneventful reign, as did his successor [[Kashtiliash III]].

Southern Mesopotamia (The [[Sealand Dynasty]]) remained independent of Babylonia and in native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] speaking hands. However [[Ulamburiash]] managed to attack it conquered parts of the land from ''Ea-gamil'', a king with a distinctly Sumerian name, around 1450 BC, whereupon Ea-Gamil fled to his allies in [[Elam]]. The Sealand Dynasty region remained independent however, and the Kassite king seems to have been unable to finally conquer it. Ulamburiash began making treaties with the [[Egyptians]] then ruling in southern [[Canaan]], and [[Assyria]] to the north. [[Karaindash]] built a bas-relief temple in [[Uruk]] and [[Kurigalzu I]] (1415–1390 BC) built a new capital [[Dur-Kurigalzu]] named after himself, transferring administrative rule from Babylon. Both of these kings continued to struggle unsuccessfully against The Sealand Dynasty.

[[Agum III]] also campaigned against the Sealand Dynasty, finally wholly conquering the far south of Mesopotamia for Babylon, destroying its capital [[Dur-Enlil]] in the process. From there Agum III extended farther south still, invading what was many centuries later to be called the [[Arabian peninsula]], and conquering the ''pre-Arab'' state of [[Dilmun]] (in modern [[Bahrain]]).

[[Karaindash]] strengthened diplomatic ties with the Assyrian king [[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] and the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Thutmosis III]] and protected Babylonian borders with Elam.

[[Kadašman-Ḫarbe I]] succeeded Karaindash, and briefly invaded Elam before being eventually ejected by its king [[Tepti Ahar]]. He then had to contend with the [[Suteans]], [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] from the southeastern [[Levant]] who invaded Babylonia and sacked [[Uruk]]. He describes having "annihilated their extensive forces", then constructed fortresses in a mountain region called [[Ḫiḫi]], in the desert to the west (modern [[Syria]]) as security outposts, and "he dug wells and settled people on fertile lands, to strengthen the guard".<ref>{{cite book |title=Babylonians |author=H. W. F. Saggs |publisher=British Museum Press |year=2000 |page=117}}</ref>

[[Kurigalzu I]] succeeded the throne, and soon came into conflict with Elam, to the east. When [[Ḫur-batila]], the successor of Tepti Ahar took the throne of Elam, he began raiding the Babylonia, taunting Kurigalzu to do battle with him at [[Dūr-Šulgi]]. Kurigalzu launched a campaign which resulted in the abject defeat and capture of Ḫur-batila, who appears in no other inscriptions. He went on to conquer the eastern lands of [[Susiana]] and [[Elam]]. This took his army to the Elamite capital, the city of [[Susa]], which was sacked. After this a puppet ruler was placed on the Elamite throne. Kurigalzu I maintained friendly relations with [[Assyria]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Hittites]] throughout his reign. [[Kadashman-Enlil I]] (1374-1360 BC) succeeded him, and continued his diplomatic policies.

[[Burnaburiash II]] ascended to the throne in 1359 BC, he retained friendly relations with Egypt, but the resurgent [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1050 BC) to the north was now encroaching into northern Babylonia, and as a symbol of peace, the Babylonian king took the daughter of the powerful Assyrian king [[Ashur-uballit I]] in marriage. He also maintained friendly relations with [[Suppiluliuma I]], ruler of the [[Hittite Empire]].

He was succeeded by [[Kara-hardash]] (who was half Assyrian, and the grandson of the Assyrian king) in 1333 BC, however a usurper named [[Nazi-Bugash]] deposed him, enraging [[Ashur-uballit I]], who invaded and sacked Babylon, slew Nazi-Bugash, annexed Babylonian territory for the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and installed [[Kurigalzu II]] (1345–1324 BC) as his vassal ruler.

Soon after [[Arik-den-ili]] succeeded the throne of Assyria in 1327 BC, Kurigalzu III attacked Assyria in an attempt to reassert Babylonian power. After some impressive initial successes he was ultimately defeated, and lost yet more territory to Assyria. Between 1307 BC and 1232 BC his successors, such as [[Nazi-Maruttash]], [[Kadashman-Turgu]], [[Kadashman-Enlil II]], [[Kudur-Enlil]] and [[Shagarakti-Shuriash]], allied with the empires of the [[Hittites]] and the [[Mitanni]], (who were both also losing swathes of territory to the Assyrians). in a failed attempt to stop Assyrian expansion, which nevertheless continued unchecked.

[[Kashtiliash IV]]'s (1242–1235 BC) reign ended catastrophically as the [[Assyria]]n king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1243–1207 BC) routed his armies, sacked and burned Babylon and set himself up as king, ironically becoming the first ''native'' Mesopotamian to rule the state, its previous rulers having all been ''non-Mesopotamian'' [[Amorites]] and [[Kassites]].<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq" /> Kashtiliash himself was taken to [[Ashur]] as a prisoner of war.

An Assyrian governor/king named [[Enlil-nadin-shumi]] was placed on the throne to rule as viceroy to Tukulti-Ninurta I, and [[Kadashman-Harbe II]] and [[Adad-shuma-iddina]] succeeded as Assyrian governor/kings, subject to Tukulti-Ninurta I until 1216 BC.

Babylon did not begin to recover until late in the reign of [[Adad-shuma-usur]] (1216–1189 BC), as he too remained a vassal of Assyria until 1193 BC. However, he was able to prevent the Assyrian king [[Enlil-kudurri-usur]] from retaking Babylonia, which, apart from its northern reaches, had mostly shrugged off Assyrian domination during a short period of civil war in the Assyrian empire, in the years after the death of Tukulti-Ninurta.

[[Meli-Shipak II]] (1188–1172 BC) seems to have had a peaceful reign. Despite not being able to regain northern Babylonia from Assyria, no further territory was lost, Elam did not threaten, and the [[Bronze Age Collapse]] now affecting the [[Levant]], [[Canaan]], [[Egypt]], [[The Caucasus]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Mediterranean]], [[North Africa]] and [[Balkans]] seemed to have little impact on Babylonia (or indeed Assyria).

War resumed under subsequent kings such as [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] (1171–1159 BC) and [[Zababa-shuma-iddin]] (1158 BC). The long reigning Assyrian king [[Ashur-Dan I]] (1179–1133 BC) resumed expansionist policies and conquered further parts of northern Babylonia from both kings, and the [[Elamite]] ruler [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] eventually conquered most of eastern Babylonia. [[Enlil-nadin-ahhe]] (1157–1155 BC) was finally overthrown and the Kassite Dynasty ended after [[Ashur-Dan I]] conquered yet more of northern and central Babylonia, and the equally powerful [[Elamite]] king [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] pushed deep into the heart of Babylonia itself, sacking the city and slaying the king. Poetical works have been found lamenting this disaster.

Despite the loss of territory, military weakness, and evident reduction in literacy and culture, the Kassite dynasty was the longest-lived dynasty of Babylon, lasting until 1155 BC, when Babylon was conquered by Shutruk-Nahhunte of Elam, and reconquered a few years later by the native Akkadian-Babylonian [[Nebuchadrezzar I]], part of the larger [[Bronze Age collapse]].

===Early Iron Age – Native Rule, Second Dynasty of Isin, 1155–1026 BC===
The Elamites did not remain in control of Babylonia long, instead entering into an unsuccessful war with Assyria, allowing [[Marduk-kabit-ahheshu]] (1155–1139 BC) to establish the [[Second Dynasty of Isin]], with the very first native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] speaking south Mesopotamian dynasty to rule Babylonia, with Marduk-kabit-ahheshu becoming only the second native Mesopotamian to sit on the throne of Babylon, after the Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]]. His dynasty was to remain in power for some 125 years. The new king successfully drove out the Elamites and prevented any possible Kassite revival. Later in his reign he went to war with Assyria, and had some initial success, briefly capturing the south Assyrian city of [[Ekallatum]] before ultimately suffering defeat at the hands of the Assyrian king [[Ashur-Dan I]].

[[Itti-Marduk-balatu]] succeeded his father in 1138 BC, and successfully repelled Elamite attacks on Babylonia during his 8-year reign. He too made attempts to attack Assyria, but also met with failure at the hands of the still reigning Ashur-Dan I.

[[Ninurta-nadin-shumi]] took the throne in 1137 BC, and also attempted an invasion of Assyria, his armies seem to have skirted through eastern [[Aramea]] (modern Syria) and then made an attempt to attack the Assyrian city of [[Arbil|Arbela]] (modern [[Erbil]]) from the west. However this bold move met with defeat at the hands of [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] who then forced a treaty in his favour upon the Babylonian king.

[[Nebuchadnezzar I]] (1124–1103 BC) was the most famous ruler of this dynasty. He fought and defeated the Elamites and drove them from Babylonian territory, invading Elam itself, sacking the Elamite capital [[Susa]], and recovering the sacred statue of [[Marduk]] that had been carried off from Babylon during the fall of the Kassites. Shortly afterwards, the king of Elam was assassinated and his kingdom disintegrated into civil war. However, Nebuchadnezzar failed to extend Babylonian territory further, being defeated a number of times by [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] (1133–1115 BC), king of the Middle Assyrian Empire, for control of formerly [[Hittites|Hittite]] controlled territories in [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]). The Hittite Empire of the northern and western Levant and eastern Asia Minor had been largely annexed by the Middle Assyrian Empire, and its heartland finally overrun by invading [[Phrygians]] from [[The Balkans]]. In the later years of his reign, he devoted himself to peaceful building projects and securing Babylonia's borders.

Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded by his two sons, firstly [[Enlil-nadin-apli]] (1103–1100), who lost territory to Assyria. The second of them, [[Marduk-nadin-ahhe]] (1098–1081 BC) also went to war with Assyria. Some initial success in these conflicts gave way to catastrophic defeat at the hands of the powerful Assyrian king [[Tiglath-pileser I]] (1115–1076 BC), who annexed huge swathes of Babylonian territory, thus further expanding the Assyrian Empire. Following this a terrible famine gripped Babylon, inviting attacks from Semitic [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] and [[Sutean]] tribes from the west.

In 1072 BC [[Marduk-shapik-zeri]] signed a peace treaty with [[Ashur-bel-kala]] (1075–1056 BC) of Assyria, however his successor [[Kadašman-Buriaš]] was not so friendly to Assyria, prompting the Assyrian king to invade Babylonia and depose him, placing [[Adad-apla-iddina]] on the throne as his vassal. Assyrian domination continued until c. 1050 BC, with [[Marduk-ahhe-eriba]] and [[Marduk-zer-X]] regarded as vassals of Assyria. After 1050 BC the Middle Assyrian Empire descended into a period of civil war, followed by constant warfare with the [[Arameans]], [[Phrygians]], [[Neo-Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]], allowing Babylonia to once more largely free itself from the Assyrian yoke for a few decades.

However [[East Semitic]] Babylonia soon began to suffer repeated incursions from [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] nomadic peoples migrating from [[The Levant]], and during the 11th century BC large swathes of the Babylonian countryside was appropriated and occupied by these newly arrived [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]]. They were followed in the late 10th or early 9th century BC by the [[Chaldea]]ns, who hailed from the same regions as the Arameans and Suteans. The Chaldeans (not to be confused with modern [[Chaldean Catholics]] who are in fact ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) settled in the far south east of Babylonia, the Arameans much of the countryside in eastern and central Babylonia and the Suteans in the western deserts, with the weak native kings being unable to stem these migrations.

===Period of Chaos 1026–911 BC===
The native dynasty, then ruled by [[Nabu-shum-libur]] was deposed by marauding [[Arameans]] in 1026 BC, and the heart of Babylonia, including the capital city itself descended into anarchic state, and no king was to rule Babylon for over 20 years.

However, in southern Mesopotamia (a region corresponding with the old Dynasty of the Sealand), Dynasty V (1025–1004 BC) arose, this was ruled by [[Simbar-shipak]], leader of a [[Kassite]] clan, and was in effect a separate state from Babylon. The state of anarchy allowed the Assyrian ruler [[Ashur-nirari IV]] (1019-1013 BC) the opportunity to attack Babylonia in 1018 BC, and he invaded and captured the Babylonian city of [[Atlila]] and some northern regions for Assyria.

The south Mesopotamian dynasty was replaced by another Kassite Dynasty (Dynasty VI; 1003–984 BC) which also seems to have regained control over Babylon itself. The [[Elamites]] deposed this brief Kassite revival, with king [[Mar-biti-apla-usur]] founding Dynasty VII (984–977 BC). However, this dynasty too fell, when the Arameans once more ravaged Babylon.

Native rule was restored by [[Nabu-mukin-apli]] in 977 BC, ushering in Dynasty VIII. Dynasty IX begins with [[Ninurta-kudurri-usur II]], who ruled from 941 BC. Babylonia remained weak during this period, with whole areas of Babylonia now under firm [[Aramean]] and [[Suteans|Sutean]] control, and by 850 BC the migrant [[Chaldea]]ns had established their own land in the extreme south east. Babylonian rulers were often forced to bow to pressure from Assyria and Elam, both of which had appropriated Babylonian territory.

===Assyrian rule, 911–619 BC===
From 911 BC with the founding of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC) by [[Adad-nirari II]], Babylon found itself once again under the domination and rule of its fellow Mesopotamian state for the next three centuries. Adad-nirari II twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of Babylonia, annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala River]] and the towns of [[Hīt]] and [[Zanqu]] in mid Mesopotamia. He made further gains over Babylonia under [[Nabu-shuma-ukin I]] later in his reign. [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] also forced Babylonia into vassalage, and [[Shalmaneser III]] (859–824 BC) sacked Babylon itself, slew king [[Nabu-apla-iddina]], subjugated the Aramean, Sutean and Chaldean tribes settled within Babylonia, and installed [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]] (855–819 BC) followed by [[Marduk-balassu-iqbi]] (819–813 BC) as his vassals. It was during the late 850's BC, in the annals of [[Shalmaneser III]], that the [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Arabs]] are first mentioned in the pages of written recorded history.

Upon the death of Shalmaneser II, [[Baba-aha-iddina]] was reduced to vassalage by the Assyrian queen [[Shammuramat]] (known as [[Semiramis]] to the Persians and Greeks), acting as regent to his successor [[Adad-nirari III]] who was merely a boy.  Adad-nirari III eventually killed Baba-aha-iddina and ruled there directly until 800 BC until [[Ninurta-apla-X]] was crowned. However he too was subjugated by Adad-Nirari II. The next Assyrian king, [[Shamshi-Adad V]] then made a vassal of [[Marduk-bel-zeri]].

Babylonia briefly fell to another foreign ruler when [[Marduk-apla-usur]] ascended the throne in 780 BC, taking advantage of a period of civil war in Assyria. He was a member of the [[Chaldea]]n tribe who had a century or so earlier settled in a small region in the far south eastern corner of Mesopotamia, bordering the [[Persian Gulf]] and south western [[Elam]]. [[Shamshi-Adad V]] attacked him and retook northern Babylonia, forcing a border treaty in Assyria's favour upon him. However he was allowed to remain on the throne, and successfully stabilised Babylonia. [[Eriba-Marduk]], another Chaldean, succeeded him in 769 BC and his son, [[Nabu-shuma-ishkun]] in 761 BC. Babylonia appears to have been in a state of chaos during this time, with the north occupied by Assyria, its throne occupied by foreign Chaldeans, and civil unrest prominent throughout the land.

A native Babylonian king named [[Nabonassar]] overthrew the Chaldean usurpers in 748 BC, and successfully stabilised Babylonia, remaining untroubled by [[Ashur-nirari V]] of Assyria. However, with the accession of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745–727 BC) Babylonia came under renewed attack. Babylon was invaded and sacked and Nabonassar reduced to vassalage. His successors [[Nabu-nadin-zeri]], [[Nabu-suma-ukin II]] and [[Nabu-mukin-zeri]] were also in servitude to Tiglath-Pileser III, until in 729 BC the Assyrian king decided to rule Babylon directly as its king instead of allowing Babylonian kings to remain as vassals of Assyria as his predecessors had done for two hundred years.

It was during this period that an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] influenced form of [[Eastern Aramaic]] was introduced by the Assyrians as the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], and Mesopotamian Aramaic began to supplant Akkadian as the spoken language of the general populace of both Assyria and Babylonia.

The Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser V]] was declared king of Babylon in 727 BC, but died whilst besieging [[Samaria]] in 722 BC.

Revolt was then fomented against Assyrian domination by [[Marduk-apla-iddina II|Merodach-Baladan]], a Chaldean malka (chieftain) of the far south east of Mesopotamia, with strong [[Elamite]] support. Merodach-Baladan managed to take the throne of Babylon itself between 721–710 BC whilst the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] (722–705 BC) were otherwise occupied in defeating the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] who had attacked Assyria's [[Persia]]n and [[Median]] vassal colonies in [[Ancient Iran]]. Merodach-Baladan was eventually defeated and ejected by [[Sargon II]] of Assyria, and fled to his protectors in [[Elam]]. [[Sargon II]] was then declared king in Babylon.

[[Sennacherib]] (705–681 BC) succeeded Sargon II, and after ruling directly for a while, he placed his son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] on the throne. However Merodach-Baladan and his Elamite protectors continued to unsuccessfully agitate against Assyrian rule. [[Nergal-ushezib]], an Elamite, murdered the Assyrian prince and briefly took the throne. This led to the infuriated Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] invading and subjugating Elam and sacking Babylon, laying waste to and largely destroying the city. Babylon was regarded as a sacred city by all Mesopotamians, including Assyrians, and this act eventually led Sennacherib to be murdered by his own sons while praying to the god [[Nisroch]] in [[Nineveh]] in 681 BC. A puppet king [[Marduk-zakir-shumi II]] was placed on the throne by the new Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]]. However, Merodach-Baladan returned from exile in Elam, and briefly deposed him, forcing Esarhaddon to attack and defeat him, whereupon he once more fled to his masters in Elam, where he died in exile.

[[Esarhaddon]] (681–669 BC) ruled Babylon personally, he completely rebuilt the city, bringing rejuvenation and peace to the region. Upon his death, and in an effort to maintain harmony within his vast empire (which stretched from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Egypt]] and [[Nubia]] and from [[Cyprus]] to [[Persia]]), he installed his eldest son [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] as a subject king in Babylon, and his youngest, the highly educated [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–627 BC), in the more senior position as king of Assyria and overlord of Shamash-shum-ukin.

Shamash-shum-ukin, after decades peacefully subject to his brother [[Ashurbanipal]], eventually became infused with Babylonian nationalism despite being an Assyrian himself, declaring that the city of Babylon (and not the Assyrian city of [[Nineveh]]) should be the seat of the immense empire. He raised a major revolt against his brother, Ashurbanipal. He led a powerful coalition of peoples also resentful of Assyrian subjugation and rule, including; [[Elam]], the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Medes]], the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Suteans]] of southern [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Arameans]] of the Levant and southwest Mesopotamia, the [[Arabs]] and [[Dilmun]]ites of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the [[Canaanites]]-[[Phoenicians]]. After a bitter struggle Babylon was sacked and its allies vanquished, Shamash-shum-ukim being killed in the process. Elam was destroyed once and for all, and the Babylonians, Persians, Chaldeans, Arabs, Medes, Elamites, Arameans, Suteans and Canaanites were violently subjugated, with Assyrian troops exacting savage revenge on the rebelling peoples. An Assyrian governor named [[Kandalanu]] was placed on the throne to rule on behalf of the Assyrian king.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq"/> Upon Ashurbanipal's death in 627 BC, his son [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] (627–623 BC) became ruler of Babylon and Assyria.

However, Assyria soon descended into a series of brutal internal civil wars which were to cause its downfall. Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed by one of his own generals, named [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] in 623 BC, who also set himself up as king in Babylon. After only one year on the throne amidst continual civil war, [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] (622–612 BC) ousted him as ruler of Assyria and Babylonia in 622 BC. However, he too was beset by constant unremitting civil war in the Assyrian heartland. Babylonia took advantage of this and rebelled under [[Nabopolassar]], a previously unknown ''malka'' (chieftain) of the Chaldeans, who had settled in south eastern Mesopotamia by c. 850 BC.

It was during the reign of Sin-shar-ishkun that Assyria's vast empire began to unravel, and many of its former subject peoples ceased to pay tribute, most significantly for the Assyrians; the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]], [[Arameans]] and [[Cimmerians]].

===Neo-Babylonian Empire (Chaldean Era)===
{{Main|Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldea}}
[[File:Neo-Babylonian Empire.png|thumb|300px|The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]]]
In 620 BC Nabopolassar seized control over much of Babylonia with the support of most of the inhabitants, with only the city of [[Nippur]] and some northern regions showing any loyalty to the Assyrian king.<ref name="Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq" /> Nabopolassar was unable to yet utterly secure Babylonia, and for the next four years he was forced to contend with an occupying Assyrian army encamped in Babylonia trying to unseat him. However, the Assyrian king, Sin-shar-ishkun was plagued by constant revolts among his own people in [[Nineveh]], and was thus prevented from ejecting Nabopolassar.

The stalemate ended in 615 BC, when Nabopolassar entered the Babylonians and Chaldeans into alliance with [[Cyaxares]], an erstwhile vassal of Assyria, and king of the [[Iranian peoples]] who had emerged c. 1000 BC, the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]]. Cyaxares had also taken advantage of the Assyrian destruction of the formerly regionally dominant pre-Iranian Elam and the subsequent anarchy in Assyria to free the [[Iranic]] peoples from three centuries of the Assyrian yoke and regional Elamite domination. The [[Scythians]] from north of the [[Caucasus]], and the [[Cimmerians]] from the [[Black Sea]] who had both also been subjugated by Assyria, joined the alliance, as did regional Aramean tribes.

In 615 BC, while the Assyrian king was fully occupied fighting rebels in both Babylonia and Assyria itself, Cyaxares launched a surprise attack on the Assyrian heartlands, sacking the cities of [[Kalhu]] (the Biblical [[Calah]], [[Nimrud]]) and [[Arrapkha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]), Nabopolassar was still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia and thus not involved in this breakthrough.

From this point on the coalition of Babylonians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Scythians, Cimmerians and Arameans fought in unison against a civil war ravaged Assyria. Major Assyrian cities such as [[Ashur]], [[Arbil|Arbela]] (modern [[Irbil]]), [[Guzana]], [[Dur Sharrukin]] (modern [[Khorsabad]]), [[Imgur-Enlil]], [[Nibarti-Ashur]], [[Kar Ashurnasipal]] and [[Tushhan]] fell to the alliance during 614 BC. Sin-shar-ishkun somehow managed to rally against the odds during 613 BC, and drove back the combined forces ranged against him.

However, the alliance launched a renewed combined attack the following year, and after five years of fierce fighting [[Nineveh]] was sacked in late 612 BC after a bitter prolonged siege, followed by street by street fighting, in which Sin-shar-ishkun was killed defending his capital.

House to house fighting continued in Nineveh, and an Assyrian general and member of the royal household, took the throne as [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612–605 BC). He was offered the chance of accepting a position of vassalage by the leaders of the alliance according to the [[Babylonian Chronicle]]. However he refused and managed to somehow successfully fight his way out of Nineveh and to the northern Assyrian city of [[Harran]] in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] where he founded a new capital. The fighting continued, as the Assyrian king held out against the alliance until 608 BC, when he was eventually ejected by the Medes, Babylonians, Scythians and their allies, and prevented in an attempt to regain the city the same year.

The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] Pharaoh [[Necho II]], whose dynasty had been installed as vassals of Assyria in 671 BC, belatedly tried to aid Egypt's former Assyrian masters, possibly out of fear that Egypt would be next to succumb to the new powers without Assyria to protect them, having already been ravaged by the [[Scythians]]. The Assyrians fought on with Egyptian aid until a final victory was achieved against them at [[Carchemish]] in north western Assyria in 605 BC.

The seat of empire was thus transferred to Babylonia for the first time since [[Hammurabi]] over a thousand years before.

Nabopolassar was followed by his son [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar II]] (605–562 BC), whose reign of 43 years made Babylon once more the mistress of much of the civilized world, taking over a fair portion of the former [[Assyrian Empire]] once ruled by its Assyrian brethren, the eastern and north eastern portion being taken by the Medes and the far north by the [[Scythians]].

Some sections of the Assyrian Army and Administration may have still continued in and around [[Dur-Katlimmu]] in north west Assyria for a time, however by 599 BC Assyrian records from this region fell silent. The fate of Ashur-uballit II remains unknown, and he may have been killed attempting to regain Harran, at Carchemish, or continued to fight on, eventually disappearing into obscurity.

The [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], erstwhile allies of Babylonia under Nabopolassar, now became a threat, and Nebuchadnezzar II was forced to march into [[Asia Minor]] and rout their forces, ending the northern threat to his Empire.

The Egyptians attempted to remain in the Near East, possibly in an effort to aid in restoring Assyria as a secure buffer against Babylonia and the Medes and Persians, or to carve out an empire of their own. Nebuchadnezzar II campaigned against the Egyptians and drove them back over the [[Sinai]]. However an attempt to take Egypt itself as his Assyrian predecessors had succeeded in doing failed, mainly due to a series of rebellions from the [[Israelite]]s of  [[Judah]] and  the former kingdom of [[Israel (northern Kingdom)| Ephraim]], the [[Phoenicians]] of [[Caanan]] and the [[Arameans]] of the [[Levant]]. The Babylonian king crushed these rebellions, deposed [[Jehoiakim]], the king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and deported a sizeable part of the population to Babylonia. Cities like [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]] and [[Damascus]] were also subjugated. The [[Arabs]] and other South Arabian peoples who dwelt in the deserts to the south of the borders of Mesopotamia were then also subjugated.

In 567 BC he went to war with Pharaoh [[Amasis II|Amasis]], and briefly invaded [[Egypt]] itself. After securing his empire, which included marrying a Median princess, he devoted himself to maintaining the empire and conducting numerous impressive building projects in Babylon. He is credited with building the fabled [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Wide Sechool |work=History of Phoenicia&nbsp;— Part IV |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/ancient/HistoryofPhoenicia/chap22.html |accessdate=2007-01-09}}</ref>

[[Amel-Marduk]] succeeded to the throne and reigned for only two years. Little contemporary record of his rule survives, though [[Berossus|Berosus]] later stated that he was deposed and murdered in 560 BC by his successor [[Neriglissar]] for conducting himself in an ''improper manner''.

[[Neriglissar]] (560–556 BC) also had a short reign. He was the son in law of Nebuchadnezzar II, and it is unclear if he was a Chaldean or native Babylonian who married into the dynasty. He campaigned in Aram and Phoenicia, successfully maintaining Babylonian rule in these regions. Neriglissar died young however, and was succeeded by his son [[Labashi-Marduk]] (556 BC), who was still a boy. He was deposed and killed during the same year in a palace conspiracy.

Of the reign of the last Babylonian king, [[Nabonidus]] (''Nabu-na'id'', 556–539 BC) who is the son of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] priestess [[Addagoppe of Harran|Adda-Guppi]] and who managed to kill the last Chaldean king, Labashi-Marduk, and took the reign, there is a fair amount of information available. Nabonidus (hence his son, the regent [[Belshazzar]]) was, at least from the mother's side, neither Chaldean nor Babylonian, but ironically [[Assyria]]n, hailing from its final capital of [[Harran]] (Kharranu). Information regarding Nabonidus is chiefly derived from a chronological tablet containing the annals of Nabonidus, supplemented by another inscription of Nabonidus where he recounts his restoration of the temple of the Moon-god [[Sin]] at Harran; as well as by a proclamation of Cyrus issued shortly after his formal recognition as king of Babylonia.

A number of factors arose which would ultimately lead to the fall of Babylon. The population of Babylonia became restive and increasingly disaffected under Nabonidus. He excited a strong feeling against himself by attempting to centralize the polytheistic religion of Babylonia in the temple of [[Marduk]] at Babylon, and while he had thus alienated the local priesthoods, the military party also despised him on account of his antiquarian tastes. He seemed to have left the defense of his kingdom to [[Belshazzar]] (a capable soldier but poor diplomat who alienated the political elite), occupying himself with the more congenial work of excavating the foundation records of the temples and determining the dates of their builders. He also spent time outside Babylonia, rebuilding temples in the Assyrian city of Harran, and also among his Arab subjects in the deserts to the south of Mesopotamia. Nabonidus and Belshazzar's Assyrian heritage is also likely to have added to this resentment. In addition, Mesopotamian military might had usually been concentrated in the martial state of Assyria. Babylonia had always been more vulnerable to conquest and invasion than its northern neighbour, and without the might of Assyria to keep foreign powers in check and Mesopotamia dominant, Babylonia was ultimately exposed.

It was in the sixth year of Nabonidus (549 BC) that [[Cyrus the Great]], the Achaemenid Persian "king of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]]" in Elam, revolted against his suzerain [[Astyages]], "king of the Manda" or Medes, at [[Ecbatana]]. Astyages' army betrayed him to his enemy, and Cyrus established himself at Ecbatana, thus putting an end to the empire of the Medes and making the Persian faction dominant among the Iranic peoples. Three years later Cyrus had become king of all Persia, and was engaged in a campaign to put down a revolt among the Assyrians. Meanwhile, Nabonidus had established a camp in the desert of his colony of Arabia, near the southern frontier of his kingdom, leaving his son [[Belshazzar]] (''Belsharutsur'') in command of the army.

In 539 BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia. A battle was fought at [[Opis]] in the month of June, where the Babylonians were defeated; and immediately afterwards [[Sippar]] surrendered to the invader. Nabonidus fled to Babylon, where he was pursued by [[Gobryas]], and on the 16th day of [[Tammuz (Babylonian calendar)|Tammuz]], two days after the capture of Sippar, "the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting." Nabonidus was dragged from his hiding place, where the services continued without interruption. Cyrus did not arrive until the 3rd of ''Marchesvan'' (October), Gobryas having acted for him in his absence. Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon, and a few days afterwards Belshazzar the son of Nabonidus died in battle. A public mourning followed, lasting six days, and Cyrus' son [[Cambyses]] accompanied the corpse to the tomb.

One of the first acts of Cyrus accordingly was to allow the Jewish exiles to return to their own homes, carrying with them their sacred temple vessels. The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation, whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian throne.

Cyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of [[Bel-Marduk]], who was assumed to be wrathful at the impiety of Nabonidus in removing the images of the local gods from their ancestral shrines to his capital Babylon.

The Chaldean tribe had lost control of Babylonia decades before the end of the era that sometimes bears their name, and they appear to have blended into the general populace of Babylonia even before this (for example, Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar II and their successors always referred to themselves as ''Shar Akkad'' and never as ''Shar Kaldu'' on inscriptions), and during the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] Chaldeans disappeared as a distinct people, and the term Chaldean ceased to refer to a race of men and instead to a social class of Astronomers and Astrologers only, regardless of ethnicity, before this term also fell from use during the Hellenic period.

===Persian Babylonia===
{{Further|Achaemenid Assyria|Fall of Babylon}}
Babylonia was absorbed into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 539 BC.

A year before Cyrus' death, in 529 BC, he elevated his son [[Cambyses II]] in the government, making him king of Babylon, while he reserved for himself the fuller title of "king of the (other) provinces" of the empire. It was only when [[Darius Hystaspis]] acquired the Persian throne and ruled it as a representative of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]], that the old tradition was broken and the claim of Babylon to confer legitimacy on the rulers of western Asia ceased to be acknowledged.

Immediately after Darius seized Persia, Babylonia briefly recovered its independence under a native ruler, [[Nidinta-Bel]], who took the name of [[Nebuchadnezzar III]], and reigned from October 522 BC to August 520 BC, when Darius took the city by storm, during this period Assyria to the north also rebelled. A few years later, probably 514 BC, Babylon again revolted under the [[Armenians|Armenian]] King [[Arakha]]; on this occasion, after its capture by the Persians, the walls were partly destroyed. [[E-Saggila]], the great temple of [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]], however, still continued to be kept in repair and to be a center of Babylonian religious feelings.

[[Alexander the Great]] conquered Babylon in 333 BC for the [[Greeks]], and died there in 323 BC. Babylonia and Assyria then became part of the Greek [[Seleucid Empire]].
It has long been maintained that the foundation of [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]] diverted the population to the new capital of southern Mesopotamia, and that the ruins of the old city became a quarry for the builders of the new seat of government, but the recent publication of the [[Babylonian Chronicles|Babylonian Chronicles of the Hellenistic Period]] has shown that urban life was still very much the same well into the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian age]] (150 BC to 226 AD). The Parthian king [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates]] conquered the region into the [[Arsacid Empire]] in 150 BC, and the region became something of a battleground between Greeks and Parthians.

There was a brief interlude of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest ([[Roman Assyria]], [[Roman Mesopotamia]]; AD 116 to 118) under [[Trajan]], after which the Parthians reasserted control.

The [[satrapy]] of Babylonia was absorbed into [[Asuristan]] (Assyria) in the [[Sassanid]] period, which began in 226 AD, and by this time [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Syriac Christianity]] (which emerged in Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia the 1st century AD) had become the dominant religion among the native populace, who had never adopted the [[Zoroastrian]] or [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic religions]] of their rulers.

Apart from the small 2nd century BC to 3rd century AD independent [[Neo-Assyrian]] states of [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Assur]], [[Beth Garmai]] and [[Beth Nuhadra]] in the north, Mesopotamia remained under largely Persian control until the Arab [[Islamic conquest of Persian Mesopotamia|Islamic conquest]] in the 7th century AD. After this Asuristan-Assyria was also dissolved as a geopolitical entity, and the native [[Aramaic]] speaking and largely Christian populace of southern and central Mesopotamia gradually underwent an (often forced) process of ''Arabisation'' and ''Islamification'' with southern Mesopotamia seeing a large influx of non-indigenous  [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]], with only the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of the north (known as [[Ashuriyun]] by the Arabs) and [[Mandeans]] of the south retaining their religions and a distinct Mesopotamian identity, culture, history and language, which they still do to this day (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).

==Babylonian culture==
Bronze Age to Early Iron Age Mesopotamian culture is sometimes summarized as "Assyro-Babylonian", because of the close cultural interdependence of the two political centers.  The term "Babylonia", especially in writings from around the early 20th century, was formerly used to include Southern Mesopotamia's earliest history, and not only in reference to the later city-state of Babylon proper. This geographic usage of the name "Babylonia' has generally been replaced by the more accurate term ''Sumer'' in more recent writing.

====Art and architecture====
{{Further|Architecture of Mesopotamia|Art of Mesopotamia}}
In Babylonia, an abundance of [[clay]], and lack of [[Rock (geology)|stone]], led to greater use of [[mudbrick]]; Babylonian temples were massive structures of crude brick, supported by [[buttress]]es, the rain being carried off by drains. One such drain at [[Ur]] was made of [[lead]]. The use of brick led to the early development of the [[pilaster]] and column, and of [[fresco]]es and enameled tiles. The walls were brilliantly coloured, and sometimes plated with [[zinc]] or [[gold]], as well as with [[tiles]]. Painted ''[[terra-cotta]]'' cones for torches were also embedded in the plaster. In Babylonia, in place of the ''[[bas-relief]]'', there was greater use of three-dimensional figures—the earliest examples being the [[Statues of Gudea]], that are realistic if somewhat clumsy. The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious, and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting.

====Astronomy====
{{Main| Babylonian astronomy}}
Tablets dating back to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian period]] document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year. Centuries of Babylonian observations of celestial phenomena are recorded in the series of [[cuneiform]] tablets known as the 'Enūma Anu Enlil'. The oldest significant astronomical text that we possess is Tablet 63 of 'Enūma Anu Enlil', the Venus tablet of [[Ammi-saduqa]], which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years and is the earliest evidence that the phenomena of a planet were recognized as periodic. The oldest rectangular [[astrolabe]] dates back to Babylonia c. 1100 BC. The [[MUL.APIN]], contains catalogues of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting [[heliacal rising]]s and the settings of the planets, lengths of daylight measured by a [[water-clock]], [[gnomon]], shadows, and [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalations]]. The Babylonian GU text arranges stars in 'strings' that lie along declination circles and thus measure right-ascensions or time-intervals, and also employs the stars of the zenith, which are also separated by given right-ascensional differences.<ref name=pingree>{{Citation | last=Pingree | first=David | author-link=David Pingree | year=1998 | contribution=Legacies in Astronomy and Celestial Omens | editor-last=Dalley | editor-first=Stephanie | editor-link= Stephanie Dalley | title=The Legacy of Mesopotamia | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=125–137 | isbn =0-19-814946-8}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last=Rochberg | first=Francesca | year=2004 | title=The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy, and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref><ref name=practice>{{cite book|title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy|first=James|last=Evans|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|pages=296–7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=babylon+greek+astronomy#PPA15,M1

====Medicine====
'''Medical diagnosis and prognosis'''
{{blockquote|We find [medical semiotics] in a whole constellation of disciplines. ... There was a real common ground among these [Babylonian] forms of knowledge ... an approach involving analysis of particular cases, constructed only through traces, symptoms, hints. ... In short, we can speak about a symptomatic or divinatory [or conjectural] paradigm which could be oriented toward past present or future, depending on the form of knowledge called upon. Toward future ... that was the medical science of symptoms, with its double character, diagnostic, explaining past and present, and prognostic, suggesting likely future. ...|sign=Carlo Ginzburg<ref>{{cite book |last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg |year=1984 |chapter=Morelli, Freud, and Sherlock Holmes: Clues and Scientific Method |pages=81–118 |editor1-last=Eco |editor1-first=Umberto |editor1-link=Umberto Eco |editor2-last=Sebeok |editor2-first=Thomas |editor2-link=Thomas Sebeok |title=The Sign of Three: Dupin, Holmes, Peirce |location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=''History Workshop'', Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-35235-4 |lccn=82049207 |oclc=9412985 |ref=harv}} Ginzburg stresses the significance of Babylonian medicine in his discussion of the conjectural paradigm as evidenced by the methods of [[Giovanni Morelli]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]] in the light of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s logic of making good guesses or [[abductive reasoning]]</ref>}}

The oldest ''Babylonian'' (i.e., [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) texts on [[medicine]] date back to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] in the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Ancient Mesopotamia: Portrait of a Dead Civilization |author=Leo Oppenheim |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1977 |page=290}}</ref> although the earliest medical prescriptions appear in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] period.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medicine, Surgery, and Public Health in Ancient Mesopotamia |author=R D. Biggs |journal=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies |volume=19 |number=1 |year=2005 |pages=7–18}}</ref> The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' written by the ''ummânū'', or chief scholar, [[Esagil-kin-apli]] of [[Borsippa]],<ref name=Stol-99/> during the reign of the Babylonian king [[Adad-apla-iddina]] (1069–1046 BC).<ref>Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 55, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 90-72371-63-1.</ref>

Along with contemporary [[ancient Egyptian medicine]], the Babylonians introduced the concepts of [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], [[physical examination]], and [[medical prescription|prescription]]s. In addition, the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' introduced the methods of [[therapy]] and [[aetiology]] and the use of [[empiricism]], [[logic]] and [[rationality]] in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. The text contains a list of medical [[symptom]]s and often detailed empirical [[observation]]s along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a [[patient]] with its diagnosis and prognosis.<ref>H. F. J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', p. 97–98, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 90-04-13666-5.</ref>

The symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as [[bandage]]s, [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]]s and [[pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s. If a patient could not be cured physically, the Babylonian physicians often relied on [[exorcism]] to cleanse the patient from any [[curse]]s. Esagil-kin-apli's ''Diagnostic Handbook'' was based on a logical set of [[axiom]]s and assumptions, including the modern view that through the examination and inspection of the symptoms of a patient, it is possible to determine the patient's [[disease]], its aetiology and future development, and the chances of the patient's recovery.<ref name=Stol-99>H.

Esagil-kin-apli discovered a variety of illnesses and diseases and described their symptoms in his ''Diagnostic Handbook''. These include the symptoms for many varieties of [[epilepsy]] and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis.<ref>Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 5, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 90-72371-63-1.</ref> Later Babylonian medicine resembles early [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek medicine]] in many ways.

====Literature====
{{Main|Assyro-Babylonian literature}}
There were libraries in most towns and temples; an old Sumerian proverb averred that "he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn." Women as well as men learned to read and write,<ref>Tatlow, Elisabeth Meier ''Women, Crime, and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society: The ancient Near East'' Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. (31 March 2005) ISBN 978-0-8264-1628-5 p.75 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONkJ_Rj1SS8C&pg=PA75&dq=women+men+literate+babylonia&as_brr=3#PPA75,M1]</ref> and in Semitic times, this involved knowledge of the extinct [[Sumerian language]], and a complicated and extensive [[syllabary]].

A considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law long continued to be written in the old agglutinative language of Sumer. Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists of them were drawn up.

There are many Babylonian literary works whose titles have come down to us. One of the most famous of these was the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], in twelve books, translated from the original Sumerian by a certain Sin-liqi-unninni, and arranged upon an astronomical principle. Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of [[Gilgamesh]]. The whole story is a composite product, and it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure.

===Neo-Babylonian culture===
The brief resurgence of a "Babylonian" identity in the 7th to 6th centuries BC was accompanied by a number of important cultural developments.

====Astronomy====
{{Main|Babylonian astronomy}}
Among the sciences, [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]] still occupied a conspicuous place in Babylonian society. Astronomy was of old standing in Babylonia. The [[zodiac]] was a Babylonian invention of great antiquity; and [[eclipses]] of the [[sun]] and [[moon]] could be foretold. There are dozens of cuneiform records of original Mesopotamian eclipse observations.<ref>See [[Chronology of Babylonia and Assyria]].</ref>

Babylonian astronomy was the basis for much of what was done in [[Greek astronomy|Greek and Hellenistic astronomy]], in classical [[Indian astronomy]], in [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Syria]]n astronomy, in medieval [[Islamic astronomy]], and in [[Central Asia]]n and [[Western Europe]]an astronomy.<ref name=pingree />
Neo-Babylonian astronomy can thus be considered the direct predecessor of much of ancient Greek mathematics and astronomy, which in turn is the historical predecessor of the European (Western) [[scientific revolution]].<ref name ="Aaboe, Asger">Aaboe, Asger.  "The culture of Babylonia: Babylonian mathematics, astrology, and astronomy."  The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries B.C.  Eds. John Boardman, I. E. S. Edwards, N. G. L. Hammond, E. Sollberger and C. B. F. Walker.  Cambridge University Press,  (1991)</ref>

During the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy. They began studying [[philosophy]] dealing with the ideal nature of the early [[universe]] and began employing an [[Consistency proof|internal logic]] within their predictive planetary systems. This was an important contribution to astronomy and the [[philosophy of science]] and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution.<ref name=Brown>D. Brown (2000), ''Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology'', Styx Publications, ISBN 90-5693-036-2.</ref> This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.

In [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid]] and [[Parthia]]n times, the astronomical reports were of a thoroughly scientific character; how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain. The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the [[History of Astronomy#Mesopotamia|history of astronomy]].

The only Babylonian astronomer known to have supported a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of planetary motion was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (b. 190 BC).<ref>[[Otto E. Neugebauer]] (1945). "The History of Ancient Astronomy Problems and Methods", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' '''4''' (1), pp. 1–38.</ref><ref>[[George Sarton]] (1955). "Chaldaean Astronomy of the Last Three Centuries B. C.", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''75''' (3), pp. 166–173 [169].</ref><ref>William P. D. Wightman (1951, 1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas'', Yale University Press p.38.</ref> Seleucus is known from the writings of [[Plutarch]]. He supported the heliocentric theory where the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotated]] around its own axis which in turn revolved around the [[Sun]]. According to [[Plutarch]], Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system, but it is not known what arguments he used.

====Mathematics====
{{Main|Assyro-Babylonian mathematics}}
Babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited.<ref name ="Aaboe, Asger" /> In respect of time they fall in two distinct groups: one from the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] period (1830–1531 BC), the other mainly [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] from the last three or four centuries BC. In respect of content there is scarcely any difference between the two groups of texts. Thus Babylonian mathematics remained stale in character and content, with very little progress or innovation,  for nearly two millennia.{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}<ref name ="Aaboe, Asger" />

The Babylonian system of mathematics was [[sexagesimal]], or a base 60 [[Babylonian numerals|numeral system]]. From this we derive the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle. The Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons. First, the number 60 has many [[divisor]]s (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30), making calculations easier.  Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much as in our base-ten system: 734 = 7×100 + 3×10 + 4×1). Among the Babylonians' mathematical accomplishments were the determination of the [[square root of two]] correctly to seven places ([http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html YBC 7289 clay tablet]). They also demonstrated knowledge of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] well before Pythagoras, as evidenced by this tablet translated by Dennis Ramsey and dating to c. 1900 BC:
<blockquote>
4 is the length and 5 is the diagonal.
What is the breadth?
Its size is not known.
4 times 4 is 16. And 5 times 5 is 25.
You take 16 from 25 and there remains 9.
What times what shall I take in order to get 9?
3 times 3 is 9. 3 is the breadth.
</blockquote>

The ''ner'' of 600 and the ''sar'' of 3600 were formed from the unit of 60, corresponding with a degree of the [[equator]]. Tablets of squares and cubes, calculated from 1 to 60, have been found at [[Senkera]], and a people acquainted with the sun-dial, the clepsydra, the lever and the pulley, must have had no mean knowledge of mechanics. A [[Lead crystal|crystal]] lens, turned on the [[lathe]], was discovered by [[Austen Henry Layard]] at [[Nimrud]] along with glass vases bearing the name of Sargon; this could explain the excessive minuteness of some of the writing on the [[Assyria]]n tablets, and a lens may also have been used in the observation of the heavens.

The Babylonians might have been familiar with the general rules for measuring the areas. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if π were estimated as 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used π as 3 and 1/8. The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven miles today. This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time. (Eves, Chapter 2) The Babylonians used also space time graphs to calculate the velocity of Jupiter. This is an idea that is considered highly modern, traced to the 14th century England and France and anticipating integral calculus.<ref>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/482.full</ref>

====Philosophy====
{{Further2|[[Babylonian literature#Philosophy|Babylonian literature: Philosophy]]}}
The origins of Babylonian philosophy can be traced back to early Mesopotamian [[wisdom literature]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialog]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. Babylonian [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] developed beyond [[Empiricism|empirical]] observation.<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), pp. 35–47.</ref>

It is possible that Babylonian philosophy had an influence on [[Greek philosophy]], particularly [[Hellenistic philosophy]]. The Babylonian text ''[[Dialogue of Pessimism]]'' contains similarities to the [[agonist]]ic thought of the [[Sophism|sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogs of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]].<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), pp. 35–47 [43].</ref> The [[Milesian school|Milesian]] philosopher [[Thales]] is also known to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.

==Legacy==
Babylonia, and particularly its capital city Babylon, has long held a place in [[Abrahamic religion]]s as a symbol of excess and dissolute power.  Many references are made to Babylon in the [[Bible]], both literally (historical) and allegorically. The mentions in the [[Tanakh]] tend to be historical or prophetic, while [[Babylon (New Testament)|New Testament references]] are more likely figurative, or cryptic references possibly to pagan Rome, or some other archetype.  The legendary [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and the [[Tower of Babel]] are seen as symbols of luxurious and arrogant power respectively.
