'''Guns N' Roses''' is an American [[hard rock]] band from Los Angeles formed in 1985. The classic lineup, as signed to [[Geffen Records]] in 1986, consisted of vocalist [[Axl Rose]], lead guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], rhythm guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]], bassist [[Duff McKagan]], and drummer [[Steven Adler]]. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardists [[Dizzy Reed]] and [[Melissa Reese]], guitarist [[Richard Fortus]] and drummer [[Frank Ferrer]]. The band has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands of all time]].

Guns N' Roses' debut album, ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] a year after its release, on the strength of "[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]", the group's only single to reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US, as well as the eleventh [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling album in the United States]]. The success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album ''[[G N' R Lies]]'' (1988) which reached number two on the ''Billboard'' 200. The [[Double album#Simultaneous releases|twin albums]] ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]'' (1991) debuted at number two and number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The cover album ''[["The Spaghetti Incident?"]]'' (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan.

After more than a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, is the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Classic era members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016.

Guns N' Roses has been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular music was dominated by [[dance music]] and [[glam metal]]. Its late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which the group brought forth a "hedonistic rebelliousness" reminiscent of the early [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], a reputation that had earned the group the nickname "the most dangerous band in the world". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer [[Matt Sorum]], was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012, in its first year of eligibility.

In the U.S., "[[Welcome to the Jungle]]" was issued as the album's first single, with an accompanying music video. Initially, the album and single lingered for almost a year without performing well, but when Geffen founder [[David Geffen]] was asked to lend support to the band, he obliged, personally convincing MTV executives to play "Welcome to the Jungle" during the network's after-hours rotation.<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Tom |date=2001 |title=The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood|location=New York |publisher=Broadway Books |page=430 |isbn= 978-0-7679-0757-6}}</ref> Even though the video was initially only played once at 4 a.m. on a Sunday, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hard rock]] fans took notice and soon began requesting the video and song en masse.<ref name="The Hard Truth"/> The song, written in Seattle, was about Los Angeles.

Guns N' Roses' next album, ''[[G N' R Lies]]'', was released in November 1988. It included the four recordings from the band's 1986 EP ''Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide'', as well as four new acoustic tracks. "[[Patience (Guns N' Roses song)|Patience]]", the only single released from ''G N' R Lies'', peaked at No.&nbsp;4 in the U.S., while the album itself reached No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The album cover, a parody of [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspapers, was modified after initial pressings to remove the headlines "Wife-beating has been around for 10,000 years" and "Ladies, welcome to the dark ages".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/04/20/top-10-controversial-album-covers/slide/gun-n-roses-g-nr-lies/|title=Guns N' Roses, G N' R Lies - Top 10 Controversial Album Covers - TIME.com|work=TIME.com|accessdate=August 19, 2015|date=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

In response to an interviewer's suggestion that replacing Adler with Sorum had turned Guns N' Roses from a rock 'n' roll band into a heavy metal one, Stradlin responded, "Yeah, a big musical difference. The first time I realized what Steve did for the band was when he broke his hand in Michigan. Tried to punch through a wall and busted his hand. So we had [[Fred Coury]] come in from [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] for the Houston show. Fred played technically good and steady, but the songs sounded just awful.

The Use Your Illusion World Tour program included a guitar solo from Slash based on ''[[The Godfather]]'' theme, a piano-driven cover of "It's Alright" by [[Black Sabbath]], and an extended jam on the classic rock-inspired "Move to the City", where the group showcased the ensemble of musicians assembled for the tour.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://gnrsource.com/songinfo/le8793.htm |title=Live Era '87-'93 |publisher=Gnrsource.com |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071204231657/http://gnrsource.com/songinfo/le8793.htm  |archivedate = December 4, 2007| dead-url=yes}}</ref>

Many of the successful performances during the tour were overshadowed, in the press by riots, late starts, and outspoken rants by Rose. While the band's previous drug and alcohol issues were seemingly under control, Rose was often agitated by lax security, sound problems, and unwanted filming or recording of the performances. He also used the time between songs to fire off political statements or retorts against music critics or celebrity rivals.

{{Main|Riverport Riot}}

On July 2, 1991, at the [[Riverport Amphitheater]] in [[Maryland Heights, Missouri]], just outside [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], during a performance of "[[Rocket Queen]]", Rose discovered that a fan was filming the show with a camera. After asking the venue's security to take away the camera, Rose decided to take it himself, jumping into the audience and tackling the fan. He had a heated confrontation with the fan before physically assaulting him. After being pulled out of the audience by members of the crew, Rose said, "Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!", threw his microphone to the ground and stormed off the stage. The angry crowd rioted, injuring dozens. Footage was captured by [[Robert John (photographer)|Robert John]], who was documenting the entire tour. Rose was wanted by the police for inciting the riot, but police were unable to arrest him until almost a year later, as the band went overseas to continue the tour. Charges were filed against Rose, but a judge ruled that he did not directly incite the riot. In his defense, Rose stated that the Guns N' Roses security team had made four separate requests to the venue's security staff to remove the camera, all of which were ignored, and that other members of the band had reported being hit by bottles launched from the audience, while the security staff was refusing to enforce a drinking limit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=75|title=There's A Riot Going On!|publisher=heretodaygonetohell.com|date=September 1991}}</ref> As a result, ''Use Your Illusion's'' liner notes featured a hidden message amidst the ''Thank You'' section: "Fuck You, St. Louis!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2004-06-30/music/a-little-patience/full/ |title=A Little Patience |last1= Harper|first1=Jordan |date=June 30, 2004 |website=riverfronttimes.com |publisher= Voice Media Group |access-date=May 8, 2015}}</ref>

Later in the year, Guns N' Roses went on the [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour]], with American Metal band [[Metallica]], being supported by [[Faith No More]], [[Motörhead]], and [[Body Count]]. During a show in August 1992 at [[Montreal|Montreal's]] [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]], Metallica frontman [[James Hetfield]] suffered second degree burns to his hands and face after malfunctions with a [[pyrotechnics]] blast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/11/news/riot-erupts-at-concert-starring-guns-n-roses.html |title=Riot Erupts at Concert Starring Guns 'n' Roses |author=''New York Times'' staff  |date=August 11, 1992|website=nytimes.com |publisher=Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr. |access-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> Metallica was forced to cancel the second hour of the show, but promised to return to the city for another performance.

The ''Use Your Illusion'' tour ended in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, on July 17, 1993. The tour set attendance records and lasted for 28 months, in which 194 shows were played.

It was also the last time Slash performed with Rose until rejoining the band in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-first-photos-of-axl-rose-and-slash-reunited-in-guns-n-roses-20160402|title=Guns N' Roses: See Video, First Photos of Axl Rose, Slash Reunited|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|date=April 2, 2016|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}</ref>

An [[Hidden Track|unadvertised cover]] of the [[Charles Manson]] song "[[Look at Your Game, Girl]]" was included on the album.<ref name="Manson cover" /> The track was kept secret, and was not included on advance tapes sent out to reviewers.<ref name="Manson cover" /> Band manager Doug Goldstein stated "There is a bonus track on the album, but Axl wants it to speak for itself," and that "It wasn't done for the critics or anybody else.

The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard charts, and sold 190,000 copies its first week.<ref name="baltsun" /> Despite initial success, ''"The Spaghetti Incident?"'' did not match the sales of the ''Illusion'' albums and its release consequently led to increased tension within the band.

===Member departures and sporadic activity (1994–1999)===
Interviews with Guns N' Roses band members suggest that between 1994 and 1996, the band sporadically began to write and record new material, most of which, according to Slash, had been written by Rose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snakepit.org/chat2.txt |title=Slash- October 16, 1996|date=October 16, 1996 |accessdate=November 11, 2010|quote="At this point in time we have only been collaborating together.

Describing why he continued using the Guns N' Roses name, instead of labeling the upcoming album an 'Axl Rose solo album', Rose stated "It is something I lived by before these guys were in it. And there were other people in Guns n' Roses before them, you know. I contemplated letting go of that, but it doesn't feel right in any way. I am not the person who chose to try to kill it and walked away. It's not an Axl Rose album, even if it's what I wanted it to be. Everybody is putting everything they've got into singing and building. Maybe I'm helping steer it to what it should be built like."<ref name="Axlspeaks" /> Also in the interview, Rose attributed the breakup of the old lineup to [[Addiction|drug addiction]]s and 'an effort from inside the band to destroy him', stating "There was an effort to bring me down. It was a king-of-the-mountain thing," and that he "needed to take control to survive".<ref name="Axlspeaks" /> Rose also described the dissolution as "a divorce".<ref name="Axlspeaks" />
