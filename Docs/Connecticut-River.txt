The '''Connecticut River''' is the longest river in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]]. Flowing roughly southward for {{convert|406.12|mi}} through four U.S. states, the Connecticut rises at the U.S. border with [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], and discharges at [[Long Island Sound]]. Its watershed encompasses five U.S. states and one Canadian province – {{convert|11260|sqmi}} – via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers.<ref name="ctriver.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctriver.org/river-resources/about-our-rivers/watershed-facts/|title=CRWC   –  Watershed Facts|publisher=Ctriver.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> Discharging at {{convert|19600|cuft|m3}} per second, the Connecticut produces 70% of Long Island Sound's freshwater.<ref name="ctriver.org"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://environmentalheadlines.com/ct/2009/09/28/event-annual-source-to-sea-cleanup-on-ct-river-courant-com/|title=Event: Source To Sea Cleanup To Benefit 410 Miles of Connecticut River — Courant.com – CT Environmental Headlines|publisher=Environmentalheadlines.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

The [[Connecticut River Valley]] is home to some of the northeastern United States' most productive farmland, as well as a metropolitan region of approximately 2 million people surrounding [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and the state of Connecticut's capital, [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]].<ref name="connecticutriver.us">{{cite web|url=http://connecticutriver.us/site/content/about-river|title=About the River – Connecticut River|publisher=Connecticutriver.us|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word "Connecticut" is a French corruption of the [[Mohegan]] word ''quinetucket'', which means "beside the long, tidal river".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Connecticut/name_origin_CT.html|title=Connecticut State Name Origin|publisher=Statesymbolsusa.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> The word "Connecticut" came into existence during the early 1600s, describing the river, which was also called simply "The Great River".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/30/nyregion/theater-the-industrialization-of-the-great-river-new-england-s-longest.html|title=THEATER; The Industrialization of the Great River, New England's Longest|date=30 August 1998|publisher=Nytimes.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===Pre-1614–1637: Native populations===
Prior to [[Netherlands|Dutch]] exploration beginning in 1614, numerous native tribes lived throughout the fertile Connecticut River valley. Information concerning how these tribes lived and interacted stems mostly from English accounts written during the 1630s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/peq.html|title=Pequot|publisher=Dickshovel.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

====Natives of the Lower Valley====
In the southernmost region of the Connecticut River valley, the [[Pequots]] dominated a territory stretching roughly from the river's mouth (at modern-day [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]) northward to just below the Big Bend (at modern-day [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]]). By employing highly organized, aggressive tactics – alternately warring with, subjugating, and making alliances with less-centralized, predominantly agricultural tribes like the [[Niantic people|Western Niantic]] and [[Tunxis]] – the Pequots fended off invasions by their rivals, the [[Mohegans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm|title=The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut – 1637 The Pequot War|publisher=Colonialwarsdt.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

At the Connecticut's Big Bend (at modern-day Middletown), the [[Mattabesset]] (Tunxis) tribe takes its name from the place where its [[sachem]]s ruled, in a village sandwiched between the territories of the aggressive Pequots to the south and Mohegans to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/matta.html|title=Mattabesic|publisher=Dickshovel.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

====Natives of the Middle Valley====
Due north, where modern-day Hartford and its suburbs sit – on the ancient floodplain of the glacial [[Lake Hitchcock]] – the Mohegans dominated the region, particularly after allying themselves with the English against the Pequots during the [[Pequot War]] of 1637.<ref name="http://www.dickshovel.com/moh.html">{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/moh.html| title=Mohegan| publisher=Dickshovel.com| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> Often portrayed as the "good Indians" in colonial accounts of the Pequot War, the Mohegans' culture bore a striking cultural resemblance to that of the Pequots, as they had 'split off' from the Pequots and become their rivals sometime prior to the Europeans' explorations of the area.<ref name="http://www.dickshovel.com/moh.html"/>

North of the [[Enfield Falls]], on the fertile stretch of hills and meadows surrounding modern-day [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], the peaceful, agricultural [[Pocomtuc]] tribe lived in unfortified villages alongside the Connecticut. En route from coastal [[Boston]] to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on the ancient Bay Path, where the Connecticut meets the western [[Westfield River]] and eastern [[Chicopee River]], sat the Pocomtuc village of Agawam (meaning "landing place" or "place for unloading canoes,") which eventually became Springfield.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://archive.org/stream/indianplacenames00hude/indianplacenames00hude_djvu.txt| title=Full text of "Indian place names of New England"| publisher=Archive.org| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> The Pocomtuc villagers at Agawam helped [[Puritan]] explorers settle this advantageous site, and – as opposed to tribes further north and south along the Connecticut – remained friendly with them for decades, helping them to develop Springfield.<ref name="greattrailsbsa.typepad.com">{{cite web| url=http://greattrailsbsa.typepad.com/pocumtuc/2008/10/we-have-a-new-l.html| title=Pocumtuc Lodge| publisher=Greatrailsbsa.typepad.com| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="dickshovel.com">{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/pocu.html| title=Pocumtuc| publisher=Dickshovel.com| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> The region stretching from Springfield northward to the modern-day [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]] state borders – with its soil enhanced by sedimentary deposits from the ancient Lake Hitchcock – fostered many peaceful, agricultural Pocomtuc and [[Nipmuc]] settlements. Occasionally, these villages endured invasions from more aggressive confederated tribes living in modern-day [[New York]], such as the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Mahican]] and [[Iroquois]] tribes.<ref name="greattrailsbsa.typepad.com"/><ref name="dickshovel.com"/>

====Natives of the Upper Valley====
With a territory stretching roughly from the [[Massachusetts]] border with Vermont and New Hampshire, northward to the rise of the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in New Hampshire, the [[Pennacook]] tribe mediated many early disagreements between colonists and other Native tribes, particularly those that lived closer to the Atlantic coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/penna.html|title=Pennacook|publisher=Dickshovel.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

In the northernmost reaches of the Connecticut River Valley, the Western [[Abenaki]] ([[Sokoki]]) tribe lived in the [[Green Mountains]] region of Vermont, but wintered as far south as the [[Northfield, Massachusetts]] area. They later merged with members of other [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] tribes displaced by the wars and famines that accompanied the European settling of the Connecticut River Valley.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/aben.html| title=Abenaki| publisher=Dickshovel.com| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===1614–1632: Dutch exploration and settlement===
In 1614, [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] explorer [[Adriaen Block]] became the first European explorer to chart the Connecticut River, sailing as far north as [[Enfield Falls Canal|Enfield Rapids]].<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jIKKZck2ywoC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=adrien+block+enfield+rapids&source=bl&ots=xPdozfBBGA&sig=Qjm0HHKWO1NhzejOoFxxpAFQnOI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d9VkUseeKpaw4APo54GoAQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=adrien%20block%20enfield%20rapids&f=false| title=The Connecticut River| publisher=Books.google.com| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> In charting the Connecticut, Bloeck called it the "Fresh River", and claimed it for the Netherlands as the northeastern border of the [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1623, Dutch traders constructed a fortified trading post at the site of modern [[Hartford, Connecticut]], calling it the ''Fort Huys de Hoop'' ("Fort House of Hope") on the plain that became modern Hartford.<ref name="newnetherlandinstitute.org">{{cite web| url=http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope/| title=House of Hope| publisher=Newnetherlandinstitute.org| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===1632–1636: Puritan settlement===
Less than a decade later, four separate Puritan-led groups settled the fertile Connecticut River Valley. In the process, they founded the two large cities that continue to dominate the Connecticut River Valley today – Hartford (est. 1635) and Springfield (est. 1636).

Displeased, for various reasons, with their own settlement along the [[New England]] coast, the first group of pioneers that settled the Connecticut River Valley left the [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1632, and ultimately founded the village of Matianuck (modern [[Windsor, Connecticut]]) – several miles north of the Dutch fort at modern Hartford.

In 1633, a group left the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], seeking a site where they could practice their religion more strictly. With this in mind, they founded [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]], in 1633 – several miles south of the Dutch fort at modern Hartford.
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Oxbow (The Connecticut River near Northampton 1836).jpg|right|thumb|225px|''View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm—The Oxbow'', 1836, by [[Thomas Cole]]]]
In 1635, the charismatic Reverend [[Thomas Hooker]] led settlers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony settlement at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] – where Hooker had feuded with the more conservative Reverend [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]] – to the site in Connecticut of the Dutch "Fort House of Hope", where Hooker founded "Newtowne" (modern Hartford).<ref name="newnetherlandinstitute.org"/> Shortly after Hooker's arrival, Newtowne annexed Matianuck (modern Windsor), based on laws supposedly articulated in Connecticut's settlement charter, the Warwick Patent of 1631. The "patent," however, had been physically lost, and the annexation was almost certainly illegal.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/warwickoverview.htm| title=The "Warwick Patent"| publisher=Cslib.org| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

The fourth English settlement along the Connecticut came out of a 1635 scouting party commissioned by [[William Pynchon]]. Iconoclastic by Massachusetts Bay Colony standards, Pynchon commissioned scouts to find the most advantageous site on the Connecticut River for the dual purposes of conducting commerce and agriculture, hoping to found a city there. His scouts located the Pocumtuc village of Agawam, where the ancient Bay Path trade route crossed the Connecticut at two of its major tributaries – the Chicopee River to the east and Westfield River to the west. Located just north of the Connecticut's first unnavigable waterfall, Enfield Falls, Pynchon correctly surmised that traders utilizing any of these major roads or waterways would have to dock and change ships at his site, thereby granting the settlement a commercial advantage.<ref name="Barrows 1911">{{cite book|last = Barrows|first = Charles Henry|title=The history of Springfield in Massachusetts for the young: being also in some part the history of other towns and cities in the county of Hampden | publisher = The Connecticut Valley Historical Society | year = 1911 | pages=46–48 | id= US 13459.5.7}}</ref> Initially named Agawam Plantation and allied with the southern settlements that would become the state of Connecticut, Pynchon's settlement switched allegiances in 1641 and was renamed Springfield in honor of Pynchon's native town in England.<ref name="Barrows 1911"/>

Of these settlements, Hartford and Springfield quickly emerged as powers. In 1641, Springfield splintered off from the Hartford-based Connecticut Colony, instead allying itself with the Boston-based Massachusetts Bay Colony. For decades, Springfield remained the Massachusetts Bay Colony's westernmost settlement, on the northern border of the Connecticut Colony. By 1654 however, the success of these English settlements rendered the Dutch position on the Connecticut untenable. A treaty relocated the boundary between the Connecticut Colony and New Netherland Colony westward, near present-day [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. The treaty allowed the Dutch to maintain their trading post at Foot Huys de Hoop, which they did until the 1664 British takeover of New Netherland.

===Border disputes===
The Connecticut Valley's central location, fertile soil, and abundant natural resources made it the target of centuries of border disputes. Beginning with Springfield's defection from the Connecticut Colony in 1641, which brought the Massachusetts Bay Colony to the river; to the conflicting royal treaties of 1764, which sparked the river's east-siders to unite with [[Ethan Allen]] and the west-siders against [[New York]] and the British; to the [[1783 Treaty of Paris]], which created a disputed U.S. international border with Canada from the Connecticut's "northernmost headwaters"; to the 1935 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case which settled a contentious boundary dispute between Vermont and New Hampshire – the Connecticut's history is characterized by both political intrigue and technological innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/content/no-border-dispute-here-vt-nh-reaffirm-boundary|title=No border dispute here: Vt., NH reaffirm boundary|work=The Big Story|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

====Springfield allies with the Massachusetts Bay Colony====
During 1640 and 1641, two political controversies took place that altered the political boundaries of the Lower Connecticut River region, preventing it from administration by a single political body.

During the 1630s, the Connecticut Colony administered Springfield, in addition to Hartford, Wethersfield, and Windsor; however, by 1640, Springfield's advantageous geography enabled it to become the Connecticut Colony's most commercially prosperous settlement. During the spring of 1640, the Connecticut Colony endured a crippling grain shortage, which caused many cattle to die of starvation. The grain shortage became a matter of survival for the Connecticut Colony, but due to its prosperity, not for Springfield.<ref name="Barrows 1911" />
[[File:Memorial Bridge, Springfield MA.jpg|225px|thumb|left|The [[Memorial Bridge (Massachusetts)|Memorial Bridge]] across the Connecticut at [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], the river's largest city]]

In response to the shortage, leading citizens of Wethersfield and Hartford gave power to Springfield's founder, Pynchon, to purchase corn for all of the Connecticut Colony's settlements from the Pocumtuc. Colony leaders authorized Pynchon to offer large sums of money – far above market prices – to the natives; however, during negotiations, Pynchon became convinced that the natives refused to sell at even "reasonable" prices, and thus he refused to buy the corn altogether. Explaining his decision, Pynchon opined that it was best not to broadcast the Connecticut Colonists' weaknesses to the natives, whom he believed might capitalize on it; likewise, he aimed to keep market values – and trade with the natives – steady in the future.<ref name="Barrows 1911" />

Furious with Pynchon's seeming willingness to further imperil the starving settlements, leading citizens of Hartford – with Windsor's and Wethersfield's consent – commissioned [[John Mason (c. 1600–1672)|Captain John Mason]], who had fought against Native Americans in the Pequot War, to travel to Springfield with "money in one hand and a sword in the other" to make a deal with the Native Americans, and also to rebuke Pynchon.<ref name="Barrows 1911"/> On reaching Springfield, Mason threatened the natives with war if they did not sell their corn at 'reasonable' prices. The natives capitulated, and ultimately sold the Connecticut Colonists' corn; however, Mason's violent approach roused distrust among the (theretofore friendly) [[Pocumtuc]] natives. Mason also upbraided Pynchon in public.<ref name="Barrows 1911"/> This incident, which arose partly from differences regarding how to treat Native Americans – Pynchon had achieved mutual benefits via capitalism with the Pocumtucs, whereas Mason had used force during the 1637 [[Pequot War]] – nevertheless caused Springfield's settlers to rally around the humiliated Pynchon, and led to the settlement severing ties with the Connecticut Colony.<ref name="Barrows 1911" />

As this controversy was heating up, the relatively distant, coastal Massachusetts Bay Colony saw an opportunity to gain a foothold along the fertile Connecticut. In 1640, Boston asserted a claim to jurisdiction over lands surrounding the Connecticut River; however, Springfield remained politically independent until tensions with the Connecticut Colony were exacerbated by a final confrontation later that year.<ref name="Barrows 1911" />

Since its founding, Hartford kept a fort at the mouth of the Connecticut River – at present-day [[Saybrook Colony|Old Saybrook]] – for protection against the Pequots, [[Wampanoags]], Mohegans, and the New Netherland Colony. After Springfield broke ties with the Connecticut Colony, the remaining Connecticut settlements demanded that Springfield's ships pay tolls when passing the mouth of the Connecticut River. Springfield's ships refused to pay this tax without representation at Connecticut's fort. Hartford, in turn, refused to grant Springfield representation. In response, the Massachusetts Bay Colony solidified its friendship with Springfield by levying a toll on Connecticut Colony ships entering [[Boston Harbor]]. Connecticut, which was then largely dependent on sea trade with Boston, permanently dropped its tax on Springfield. Following this bit of gamesmanship, Springfield allied with Boston, drawing the first state border across the Connecticut.<ref name="Barrows 1911" />

====New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York border disputes====
The [[Fort at Number 4]], which is now [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]], was the northernmost English settlement on the Connecticut River until the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763. Prior to that, Abenaki natives resisted British attempts at colonization; however, following the British victory over the allied French and Indian forces, the British began settling north of modern-day [[Brattleboro, Vermont]].<ref name="flowofhistory.org">{{cite web| url=http://www.flowofhistory.org/es_toolkit/essays/2why.html| title=Why did settlers come to New Hampshire and Vermont, and where did they come from?| publisher=Flowofhistory.org\accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> Settlement of the Upper Connecticut region increased quickly, with population assessments of 36,000 by 1790.<ref name="flowofhistory.org"/>

The area that is now Vermont was claimed by both New Hampshire and [[Province of New York|New York]], and was settled primarily through the [[New Hampshire Grants|issuance of land grants]] by New Hampshire Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] beginning in the 1740s.<ref>Wardner, p. 13.</ref>  New York protested these grants, and in 1764 King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] decided that the border between the provinces should be the western bank of the Connecticut River.<ref>Wardner, p. 41</ref>  The residents of the disputed area, notably Ethan Allen and the [[Green Mountain Boys]], actively resisted attempts by New York to exercise its authority over the area, which resulted first in the establishment of the independent [[Vermont Republic]] in 1777,<ref>Wardner, p. 443</ref> and its eventual accession in 1791 to the United States as the fourteenth state.<ref>Van de Water, Frederic. ''The Reluctant Republic'', New York: John Day, 1941. p. 337</ref> Boundary disputes between Vermont and New Hampshire lasted for nearly 150 years thereafter, finally settling in 1934, when the U.S. Supreme Court re-affirmed King George's boundary as the ordinary low-water mark on the Vermont shore. In some places, the state line is now inundated by the impoundments of dams built after this time.<ref name="crjc.org" />

===The Treaty of Paris and the 19th century===
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]] created a new international border between New Hampshire and what was to become the [[Province of Canada]] at "northwesternmost headwaters of the Connecticut". Several streams fit this description, and thus a boundary dispute led to the short-lived [[Indian Stream Republic]], which existed from 1832 to 1835.

The broad, fertile Connecticut River Valley attracted agricultural settlers and colonial traders to Hartford, Springfield, and the surrounding region; later, during the 19th century, the high volume and numerous falls of the river led to the rise of industry. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the cities of Springfield and Hartford in particular became centers of innovation and "intense and concentrated prosperity."<ref>[http://www.mass.info/springfield.ma/description.htm]  {{wayback|url=http://www.mass.info/springfield.ma/description.htm |date=20081203182336 }}</ref>

In 1829 the Enfield Falls Canal was opened to circumvent shallows by the Connecticut's first major falls, the Enfield Falls. The locks built for this canal gave their name to the town of [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]].<ref>[http://www.our-oxford.info/other-history/W-locks.htm]  {{wayback|url=http://www.our-oxford.info/other-history/W-locks.htm |date=20060926100919 }}</ref> The Connecticut River Valley – in particular, the cities of Springfield and Hartford – functioned as America's hub of technical innovation into the 20th century, and thus attracted numerous railroad lines. The proliferation of the railroads in Springfield and Hartford greatly decreased the economic importance of the Connecticut River. From the late 1800s until today, it has functioned largely as a center of wildlife and recreation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrivertravel.net/culture.htm|title=Culture: Connecticut River Byway|publisher=Ctrivertravel.net|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===Log drives and the early 20th century===
[[File:The Oxbow, Connecticut River c 1910.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[The Oxbow (Connecticut River)|The Oxbow]], Connecticut River, circa 1910]]
Starting about 1865,<ref name=vnj1304/> the river was used for massive [[Log driving|logging drives]] from [[Third Connecticut Lake]] to initially [[water power]]ed [[sawmill]]s near Enfield Falls.

===The flood of 1936===
In March 1936, due to a winter with heavy snowfall, an early spring thaw and torrential rains, the Connecticut River flooded, overflowing its banks, destroying numerous bridges and isolating hundreds of people who had to be rescued by boat.

The dam at [[Vernon, Vermont]], was topped by {{convert|19|ft|m}}. Sandbagging by the National Guard and local volunteers helped prevent the dam's powerhouse from being overwhelmed, despite blocks of ice breaking through the upstream walls.<ref name="wgby">{{cite video | first = Ed | last = Klekowski | first2 = Elizabeth | last2 = ilda  | first3 = Libby | last3 = Klekowski | year = 2003 | title = The Great Flood of 1936: The Connecticut River Story | url = http://www.wgby.org/localprograms/flood/ | medium = DVD | language = | trans_title = | publisher = WGBY | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] | rchiveurl  = | archivedate = | accessdate  = 16 November 2011 | time = 02:10 | id =  | isbn =  | oclc = 58055715 | quote =  | ref = }}</ref>

In [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], looting during the flood became a problem, causing the mayor of the city to deputize citizen patrols to protect flooded areas. Over 3,000 refugees from the area were housed in [[Amherst College]] and the [[Massachusetts State Agricultural College]] (now [[UMass Amherst]]).

Unprecedented accumulated ice jams compounded the problems created by the flood, diverting water into unusual channels and damming the river, raising water levels even further. When the jam at [[Hadley, Massachusetts]], gave way, the water crest overflowed the dam at Holyoke, overwhelming the sandbagging there. The village of [[South Hadley Falls, Massachusetts|South Hadley Falls]] was essentially destroyed, and the southern parts of Holyoke were severely damaged, with 500 refugees.
[[File:1936Flood HartfordCT01.jpg|thumb|left|225px||Downtown [[Hartford, Connecticut]], during the 1936 flood]]
In Springfield, Massachusetts, {{convert|5|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|18|mi|km}} of streets, were flooded, and 20,000 people lost their homes. The city lost power, and nighttime looting caused the police to issue a "shoot on sight" edict; 800 National Guard troops were brought in to help maintain order. Rescue efforts using a flotilla of boats saved people trapped in upper stories of buildings, bringing them to local fraternal lodges, schools, churches and monasteries for lodging, medical care, and food. The [[American Red Cross]] and local, state and Federal agencies, including the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and the [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], contributed aid and manpower to the effort. Flooding of roads isolated the city for a time. When the water receded, it left behind silt-caused mud which in places was {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} thick; the recovery effort in Springfield, at the height of the American [[Great Depression]], took approximately a decade.

Overall, the flood caused 171 deaths and [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000000|1936|r=-8}}}} with inflation{{Inflation-fn|US}}) in damages. Across the northeast, over 430,000 people were made homeless or destitute by flooding that year.<ref>Klelowski, Ed. ''The Great Flood of 1936: The Connecticut River Valley Story'' [[WGBY]] (2003)</ref>

The Connecticut River Flood Control [[interstate compact|Compact]] between the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont was established in 1953 to help prevent serious flooding.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crvfcc.org/documents/compact.pdf| format=PDF| title=Connecticut River Flood Control Compact|date=1955|publisher=Crvfcc.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===1936–present: Water supply===
The creation of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] in the 1930s diverted the [[Quabbin Valley|Swift River]], which feeds the Chicopee River, a tributary of the Connecticut. This resulted in an unsuccessful lawsuit by the state of Connecticut against the diversion of its riparian waters.<ref>U.S. Supreme Court, Connecticut v. Massachusetts, {{Ussc|282|660|1931}}</ref>

Demand for drinking water in eastern Massachusetts passed the sustainable supply from the existing system in 1969. Diverting water from the Connecticut River was considered several times,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ctriver.org/about_us/history/index.html|title=History, Connecticut River Watershed Council| publisher=Ctriver.org| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> but in 1986 the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] instead undertook a campaign of water conservation. Demand was reduced to sustainable levels by 1989, reaching approximately a 25% margin of safety by 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mwra.state.ma.us/monthly/wsupdat/demand-1985-2010-640.jpg| title=MWRA Water System Demand, 1989–2009|publisher=Mwra.state.ma.us| accessdate=2011-08-28}}</ref>

By far the largest river ecosystem in New England, the Connecticut River watershed spans five of the six New England states – New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, [[Connecticut]], as well as small portions of [[Maine]] and the Canadian province of Quebec.<ref name="ctriver.org"/><ref name="crjc.org"/><ref name="des.nh.gov"/>

===The Upper Connecticut River: New Hampshire and Vermont===
[[image:ConnLakes.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=the Connecticut Lakes|The [[Connecticut Lakes]], the source of the Connecticut River, near the border of New Hampshire and Quebec]]

The Connecticut River rises from the [[Fourth Connecticut Lake]], a small pond that sits {{convert|300|yd}} south of the U.S. national border with [[Chartierville, Quebec]], Canada, in the town of Pittsburg, New Hampshire, United States. Beginning at an elevation of {{convert|2670|ft}} above sea level, the Connecticut River flows through the remaining [[Connecticut Lakes]] and [[Lake Francis (Murphy Dam)|Lake Francis]] – for {{convert|14|mi|adj=on}}, all within the town of Pittsburg – and then widens as it delineates {{convert|255|mi|adj=on}} of the border between New Hampshire and Vermont.<ref name="des.nh.gov">{{cite web|url=http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/rivers/conn_river.htm|title=Connecticut River – Designated Rivers River Nominations – Rivers Management and Protection Program – NH Department of Environmental Services|publisher=Des.nh.gov|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> The Connecticut drops more than {{convert|2480|ft}} in elevation as it winds south to the border of Massachusetts, at which point it sits {{convert|190|ft}} above sea level.<ref name="crjc.org">{{cite web|url=http://crjc.org/facts.htm|title=Fast Facts about the Connecticut River|publisher=Crjc.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="nashuatelegraph.com">{{cite web| url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/newsstatenewengland/960331-227/state-officials-to-perambulate-the-border-between.html| title=State officials to perambulate the border between N.H. and Vermont (symbolically, that is)| work=Nashua Telegraph| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

The region along the river upstream and downstream from [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]] and [[White River Junction, Vermont]], is known locally as the "Upper Valley". The exact definition of the region varies, but it generally is considered to extend south to [[Windsor, Vermont]], and [[Cornish, New Hampshire]], and north to [[Bradford, Vermont]], and [[Piermont, New Hampshire]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://uppervalleychamber.com/| publisher=Upper Valley Chamber of Commerce| title=Upper Valley Bi-State Regional Chamber of Commerce| accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref>

===The Middle Connecticut River: Massachusetts through central Connecticut===
Following the most recent [[ice age]], the Middle Connecticut River Valley sat at the bottom of Lake Hitchcock. Its lush greenery and rich, almost rockless soil comes from the ancient lake's sedimentary deposits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthview.pair.com/ctriver.html|title=Earth View LLC|publisher=Earthview.pair.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> In the Middle Connecticut region, the river reaches its maximum depth – {{convert|130|ft}} – at [[Gill, Massachusetts]], around the [[French King Bridge]], and its maximum width – {{convert|2100|ft}} – at [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts|Longmeadow]], directly across from the [[Six Flags New England]] amusement park.<ref name="crjc.org"/><ref name=abyss>{{cite web| last=Klekowski| first=Ed| title=Abyssal Depths| url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/abyss.html| accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref> The Connecticut's largest falls – South Hadley Falls – features a vertical drop of {{convert|58|ft}}.<ref name="ctriver.org"/> Lush green forests and agricultural hamlets dot this middle portion of the Connecticut River; however, the region is best known for its numerous [[college town]]s, such as Northampton, [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], and [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], as well as the river's most populous city, Springfield. The city sits atop bluffs beside the Connecticut's confluence with two major tributaries, the Chicopee River to the east and Westfield River to the west.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_6th/lesson3/bkgdessay.html| author=Susan McGowan| title=The Landscape in the Colonial Period| publisher=Americancenturies.mass.edu| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

The Connecticut River is influenced by the tides as far north as Enfield Rapids in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, approximately {{convert|58|mi}} north of the river's mouth. Two million residents live in the densely populated Hartford-Springfield region, which stretches roughly between the college towns of Amherst, Massachusetts, and Middletown, Connecticut. Hartford, the Connecticut River's second largest city and only state capital, is located at the southern end of this region on an ancient floodplain that stretches to Middletown.

===The Lower Connecticut River: Southern Connecticut through Long Island Sound===
{{convert|15|mi|0}} south of Hartford, at Middletown, the Lower Connecticut River section begins with a narrowing of the river, and then a sharp turn southeast. Throughout southern Connecticut, the Connecticut passes through a thinly populated, hilly, wooded region before again widening and discharging into [[Long Island Sound]] between Old Saybrook and [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]]. Due to the presence of large, shifting sandbars at its mouth, the Connecticut is the only major river in the Northeastern United States without a port at its mouth.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oldsaybrookct.org/Pages/OldSaybrookCT_CC/NHT_PDFs/StopNo2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Type 6 Conservation Site – Connecticut River Estuary |publisher=Oldsaybrookct.org| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

====Mouth and tidelands====
The Connecticut River carries a heavy amount of [[silt]], especially during the spring snow melt, from as far north as Quebec. This heavy silt concentration manifests in a large [[sandbar]] near the Connecticut's mouth, which has, historically, provided a formidable obstacle to navigation. Due to the difficulty it presents to ships, the Connecticut is one of the few major rivers in the United States without a major city at its mouth. The Connecticut's major cities – Hartford and Springfield – lie {{convert|45|and|69|mi|-1}} upriver, respectively.

[[The Nature Conservancy]] named the Connecticut River's tidelands one of the Western Hemisphere's "40 Last Great Places", while the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]] listed its [[estuary]] and tidal [[wetlands]] complex as one of 1,759 wetlands of international importance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.yankeemagazine.com/article/features/connecticutriver| title=Connecticut River Tidelands| work=''Yankee'' Magazine| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

In 1997, the Connecticut River was designated one of only 14 [[American Heritage Rivers]], which recognized its "distinctive natural, economic, agricultural, scenic, historic, cultural and recreational qualities." In May 2012, the Connecticut River was designated America's first National [[Blueway]], in recognition of the restoration and preservation efforts on the river.<ref name="connecticutriver.us"/>
[[Image:Sediment Spews from Connecticut River.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of the Connecticut River depositing silt into [[Long Island Sound]]]]

===Dams===
The Connecticut River's flow is slowed by main stem dams, which create a series of slow-flowing basins from Lake Francis Dam in Pittsburg, New Hampshire, to the Holyoke Dam at [[South Hadley]] Falls in Massachusetts.<ref name="ctriver.org"/> Among the most extensively dammed rivers in the United States, the Connecticut may soon flow at a more natural pace, according to scientists at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who have devised a computer that – "in an effort to balance human and natural needs" – coordinates the holding and releasing of water between the river's 54 largest dams.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://scopeweb.mit.edu/articles/connecticut-river-may-soon-flow-freely-again/| title=Scopeweb| publisher=Scopeweb.mit.edu| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===Tributaries===
The Connecticut River watershed encompasses {{convert|11260|sqmi}}, connecting 148 tributaries, including 38 major rivers and numerous lakes and ponds.<ref name="connecticutriver.us"/> Major tributaries include (from north to south) the [[Passumpsic River|Passumpsic]], [[Ammonoosuc River|Ammonoosuc]], [[White River (Vermont)|White]], [[Black River (Connecticut River)|Black]], [[West River (Vermont)|West]], [[Ashuelot River|Ashuelot]], [[Millers River|Millers]], [[Deerfield River|Deerfield]], [[Chicopee River|Chicopee]], [[Westfield River|Westfield]], and [[Farmington River|Farmington]] rivers. The [[Swift River (Ware River)|Swift River]], a tributary of the Chicopee, has been dammed and largely replaced by the Quabbin Reservoir which [[water supply network|provides water]] to the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] district in eastern Massachusetts, including Boston and its [[Boston metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].

==Natural history==
There are a number of wildlife species, including [[peregrine falcon]], [[osprey]], [[American black bear|bear]], [[bobcat]], [[wild turkey]], [[bald eagle]], [[moose]], and numerous endangered species, e.g. the [[shortnose sturgeon]], the [[piping plover]], the puritan [[tiger beetle]], [[dwarf wedgemussel]], [[small whorled pogonia]], Jesup's [[milk-vetch]] and [[Northeastern bulrush]].<ref name="ctriver.org"/><ref name="ctriver.org"/><ref name="crjc.org"/><ref name="outdoors.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.outdoors.org/publications/outdoors/2013/features/paddling-the-connecticut-river.cfm|title=Ribbon of Blue|publisher=Outdoors.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===Fish===
[[Image:BillDoingGuideWork.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Drift boat fishing guide working the river near [[Colebrook, New Hampshire]]]]
There are several species of [[anadromous]] and catadromous fish, including [[brook trout]], [[winter flounder]], [[blueback herring]], [[alewife]], [[rainbow trout]], large [[brown trout]], [[American shad]] (''Alosa sapidissima''), [[hickory shad]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[Atlantic sturgeon]], [[striped bass]] (''Morone saxatilis''), [[carp]], [[catfish]], [[American eel]], [[sea lamprey]], and endangered shortnose sturgeon and dwarf wedgemussels.<ref name="fws.gov">{{cite web| url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/fisheries/resource/habitat.html| title=Fisheries Program - Northeast Region – U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service| author=Northeast Region Web Development Group| publisher=Fws.gov| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> Additionally, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] has repopulated the river with another species of migratory fish, the [[Atlantic salmon]], which for more than 200 years had been [[extinct]] from the river due to [[dam]]ming.<ref name="fws.gov"/> Several [[fish ladder]]s and fish elevators have been built to allow fish to resume their natural migration upriver each spring.

Much of the beginning of the river's course in the town of Pittsburg is occupied by the Connecticut Lakes, which contain [[lake trout]] and [[landlocked salmon]]. Landlocked salmon make their way into the river during spring spawning runs of [[bait fish]] and during their fall spawn. The river has fly-fishing-only regulations on {{convert|5|mi|0}} of river. Most of the river from Lake Francis south is open to lure and bait as well. Two tail-water dams provide cold river water for miles downstream, making for bountiful summer fishing on the Connecticut.

After the first major dam was built near [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]], thirteen additional dams have ended the Connecticut River's great anadromous fish runs. Fish ladders constructed since the first fish passage in 1980 at Turners Falls, have enabled migrating fish to return to some of their former spawning grounds. In addition to dams, warm water discharges between 1978 and 1992 from [[Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]] in Vernon,Vermont released water up to {{convert|105|F|C}} degrees and the thermal plume reached {{convert|55|mi|km}} downstream to Holyoke. This thermal pollution appears to be associated with an 80% decline in American shad fish numbers from 1992 to 2005 at Holyoke dam. This decline may have been exacerbated by over-fishing in the mid-Atlantic and predation from resurging striped bass populations. The nuclear plant was closed at the end of 2014 but the 2015 shad run at Vernon numbered only 42,000 shad.<ref name=Caduto/>

There are 12 species of [[Freshwater bivalve|freshwater mussels]].<ref name="biodrawversity.com">{{cite web| url=http://www.biodrawversity.com/pubs/Front_Matter.pdf| title=Nedeau, E.J. 2008. Freshwater Mussels and the Connecticut River Watershed. Connecticut River Watershed Council, Greenfield, MA.| accessdate=2012-02-06}}</ref> Of those, 11 occur in the mainstem of the Connecticut, all but the [[brook floater]], which is found only in small streams and rivers. Species diversity is higher in the southern part of the watershed (Connecticut and Massachusetts) than in the northern part (Vermont and New Hampshire), largely due to differences in stream gradient and substrate. Eight of the 12 species in the watershed are listed as endangered, threatened, or of Special Concern in one or more of the states in the watershed.<ref name="biodrawversity.com"/>

==Economy==
<!---
A countless number of rivers have been used as means to transport people, goods, etc., and are still used so today. All such information should be described here. Stylistically, this can be a good segue from history, connecting past uses of the river to present-day uses.

===Boating===
The mouth of the river up to [[Essex, Connecticut|Essex]] is thought to be one of the busiest stretches of waterway in Connecticut. Some local police departments and the state Environmental Conservation Police patrol the area a few times a week. Some towns keep boats available if needed.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kaplan, Thomas|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/nyregion/30saybrook.html?ref=nyregion&pagewanted=print|title=River Watchers, Tackling Speeders and Thin Budgets.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 30, 2007|accessdate=August 30, 2007}}</ref> In Massachusetts, the most active stretch of the Connecticut River is centered on [[The Oxbow (Connecticut River)|the Oxbow]], {{convert|14|mi}} north of Springfield in the college town of Northampton.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oxbow-marina.com/| title=Oxbow-Marina| publisher=Oxbow-marina.com| accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===Pollution and cleanup===
[[Image:Connecticut River restoration Farilee VT1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Stream restoration|Riverbank restoration]] project in [[Fairlee, Vermont]]]]
The [[Water Quality Act]] of 1965 had a major impact on controlling [[water pollution]] in the Connecticut River and its tributaries.

Since then, the river has<!--really need to link or describe what classes d and b are.

===Crossings===
{{Main|List of crossings of the Connecticut River}}
The Connecticut River is a barrier to travel between western and eastern New England. Several major transportation corridors cross the river including [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] ([[Connecticut Turnpike]]), [[Interstate 90]] ([[Massachusetts Turnpike]]), [[Interstate 89]], [[Interstate 93]], and [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]]. In addition, [[Interstate 91]], whose route largely follows the river north-south, crosses it twice – once in Connecticut and once in Massachusetts.
