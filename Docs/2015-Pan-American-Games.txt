[[File:Skyline of Toronto viewed from Harbour.jpg|thumb|left|Toronto was selected by the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] as the official bid city from Canada for the 2015 Pan American Games]]
The [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] chose Toronto and the surrounding region as the Canadian candidate. No other Canadian city was given a chance to bid in a domestic race, and thus Toronto was selected without a vote.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gerein |first=Keith |date=August 15, 2008 |title=Pursuit of 2015 Universiade may be futile |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/cityplus/story.html?id=3f4bc4fc-009e-4743-9e77-6d46918106ef |newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]] |location=[[Edmonton]], Canada|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] |accessdate=August 31, 2014 }}</ref> Toronto's interest in bidding came after failing to land the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], which were held in [[Atlanta]] and [[Beijing]] respectively.

On February 23, 2009, [[Toronto City Council]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario City Council|Hamilton City Council]] approved the bid and confirmed their intentions to support the successful hosting of the event.<ref>{{cite press release |date=February 23, 2009 |title=Pan Am Games bid gets critical endorsement |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/514141/pan-am-games-bid-gets-critical-endorsement |agency=[[CNW Group]]|accessdate=August 31, 2014 }}</ref> The official bid book document was submitted to the [[Pan American Sports Organization]] (PASO) on May 27, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiancyclist.com/dailynews.php?id=16663 |title=Toronto Submits 2015 Pan American Games Bid Book  |date=May 27, 2009 |website=Canadian Cyclist|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}</ref>

PASO made an evaluation visit to Toronto between August 30 and 31, 2009. The team analysed the candidate city features and provided its feedback back to voting members of PASO. The evaluation committee was headed by [[Julio Maglione]], a member of the IOC representing [[Uruguay]] and the head of [[FINA|Fédération Internationale de Natation]] (FINA), the international swimming federation. After the visit Maglione said, "Toronto has all the conditions to play host to the Pan American Games."<ref>{{cite news |date=September 1, 2009 |title=Pan Am Bid Evaluation Head Enthusiastic About Toronto Venues And Bid Legacy |url=http://www.barbadosgazette.com/pan-am-bid-evaluation-head-enthusiastic-about-toronto-venues-and-bid-legacy/|newspaper=Barbados Gazette |accessdate=August 31, 2014 }}</ref>

Toronto won the bidding process to host the Pan and Parapan American Games by a vote of the [[Pan American Sports Organization]] on November 6, 2009, at the PASO Session held in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico. The result was announced by PASO President [[Mario Vázquez Raña]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/panamgames/article/722389--toronto-wins-2015-pan-am-games?bn=1 | title=Toronto wins 2015 Pan Am Games |work=[[Toronto Star]]| date=September 9, 2009 | accessdate=April 7, 2011}}</ref> Toronto faced two other finalists shortlisted [[Lima]], [[Peru]], and [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].

===Logo===
[[File:Toronto bid logo for the 2015 Pan American Games.svg|100px|right|thumb|The original bid logo for the games]]

Toronto's bid logo was launched on October 2, 2008, with the then-Toronto mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] and then-head of the organizing committee [[David Peterson]] unveiling the logo to the public. The bid logo looks like an abstract maple leaf with three sections, each section made up of two strokes in the shape of a "v" with a spot in the centre. The colours are green, red and blue. This was the official logo of the games until 2010, when the new logo was launched.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/commonwealth_games_bids/1216133774.html|title=Toronto 2015 Pan American Games Bid Officially Launched |date=October 2, 2008|publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate= April 29, 2011}}</ref>

==Concerns and controversies==

===Scheduling===
The [[Aquatic sports|aquatics]] events at the 2015 Pan American Games were scheduled to be held roughly around the same time as the [[2015 World Aquatics Championships]] scheduled in [[Kazan]], Russia. In order to maintain the quality of its fields, the schedule of the five aquatics disciplines had to be changed to accommodate athletes. The synchronized swimming competition was moved to the day before the [[2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony|opening ceremony]], diving events began on the day of the opening ceremony (when events are traditionally not held on the day of the ceremony), open water swimming was moved to the first weekend of the games, swimming was reduced to a five-day schedule (down from seven in [[Swimming at the 2011 Pan American Games|2011]]), and water polo competitions began three days before the opening ceremony. All events were scheduled to be completed by July 24, six days before the opening ceremonies of the World Championships, which in itself was moved back a week to accommodate the games. The change in schedule meant that for the first time, events were held before the opening ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uana-aquatics.org/uana/UserFiles/File/Swimming/documents2013/PAGUpdate62813Hogan2.pdf |title=Dear President Coaracy & UANA Executive Committee Members |last1=Hogan |first1=Bill|date=2013 |publisher=[[Swimming Union of the Americas]] (UANA) |accessdate=November 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://swimswam.com/fina-moves-dates-2015-world-aquatics-championships-accommodate-pan-games/ |title=FINA Moves Dates of 2015 World Aquatics Championships to Accommodate Pan Am Games |last1=Keith |first1=Braden |date=October 10, 2013 |publisher=Swim Swam |access-date=February 16, 2015}}</ref>

The [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] concluded on the Sunday prior to the opening ceremony; due to the proximity of the events, teams who competed in both the Women's World Cup and the Pan-Am women's football tournament were not expected to field their best players due to availability.<ref>{{cite news |last=Davidson |first=Neil |date=February 13, 2015  |title=Canada won't field best players at Pan Am games due to conflicting events |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1829746/canada-wont-field-best-players-at-pan-am-games-due-to-conflicting-events/ |newspaper=[[The Canadian Press]] |access-date=February 21, 2015 }}</ref> Toronto and Hamilton had decided not to bid to host matches during the Women's World Cup due to a potential conflict with the Games.<ref>{{cite news |last=Masters |first=Mark |date=March 3, 2011 |title=Toronto won't host any World Cup games |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/03/03/toronto-wont-host-any-world-cup-games/ |newspaper=[[National Post]] |location=Toronto, Canada |access-date=February 21, 2015 }}</ref>

The [[2015 World Archery Championships]] were scheduled later in July, to not conflict with the games, while the [[2015 World Fencing Championships]] (which finished one day prior to the start of fencing competitions at the Pan-Am Games) were coordinated to allow athletes to compete at both events. Finally the second round of the [[2015 Davis Cup]] was moved ahead one week to not conflict with the tennis competitions. Tennis competitions were held before the opening ceremony, to allow athletes to compete in both events.<ref name="female"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uana-aquatics.org/NewsShow.jsp?&id=390894&team=uana |title=TO2015 Games Insider|date=March 6, 2015 |publisher=[[Toronto Organizing Committee for the 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games|TO2015]] |access-date=March 6, 2015}}</ref>

The volleyball tournaments and the [[2015 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix]] and the [[2015 FIVB Volleyball World League|FIVB Volleyball World League]] were played at roughly the same time, leading to scheduling conflicts for teams playing both events.<ref name="female"/>

The [[IndyCar Series]]' [[Honda Indy Toronto]] race, which is held on a street circuit at Exhibition Place, was moved to June from July to avoid conflicting with the Games.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 30, 2014|title=Honda Indy Toronto will take to the street in June instead of July |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/news/trans-canada-highway/toronto-indy-will-take-to-the-street-in-june-instead-of-july/article21382778/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=Toronto, Canada |access-date=February 21, 2015 }}</ref>

===Expenses claims===
In September 2013, it was reported that many senior members of the [[Toronto Organizing Committee for the 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games|organizing committee]], including then CEO [[Ian Troop]], expensed Ontario taxpayers for things such as a cup of tea. This led to outrage among provincial politicians including [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario Premier]] [[Kathleen Wynne]], "I'm just going to say it's ridiculous. It is the kind of entitlement that is unacceptable".<ref>{{cite news |date=September 30, 2013|title=Expense claims from Pan Am Games execs under fire |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/expense-claims-from-pan-am-games-execs-under-fire-1.1874042 |newspaper=[[The Canadian Press]]|access-date=February 17, 2015 }}</ref> In response to the backlash the organization released an updated expenses and travel policy in November 2013.<ref>{{cite news |date=November 21, 2014 |title=Strong Awareness Driving Corporate Interest in Partnering with TORONTO 2015 Pan Am/Parapan Am Games |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1265455/strong-awareness-driving-corporate-interest-in-partnering-with-toronto-2015-pan-am-parapan-am-games |newspaper=[[CNW Group]]|access-date=February 17, 2015 }}</ref> In December 2013 the CEO [[Ian Troop]] was ousted by the organization's board of directors, just three months after the expense scandal came into light.<ref name="exp">{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=Adrian |date=December 13, 2013|title=Pan Am Games board ousts CEO, names replacement |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ian-troop-out-as-head-of-pan-am-games-committee/article15954691/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |location=Toronto, Canada |access-date=February 17, 2015}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Saad Rafi]].<ref name="exp"/> In 2014 more expenses by the organization came under scrutiny including boxes of South American Wine.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brennan |first=Richard |date=December 12, 2014 |title=Pan Am Games expense claims include wine tour, Smarties, Argo tickets |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/panamgames/2014/12/12/pan_am_games_expense_claims_include_wine_tour_flowers.html |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|location=Toronto, Canada |access-date=February 17, 2015 }}</ref>

In 2015 Ian Troop, the former CEO, gave an interview in which he stated that organizers cleared him from any wrongdoing, and that all expenses fell under the organization's policy. Troop also mentioned under his leadership the organization saved {{CAD|50|link=yes}} million from the capital infrastructure budget. Troop's firing had nothing to do with the expenses scandal that arose in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=Adrian |date=February 22, 2015 |title=Former Pan Am Games CEO defends his spending |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/former-pan-am-games-ceo-defends-his-spending/article23147883/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |location=Toronto, Canada|access-date=February 22, 2015 }}</ref>

===Executive compensation and bonuses===
The games' organizing committee came under scrutiny for the high compensation and bonus packages its executive team has been awarded.<ref>{{cite news |last=Casey|first=Liam|date=April 5, 2012|title=High salaries for 2015 Pan Am Games staff face scrutiny |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/04/05/high_salaries_for_2015_pan_am_games_staff_face_scrutiny.html |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |location=Toronto, Canada |access-date=March 24, 2015 }}</ref> Under Ontario's Salary Disclosure rules, any provincial employee receiving over {{CAD|100,000|link=yes}} in compensation will have their salary publicly disclosed.

Additionally, in 2013 it was revealed that as part of his compensation package, Troop would be eligible for a {{CAD|780,000|link=yes}} bonus at the end of his contract, if the games had finished successfully.

Toronto's ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'' described a lack of excitement for the games by Toronto residents and "lacklustre" ticket sales,<ref>{{cite web | last = Sachgau | first = Oliver | title = Pan Am Games Start Today: Here’s What You Should Know | publisher = The Globe and Mail | date = July 10, 2015 | url = http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/pan-am-games-start-today-heres-what-you-should-know/article25412594/}}</ref> while ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Toronto residents as "indifferent" and "apathetic" to the games due to excessive costs and "apocalyptic news coverage" of traffic disruptions, adding "Canada is a country where winter sports predominate, and the Pan Am Games have never been of immense interest".<ref name="Austen"/><ref name="Flack">{{cite web | last = Flack | first = Derek | title = New York Times Skewers Toronto Over Pan Am Apathy | publisher = BlogTO | date = July 10, 2015 | url = http://www.blogto.com/sports_play/2015/07/new_york_times_skewers_toronto_over_pan_am_apathy/}}</ref>  One Toronto journalist wrote "in Toronto's fierce desire to be a world class city, the Pan Am Games are viewed as a consolation prize to previous unsuccessful Olympic bids".<ref name="Flack"/>

Signs of a more positive reception to the Games began to emerge following its opening; on the first official day of competition, 20,000 tickets were sold (in comparison to a single-day projection of eight to nine thousand), and by the next day, at least 850,000 of the 1.2 million total tickets had been sold.<ref name=np-ticketsalesincrease>{{cite news|title=Pan Am Games sees bump in ticket sales on first full day of competition, organizers say|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/pan-am-games-sees-bump-in-ticket-sales-on-first-full-day-of-competition-organizers-say|accessdate=July 14, 2015|work=National Post|date=July 13, 2015}}</ref> By the end of the games, approximately 1.05 million out of 1.2 million available tickets were sold.<ref name=NP-TicketSales>{{cite news|last1=Warnica|first1=Richard|title=Potential Toronto Olympic bid drowns out Pan Am games on closing day|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/toronto/its-time-to-make-it-crystal-clear-olympic-chatter-on-toronto-candidacy-drowns-out-pan-am-games-on-closing-day|accessdate=July 27, 2015|work=National Post|publisher=National Post|date=July 26, 2015|ref=PanAm Ticket Sales}}</ref>

A large, illuminated "Toronto" sculpture sign installed in [[Nathan Phillips Square]] for the Games proved to be popular with locals and tourists as a spot for photos, and came to become a symbol of the renewed enthusiasm surrounding the Pan Am Games. Considering it a symbol of their legacy, [[Mayor of Toronto]] [[John Tory]] solicited suggestions for a permanent location for the sign following the Games. It was later announced that the sign would remain in the Square in its current form through at least the end of 2016.<ref name=torstar-signstaying>{{cite news|title=Toronto sign staying at Nathan Phillips Square|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/09/13/toronto-sign-staying-at-nathan-phillips-square.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|work=Toronto Star}}</ref><ref name=torstar-panamsign>{{cite news|title=Tory takes to Twitter to ask where ‘Toronto’ sign should go next|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/panamgames/2015/07/16/tory-takes-to-twitter-to-ask-where-toronto-sign-should-go-next.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=Toronto Star}}</ref>

=== Canadian television coverage ===
Although still billed as having been the most extensive coverage of the Pan American Games ever broadcast in the country,<ref name=np-cbcplans /> CBC faced criticism for the amount of coverage it produced and broadcast from the 2015 Pan American Games. Live coverage of events were mostly relegated to its digital platforms, with only condensed, tape delayed highlights of events airing on CBC, drawing comparisons to the similar practices imposed by [[Olympics on NBC|NBC's coverage of the Olympics]]. Events in some sports were not broadcast at all, or received only limited online coverage. Critics also perceived several changes, including the last-minute addition of broadcasts, such as the baseball finals online and a semi-final game in men's basketball on [[Sportsnet]], and the expansion of CBC's primetime coverage block part-way through the games, as signs that CBC had underestimated viewer interest in the Games.<ref name=torstar-cbclive/><ref name=np-resources/>

CBC Sports head of programming Trevor Pilling explained that the large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that "I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics are a different event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task."<ref name=torstar-cbclive/><ref name=np-resources/>

While the ''[[National Post]]'' also felt that budget cuts faced by the CBC in recent years, including those imposed following the loss of its national broadcast rights to the [[National Hockey League]] to [[Rogers Communications]], may have also had an impact—with a CBC spokesperson arguing that "resources" were a factor, Pilling denied that this was the case, arguing that it was "about the planning, It is about making good, sound business decisions", and promised that CBC would return to its extensive coverage during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=torstar-cbclive>{{cite news|title=CBC head of sports defends Pan Am Games coverage: Mudhar|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/panamgames/2015/07/24/cbc-head-of-sports-defends-pan-am-games-coverage-mudhar.html|accessdate=August 19, 2015|work=Toronto Star}}</ref><ref name=np-resources>{{cite news|title=‘Resources are a factor’ in Pan Am Games broadcasts, CBC says after facing criticism for gaps in coverage|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/cbc-following-staffing-cuts-in-sports-criticized-for-gaps-in-pan-am-games-coverage-for-sure-resources-are-a-factor|accessdate=August 19, 2015|work=National Post}}</ref>
