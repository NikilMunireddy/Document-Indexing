'''Hebei''' ({{zh|c=河北|p={{Audio|zh-Hebei.ogg|Héběi|help=no}}}}; [[Postal romanization|postal]]: Hopeh) is a [[province of China|province]] of China in the [[North China]] region. Its one-[[Chinese character|character]] abbreviation is "{{lang|zh|冀}}" (jì), named after Ji Province, a [[Han Dynasty]] province (''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]'') that included what is now southern Hebei. The name ''Hebei'' literally means "north of the river",<ref>{{cite web|title=Yellow bridge Chinese Dictionary|url=http://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/dictionary.php|website=Yellow Bridge|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref> referring to its location entirely to the north of the Huang He 黄河([[Yellow River]]).<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces], [[People's Daily Online]].</ref>

Hebei was formed in 1928 after the central government dissolved the province of [[Zhili Province|Chihli]] (直隸), which means "Directly Ruled (by the Imperial Court)".

[[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] Municipalities, which border each other, were carved out of Hebei. The province borders [[Liaoning]] to the northeast, [[Inner Mongolia]] to the north, [[Shanxi]] to the west, [[Henan]] to the south, and [[Shandong]] to the southeast. [[Bohai Bay]] of the [[Yellow Sea]] is to the east. A small part of Hebei, [[Sanhe]] Exclave, consisting of [[Sanhe]], [[Dachang Hui Autonomous County]], and [[Xianghe County]], an [[exclave]] disjointed from the rest of the province, is wedged between the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin.

A common alternate name for Hebei is '''Yānzhào''' ({{lang|zh|燕趙}}), after the [[state of Yan]] and [[state of Zhao]] that existed here during the [[Warring States period]] of early Chinese history.

== History ==
Plains in Hebei were the home of [[Peking man]], a group of [[Homo erectus]] that lived in the area around 200,000 to 700,000 years ago. [[Neolithic]] findings at the [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] date back to 7000 and 8000 BC.<ref>{{cite web

During the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (722 BC – 476 BC), Hebei was under the rule of the states of [[State of Yan|Yan]] ({{lang|zh|燕}}) in the north and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] ({{lang|zh-hant|晉}}) in the south. Also during this period, a nomadic people known as [[Beidi|Dí]] ({{lang|zh|狄}}) invaded the plains of northern China and established [[State of Zhongshan|Zhongshan]] ({{lang|zh|中山}}) in central Hebei. During the [[Warring States period]] (403 BC–221 BC), Jin was partitioned, and much of its territory within Hebei went to [[State of Zhao|Zhao]] ({{lang|zh-hant|趙}}).

The [[Qin Dynasty]] unified China in 221 BC. The [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – AD 220) ruled the area under two provinces (''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]''), [[Youzhou Province]] ({{lang|zh|幽州}}) in the north and [[Jizhou Province]] ({{lang|zh|冀州}} ''Jì Zhōu'') in the south. At the end of the Han Dynasty, most of Hebei came under the control of [[warlord]]s [[Gongsun Zan]] in the north and [[Yuan Shao]] further south; Yuan Shao emerged victorious of the two, but he was soon defeated by rival [[Cao Cao]] (based further south, in modern-day [[Henan]]) in the [[Battle of Guandu]] in 200. Hebei then came under the rule of the [[Kingdom of Wei]] (one of the [[Three Kingdoms]]), established by the descendants of Cao Cao.

[[File:IronLion.jpg|thumb|left|1500-year-old [[Iron Lion of Cangzhou]]]]
After the invasions of northern nomadic peoples at the end of the [[Western Jin Dynasty]], the chaos of the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] and the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties]] ensued. Hebei, firmly in North China and right at the northern frontier, changed hands many times, being controlled at various points in history by the [[Later Zhao]], [[Former Yan]], [[Former Qin]], and [[Later Yan]]. The [[Northern Wei]] reunified northern China in 440, but split in half in 534, with Hebei coming under the eastern half (first the [[Eastern Wei]]; then the [[Northern Qi]]), which had its capital at Ye (鄴), near modern [[Linzhang]], Hebei. The [[Sui Dynasty]] again unified China in 589.

During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), the area was formally designated "Hebei" (north of the Yellow River) for the first time. During the earlier part of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], Hebei was fragmented among several regimes, though it was eventually unified by [[Li Cunxu]], who established the [[Later Tang]] (923–936). The next dynasty, the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]] under Shi Jingtang, posthumously known as Emperor [[Gaozu of Later Jin]], ceded much of modern-day northern Hebei to the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao Dynasty]] in the north; this territory, called the [[Sixteen Prefectures]] of Yanyun, became a major weakness in the Chinese defense against the Khitans for the next century, since it lay within the [[Great Wall]].

During the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (960–1127), the sixteen ceded prefectures continued to be an area of hot contention between Song China and the Liao Dynasty. The [[Southern Song Dynasty]] that came after abandoned all of [[North China]], including Hebei, to the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jurchen Jin Dynasty]] after the [[Jingkang Incident]] in 1127 of the [[Jin campaigns against the Song Dynasty|Jin–Song wars]].

[[File:Budala5.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The [[Putuo Zongcheng Temple]] of [[Chengde]], Hebei, built in 1771 during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].]]
[[File:Saihanba5.jpg|thumb|Saihanba National Park in Inner Mongolian plateau grassland border, north Chengde, Hebei]]

The [[Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty]] divided China into provinces but did not establish Hebei as a province. Rather, the area was directly administrated by the Secretariat ({{lang|zh-hant|中書省}}) at capital [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]]. The [[Ming Dynasty]] ruled Hebei as "Beizhili" ({{lang|zh-hant|北直隸}}, [[pinyin]]: Běizhílì), meaning "Northern Directly Ruled", because the area contained and was directly ruled by the imperial capital, [[Beijing]]; the "Northern" designation was used because there was a southern counterpart covering present-day [[Jiangsu]] and [[Anhui]]. When the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]] came to power in 1644, they abolished the southern counterpart, and Hebei became known as "[[Zhili Province|Zhili]]", or simply "Directly Ruled". During the Qing Dynasty, the northern borders of Zhili extended deep into what is now [[Inner Mongolia]], and overlapped in jurisdiction with the [[Leagues of China|league]]s of Inner Mongolia.

The Qing Dynasty collapsed in 1912 and was replaced by the [[Republic of China]]. Within a few years, China descended into civil war, with regional warlords vying for power. Since Zhili was so close to Peking ([[Beijing]]), the capital, it was the site of frequent wars, including the [[Zhiwan War]], the [[First Zhifeng War]] and the [[Second Zhifeng War]]. With the success of the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]], a successful campaign by the [[Kuomintang]] to end the rule of the warlords, the capital was moved from Peking (Beijing) to Nanking ([[Nanjing]]). As a result, the name of Zhili was changed to Hebei to reflect the fact that it had a standard provincial administration, and that the capital had been relocated elsewhere.

The founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] saw several changes: the region around [[Chengde]], previously part of [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] Province (historically part of [[Manchuria]]), and the region around [[Zhangjiakou]], previously part of [[Chahar (province)|Chahar]] Province (historically part of [[Inner Mongolia]]), were merged into Hebei, extending its borders northwards beyond the Great Wall. The capital was also moved from [[Baoding]] to the upstart city of [[Shijiazhuang]], and, for a short period, to [[Tianjin]].

On July 28, 1976, [[Tangshan]] was struck by a powerful [[earthquake]], the [[Tangshan earthquake]], the deadliest of the 20th century with over 240,000 killed. A series of smaller earthquakes struck the city in the following decade.

In 2005, Chinese archaeologists unearthed what is being called the Chinese equivalent of [[Italy]]'s [[Pompeii]]. The find in question, located near Liumengchun Village (柳孟春村) in [[Cang County]] in east-central Hebei, is a buried settlement destroyed nearly 700 years ago by a major earthquake. Another possible explanation may be the four successive floods which hit the area around the time when the settlement met its sudden end.  The settlement appears to have been a booming commercial center during the [[Song Dynasty]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}<!-- dead link: [http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20050515/sc_afp/chinaarcheology_050515215147] -->

Most of central and southern Hebei lies within the [[North China Plain]]. The western part of Hebei rises into the [[Taihang Mountains]] (Taihang Shan), while the [[Yan Mountains]] (Yan Shan) run through northern Hebei, beyond which lie the grasslands of [[Inner Mongolia]]. The [[Great Wall of China]] cuts through northern Hebei from east to west as well, briefly entering the border of Beijing Municipality, and terminates at the seacoast of [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] in northeastern Hebei. The highest peak is [[Mount Xiaowutai]] in northwestern Hebei, with an altitude of 2882 m.

Hebei borders [[Bohai Sea]] on the east. The [[Hai He]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] covers most of the province's central and southern parts, and the [[Luan He]] watershed covers the northeast. Not counting the numerous reservoirs to be found in Hebei's hills and mountains, the largest lake in Hebei is [[Baiyangdian]], located mostly in [[Anxin County]].

Hebei has a [[continental climate|continental]] [[monsoon]] climate, with cold, dry winters, and hot, humid summers. Temperatures average {{convert|−16|to|−3|°C|°F}} in January and {{convert|20|to|27|°C|°F}} in July; the annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] ranges from {{convert|400|to|800|mm|in|0abbr=on}}, concentrated heavily in summer.

These eleven prefecture-level divisions are subdivided into 170 county-level divisions (44 [[district of China|district]]s, 20 [[county-level cities]], 99 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]] and 6 [[autonomous counties]]). Those are, in turn, divided into 2207 township-level divisions (1 [[district public office]], 937 [[town of China|town]]s, 979 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|townships]], 55 [[ethnic township]]s, and 235 [[subdistrict]]s).

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Hebei|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The politics of Hebei is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The [[Governor of Hebei]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Hebei. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hebei [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary ([[CPC Party Chief]]).

== Economy ==
[[File:Shijiazhuang central.jpg|thumb|240px|Downtown [[Shijiazhuang]].]]

In 2014, Hebei's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was 2.942 trillion yuan (US$479 billion),<ref>http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2012/01/27/chinas-provincial-gdp-figures-in-2011.html</ref> ranked 6th in the PRC. [[GDP per capita]] reached 40,124 [[Renminbi]]. As of 2011, the [[primary sector of industry|primary]], [[secondary sector of industry|secondary]], and [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] sectors of industry contributed 203.46 billion, 877.74 billion, and 537.66 billion RMB respectively. The registered urban [[unemployment rate]] was 3.96%.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}<!-- dead link: [http://www.hetj.gov.cn/tjgb/2003/tjgb2004.htm] -->

[[File:20060416050427.jpg|right|240px|thumbnail|A corner in downtown [[Zhangjiakou]].]]

40% of Hebei's labor force works in the agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry sectors, with the majority of production from these industries going to [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]<ref name="thechinaperspective.com">http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/hebei-province/</ref> Hebei's main agricultural products are [[cereal]] crops including [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[millet]], and [[sorghum]]. [[Cash crop]]s like [[cotton]], [[peanut]], [[soybean]]s and [[sesame]] are also produced.

[[Kailuan]], with a history of over 100 years, is one of China's first modern [[coal]] mines, and remains a major mine with an annual production of over 20 million metric tonnes. Much of the [[North China Oilfield]] is found in Hebei, and there are also major iron mines at [[Handan]] and [[Qian'an, Hebei|Qian'an]]. Iron, as well as steel, manufacturing are the largest industries in Hebei, and are likely to remain so as these industries consolidate and Hebei continues to grow as a manufacturing and transportation center for the region.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com"/>

Hebei's industries include [[textiles]], [[coal]], [[steel]], [[iron]], engineering, chemical production, petroleum, power, [[ceramic]]s and food.

The population is mostly [[Han Chinese]]. 55 ethnic minorities are present in Hebei, representing 4.27% of the total population. The most important are [[Manchu]] (2.1 million people), [[Hui people]] (600000 people) and [[Mongol]] (180000 people).<ref>[http://info.hebei.gov.cn/hbszfxxgk/329988/330059/3736560/index.html 河北省少数民族及宗教概况]</ref>

The predominant religions in Hebei are [[Chinese folk religion]]s, [[Taoism|Taoist traditions]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]]. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 5.52% of the population believes and is involved in [[Chinese ancestral religion|cults of ancestors]], while 3.05% of the population identifies as Christian,<ref name="Wang2015"/> mostly of the [[Catholic Church]]. Local worship of deities in the region began to organise into "[[associations of good-doing|benevolent churches]]" as a reaction to Catholicism in the [[Qing dynasty]].

The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 90.61% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in [[Chinese folk religion|worship of nature deities]], Buddhism, [[Confucianism]], Taoism and [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]]. [[Zailiism]] is a folk religious sect that originated in Hebei. There is a presence of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist schools]] in the province.

Hebei has the largest Catholic population in China, with 1 million members according to the local government.<ref>[http://www.hebmzt.gov.cn/tabid/73/InfoID/1240/frtid/84/Default.aspx 天主教] 河北省民族宗教事务厅</ref> and 1.5 million Catholics according to the Catholic Church.<ref name="chinacath">[http://www.chinacath.org/news/china/2010-09-15/8534.html 河北地下教会主教成为爱国会成员]</ref> The province is considered as the center of Catholicism in China. The town of Donglu, where an apparition of the Virgin Mary was reported to have occurred in 1900, is reportedly "one of the strongholds of the unofficial Catholic Church in China".<ref>[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/50f946dd2.pdf Country Advice China], Australian Government 13 February 2012</ref>

A large number of Catholics in Hebei remain loyal to the Pope and reject the authority of the Catholic Patriotic Church. Four of Hebei's underground bishops have been imprisoned in recent years: Bishop Francis An Shuxin of Donglu since 1996; Bishop James Su Zhimin since October 1997; and Bishops Han Dingxiang of Yongnian who died in prison in 2007 and Julius Jia Zhiguo of Zhengding since late 1999.<ref name="chinacath"/><ref name="pfc">[http://www.prayforchina.com/province/Hebei.htm Hebei], Pray for China</ref> In 2003 there were 350.000 Protestants and 580.000 Muslims according to government statistics.<ref>[http://www.hebmzt.gov.cn/tabid/73/InfoID/1241/frtid/84/Default.aspx Hebei Government Statistics #1]</ref><ref>[http://www.hebmzt.gov.cn/tabid/73/InfoID/1239/frtid/106/Default.aspx Hebei Government Statistics #2]</ref> According to a survey, as of 2010 Muslims constitute 0.82% of the population of Hebei.<ref name="2010-Islam">Min Junqing.

Dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are spoken over most of the province, and most Mandarin dialects in Hebei are in turn classified as part of the [[Ji Lu Mandarin]] subdivision. Regions along the western border with [[Shanxi]], however, have dialects that are distinct enough for linguists to consider them as part of [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], another subdivision of Chinese, rather than Mandarin. In general, the dialects of Hebei are quite similar to and readily intelligible with the [[Beijing dialect]], which forms the basis for [[Standard Chinese]], the official language of the nation. However, there are also some distinct differences, such as differences in the pronunciation of certain words that derive from [[entering tone]] syllables (syllables ending on a [[plosive consonant|plosive]]) in [[Middle Chinese]].

Traditional forms of [[Chinese opera]] in Hebei include [[Pingju]], [[Hebei Bangzi]] (also known as [[Hebei Clapper Opera]]), and [[Cangzhou Kuaiban Dagu]]. Pingju is especially popular: it tends to be colloquial in language and hence easy to understand for audiences. Originating from northeastern Hebei, Pingju has been influenced by other forms of Chinese opera like [[Beijing opera]]. Traditionally Pingju makes use of just a ''[[Sheng (Chinese opera)|xiaosheng]]'' (young male lead), a ''[[Dan (Chinese opera)|xiaodan]]'' (young female lead), and a ''[[Chou (Chinese opera)|xiaohualian]]'' (young comic character), though it has since diversified with the use of other roles as well.

[[Quyang County]], in central Hebei, is noted for its [[Dingzhou porcelain]], which includes various vessels such as bowls, plates, vases, and cups, as well as figurines. Dingzhou porcelain is usually creamy white, though it is also made in other colours.

[[Hebei cuisine]] is typically based on wheat, mutton and beans.

== Transportation ==
Because Hebei surrounds Beijing and Tianjin, all the numerous important railway lines radiating out of these two cities pass through Hebei. The [[Beijing–Guangzhou Railway]] is one of the most important: it passes through many major cities such as [[Baoding]], [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Xingtai]] and [[Handan]] on its way south to [[Henan]].  Other important railways include the [[Beijing–Kowloon Railway]], [[Beijing–Shanghai Railway]], [[Beijing-Harbin Railway]], [[Beijing–Chengde Railway]], [[Beijing–Tongliao Railway]], [[Beijing-Baotou Railway]] and [[Fengtai–Shacheng Railway]].  High-speed rail lines crossing the province include the [[Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway]], [[Beijing-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] and [[Shijiazhuang–Taiyuan High-Speed Railway]].  Future high-speed rail lines from Beijing and Tianjin to [[Northeast China]] and [[Northwest China]] will traverse northern Hebei.

During the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]], Beijing and Hebei were collaborating on a new passenger railway. The RMB 82.6 billion network will add 844 kilometers to the system. Current railway systems for Hebei trains are also being upgraded and will soon be able to travel at speeds of between 160 and 200 kilometers per hour.

As of the early 2013, railway schedule systems listed 160 passenger train stations within the province.<ref>[http://qq.ip138.com/train/hebei/ List of train stations in Hebei] {{zh icon}}</ref>

The recent expressway boom in China has not left Hebei behind. There are expressways to every prefecture-level city of Hebei except [[Chengde]], totalling to approximately 2,000 kilometers. The total length of highways within Hebei is around 40,000 kilometers.

There are a number of ports along the [[Bohai Sea]], including [[Qinhuangdao]] (the second busiest in China with a capacity of over 100 million tons), [[Huanghua, Hebei|Huanghua]], and [[Jingtang]]. Shijiazhuang's [[Zhengding Airport]] is the province's center of air transportation, with domestic and international flights. Parts of Hebei will also be served by the new [[Beijing Daxing International Airport]] in [[Beijing]], which is currently under construction and expected to be completed by 2017.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8752665/China-to-build-worlds-biggest-airport.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=China to build world's biggest airport | date=September 9, 2011}}</ref>

The east end of the [[Ming Great Wall]] is located on the coast at [[Shanhai Pass|Shanhaiguan]] (Shanhai Pass), near [[Qinhuangdao]]. Informally known as the "First Pass of The World" (天下第一關), Shanhaiguan was the place where Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] opened the gates to Manchu forces in 1644, beginning nearly 300 years of Manchu rule; Shanhai Pass also marks the psychological entrance / exit of Manchuria, so that for centuries Manchuria was known as "outside the Pass" or "east of the Pass". [[Beidaihe]], located near Shanhaiguan, is a popular beach resort well known as a former meeting place for top governmental officials.

The Ming Great Wall crosses the northern part of Hebei.

The [[Chengde Mountain Resort]] and its outlying temples are a [[World Heritage Site]]. Also known as the Rehe Palace, this was the summer resort of the Manchu [[Qing Dynasty]] emperors. The Chengde Resort was built between 1703 and 1792, and consists of a palace complex, a large park area composed of lakes, pavilions, causeways, bridges, etc., and a number of Tibetan Buddhist and Han Chinese temples in the surrounding area.

There are Qing Dynasty imperial [[tomb]]s at [[Zunhua]] ([[Eastern Qing Tombs]]) and [[Yi County, Hebei|Yixian]] ([[West Qing Tombs]]). The Eastern Qing Tombs are the resting place of 161 Qing emperors, empresses, and other members of the Qing imperial family, while the West Qing Tombs have 76. These are also part of a [[World Heritage Site]].

The [[Zhao County|Zhaozhou]], or [[Anji Bridge]], built by Li Chun during the [[Sui Dynasty]], is the oldest stone [[arch bridge]] in China, and one of the most significant examples of pre-modern Chinese [[civil engineering]].

[[Baoding]], the old provincial capital, contains the historical [[Zhili Governor's Residence]].

[[Xibaipo]], a village about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} from [[Shijiazhuang]], in [[Pingshan County, Hebei|Pingshan County]] was the location of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of China]] and the headquarters of the [[People's Liberation Army]] during the decisive stages of the [[Chinese Civil War]] between May 26, 1948 and March 23, 1949, at which point they were moved to [[Beijing]]. Today, the area houses a memorial site.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.thechinabeat.org/?p=2384
