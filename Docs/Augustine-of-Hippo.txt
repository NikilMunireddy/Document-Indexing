He was the [[bishop]] of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day [[Annaba]], [[Algeria]]), located in [[Numidia]] ([[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]]). He is viewed as one of the most important [[Church Fathers]] in Western Christianity for his writings in the [[Patristics|Patristic Era]]. Among his most important works are ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' and ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]].''

According to his contemporary, [[Jerome]], Augustine "established anew the ancient Faith."<ref>[[Jerome]] wrote to Augustine in 418: "You are known throughout the world; Catholics honour and esteem you as the one who has established anew the ancient Faith" (''conditor antiquae rursum fidei'').

After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 387, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives.<ref>{{cite book |title=Augustine the Theologian |last=TeSelle |first=Eugene |year=1970 |location=London |pages=347–349 |isbn= 0-223-97728-4}} March 2002 edition: ISBN 1-57910-918-7.</ref> Believing that the [[Grace in Christianity|grace of Christ]] was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of [[original sin]] and made seminal contributions to the development of [[just war theory]].

When the [[Western Roman Empire]] began to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the [[East–West Schism|pre-Schism]] [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] as a spiritual [[New Jerusalem#Christianity|City of God]], distinct from the material Earthly City.<ref name="CC">{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will |title=Caesar and Christ: a History of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Civilization and of Christianity from Their Beginnings to A.D. 325 |publisher=MJF Books |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=1-56731-014-1 |authorlink=Will Durant}}</ref> His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview.

In the Catholic Church and the [[Anglican Communion]], he is a saint, a preeminent [[Doctor of the Church]], and the patron of the [[Augustinians]]. His memorial is celebrated on 28 August, the day of his death. He is the [[patron saint]] of brewers, printers, theologians, the alleviation of sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.<ref name="KnoYrSaint">[http://www.catholicapologetics.info/library/saints/index.htm Know Your Patron Saint]. catholicapologetics.info</ref> Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the [[Protestant Reformation]] due to his teachings on [[salvation]] and [[divine grace]].{{citation_needed|date=February 2016}}

In the [[Eastern Christianity|East]], some of his teachings are disputed and have in the 20th century in particular come under attack by such theologians as [[John Romanides|Father John Romanides]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = SOME UNDERLYING POSITIONS OF THIS WEBSITE| url = http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm| website = www.romanity.org| accessdate = 2015-09-30}}</ref> But other theologians and figures of the Orthodox Church have shown significant appropriation of his writings, chiefly [[Georges Florovsky|Father Georges Florovsky]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Limits of Church| url = http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/limits_church.htm| website = www.fatheralexander.org| accessdate = 2015-09-30}}</ref> The most controversial doctrine surrounding his name is the [[filioque]],<ref name="Rev.

Augustine was born in the year 354 AD in the [[municipium]] of Thagaste (now [[Souk Ahras]], [[Algeria]]) in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]].<ref>[[Paul MacKendrick|MacKendrick, Paul]] (1980) ''The North African Stones Speak'', Chapel Hill: [[University of North Carolina Press]], p. 326, ISBN 0709903944.</ref><ref>[[Everett Ferguson|Ferguson, Everett]] (1998) ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', [[Taylor & Francis]], p. 776, ISBN 0815333196.</ref> His mother, [[Saint Monica|Monica]], was a devout Christian; his father Patricius was a Pagan who converted to Christianity on his deathbed.<ref>Vesey, Mark, trans.

Augustine's family name, Aurelius, suggests that his father's ancestors were [[liberti|freedmen]] of the ''[[Aurelia (gens)|gens Aurelia]]'' given full Roman citizenship by the [[Edict of Caracalla]] in 212. Augustine's family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born.<ref>Lancel, Serge (2002) ''Saint Augustine'', Hymns Ancient & Modern, p. 5, ISBN 0334028663.</ref> It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of [[Berbers|Berber]] origin, on the basis of her name,<ref name="KP"/><ref>Michael Brett and Elizabeth Fentress, ''The Berbers'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], 1997, pp. 71, 293</ref> but as his family were ''[[Decurion (administrative)|honestiores]]'', an upper class of citizens known as honorable men, Augustine's first language is likely to have been Latin.<ref name="KP"/>

At the age of 11, Augustine was sent to school at Madaurus (now [[M'Daourouch]]), a small [[Numidia]]n city about {{convert|19|mi}} south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with [[Latin literature]], as well as pagan beliefs and practices.<ref>Andrew Knowles and Pachomios Penkett, ''Augustine and His World'', Ch. 2.</ref> His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden. He tells this story in his autobiography, ''The Confessions''. He remembers that he did not steal the fruit because he was hungry, but because "it was not permitted."<ref name="ReferenceB">Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 2:4</ref> His very nature, he says, was flawed. 'It was foul, and I loved it. I loved my own error—not that for which I erred, but the error itself."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> From this incident he concluded the human person is naturally inclined to sin, and in need of the grace of Christ.

At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus,<ref name=EA>''Encyclopedia Americana'', v. 2, p. 685. Danbury, CT: [[Grolier]], 1997. ISBN 0-7172-0129-5.</ref> Augustine went to [[Carthage]] to continue his education in [[rhetoric]]. It was while he was a student in Carthage that he read [[Cicero]]'s [[dialogue]] ''[[Hortensius (Cicero)|Hortensius]]'' (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression and sparking his interest in philosophy.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:4</ref> Although raised as a Christian, Augustine left the church to follow the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]], much to his mother's despair.<ref>{{cite web| last= Pope | first = Hugh | work =Catholic Encyclopedia | title = Saint Monica| url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm | accessdate = 20 April 2012|quote= At Carthage Augustine had become a Manichaean and when on his return home he propounded certain heretical propositions she drove him away from her table, but a strange vision urged her to recall him. It was at this time that she went to see a certain holy bishop, whose name is not given, but who consoled her with the now famous words, "the child of those tears shall never perish."}}</ref> As a youth Augustine lived a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle for a time, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits. The need to gain their acceptance forced inexperienced boys like Augustine to seek or make up stories about sexual experiences.<ref name="ReferenceA">Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 2:3</ref> It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, "Grant me [[chastity]] and [[sexual abstinence|continence]], but not yet."<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 8:7</ref>

At about the age of 19, Augustine began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover<ref name=Uta>{{cite book |title= Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: Women, Sexuality and the Catholic Church | last =Ranke-Heineman | first = Uta| publisher= Penguin Books | place = US |year=1988| isbn=9780385265270}}</ref> for over fifteen years<ref name="utne.com">http://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/st-augustine-and-original-sin-ze0z1505zken.aspx "Don't Blame the Devil: St Augustine and Original Sin".

In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress. (He had to wait for two years because the legal age of marriage was twelve. By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest.)<ref name="utne.com"/><ref>{{cite book| last=Brown| first=Peter| title=Augustine of Hippo: A Biography| year=1970| publisher=University of California Press| location=Berkeley| page=63}}</ref>

Augustine was from the beginning a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek<ref name=O>[http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/augustine/ O'Donnell, James J. "Augustine the African", Georgetown University]. Faculty.georgetown.edu. Retrieved on 2015-06-17.</ref> —he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized that he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.

===Teaching rhetoric===
Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and would remain there for the next nine years.<ref name=EA/> Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practised, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay. Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who had been asked by the imperial court at [[Milan]]<ref name="celife" /> to provide a rhetoric professor.
[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|left|thumb|The earliest known portrait of Saint Augustine in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome]]

Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers. Although Augustine showed some fervour for Manichaeism, he was never an initiate or "elect", but an "auditor", the lowest level in the sect's hierarchy.<ref name = "celife" />

While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, [[Faustus of Mileve]], a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism.<ref name="celife"/> In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the [[New Academy]] movement. Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths.<ref>(Kishlansky, 142{{cite book| last1=Kishlansky| first1=Mark| last2=Geary| first2=Patrick| last3=O'Brien| first3=Patricia| title=Civilization in the West| date=2010| publisher=Pearson Education Inc.| location=New Jersey| pages=142–143| edition=Volume 1: to 1715| ref=Augustine of Hippo}}</ref> At Milan, his mother's religiosity, Augustine's own studies in [[Neoplatonism]], and his friend [[Simplician]]us all urged him towards Christianity.<ref name= EA/> Initially Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with [[Ambrose]] of Milan, Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed.

Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced.<ref name = "BeDuhn2009">{{cite book | first = Jason David | last = BeDuhn | title = Augustine's Manichaean Dilemma: Conversion and Apostasy, 373–388 C.E. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEmZaq1Gg3wC&pg=PA163 | accessdate = 17 June 2011 | date =28 October 2009| publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |isbn=978-0-8122-4210-2|page= 163}}</ref> Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired. Augustine arrived in Milan and was immediately taken under the wing by Ambrose. Within his ''Confessions'', Augustine states, "That man of God received me as a father would, and welcomed my coming as a good bishop should."<ref name="Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion">{{cite web| last1=Outler| first1=Albert| title="Medieval Sourcebook." Internet History Sourcebooks Project| url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aug-conv.asp| website=Fordham University, Medieval Sourcebook| publisher=[[Fordham University]] |accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> Soon, their relationship grew, as Augustine wrote, "And I began to love him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church—but as a friendly man."<ref name="Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion"/> Augustine visited Ambrose in order to see if Ambrose was one of the greatest speakers and rhetoricians in the world. More interested in his speaking skills than the topic of speech, Augustine quickly discovered that Ambrose was a spectacular orator. Eventually, Augustine says that through the unconscious, he was led into the faith of Christianity.<ref name="Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion"/>

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a marriage for which he abandoned his concubine. Although Augustine accepted this marriage, Augustine was deeply hurt by the loss of his lover. He said, "My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding." Augustine confessed that he was not a lover of [[marriage|wedlock]] so much as a [[slave]] of [[lust]], so he procured another concubine since he had to wait two years until his fiancée came of age. However, his wound was not healed, even began to fester.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 6:15</ref>

There is evidence that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Burrus | first=Virginia| year=2011| title="Fleeing the Uxorious Kingdom": Augustine's Queer Theology of Marriage | journal =Journal of Early Christian Studies| publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |volume=19| issue=1| pages = 1–20| doi=10.1353/earl.2011.0002}}</ref> In his ''Confessions'', he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fiancée, but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines. [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at [[Cassago Brianza|Cassiciacum]], a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as ''Christianae vitae otium'' – the Christian life of leisure.<ref name="Ferguson208">Ferguson, Everett (1999) ''Christianity in Relation to Jews, Greeks, and Romans'', [[Taylor & Francis]], p. 208, ISBN 0-8153-3069-3.</ref>

===Christian conversion and priesthood===
[[File:Fra angelico - conversion de saint augustin.jpg|thumb|{{Cite journal | title = The Conversion of St. Augustine | type = painting | first = Fra | last = Angelico | author-link = Fra Angelico}}]]
In the summer of 386, at the age of 31, after having heard and been inspired and moved by the story of Ponticianus's and his friends' first reading of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony of the Desert]], Augustine converted to Christianity. As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him to "take up and read" ({{lang-la|tolle, lege}}), which he took as a divine command to open the Bible and read the first thing he saw. Augustine read from [[Epistle to the Romans|Paul's Epistle to the Romans]] – the so-called "''[[Epistle to the Romans#Transformation of believers (12–15:13)|Transformation of Believers]]''" section, consisting of chapters 12 through 15 – wherein Paul outlines how the Gospel transforms believers, and the believers' resulting behaviour. The specific part to which Augustine opened his Bible was Romans chapter 13, verses 13 and 14, to wit:
{{Quote |Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.<ref>{{cite book| author = Augustine of Hippo | title = Confessions |year= 2008| publisher= Oxford University Press| place = New York | pages =152–53 | others = Chadwick, Henry transl}}</ref>}}

He later wrote an account of his conversion – his very transformation, as Paul described – in his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' ({{lang-la|Confessiones}}), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of [[autobiography]]. This work is an outpouring of thanksgiving and penitence. Although it is written as an account of his life, the ''Confessions'' also talks about the nature of time, causality, free will, and other important philosophical topics.<ref name="justus.anglican.org">[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/50.html Augustine of Hippo, Bishop and Theologian]. Justus.anglican.org. Retrieved on 2015-06-17.</ref> The following is taken from that work:

{{quote|<poem>Late have I loved Thee, O Lord; and behold,
Thou wast within and I without, and there I sought Thee.
Thou was with me when I was not with Thee.
Thou didst call, and cry, and burst my deafness.
Thou didst gleam, and glow, and dispell my blindness.
Thou didst touch me, and I burned for Thy peace.
For Thyself Thou hast made us,

Much of Augustine's conversion is dramatized in [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]'s oratorio ''La conversione di Sant' Agostino.'' In the libretto for the oratorio by [[Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria]], Augustine's mother Monica is presented as a prominent character that is worried that Augustine might not convert to Christianity. The Duchess took a five-part drama by Franciscus Neumayr and condensed it for the purposes of the oratorio.

In 391 Augustine was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] in [[Hippo Regius]] (now [[Annaba]]), in [[Algeria]]. He became a famous [[preacher]] (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered.<ref name="celife">Portalié, Eugène.

In 395 he was made [[coadjutor Bishop]] of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter,<ref>Brown, Peter (2000) ''Augustine of Hippo: A Biography'', Berkeley: University of California Press, ISBN 0520227573.</ref> hence the name "Augustine of Hippo"; and he gave his property to the church of Thagaste.<ref>Augustine, ''ep.''126.1</ref> He remained in that position until his death in 430. He wrote his autobiographical ''Confessions'' in 397-398. His work ''The City of God'' was written to console his fellow Christians shortly after the [[Visigoths]] had [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]].

Augustine worked tirelessly in trying to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. Though he had left his monastery, he continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a ''[[Monastic rule|regula]]'' for his monastery that led to his designation as the "[[patron saint]] of [[regular clergy]]."<ref>[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-augustine-of-hippo/ Saint Augustine of Hippo] at ''saints.sqpn.com''. Retrieved 30 September 2011</ref>

Much of Augustine's later life was recorded by his friend [[Possidius]], bishop of [[Calama (Numidia)|Calama]] (present-day [[Guelma]], Algeria), in his ''Sancti Augustini Vita''. Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine's personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see.<ref>[[#Weiskotten|Weiskotten]]</ref>

Shortly before Augustine's death the [[Vandals]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe that had converted to [[Arianism]], invaded [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]]. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege.<ref>[[#Weiskotten|Weiskotten]], p. 43</ref> According to Possidius, Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential [[Psalms|Psalms of David]] be hung on his walls so that he could read them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved. He died on 28 August 430.<ref>[[#Weiskotten|Weiskotten]], p. 57</ref> Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city.

Augustine was [[canonization|canonized]] by popular acclaim, and later recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by [[Pope Boniface VIII]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02662a.htm| title=New Advent – Pope Boniface VIII| accessdate=26 February 2012}}</ref> His [[feast day]] is 28 August, the day on which he died.

====Relics====
According to [[Bede]]'s ''True Martyrology'', Augustine's body was later [[Translation (relic)|translated]] or moved to [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]], by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by [[Huneric]]. Around 720, his remains were transported again by Peter, [[bishop of Pavia]] and uncle of the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]], to the church of [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]] in Pavia, in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by [[Muslim]]s. In January 1327, [[Pope John XXII]] issued the papal bull ''Veneranda Santorum Patrum'', in which he appointed the [[Augustinians]] guardians of the tomb of Augustine (called ''Arca''), which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life.

In October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing some human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the [[regular canons]] (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed that they were. Eventually [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724–1730) directed the Bishop of Pavia, [[Monsignor]] Pertusati, to make a determination. The bishop declared that, in his opinion, the bones were those of Saint Augustine.<ref>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=2213&iparentid=145 Augustine's tomb, Augnet].

The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in [[Milan]] with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled ''Arca'', which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair, but was finally rebuilt in the 1870s, under the urging of [[Agostino Gaetano Riboldi]], and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Dale, Shanon |title=A house divided: San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia and the politics of Pope John XXII| doi=10.1016/S0304-4181(00)00016-6| year=2001| journal=Journal of Medieval History| volume=27| page=55}}</ref><ref>Stone, Harold Samuel (2002) ''St. Augustine's Bones: A Microhistory'' (Studies in Print Culture and the History of the Book) Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], ISBN 1558493883.</ref>

===Christian anthropology===
Augustine was one of the first Christian [[Late Latin|ancient Latin]] authors with a very clear vision of [[Christian anthropology|theological anthropology]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Stanford | title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter-url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#PhiAnt | contribution = Saint Augustine {{ndash}} Philosophical Anthropology | accessdate = 23 March 2011}}</ref> He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise ''[[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume III/Moral Treatises of St. Augustin/On Care to Be Had for the Dead/Section 5|On Care to Be Had for the Dead, section 5]]'' (420 AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human [[person]].<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De cura pro mortuis gerenda'' [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 41, 627[13–22]; PL 40, 595: ''Nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt corpora. (...)Haec enim non ad ornamentum vel adiutorium, quod adhibetur extrinsecus, sed ad ipsam naturam hominis pertinent''.</ref> Augustine's favourite figure to describe ''body-soul'' unity is [[marriage]]: ''caro tua, coniunx tua — your body is your wife''.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Enarrationes in psalmos'', 143, 6.</ref><ref>[[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]; 46, 234–35.</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De utilitate ieiunii'', 4,4–5.</ref> Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De quantitate animae'' 1.2; 5.9.</ref> Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De quantitate animae'' 13.12: ''Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata''.</ref> Augustine was not preoccupied, as [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the [[metaphysics]] of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On the free will'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7–6.13.</ref><ref>{{Cite book | first = WE | last = Mann | contribution = Inner-Life Ethics | title=The Augustinian Tradition | publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 | pages=141–42 | isbn=0-520-20999-0 | editor-first = GB | editor-last = Matthews}}</ref>

===Slavery===

Augustine led many clergy under his authority at Hippo to free their slaves "as an act of piety."<ref>Augustine, "Of the Work of Monks", p. 25, Vol. 3, ''Nicene & Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, MI, Reprinted 1986</ref> He boldly wrote a letter urging the emperor to set up a new law against slave traders and was very much concerned about the sale of children. Christian emperors of his time for 25 years had permitted sale of children, not because they approved of the practice, but as a way of preventing [[infanticide]] when parents were unable to care for a child. Augustine noted that the tenant farmers in particular were driven to hire out or to sell their children as a means of survival.<ref>The Saints, Pauline Books & Media, Daughters of St. Paul, Editions du Signe (1998), p. 72</ref> In his famous book, ''The City of God'', he presents the development of slavery as a product of sin and as contrary to God's divine plan. He wrote that God "did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation – not man over man, but man over the beasts." Thus he wrote that righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle, not kings over men. "The condition of slavery is the result of sin," he declared.<ref>Augustine, ''The City of God'', Ch. 15, p. 411, Vol. II, ''Nicene & Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, MI, Reprinted 1986</ref> However, he did on at least one occasion support slavery. In The City of God, Augustine wrote he felt slavery was not a punishment. He wrote: "Slavery is not penal in character and planned by that law which commands the preservation of the natural order and forbids disturbance."

===Astrology===
Augustine's contemporaries often believed [[astrology]] to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and [[horoscope]]s. (Augustine's term "mathematici", meaning "astrologers", is sometimes mistranslated as "mathematicians".) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but "common swindlers".<ref>{{cite book | title = Augustine the Bishop.

===Creation===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis}}
In ''City of God'', Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-18.htm#P2017_1154484 "Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years to the World's Past"], ''The City of God'', Book 12: Chapt. 10 [419].</ref> In ''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis'', Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven calendar days like a literal interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way – it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]] 18:1, ''creavit omnia simul'' ("He created all things at once"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm B Eerdmans | isbn = 978-0-8028-3843-8 | pages = 377–78 | editor-first = Allan D | editor-last = Fitzgerald | last = Teske| first = Roland J | title = Genesi ad litteram liber imperfectus, De| encyclopedia = Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia| year = 1999}}</ref> Augustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of [[Adam and Eve]] were already created mortal before [[Fall of man|the Fall]].<ref>''On the Merits'', 1.2; ''City of God'', 13:1; ''Enchiridion'', 104</ref> Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that we should be willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up.<ref>Young, Davis A. [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html "The Contemporary Relevance of Augustine's View of Creation"], ''[[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]]'' '''40.1''':42–45 (3/1988).

===Ecclesiology===
{{See also|Ecclesiology}}
[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|150px|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]
Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church|hierarchy]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]], and the [[laity]]) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacrament]]s, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of "wheat" and "tares", that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the "true" or "pure" church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.<ref name="Gonzalez">{{cite book

Augustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],<ref name="Gonzalez"/> and that their authority in the Church is God-given.

===Eschatology===
Augustine originally believed in [[premillennialism]], namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]], but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.<ref>{{cite book| author=Blomberg, Craig L. |title=From Pentecost to Patmos| publisher=Apollos| year=2006| page=519| isbn=0805432485}}</ref> At the Reformation, theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death,<ref name="Oxford:unspecified">[[#Cross|Cross]]</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Enchiridion'', 110</ref> and that [[purgatory|purgatorial]] fires of the [[intermediate state]] purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.<ref name="Oxford:unspecified"/>

===Epistemological views===
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]] concerns shaped Augustine's intellectual development. His early dialogues [''Contra academicos'' (386) and ''De Magistro'' (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[illuminationism|inner illumination]]. The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays an active and regular part in human perception (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes' idea of clear and distinct perceptions) and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents. According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of [[sense perception]]. It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities.<ref name=encyclopedia/> Augustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in ''[[On the Trinity]]'' (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.<ref>{{cite book| author=Matthews, Gareth B. |title=Thought's ego in Augustine and Descartes| isbn=0801427754| publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |year=1992}}</ref> In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.<ref>{{cite journal| last=King| first=Peter| author2=Nathan Ballantyne| title=Augustine on Testimony| journal=[[Canadian Journal of Philosophy]] |year=2009| volume=39| issue=2| doi=10.1353/cjp.0.0045| url=http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf| page=195}}</ref>

===Just war===
{{See also|Just War}}
Augustine asserted that Christians should be [[pacifists]] as a personal, philosophical stance.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html "A Time For War?"] ''Christianity Today'' (2001-01-09).

Defence of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine coined the phrase in his work ''The City of God''.<ref>[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo].

===Mariology===
Although Augustine did not develop an independent [[Mariology]], his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers.<ref>O Stegmüller, in Marienkunde, 455</ref> Even before the [[Council of Ephesus]], he defended the [[perpetual virginity of Mary|ever Virgin Mary]] as the [[theotokos|Mother of God]], who, because of her virginity, is full of grace.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 6,6, 191.</ref> Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary "conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever."<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 18</ref>

===Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation===
Augustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and our God-given reason, the Biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this "literal sense" does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended [[metaphor]].<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Genesi ad literam 1:19–20'', Chapt. 19 [408], ''De Genesi ad literam'', 2:9</ref>

===Original sin===
{{see also|Original sin}}

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century]]
Augustine taught that Original sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first.<ref>He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''. (''Contra Julianum'', V, 4.18; PL 44, 795)</ref> The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] (Gen 2:17).<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 6:12, vol. 1, p. 192-3 and 12:28, vol. 2, p. 219-20, trans.

I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more."

See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: «Quod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest».

Augustine's understanding of the consequences of the original sin and of necessity of the redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against [[Pelagius]] and his [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] disciples, [[Caelestius]] and [[Julian of Eclanum]],<ref name="Gonzalez"/> who had been inspired by Rufinus of Syria, a disciple of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].<ref>[[Marius Mercator]] ''Lib. subnot.in verb.

Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not to act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''[http://www.augustinus.it/latino/grazia_cristo/grazia_cristo_1_libro.htm De gratia Christi et de peccato originali]'', I, 15.16; CSEL 42, 138 [v.24–29]; Ibid., I,4.5; CSEL 42, 128 [v.15–23]. See [[#Bonner|Bonner]], p. 355–356</ref> Like [[Jovinian]], Pelagians insisted that human affections and desires were not touched by the fall either. Immorality, ''e.g.'' [[fornication]], is exclusively a matter of will, ''i.e.'' a person does not use natural desires in a proper way. In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 1.31–32</ref>

In the matter which concerns us here, the agreement with Neoplatonism (and with the Platonic tradition in general) centers on two related notions: immutability as primary characteristic of divinity, and likeness to divinity as the primary vocation of the soul.

Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against [[human sexuality]] and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the ''Confessions''. But in view of his writings it is apparently a misunderstanding.<ref>Gerald Bonner's comment explains a little bit why there are so many authors who write false things about Augustine's views: "It is, of course, always easier to oppose and denounce than to understand." See [[#Bonner|Bonner]], p. 312</ref> Augustine taught that human sexuality has been wounded, together with the whole of human nature, and requires [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] of Christ. That healing is a process realized in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a ''remedium concupiscentiae'' – remedy of concupiscence.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De continentia'', 12.27; PL 40, 368; Ibid., 13.28; PL 40, 369; ''Contra Julianum'', III, 15.29, PL 44, 717; Ibid., III, 21.42, PL 44, 724.</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=| title=A Postscript to the Remedium Concupiscentiae| journal=The Thomist| volume= 70 |year=2006| pages= 481–536 |url=http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/932}}</ref> The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body.<ref>''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1501.htm Merits and Remission of Sin, and Infant Baptism]'' (''De peccatorum meritis et remissione et de baptismo parvulorum''), I, 6.6; PL 44, 112–113; cf.

The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin is transmitted to his descendants by [[concupiscence]],<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Imperfectum Opus contra Iulianum'', II, 218</ref> which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body,<ref>In 393 or 394 he commented: ''Moreover, if unbelief is fornication, and [[idolatry]] unbelief, and [[covetousness]] idolatry, it is not to be doubted that covetousness also is fornication. Who, then, in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive, that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with another's husband or wife, but any unlawful lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband, because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are compelled to understand as being general and universal.'' ("[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/16011.htm On the Sermon on the Mount]", ''De sermone Domini in monte'', 1:16:46; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 35, 52)</ref> making humanity a ''massa damnata'' (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will.<ref name="Oxford:Original"/>

Augustine's formulation of the doctrine of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils, ''i.e.'' [[Councils of Carthage|Carthage]] (418), [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] (431), [[Council of Orange (529)|Orange]] (529), [[Council of Trent|Trent]] (1546) and by popes, ''i.e.'' [[Pope Innocent I]] (401–417) and [[Pope Zosimus]] (417–418). [[Anselm of Canterbury]] established in his ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' the definition that was followed by the great 13th century Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the "privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess", thus separating it from ''concupiscence'', with which some of Augustine's disciples had defined it<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of the Middle Ages |last=Southern |first=R.W. |year=1953 |location=London |pages=234–7}}</ref><ref>[[#Bonner|Bonner]], p. 371</ref> as later did Luther and Calvin.<ref name="Oxford:Original"/> In 1567, [[Pope Pius V]] condemned the identification of Original Sin with concupiscence.<ref name="Oxford:Original"/>

Augustine taught that some people are [[Predestination|predestined]] by God to salvation by an eternal, sovereign decree which is [[unconditional election|not based on man's merit or will]]. The saving grace which God bestows is [[irresistible grace|irresistible]] and unfailingly results in conversion. God also grants those whom he saves with the gift of [[perseverance of the saints|perseverance]] so that none of those whom God has chosen may conceivably fall away.<ref name="Gonzalez"/>{{rp|44}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Hägglund| first=Bengt| title=Teologins historia| language=German| trans_title=History of Theology| others=Translated by Gene J.

In ''On Rebuke and Grace'' (''De correptione et gratia''), Augustine wrote: "And what is written, that He wills all men to be saved, while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings of mine; but here I will say one thing: He wills all men to be saved, is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them."<ref>{{cite book |others=Translated by Peter Holmes and Robert Ernest Wallis, and revised by Benjamin B.

===Free will===
Included in Augustine's [[theodicy]] is the claim that God created humans and angels as rational beings possessing [[free will]]. Free will was not intended for sin, meaning it is not equally predisposed to both good and evil. A will defiled by sin is not considered as "free" as it once was because it is bound by material things, which could be lost or be difficult to part with, resulting in unhappiness. Sin impairs free will, while grace restores it. Only a will that was once free can be subjected to sin's corruption.<ref>{{cite book| editor-first=Chad |editor-last=Meister| editor2-first=Paul| editor2-last=Copan| title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion| date=2012| series=Routledge Philosophy Companions| location=London| isbn=9780415782944| edition=2nd}}</ref>

The [[Catholic Church]] considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will.<ref name="ceteach"/> He often said that anyone can be saved if they wish.<ref name="ceteach"/> While God knows who will and won't be saved, with no possibility for the latter to be saved in their lives, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.<ref name="ceteach">Portalié, Eugène. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02091a.htm "Teaching of St. Augustine of Hippo"] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company (1907). Retrieved 30 September 2011</ref>

===Sacramental theology===
Also in reaction against the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the "regularity" and "validity" of the [[sacrament]]s. Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of [[Cyprian]], who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.<ref name="Gonzalez"/> Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.
[[File:Vittore carpaccio, visione di sant'agostino 01.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''[[St. Augustine in His Study (Carpaccio)|St. Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], 1502]]
Augustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], saying that Christ's statement, "This is my body" referred to the bread he carried in his hands,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Explanations of the Psalms'' 33:1:10 [405]</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 227 [411]</ref> and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 272</ref>

Against the [[Pelagians]], Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed'', Paragraph 16</ref> This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the [[Apocalypse]], may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book 20, Chapter 8</ref>

===Statements on Jews===
Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,<ref>[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.</ref> and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.</ref> He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely "Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at "the end of time," argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.<ref>Edwards, J. (1999) ''The Spanish Inquisition'', Stroud, pp. 33–35, ISBN 0752417703.</ref> The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews "survive but not thrive" (it is repeated by author [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]] in his book ''Constantine's Sword'', for example)<ref>James Carroll, ''Constantine's Sword'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002), p. 219.</ref><ref>See also [http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1864878,00.html Paula Fredriksen, interviewed by David Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"] in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], December 7, 2008.</ref> is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.<ref>Fredriksen interviewed by Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"</ref>

===Views on sexuality===
For Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine'', 3.37</ref> For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. He wrote that the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome were innocent because they did not intend to sin.<ref>[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]] (1945) ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon & Schuster. p. 356.</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book I, Ch. 16, 18.</ref>

He believed that the serpent approached Eve because she was less rational and lacked self-control, while Adam's choice to eat was viewed as an act of kindness so that Eve would not be left alone.<ref name="Reuther, R.R. 2007 pp. 47-68">Reuther, R.R. (2007). "Augustine: Sexuality gender and women", pp. 47–68 in J.C. Stark (Ed.), ''Feminist Interpretations of Augustine'',  University Park, PA: [[The Pennsylvania State University Press]], ISBN 027103257X.</ref> Augustine believed sin entered the world because man (the spirit) did not exercise control over woman (the flesh).<ref>Edwards, B. (2011) ''Let My People Go: A Call to End the Oppression of Women in the Church'', Charleston, SC: Createspace, ISBN 1466401117.</ref> Augustine does, however, praise women and their role in society and in the Church. In his ''Tractates on the Gospel of John'', Augustine, commenting on the [[Samaritan]] woman from John 4:1–42, uses the woman as a figure of the church.

According to Raming, the authority of the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', a collection of Roman Catholic [[canon law]] which prohibits women from leading, teaching, or being a witness, rests largely on the views of the early church fathers—one of the most influential being Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo.<ref>Raming, I.

Lanham, MD: [[Scarecrow Press]], pp. 29–30, ISBN 0810848503.</ref> The laws and traditions founded upon Augustine's views of sexuality and women continue to exercise considerable influence over church doctrinal positions regarding the role of women in the church.<ref>Edwards, B.

Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is ''De Magistro'' (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education. However, his ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Saint Augustine wrote his ''Retractationes'', reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of "retractationes" may be "reconsiderations". Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Saint Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding/meaning/truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development and change.<ref name=mccloskey/>

Augustine was a strong advocate of [[critical thinking]] skills. Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialogue/dialectic/discussion is the best means for learning, and this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Saint Augustine's dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.<ref name=mccloskey>McCloskey, Gary N. (April 2008) [http://www.merrimack.edu/academics/augustinian_pedagogy/documents/encountering_0408.pdf Encounters of Learning: Saint Augustine on Education], Saint Augustine Institute for Learning and Teaching, [[Merrimack College]].</ref>

He recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds:
* the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers;
* the student who has had no education; and
* the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated.

If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between "having words and having understanding," and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

A ''restrained'' style of teaching ensures the students' full understanding of a concept because the teacher does not bombard the student with too much material; focuses on one topic at a time; helps them discover what they don't understand, rather than moving on too quickly; anticipates questions; and helps them learn to solve difficulties and find solutions to problems.

Augustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline.

(1931) ''A History of Later Latin Literature'', Dawsons of Pall Mall, London, pp. 56 ff.</ref> They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]]; texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''); [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]]; many [[sermon]]s and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life. Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate Dei'' (''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time. He also wrote ''On Free Choice of the Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.

In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the ''[[Enneads]]'', probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Neoplatonism, some ideas are still visible in his early writings.<ref>[[Bertrand Russell]], ''History of Western Philosophy'' Book II Chapter IV</ref> His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. He was also influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), and [[Cicero]] (known for his teaching on argument).<ref name=encyclopedia/>

===In philosophy===
[[Philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the ''Confessions'', comparing it favourably to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s version of the view that time is subjective.<ref>''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1946), reprinted Unwin Paperbacks 1979, pp. 352–353.</ref> Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the "eternal present"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory<ref>[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''</ref> clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.

Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].<ref>{{cite book| last=de Paulo| first=Craig J. N.| title=The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of an Augustinian Phenomenology| year=2006| publisher=[[The Edwin Mellen Press]] | isbn=0773456899}}</ref> [[Edmund Husserl]] writes: "The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem."<ref>Husserl, Edmund (1964) ''Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.'' Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, p. 21.</ref> [[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]''.<ref>For example, Heidegger's articulations of how "Being-in-the-world" is described through thinking about ''seeing'': "The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''." Heidegger then quotes the''Confessions'': "Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'". ''Being and Time'', Trs. Macquarrie & Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964, p. 171.</ref> [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): "The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity."<ref>{{cite journal| author=Chiba, Shin| title= Hannah Arendt on Love and the Political: Love, Friendship, and Citizenship| journal=The Review of Politics| volume= 57| issue= 3 | year=1995| pages= 505–535 (507)| jstor=1408599| doi=10.1017/S0034670500019720}}</ref> Jean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' {{clarify span |text=finds similarity between Augustine and Arendt in their concepts of evil |reason=Please explain what is the likeness.

===In theology===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall.<ref name="Oxford:Original">[[#Cross|Cross]], Ch. "Original Sin"</ref> Augustine's doctrine of [[efficacious grace]] found eloquent expression in the works of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]; also [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] theologians such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] would look back to him as their inspiration.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).<ref name="Oxford:Original"/>

According to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against [[paganism]] and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and [[witchcraft]]. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Marxism]], [[Freudianism]] and eco-fundamentalism.<ref name="Deepak Lal">Lal, D. (March 2002) [http://www.econ.ucla.edu/workingpapers/wp812.pdf "Morality and Capitalism: Learning from the Past"]. Working Paper Number 812, Department of Economics, [[University of California, Los Angeles]].</ref> Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine's thought, particularly ''The City of God'', in their book of political philosophy ''Empire''.

Augustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]. [[Hannah Arendt]], an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] extensively quotes Augustine in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''. Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of [[semiotics]], but rather built upon [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: "as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies."<ref>Munteanu, E. 'On the Object-Language / Metalanaguage Distinction in Saint Augustine's Works. De Dialectica and de Magistro.', p. 65. In Cram, D., Linn, A. R., & Nowak, E. (Eds.).

Retrieved April 16, 2015 from https://books.google.com/books?id=IWtCAAAAQBAJ.</ref>

In his autobiographical book ''Milestones'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] claims Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought.

==In popular culture==
Augustine was played by Dary Berkani in the 1972 television movie ''Augustine of Hippo''. He was played by [[Franco Nero]] in the 2010 mini-series ''[[Augustine: The Decline of the Roman Empire]]'' and the 2012 feature film ''[[Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine]]''.<ref>[http://www.restlessheartfilm.com/ Restless Heart]. Restlessheartfilm.com. Retrieved on 2013-04-28.</ref> The modern-day name links to the Agostinelli family.<ref>[http://www.4crests.com/agostinelli-coat-of-arms.html AGOSTINELLI Family Crest / AGOSTINELLI Coat of Arms]. 4crests.com (2013-04-19). Retrieved on 2013-04-28.</ref>

[[Jostein Gaarder]]'s [[philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]] ''[[Vita Brevis]]'' is presented as a translation of a manuscript written by Augustine's concubine after he became the Bishop of Hippo. Augustine also appears in the novel ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'' by Flann O'Brien (the pen name of Irish author [[Brian O'Nolan]]). He is summoned to an underwater cavern by an absurd scientist called De Selby; together they discuss life in Heaven and the characters of other saints. [[Walter M. Miller, Jr.]]'s novel ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'' cites Augustine as possibly positing the first version of a theory of [[evolution]].<ref>Miller, Walter M., Jr. (1959) ''A Canticle for Leibowitz'', p. 209.</ref>

[[Bob Dylan]] recorded a song entitled "[[I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine]]" on his album ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]''. Pop artist [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] pays an homage of sorts to Augustine's struggles with lust with the song "Saint Augustine in Hell" which appears on the singer's 1993 album ''[[Ten Summoner's Tales]]''. Christian rock band [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]] named their fourth track on their 2010 release ''Horseshoes and Handgrenades'' after Augustine, called "The Ballad of St. Augustine".  The song "St. Augustine" appears on [[Girlyman]]'s album, ''Supernova''. American rock band [[Moe (band)|Moe]] named and referenced Augustine of Hippo in their song entitled "St. Augustine".

The conversion of Saint Augustine is dramatized in the oratorio ''La conversione di Sant'Agostino'' (1750) composed by [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]. The libretto for this oratorio, written by [[Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria]], draws upon the influence of [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasio]] (the finished libretto having been edited by him) and is based off an earlier five-act play ''Idea perfectae conversionis dive Augustinus'' written by the Jesuit priest [[Franz Neumayr]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7vpR97_-VIC&lpg=PA98&ots=z_eeg---Ko&dq=la%2520conversione%2520di%2520sant'agostino%2520oratorio%2520hasse&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q=la%2520conversione%2520di%2520sant'agostino%2520oratorio%2520hasse&f=false|title=A History of the Oratorio|last=Smither|first=Howard E.|date=1977-01-01|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807812747|language=en}}</ref>
