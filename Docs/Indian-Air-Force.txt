The '''Indian Air Force''' ('''IAF'''; <small>[[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]</small>: ''Bhāratīya Vāyu Senā'') is the [[air force|air arm]] of the [[Indian armed forces]]. It is the world's fourth largest air force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/airforce.htm|title=India - Air Force|author=John Pike|publisher=}}</ref> Its primary responsibility is to secure Indian [[airspace]] and to conduct [[aerial warfare]] during a conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the [[British Empire]] and the prefix ''Royal'' was added in 1945 in recognition of its services during World War II. After India became independent from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1947, the Royal Indian Air Force served the [[Dominion of India]], with the prefix being dropped when India became a republic in 1950. Since independence, the IAF has been involved in [[Indo-Pakistani Wars|four wars]] with neighbouring [[Pakistan]] and one with the People's Republic of China. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include [[Indian annexation of Portuguese India|Operation ''Vijay'']], [[Operation Meghdoot|Operation ''Meghdoot'']], [[Operation Cactus|Operation ''Cactus'']] and [[Operation Poomalai|Operation ''Poomalai'']]. Apart from conflicts, the IAF has been an active participant in [[History of United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeeping missions]].

The [[President of India]] serves as Supreme Commander of the IAF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presidentofindia.nic.in/about.htm|title=About - The President of India|publisher=}}</ref> The [[Chief of Air Staff (India)|Chief of Air Staff]], an [[Air Chief Marshal]], is a [[four-star rank|four-star]] officer and commands the Air Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of [[Marshal of the Air Force]] has been conferred once, to [[Arjan Singh]], by the President of India on 26 Jan 2002 and he became first [[five-star rank]] holding officer of IAF & serves as the ceremonial chief.

Thus, the IAF has the primary objective of safeguarding Indian territory and national interests from all threats in conjunction with the other branches of the armed forces by defending Indian airspace. The IAF provides close air support to the [[Indian Army]] troops in the battlefield and also provides strategic and tactical airlift capabilities. IAF also provides infantry and artillery transportations or secondary  Airlift for the Indian Army . The IAF also operates the [[Integrated Space Cell]] together with the other two branches of the [[Indian Armed Forces]], the civilian [[Department of Space]] and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) to utilise more effectively the country's space-based assets for military purposes and to look into threats to these assets.<ref name="India in aerospace defence plan">{{cite news |title=India in aerospace defence plan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6307875.stm |publisher=BBC |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref><ref name="SpaceDaily">{{cite web |title=India Begins Work On Space Weapons Command |url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/India_Begins_Work_On_Space_Weapons_Command.html |publisher=Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) |archiveurl=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1019506091.html |archivedate=24 April 2006 |date=12 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=23 June 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Air Ministry Second World War Official Collection CI75.jpg|thumb|left|[[World War II]] photo: [[Arjan Singh]] (middle) as Flight Lieutenant. He went on to become [[Marshal of the Air Force]].]]
During [[World War II]], the IAF played an instrumental role in blocking the advance of the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese army]] in [[Myanmar|Burma]], where its first air strike was on the Japanese military base in [[Rakhine State|Arakan]]. It also carried out strike missions against the Japanese airbases at [[Mae Hong Son]], [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Chiang Rai]] in northern [[Thailand]].

The IAF was mainly involved in [[Airstrike|Strike]], [[Close Air Support]], [[Aerial reconnaissance]], [[Bomber escort|Bomber Escort]] and Pathfinding missions for RAF and USAAF Heavy bombers. RAF Pilots were embedded in IAF units and vice versa to gain combat experience. IAF pilots participated in air operations in Europe as part of the RAF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?31169-Royal-Indian-Air-Force-in-WW2-Lots-of-Rare-Pics |title=Royal Indian Air Force in WW2 - Lots of Rare Pics |publisher=militaryphotos.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121021032255/http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?31169-Royal-Indian-Air-Force-in-WW2-Lots-of-Rare-Pics |archivedate=21 October 2012 }}</ref>

During the war, the IAF went through a phase of steady expansion. New aircraft, including the U.S. built [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]], [[Douglas DC-3]] and the British [[Hawker Hurricane]], [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Westland Lysander]], were added to its fleet.

In recognition of the services rendered by the IAF, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] conferred the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] "Royal" in 1945. Thereafter the IAF was referred to as the ''Royal Indian Air Force''. In 1950, when India became a republic, the prefix was dropped and it reverted to being the Indian Air Force.

===First years of independence (1947–1950)===

After become independent from the [[British Empire]] in 1947, [[British Raj|British India]] was [[partition of India|partitioned]] into the new states of the [[Dominion of India]] and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]. Along the lines of the geographical partition, the assets of the air force were divided between the new countries. India's air force retained the name of the Royal Indian Air Force, but three of the ten operational squadrons and facilities, located within the borders of Pakistan, were transferred to the [[Pakistan Air Force|Royal Pakistan Air Force]].<ref name="Engineer">{{cite web|last=Engineer |first=Aspy M. |title=Air Marshal Aspy Engineer's Recollections |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1940s/Aspy01.html |date=February 1993 |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |accessdate=8 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20091230140314/http://bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1940s/Aspy01.html |archivedate=30 December 2009 }}</ref> The RIAF Roundel was changed to an interim 'Chakra' roundel derived from the [[Ashoka Chakra]].<ref name="Heraldry"/>

===Border disputes and changes in the IAF (1962–1971)===

In January 2002, the [[Government of India|government]] conferred the rank of [[Marshal of the Air Force]] on [[Arjan Singh]] making him the first and only ''[[five-star rank|Five-star]]'' officer with the Indian Air Force and ceremonial chief of the air force.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marshal of the Indian Air Force |url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=14 |publisher=Indian Air Force |accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref>

===Commands===
{{main|List of Indian Air Force bases}}
The Indian Air Force is divided into five operational and two functional [[Command (military formation)|commands]]. Each Command is headed by an Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Air Marshal. The purpose of an operational command is to conduct military operations using aircraft within its area of responsibility, whereas the responsibility of functional commands is to maintain [[combat readiness]]. Aside from the Training Command at Bangalore, the primary flight training is done at the [[Air Force Academy, Dundigul]] (located in [[Hyderabad]]), followed by operational training at various other schools. Advanced officer training for command positions is also conducted at the Defence Services Staff College; specialised advanced flight training schools are located at [[Bidar]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Hakimpet]], Telangana (also the location for helicopter training). Technical schools are found at a number of other locations.<ref name="GS_IAF">{{cite web |title=Indian Air Force|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/airforce.htm |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref>

Within each operational command are anywhere from three to 10 [[List of Indian Air Force bases|bases]] or stations, each commanded by an [[Air Commodore]].

===Wings===
{{Indian Air Force}}
A [[Wing (air force unit)|Wing]] is a formation intermediate between a Command and a Squadron. It generally consists of two or three IAF Squadrons and Helicopter Units, along with Forward Base Support Units (FBSU). FBSUs do not have or host any Squadrons or Helicopter units but act as transit airbases for routine operations. In times of war, they can become fully fledged air bases playing host to various Squadrons. In all, about 47 Wings and 19 FBSUs make up the IAF.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air Force Wings, FBSUs and CMUs |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Units/Bases/282-Wings.html |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |accessdate=10 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Air Force FBSUs and CMUs |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Units/Bases/284-FBSUs.html |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |accessdate=10 July 2009}}</ref> Wings are typically commanded by a [[Group Captain]].

===Squadrons and Units===
[[Squadron (aviation)|Squadrons]] are the field units and formations attached to static locations. Thus, a Flying Squadron or Unit is a sub-unit of an air force station which carries out the primary task of the IAF. A fighter squadron consists of 18 aircraft; all fighter squadrons are headed by a [[Commanding Officer]] with the rank of [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rawindia.com/?p=53 |title=Indian Air Force |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}</ref> Some Transport squadrons and Helicopter Units are headed by a Commanding Officer with the rank of [[Group Captain]].

===Flights===
[[Flight (military unit)|Flights]] are sub-divisions of [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadrons]], commanded by a [[Squadron Leader]]. Each Flight consists of two sections.<ref name="careerairforce.nic.in">[http://careerairforce.nic.in/life_airforce/lifeair_cargraph_officers.html]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>

===Sections===
The smallest unit is the section, led by a [[Flight Lieutenant]]. Each section consists of three aircraft.

Within this formation structure, IAF has several service branches for day-to-day operations. They are:<ref name="Career IAF">{{cite web |title=Indian Air Force: Career Opportunities |url=http://www.careerairforce.nic.in/career_opp/caropp_officer_varientry.html |publisher=Indian Air Force |accessdate=21 April 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>

===Garud Commando Force===
{{Main|Garud Commando Force}}
[[File:Garud1.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Garud Commando Force|Garud Commandos]] in a drill, 2015.]]
In September 2009, the IAFMM. established its own [[Special Forces of India|special operation]] unit called the [[Garud Commando Force]], consisting of approximately 1,500 personnel. For starting this special force volunteers from exiting trades were called and sent for commando and specialised training at various institutes of army and other forces. The airmen who successfully completed all course were inducted in Garud force, while special recruitment and selections from various IAF training institute were made for selecting young air warriors for Garud SF. By doing this IAF got two set of personnel for its SF, i.e. experienced senior lot with experience of working in various IAF units and younger airmen who can be groomed and brought up to the standards of SF. The unit derives its name from ''[[Garuda]]'', a divine mythical bird of [[Hindu]] [[Mythology]], but more commonly the word for [[Garuda]] in [[Sanskrit]]. Garud is tasked with the protection of critical installations; During hostilities, Garuds undertake combat search and rescue, rescue of downed airmen and other forces from behind enemy lines, suppression of enemy air defence (SEAD), radar busting, combat control, missile and munitions guidance ("lasing" of targets) and other missions in support of air operations. It has been suggested that they undertake an offensive role including raids on enemy air bases etc. during times of war.

Apart from protecting air bases from sabotage and attacks by commando raids, they are also tasked to seal off weapons systems, fighter hangars and other major systems during intrusions and conflicts. and disaster relief during calamities.<ref name="PIB 7 September">{{cite press release |title=Constitution of Commando Force |publisher=Press Information Bureau, [[Government of India]] |date=18 December 2003 |url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=262 |accessdate=25 July 2008}}</ref>

===Integrated Space Cell===

==Personnel==
[[File:IAF Uniform.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Officers of the IAF in their [[uniform]].]]

Over the years reliable sources provided notably divergent estimates of the personnel strength of the Indian Air Force after analysing [[open-source intelligence]]. The public policy organisation GlobalSecurity.org had estimated that the IAF had an estimated strength of 110,000 active personnel in 1994.<ref name="GS_IAF"/> In 2006, Anthony Cordesman estimated that strength to be 170,000 in the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS) publication ''"The Asian Conventional Military Balance in 2006"''.<ref name=CordesmanKleiber24>{{Harvnb|Cordesman|Kleiber|2006|p=24|Ref=Csis}}</ref> In 2010, James Hackett revised that estimate to an approximate strength of 127,000 active personnel in the IISS publication ''"Military Balance 2010"''.<ref>{{Harvnb| Hackett|2010|p=360|Ref=IISS2010}}</ref>

===Airmen===

The duty of an airman in the Indian Air Force is to make sure that all the air and ground operations run smoothly. From operating Air Defence systems to fitting missiles, they are involved in all activities of an air base and give support to various technical and non-technical jobs.<ref name="airmen">{{cite web |title=Central Airmen Selection Board|url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=135 |publisher=Indian Air Force |accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref> The airmen of Technical trades are responsible for maintenance, repair and prepare for use the propulsion system of aircraft and other airborne weapon delivery system, Radar, Voice/Data transmission and reception equipment, latest airborne weapon delivery systems, all types of light, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic systems of airborne missiles, aero engines, aircraft fuelling equipment and heavy duty mechanical vehicles, cranes and loading equipment etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=135|title=CASB|work=indianairforce.nic.in}}</ref>  The competent and qualified Airmen from Technical trades  also participate in flying as Flight Engineers, Flight Signallers and Flight Gunners. The recruitment of personnel below officer rank is conducted through All India Selection Tests and Recruitment Rallies. All India Selection Tests are conducted among 15 Airmen Selection Centres (ASCs) located all over India. These centres are under the direct functional control of Central Airmen Selection Board (CASB), with administrative control and support by respective commands. The role of CASB is to carry out selection and enrolment of airmen from the Airmen Selection Centres for their respective commands.<ref name="airmen"/> Candidates initially take a written test at the time of application. Those passing the written test undergo a physical fitness test, an interview conducted in English, and medical examination. Candidates for training are selected from individuals passing the battery of tests, on the basis of their performance. Upon completion of training, an individual becomes an Airman.<ref name="airmen"/> Some MWOs and WOs are granted honorary commission in the last year of their service as an honorary Flying Officer or [[Flight Lieutenant]] before retiring from the service.<ref name="airmen"/>

Almost all the commands have some percentage of civilian strength which are central government employees. These are regular ranks which are prevalent in ministries. They are usually not posted outside their stations and are employed in administrative and non-technical work.<ref>{{cite web | title=Non Combatant(Enrolled) – Pension Chart| url=http://pcdapension.nic.in/govtOrders/Tables/table66.htm | publisher=Principal Controller of Defence Accounts | accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=AFRO Career Planning | url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=147 | publisher=Indian Air Force | accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref>

===Training and education===
{{Main|Military academies in India}}

The Indian Armed Forces have set up numerous military academies across India for training its personnel, such as the [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]] (NDA). Besides the tri-service institutions, the Indian Air Force has a [[Training Command, Indian Air Force|Training Command]] and several training establishments. While technical and other support staff are trained at various Ground Training Schools, the pilots are trained at the [[Air Force Academy, Dundigul]] (located in [[Hyderabad]]). The [[Basic Flying Training School (India)|Pilot Training Establishment]] at [[Allahabad]], the [[Air Force Administrative College]] at [[Coimbatore]], the School of Aviation Medicine at [[Bangalore]], the [[Air Force Technical College, Bangalore]] at [[Jalahalli]], the [[Tactics and Air Combat and Defence Establishment]] at [[Gwalior]], and the Paratrooper’s Training School at [[Agra]] are some of the other training establishments of the IAF.

==Future of the Indian Air Force==
<!--This section is an extremely generalised and short list of IAF's future plans. Details, news, and announcements about new and ongoing programmes have been truncated to its own main page. See Future of the Indian Air Force. Please do not include aforementioned items.-->
{{Main|Future of the Indian Air Force}}
The number of aircraft in the IAF has been decreasing from the late 1990s due to retirement of older aircraft and several crashes. To deal with the depletion of force levels, the IAF has started to modernise its fleet. This includes both the upgrade of existing aircraft, equipment and infrastructure as well as induction of new aircraft and equipment, both indigenous and imported. As new aircraft enter service and numbers recover, the IAF plans to have a fleet of 42 squadrons.<ref name="42 Squad">{{cite news | title=IAF fighter squadrons to rise to 42 by 2022: Antony| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/IAF_fighter_squadrons_to_rise_to_42_by_2022_Antony/articleshow/4151093.cms |work=The Times of India  | date=18 February 2009 | accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref>

After much uncertainty and protracted talks between Dassault and the Indian Government the original Rafael deal was declared dead. The main reason being disagreements over transfer of technology. The Indian Government has cancelled the MMRCA tender and decided to cut down original order from 126 to 36 aircraft; these to be bought off the shelf from Dassault. The IAF has issued a Request for Information (RFI) for 16 [[C-27J Spartan]] medium military transport aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories655.htm|title=IAF issues RFI for C 27J Spartan|date=July 2010|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> A new Request For Information has been issued to replace [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748]] for $2.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defencenews.in/defence-news-internal.asp?get=new&id=1358 |publisher=Defence News |title=MoD Clears $2.4 bn Plan To Buy Cargo Planes For IAF |deadurl=yes |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120801072605/http://www.defencenews.in:80/defence-news-internal.asp?get=new&id=1358 |archivedate=1 August 2012 }}</ref> The IAF also submitted a request for information to international suppliers for a stealth unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/07/07/344140/india-canvasses-global-suppliers-for-stealthy-ucav.html |title=India canvasses global suppliers for stealthy UCAV |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100710130423/http://www.flightglobal.com:80/articles/2010/07/07/344140/india-canvasses-global-suppliers-for-stealthy-ucav.html |archivedate=10 July 2010 }}</ref>

===Network-centric warfare===
The [[Air Force Network]] (AFNET), a robust digital information grid that enabled quick and accurate threat responses, was launched in 2010, helping the IAF become a truly network-centric air force. AFNET is a secure communication network linking command and control centres with offensive aircraft, sensor platforms and ground missile batteries. Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS), an automated system for Air Defence operations will ride the AFNet backbone integrating ground and airborne sensors, weapon systems and command and control nodes. Subsequent integration with civil radar and other networks shall provide an integrated Air Situation Picture, and reportedly acts as a [[force multiplier]] for intelligence analysis, mission control, and support activities like maintenance and logistics. The design features multiple layers of security measures, including encryption and intrusion prevention technologies, to hinder and deter espionage efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=IAF's AFNET NCW Backbone Goes Live Next Week|url=http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/09/iafs-afnet-goes-live-next-week.html|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref>
