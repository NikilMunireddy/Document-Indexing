Indian Standard Time

[[Image:IST-CIA-TZ.png|thumb|IST in relation with the bordering nations]]
'''Indian Standard Time''' ('''IST''') is the [[time zone|time]] observed throughout [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], with a [[time offset]] of [[UTC+05:30]]. India does not observe [[daylight saving time]] ('''DST''') or other seasonal adjustments. In military and aviation time IST is designated '''E*''' ("Echo-Star").<ref>{{cite web |url= http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/info/timezone.htm |title= Military and Civilian Time Designations |accessdate= 2006-12-02 |work=Greenwich Mean Time}}</ref>

Indian Standard Time is calculated on the basis of 82.58° E [[longitude]], in [[Shankargarh|Shankargarh Fort]], Mirzapur ({{Coord|25.15|N|82.58|E|}}) (in [[Mirzapur district]] in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]) which is nearly on the corresponding longitude reference line.<ref name="two-timing">{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorial-views-on/Edits/Two-timing-India/Article1-246310.aspx |title=Two-timing India|date=2007-09-04|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

In the [[tz database]], it is represented by [[Asia/Kolkata]].

==History==
{{Main|Time in India}}

After [[Indian independence movement|independence in 1947]], the Indian government established IST as the official time for the whole country, although [[Kolkata]] and [[Mumbai]] retained their own local time (known as [[Calcutta Time]] and [[Bombay Time]]) until 1948 and 1955, respectively.<ref name="Princely states">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-misc.html |title=Odds and Ends |accessdate=2006-11-25 |publisher=[[Indian Railways Fan Club]]}}</ref> The Central observatory was moved from [[Chennai]] to a location at Shankargarh Fort [[Allahabad district]], so that it would be as close to UTC +5:30 as possible.

Daylight Saving Time (DST) was used briefly during the [[Sino-Indian War|China–Indian War of 1962]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|Indo–Pakistani Wars of 1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]].<ref name="timez">{{cite web |url =http://wwp.india-time.com/indian-time-zones.htm |title =India Time Zones |accessdate =2006-11-25|work=Greenwich Mean Time}}</ref>

==Criticism and proposals==
The country's east–west distance of more than {{convert|2,933|km|mi}} covers over 28 degrees of longitude, resulting in the sun rising and setting almost two hours earlier on India's eastern border than in the [[Rann of Kutch]] in the far west. Inhabitants of the [[Northeast India|northeastern states]] have to advance their clocks with the early sunrise and avoid the extra consumption of energy after daylight hours.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1501252.stm |title=India investigates different time zones|accessdate=2006-11-25 |last=Sen |first=Ayanjit |date=2001-08-21 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

In the late 1980s, a team of researchers proposed separating the country into two or three time zones to conserve energy. The binary system that they suggested involved a return to British–era time zones; the recommendations were not adopted.<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="thehindu2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/01/07/stories/2002010700130300.htm |title=A matter of time |accessdate=2006-11-25 |last=S. Muthiah |date=2012-09-24 |work=[[The Hindu]] }}</ref>

In 2001, the government established a four–member committee under the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Ministry of Science and Technology]] to examine the need for multiple time zones and daylight saving.<ref name="bbc"/> The findings of the committee, which were presented to [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 2004 by the Minister for Science and Technology, [[Kapil Sibal]], did not recommend changes to the unified system, stating that "the prime meridian was chosen with reference to a central station, and that the expanse of the Indian State was not large."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dst.gov.in/admin_finance/un-sq1007.htm |title=Standard Time for Different Regions |accessdate=2006-11-25 |date=2004-07-22 |work=Department of Science and Technology}}</ref>

Though the government has consistently refused to split the country into multiple time zones, provisions in labour laws such as the ''Plantations Labour Act, 1951'' allow the Central and State governments to define and set the local time for a particular industrial area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrcw.nic.in/shared/sublinkimages/19.htm |title=A matter of time |accessdate=2006-11-25 |work=National Resource Centre for Women}}</ref> In [[Assam]], tea gardens follow a separate time zone known as the 'Tea Garden Time' or ''Bagantime'' that is one hour ahead of IST.<ref name="HindustanTimes2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Change-clock-to-bagantime/Article1-304181.aspx |title= Change clock to bagantime |accessdate=2008-09-22 |last=Rahul Karmakar |date=2012-09-24 |work=[[Hindustan Times]] }}</ref>  Still Indian Standard Time remains the only officially used time.

The filmmaker [[Jahnu Barua]] has been campaigning for a separate time zone (daylight saving time) for the past 25 years. In 2010, he suggested creating a separate time zone for the Development of Northeastern Region.<ref>http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-01-02/india/45797966_1_jahnu-barua-tarun-gogoi-separate-time-zone</ref>

In 2014, Chief Minister of Assam [[Tarun Gogoi]] started campaigning for another time zone for [[Assam]] and other [[northeast India|northeastern states]] of India.<ref>http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/india-could-get-second-time-zone-with-assam-one-hour-ahead-466326?curl=1388743528</ref> However, the proposal would need to be cleared by the Central Government of India.

==Time signals==
Official time signals are generated by the [[Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory]] at the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi, for both commercial and official use. The signals are based on [[atomic clock]]s and are synchronised with the worldwide system of clocks that support the [[Coordinated Universal Time]].

Features of the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory include:
*[[High frequency]] broadcast service operating at 10&nbsp;MHz under call sign ''ATA'' to synchronise the user clock within a millisecond;
*[[Indian National Satellite System]] satellite–based standard time and frequency broadcast service, which offers IST correct to ±10 microsecond and frequency calibration of up to ±10<sup>−10</sup>; and
*Time and frequency calibrations made with the help of [[picosecond|pico–]] and [[nanosecond]]s time interval [[frequency counter]]s and [[phase (waves)|phase]] recorders.

IST is taken as the standard time as it passes through almost the centre of India. To communicate the exact time to the people, the exact time is broadcast over the state–owned [[All India Radio]] and [[Doordarshan]] television network. Telephone companies have dedicated phone numbers connected to [[mirror website|mirror]] [[time server]]s that also relay the precise time. Another increasingly popular means of obtaining the time is through [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=19703 |title=Satellites for Navigation |accessdate=2006-11-25 |work=Press Information Bureau, Government of India}}</ref>
