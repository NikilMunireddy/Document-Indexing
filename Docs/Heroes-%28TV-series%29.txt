Originally, Kring designed the series to have an ever-shifting cast. However, his motivation changed when he realized how popular the original cast was with audiences; therefore, he brought back most of the first season cast for the second season, with a few additions who received star [[billing (film)|billing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/gossip/kristin/detail/index.jsp?uuid=eaa80101-98f1-4d9c-8b36-5d22db15296c|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611043645/http://www.eonline.com/gossip/kristin/detail/index.jsp?uuid=eaa80101-98f1-4d9c-8b36-5d22db15296c|archivedate=June 11, 2008 |title=Celebrity News, Celeb Gossip&nbsp;– E!

[[File:Cristine Rose 2009.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|left|[[Cristine Rose]] joined the main cast in season two]]

During the first two seasons, some characters were written out to make room for new characters with new stories. In season one [[Claude (Heroes)|Claude]] portrayed by [[Christopher Eccleston]] who had the power of invisibility was instrumental in helping Peter understand his powers  throwing him off a building to try to help him fly but he discovered he healed instead. [[Simone Deveaux]] was the first major character to be written out, dying near the end of season one. DL became a guest star after the events of the first season's finale, making two appearances throughout season two. Isaac Mendez was also written out, dying at the hands of [[Sylar]], which was shown during Hiro Nakamura's time traveling expedition to New York earlier in season one. New characters added during season two include: [[Maya Herrera]], played by [[Dania Ramirez]], a fugitive with the ability to emit a deadly poison; [[Adam Monroe]], a 400-year-old Englishman also known as  Takezo Kensei with the ability to regenerate, portrayed by [[David Anders]]; [[Monica Dawson]], portrayed by [[Dana Davis]], a restaurant worker with the ability to mimic physical movements she sees; and [[Elle Bishop]], a sadistic [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] with the ability to generate electricity, portrayed by [[Kristen Bell]]. Two recurring characters from season one, [[Sylar]], portrayed by [[Zachary Quinto]], and [[Ando Masahashi]], portrayed by [[James Kyson Lee]], were upgraded to main characters in season two.

Starting in the season three episode "I Am Become Death", the character [[Mohinder Suresh]] develops abilities of super strength which at first seems to be okay. Later however he develops an adverse reaction turning him into a monster. He wraps up people in a cocoon of sorts and puts them on the walls. This is later remedied after the perfected formula splashes on him removing the rash and aggression.

Starting in season two, recurring character [[Angela Petrelli]], portrayed by [[Cristine Rose]], was promoted to a main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbcumv.com/entertainment/storylines.nbc/heroes.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gWo5yBiQ|archivedate=May 4, 2009 |title=NBC Universal Media Village |publisher=Nbcumv.com |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref> Elle, Adam, and Micah were removed from the main cast.

===Synopsis===
[[Image:Cast of Heroes.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Heroes'' at ComicCon 2008. (Masi Oka and Jack Coleman not pictured.)]]
The plot of ''Heroes'' is designed to be told in a way similar to the way comic books are told. Each season of ''Heroes'' contains one or two "volumes". There are several main story lines in each volume. As the main plots develop, smaller, more intimate stories are told within them. Each main character's story is developed separately and as time passes their paths cross and it is explained how their stories are intertwined and connected. This is the story of ordinary people who discover extraordinary super powers after a solar eclipse reveals them, and how these abilities affect the characters' daily lives.

The [[List of Heroes episodes#Season 1 (2006–07)|first season]], known as "Volume One: Genesis", begins with a seemingly ordinary group of people who gradually become aware that they have special abilities. The story develops showing their reactions to these powers, and how this discovery affects their personal and professional lives. At the same time, several ordinary individuals are investigating the origins and extent of these abilities. Mohinder Suresh ([[Sendhil Ramamurthy]]), a research geneticist, continues his late father's research into the biological source of the powers, while Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman) represents, and is a lead agent for, a secret organization known only as "[[Company (Heroes)|the Company]]" that wants to control and, if necessary, terminate those who are gifted. After only having a short time to come to terms with their new abilities, each of the heroes is drawn into the final showdown. They must each do their part to stop the destruction of the world that starts with an impending explosion at Kirby Plaza in New York City.

[[List of Heroes episodes#Season 2 (2007)|Season two]], known as "Volume Two: Generations",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/heroes-generations-finale/071204-01 |title=Exclusive: Tim Kring Explains Heroes' "Generations" Finale |last=Logan |first=Michael |date=December 4, 2007 |publisher=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906221929/http://www.tvguide.com/news/heroes-generations-finale/071204-01 |archivedate=2008-09-06}}</ref> begins four months after the events at Kirby Plaza. The main plot of ''Generations'' deals with the Company and its research on the [[Shanti virus]]. In a flashback to 1977, the research is performed by the Company's founders, whose identities are eventually revealed, to discover what the effects of various strains of the virus will do to the human and superhuman population. The virus is weaponized and locked away at Primatech Paper, the Company's facility used as a front. Returning to the present, the heroes must come together in an attempt to stop the release of a deadly strain of the virus and avert a global [[pandemic]].

The first part of [[List of Heroes episodes#Season 3 (2008–09)|season three]] is called "Volume Three: Villains". Volume three begins with an assassination attempt on Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar), a political figure who can fly, and explores its consequences. Meanwhile, several villains escape from the confines of Level 5, a maximum security area owned and operated by the Company within Primatech, and Noah Bennet attempts to recapture them. [[Arthur Petrelli]] ([[Robert Forster]]), Nathan Petrelli's father, heals from systemic nerve damage and aims to create a formula to give ordinary people superhuman abilities. The second part of season three, "Volume Four: Fugitives", reveals what happens after Nathan fails to produce the formula. After the destruction of [[Primatech]] and Pinehearst, the rival company of Primatech, the heroes attempt to lead normal lives until Nathan initiates his plan to round up all people with abilities. Sylar kills Nathan in an intense duel. However, because Nathan is a prominent political player, Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg), who has power over people's minds, is instructed to alter Sylar's mind so that he will believe that he is Nathan and take his place. This has a negative side effect causing Sylar's consciousness to become trapped in Matt Parkman's mind.

[[Heroes (season 4)|Season four]] contains volume five, "Redemption", and takes place six weeks after the events of season three. The heroes try to return to their normal lives; Peter returns to his job as a paramedic, while Claire attends college. Sylar's body is causing his previously acquired abilities to manifest as he struggles with his forced identity as Nathan. Sylar's actual consciousness, trapped in Matt Parkman's mind, taunts Matt and seeks out his own body. Meanwhile, Hiro has to deal with his [[brain tumor]] that is slowly killing him and preventing him from controlling his powers. A carnival group is introduced whose leader, Samuel, tries to recruit more people with abilities into his carnival family. Samuel claims he is creating a community for special people where they are welcome to be open with their abilities and respected by outsiders. In truth, he is bringing together as many people with abilities as possible to build up his own power, moving earth. The more special people he has around him, the stronger his power. The heroes have to come together to battle Samuel and his plan to expose "specials" to the world by killing thousands of people. The series finale ends by opening the nonexistent volume six, "Brave New World", in which Claire reveals the existence of people with special abilities to a group of reporters and photographers.
And the series ends like it started with Claire Bennett stating after she jumped to kill her self "my name is Claire Bennett, and that was attempt one"

==Production==

===Conception===
''Heroes'' began development early in 2006, when [[Tim Kring]], creator of NBC's ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', came up with the show's concept. Kring wanted to create a "large [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] saga" that would connect with the audience. He began thinking about how big, scary and complicated he felt the world is, and wanted to create a character-driven series about people who could do something about it. Kring felt that a cop or medical drama did not have characters that were big enough to save the world. He came up with the thought of [[superheroes]]; ordinary people who would discover extraordinary abilities, while still rooted in the real world and in reality. Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart brought forth a cast of new faces such as [[Milo Ventimiglia]] who described the pilot as a "character drama about everyday people with a heightened reality." Said heightened reality was brought to light through the work of production designer Ruth Ammon. Kring wanted the series to have touchstones that involved the characters and the world they lived in.<ref name="Kring-imdb">{{cite video|people= Kring, Tim (creator) |date=August 28, 2008 |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813715/ |format=DVD |title=(Unknown episode) |medium=Season one episodes |publisher= NBC Universal Media|accessdate=January 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nbc.com/heroes/2006/09/why_i_wanted_to_do_a_show_like.php |title=''Heroes'' Live Blog: Why I wanted to do a show like ''Heroes'' |first=Tim |last=Kring |authorlink=Tim Kring |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |publisher=NBC}}</ref>

Before he began putting his ideas together, he spoke with ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' executive producer Damon Lindelof, with whom he had worked for three years on ''Crossing Jordan''. Kring credits Lindelof for giving him ideas on how to pitch the series to the network and advice on the lessons he (Lindelof) learned about working on a [[Serial (radio and television)|serialized drama]]. The two still speak and support each other's projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nbc.com/heroes/2006/09/friends_with_the_creator_of_lo.php |title=''Heroes'' Live Blog: Friends with the creator of LOST |first=Tim |last=Kring |authorlink=Tim Kring |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |publisher=NBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/interviews/jeph_loeb.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213112206/http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/interviews/jeph_loeb.shtml|archivedate=February 13, 2008 |title=Interview with Jef Loeb |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |publisher=NBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2007/03/04/its_all_connected/?page=2 |title=''Heroes'' conspiracy theory isn't ''Lost'' on series' fans&nbsp;– The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date=March 4, 2007 |accessdate=May 27, 2009 | first1=Joanna | last1=Weiss}}</ref> When Kring pitched the idea for ''Heroes'' to the NBC network, he described the network's reaction as "excited...very supportive."<ref name="NBCblog-pitch">{{cite web|url=http://blog.nbc.com/heroes/2006/09/the_pitch_process_to_nbc.php |title=''Heroes'' Live Blog: The Pitch Process to NBC |first=Tim |last=Kring |authorlink=Tim Kring |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |publisher=NBC}}</ref> He comments that he has been partners with NBC for some time based on his six-year run as [[showrunner]] for ''Crossing Jordan''.<ref name="NBCblog-pitch" /> When he pitched the pilot, he described every detail, including the [[cliffhanger|cliffhanger ending]].

===Writing===
[[File:New Loeb Photograph.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|Comic writer [[Jeph Loeb]] helped define the tone of the series]]
When the writing team worked on an episode, each writer took a character and wrote the individual scenes surrounding them. These stories were then combined and given to the episode writer. This system allowed every writer to contribute to every episode,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=8738 |title=Reflections: Talking with Bryan Fuller |accessdate=November 1, 2006 |last=Taylor |first=Robert |date=October 26, 2006 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> and enabled the writing team to finish scripts sooner, so the filming crew could shoot more scenes at a location.<ref name="ogmog" /> Tim Kring described the writing process as a collaborative one and stated that the collaboration process was important because production needed to shoot several scenes at a single location.

[[Claude (Heroes)|Claude]]'s theme involved wind and voices to create the feeling of a ghost-like presence. [[Sylar]]'s involves [[marimba]]s and [[bassoon]]s with [[staccato]] to re-create the sound of clocks ticking in reference to the character's power. [[Matt Parkman]]'s theme involves voices being played backwards when he uses his power of [[telepathy]]. [[Peter Petrelli]]'s theme involves [[marcato]] strings. [[Niki Sanders]]'s theme was based on her character's alter-ego named Jessica and involved winds and Indian voices chanting in an underscore to give a feeling that she was possessed. [[Mohinder Suresh]]'s theme is the piano composition that plays at the end of some episodes.<ref name="beeman's music blog" />

==Mythology==
{{Main|Mythology of Heroes}}

''Heroes'' includes some mysterious fictional recurring elements that have been ascribed to science fiction or [[supernatural]] phenomena. Tim Kring and the creators of the series referred to these fictional elements as part of the [[mythology]] of the series. Kring confirmed that although the show has a unique mythology, he did not want to sink too deeply into it. Rather, Kring used volumes to wrap up ongoing plot lines instead of carrying storylines over long periods of time as in ''Lost''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2007/04/magkring |title=Santiago Cabera: Heroes Artistic Hero |accessdate=February 3, 2008 |last=Kushner |first=David |date=April 23, 2007 |publisher=[[Wired News]]}}</ref> Among the show's mythological elements are the [[The Company (Heroes)|Company]], the legend of Takezo Kensei, paintings of the future, superpowers and their origins, the Shanti virus, ''9th Wonders!'' comic book, and numerous other elements and mythological themes.

===Critical reception===
During the series' first season, the [[American Film Institute]] named ''Heroes'' one of the ten "best television programs of the year."<ref>{{cite press release|title=AFI Awards 2006 Official Selections Announced |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date=December 10, 2006 |format=PDF |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2006/awards06.pdf |accessdate=December 11, 2006}}</ref>
Doug Elfman of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] stated, "the show's super strengths are its well-developed filmmaking, smooth pacing and a perfect cast. It views like the first hour of a fun, thoughtful movie." Barry Garron at ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also stated, "''Heroes'' is one of TV's most imaginative creations and might, with luck, become this year's ''Lost''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003156041|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212155757/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003156041|archivedate=February 12, 2007 |title=Heroes |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date= |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref> Less favorable reviews included the ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', who commented that although the show had lots of "cool effects," it "lands, splat, in a pile of nonsense and dim dialogue." In response to the first pod of season one episodes, The ''Chicago Tribune'' went as far as saying, "you could watch the first few episodes of ''Heroes'', or you could repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/09/like_pain_heres.html |title=The Watcher&nbsp;– All TV, all the time &#124; Chicago Tribune &#124; Blog |publisher=Featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com |date= September 22, 2006|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], the ''Heroes'' pilot received a 67/100, with generally favorable reviews from critics.<ref name="metacritic-heores">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/heroes?q=heroes |title=Heroes (NBC)&nbsp;– Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=March 28, 2008}}</ref> The show was declared the fourth highest rated show for the first ten years of [[IMDb.com]] Pro (2002–2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brad-pitt-johnny-depp-dark-knight-lost-imdb-top-10-284912|title=Johnny Depp, 'The Dark Knight,' 'Lost' Named to IMDb's Top 10 of the Last Decade|accessdate=February 10, 2012|date=January 25, 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|author=Schillaci, Sophie A.}}</ref>

Season two was criticized by commentators and fans for a much slower pace, less engaging storyline and lack of focus compared to the first season. [[Milo Ventimiglia]] stated that "when there's a little bit of a delay, there's not that instant, rewarding scene or moment or episode... people get impatient, so it has been extremely important for them to strike a balance between giving and getting."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/heroes/ventimiglia-exerts-best-effort-15101.aspx |title=Ventimiglia Exerts "Best Efforts" When Working on ''Heroes'' |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=December 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''Heroes'' creator Tim Kring commented on criticisms of season two, and the series' 15% decline in ratings.<ref name="EWApology">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20158840,00.html |title=''Heroes'' Creator Apologizes to Fans |accessdate=November 16, 2007 |last=Jensen |first=Jeff |date=November 7, 2007 |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Kring said that he felt he had made mistakes with the direction of season two. He had thought that the audience was looking for a "build-up of characters and the discovery of their powers", when viewers were instead looking for "adrenaline." Kring also outlined what he felt were problems with plot development, stating that season two "took too long to get to the big-picture story", explaining that Peter's vision of the viral [[armageddon]] should have occurred in the first episode instead of the seventh. He feels that it would have been better to introduce new characters within the context of the main storyline, as with [[Elle Bishop|Elle]], rather than in unattached arcs such as that of Maya and Alejandro. Kring also admitted that he should have resolved the "Hiro in Japan" storyline much more quickly, and that the romantic stories were not working well. With regard to Claire and West, and Hiro and Yaeko, he said, "I've seen more convincing romances on TV. In retrospect, I don't think romance is a natural fit for us."<ref name="EWApology" />

Seasons three and four had an equally harsh reception. ''Los Angeles Times'' said "Even just a half-hour in, it's difficult not to wish everyone would just lighten the heck up. The graphic novel noir feel is becoming increasingly oppressive, and everyone is just so grim."<ref name=meta>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/heroes/season-3 |title=Heroes&nbsp;— Season 3 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref> ''New York Post'' said "This show, which was once so thrilling and fun, has become full of itself, its characters spouting crazy nonsense."<ref name=meta/>
