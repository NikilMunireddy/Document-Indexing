'''County Dublin''' ({{lang-ga|Contae Bhaile Átha Cliath}}<ref>http://www.logainm.ie/pdf/10.09.23_BRAINSE.pdf</ref> or ''Contae Átha Cliath'') is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is conterminous with the [[Dublin Region]] and is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]]. It is named after the city of [[Dublin]], which is the regional capital and the [[capital city]] of Ireland. County Dublin was one of the first parts of Ireland to be [[shire]]d by [[John, King of England]] following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]].

Prior to 1994 County Dublin was also an administrative unit covering the whole county outside of [[Dublin City Council]]. In 1994 Dublin County Council was abolished and replaced with three separate administrative county councils: [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]].

The population of the county was 1,273,069 according to the census of 2011.<ref name=census2011>[http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=CD101&Planguage=0 CD101: Actual and Percentage Change in Population by Sex, Aggregate Town or Rural Area, Province County or City, CensusYear and Statistic], Central Statistics Office. Retrieved 6 Dec 2015</ref>

==Local government and politics==
There are four [[Local government|local authorities]] whose remit collectively encompasses the geographic area of the county and city of Dublin. These are [[Dublin City Council]], [[South Dublin County Council]], [[Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council]] and [[Fingal County Council]].

There is also Dublin Regional Authority which has authority over the while county but this body has few powers. It consists of 30 representatives who meet once per month.<ref name="IrishRegionOffice">[http://www.iro.ie/dublin_region.html Irish Region Office - Regions of Ireland: Dublin Region]</ref> These representatives are nominated from the four administrative councils of the region. Like each Regional Authority, it is assisted in its duties by an Operational Committee and EU Operational Committee.<ref name="IrishRegionOffice"/>

Prior to the [[Act of the Oireachtas|enactment]] of the [[Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993]], the county was a unified whole even though it was administered by two [[Local authority|local authorities]] - [[Dublin County Council]] and [[Dublin Corporation]]. Since the enactment of the [[Local Government Act 2001]] in particular, the geographic area of the county has been divided between three entities at the level of "county" and a further entity at the level of "city". They rank equally as first level [[local administrative unit]]s of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] Dublin Region for [[Eurostat]] purposes. There are 34 [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities in the Republic of Ireland. Each [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] is responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] such as [[sanitation]], [[planning]] and [[Real estate development|development]], [[library|libraries]], the collection of [[automobile|motor]] [[tax]]ation, local [[road]]s and [[social housing]].

The county is part of the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]] constituency for the purposes of [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]]. For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the area of the county is currently (2016) divided into eleven constituencies: [[Dublin Bay North (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Bay North]], [[Dublin Bay South (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Bay South]], [[Dublin Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Central]], [[Dublin Fingal (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Fingal]], [[Dublin Mid-West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Mid-West]], [[Dublin North-West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin North-West]], [[Dublin Rathdown (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin Rathdown]], [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South-Central]], [[Dublin South-West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South-West]], [[Dublin West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin West]], and [[Dún Laoghaire (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dún Laoghaire]]. Together they return 44 deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil.

===Dublin Region===
[[File:Ireland location map Dublin region.svg|thumb|alt=|The Dublin region of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] with each constituent county/city council highlighted.]]
The '''Dublin Region''' is a [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] Level III [[List of regions of the Republic of Ireland|region]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The region is one of eight regions of the Republic of Ireland for the purposes of [[Eurostat]] statistics. Its NUTS code is IE021. It is co-extensive with the old county. The regional capital is [[Dublin|Dublin City]] which is also the national capital.<ref name="IrishRegionOffice"/>

===Dissolution of Dublin County Council===
[[File:KILLINEY-147 (1424762996).jpg|left|240px|thumbnail|View of Killiney Bay from [[Killiney Hill]]]]

Dublin County Council (which did not include the [[county borough]] of Dublin) was abolished in 1994 and the area divided among the administrative counties of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]] each with its [[county town|county seat]]. To these areas may be added the area of Dublin city which collectively comprise the Dublin Region<ref name="r1">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI394Y1993.html|title=Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993|accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref> (''{{lang|ga|Réigiúin Átha Cliath}}'') and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority.

The area lost its administrative [[county]] status in 1994, with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ''Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993'' stating that "the county shall cease to exist."<ref>[[Act of the Oireachtas]]: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sec9 Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 (Section 9 Part 1(a))]</ref><ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sec2 Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 Section 2] specifies: ''"the county", in relation to any time before the establishment day, means the administrative county of Dublin.''</ref> In discussing the legislation to dissolve Dublin County Council, [[Avril Doyle]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] said, "The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin, and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin. I am not sure whether Dubliners realise that that is what we are about today, but in effect that is the case."<ref>[[Dáil Éireann]]: [http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0435/D.0435.199311030007.html Parliamentary Debates (3 November 1993)]</ref>

Despite the legal status of the Dublin Region, the term "County Dublin" is still in common usage. Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a "County Dublin" or "Dublin Region" basis. The area formerly known as "County Dublin" is now defined in legislation solely as the "Dublin Region" under the ''Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993'',<ref name="r1" /> and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area. The term ''[[Greater Dublin Area]]'', which might consist of some or all of the Dublin Region along with counties of [[County Kildare|Kildare]], [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], has no legal standing.

The latest [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] "Discovery Series" (Third Edition 2005) 1:50,000 map of the Dublin Region, Sheet 50, shows the boundaries of the city and three surrounding counties of the region. Extremities of the Dublin Region, in the north and south of the region, appear in other sheets of the series, 43 and 56 respectively.

==Economy==
The economy of County Dublin was identified as being the powerhouse behind the [[Celtic Tiger]], a period of strong economic growth of the state. This resulted in the economy of the county expanding by almost 100% between the early 1990s and 2007. This growth resulted from incoming high-value industries, such as financial services and [[software manufacturing]], as well as low-skilled retail and domestic services, which caused a shift away from older manufacturing-industry.<ref name="IrishRegionOffice"/> This change saw high unemployment in the 1980s and early 1990s which resulted in damage to the capitals social structure.<ref name="IrishRegionOffice"/>

<ref>http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do</ref> According to Eurostat figures for 2012, the region has GDP of €72.384 bn and a GDP per capita of €57,200 the highest on the island of Ireland (the second highest is Cork with €48,500)

==Transport==

It is also served by two main seaports, Dún Laoghaire port and [[Dublin Port]], which is just located outside of the city center.  The two main train stations are [[Dublin Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly]], both of which serve intercity trains.

==Demographics==
