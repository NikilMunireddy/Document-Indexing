The '''American Mathematical Society''' ('''AMS''') is an association of professional [[mathematician]]s dedicated to the interests of [[mathematics|mathematical]] research and scholarship, and serves the national and international community through its publications, meetings, advocacy and other programs.

The society is one of the four parts of the [[Joint Policy Board for Mathematics]] (JPBM) and a member of the [[Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences]] (CBMS).

==History==
It was founded in 1888 as the ''New York Mathematical Society'', the brainchild of [[Thomas Fiske]], who was impressed by the ''[[London Mathematical Society]]'' on a visit to England.  [[John Howard Van Amringe]] was the first president and Fiske became secretary.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Archibald, Raymond Clare|authorlink=Raymond Clare Archibald|title=History of the American Mathematical Society, 1888-1938|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1939|volume=45|issue=1|pages=31–46|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183501056|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1939-06908-5}}</ref>  The society soon decided to publish a journal, but ran into some resistance, due to concerns about competing with the [[American Journal of Mathematics]].  The result was the ''[[Bulletin of the New York Mathematical Society]]'', with Fiske as editor-in-chief.  The de facto journal, as intended, was influential in increasing membership. The popularity of the ''Bulletin'' soon led to [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] and [[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]], which were also ''de facto'' journals. 

In 1891 [[Charlotte Scott]] became the first woman to join the society. The society reorganized under its present name and became a national society in 1894, and that year Scott served as the first woman on the first Council of the American Mathematical Society. 

In 1951, the society's headquarters moved from [[New York City]] to [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The society later added an office in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 1984 and an office in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1992. 

In 1954 the society called for the creation of a new teaching degree, a Doctor of Arts in Mathematics, similar to a PhD but without a research thesis.<ref>[https://books.google.com/?id=8TgLAAAAIAAJ&q=%22American+Mathematical+Society%22+%22new+degree%22&dq=%22American+Mathematical+Society%22+%22new+degree%22&pgis=1 Journal of Proceedings and Addresses of the Annual Conference] 1960. Association of Graduate Schools</ref> 

In the 1970s, as reported in "A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents' Perspectives", by [[Lenore Blum]], "In those years the AMS [American Mathematical Society] was governed by what could only be called an 'old boys network,' closed to all but those in the inner circle." [[Mary W. Gray]] challenged that situation by "sitting in on the Council meeting in Atlantic City. When she was told she had to leave, she refused saying she would wait until the police came. (Mary relates the story somewhat differently: When she was told she had to leave, she responded she could find no rules in the by-laws restricting attendance at Council meetings. She was then told it was by 'gentlemen's agreement.' Naturally Mary replied 'Well, obviously I'm no gentleman.') After that time, Council meetings were open to observers and the process of democratization of the Society had begun." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm-math.org/articles/notices/199107/blum/node2.html#SECTION02010000000000000000 |title=A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics (from Notices): How it was |publisher=Awm-math.org |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2015}}</ref> 

[[Julia Robinson]] was the first female president of the American Mathematical Society (1983–1984) but was unable to complete her term as she was suffering from leukemia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Julia_Bowman_Robinson.aspx |title=Julia Bowman Robinson |website=Encyclopedia.com}}</ref> 

In 1988 the [[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]] was created, with the intent of being the flagship journal of the AMS.

==Meetings==

The AMS, along with the [[Mathematical Association of America]] and other organizations, holds the largest annual research mathematics meeting in the world, the [[Joint Mathematics Meeting]] held in early January.  The 2013 Joint Mathematics Meeting in San Diego drew over 6,600 attendees.  Each of the four regional sections of the AMS (Central, Eastern, Southeastern and Western) hold meetings in the spring and fall of each year.  The society also co-sponsors meetings with other international mathematical societies.

== Fellows ==

The AMS selects an annual class of Fellows who have made outstanding contributions to the advancement of mathematics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/profession/ams-fellows/ams-fellows|title=Fellows of the American Mathematical Society|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>

==Publications==

The AMS publishes [[Mathematical Reviews]], a database of reviews of mathematical publications, various journals, and books.  In 1997 the AMS acquired the [[Chelsea Publishing Company]], which it continues to use as an imprint.

==Prizes==

Some prizes are awarded jointly with other mathematical organizations.  See specific articles for details.

*[[Bôcher Memorial Prize]]
*[[Cole Prize]]
*[[David P. Robbins Prize]]
*[[Frank and Brennie Morgan Prize for Outstanding Research in Mathematics by an Undergraduate Student]]

==Typesetting==

The AMS was an early advocate of the typesetting program [[TeX]], requiring that contributions be written in it and producing its own packages [[AMS-TeX]] and [[AMS-LaTeX]].  TeX and LaTeX are now ubiquitous in mathematical publishing.

==Presidents==
The AMS is led by the President, who is elected for a two-year term, and cannot serve for two consecutive terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/secretary/bylaws.html|title=Bylaws (as amended December 2003)|work=American Mathematical Society}}</ref>
