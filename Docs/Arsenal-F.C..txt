'''Arsenal Football Club ''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Holloway, London]], that plays in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of English football. The club [[Football records in England#Total titles won .281871.E2.80.93present.29|has won]] 12 [[FA Cup]]s, a joint-record, 13 [[List of English football champions#Total titles won|League titles]], two [[Football League Cup|League Cups]], 14 [[FA Community Shield]]s, and one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]].

Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join [[The Football League]], in 1893. They entered the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1904, and have since accumulated the second most points.<ref name="All Time Table">{{cite web|title=English Premier League : Full All Time Table|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/all-time-table/full|website=statto.com|accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref> Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division.<ref name="RSSSF Div Movements">{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=James|last2=Heneghan|first2=Michael|last3=Orford|first3=Stuart|last4=Culliton|first4=Eoin|title=English Clubs Divisional Movements 1888-2015|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=13 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329230545/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|archivedate=29 Mar 2016|date=8 October 2015}}</ref> In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]], they won their first [[Double (association football)#England|League and FA Cup Double]]. Between 1988 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles.

[[Herbert Chapman]] won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely. The [[Formation (association football)#WM|WM formation]], [[Floodlight#Association football|floodlights]], and [[Squad number (association football)#First use of numbers|shirt numbers]] have all been attributed to him.<ref name="Herbert Chapman Hall of Fame">{{cite web|title=Herbert Chapman|url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/herbert-chapman|publisher=National Football Museum|accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref> He added the white sleeves and brighter red to Arsenal's kit. [[Arsène Wenger]] has served the longest and won the most trophies. His teams set several English records: the longest win streak; the longest unbeaten run; and [[2003–04 Arsenal F.C. season|the only]] 38 match season [[The Invincibles (football)|unbeaten]].

In 1886, [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich munitions]] workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]]. They became [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s nearest club, commencing the [[North London derby]]. In 2006, they moved to the [[Emirates Stadium]] in nearby Holloway.

The club's relative geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they were taken over by businessmen [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] and William Hall.<ref>{{cite book |last=Soar & Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | pages=32–33 }}</ref> Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], north London; they dropped "Woolwich" from their name the following year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Soar & Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | page=40 }}</ref> Arsenal only finished in fifth place in the second division during the last pre-war competitive season of 1914–15, but were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division when competitive football resumed in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Some books have reported that this election to division 1 was achieved by dubious means.<ref>It has been alleged that Arsenal's promotion, on historical grounds rather than merit, was thanks to underhand actions by Norris, who was chairman of the club at the time; see [[History of Arsenal F.C.

Arsenal appointed [[Herbert Chapman]] as manager in 1925. Having already won the league twice with [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in [[1923–24 Football League|1923–24]] and [[1924–25 Football League|1924–25]] (see [[Football in England#Seasons in English football|Seasons in English football]]), Chapman brought Arsenal their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings of star players such as [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] and [[Cliff Bastin]], laid the foundations of the club's domination of English football in the 1930s.<ref name="Herbert Chapman Hall of Fame" /><ref>{{cite book | last=Soar & Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | page=18 }}</ref> Under his guidance Arsenal won their first major trophies&nbsp;– victory in the [[1930 FA Cup Final]] preceded two League Championships, in [[1930–31 Football League|1930–31]] and [[1932–33 Football League|1932–33]]. In addition, Chapman was behind the 1932 renaming of the local [[London Underground]] station from "Gillespie Road" to "[[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal]]", making it the only Tube station to be named specifically after a football club.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3709.html | archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20111112051537/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3709.html | archivedate=12 November 2011 | title=London Underground and Arsenal present The Final Salute to Highbury | publisher=Transport for London | date=12 January 2006 | accessdate=12 August 2011 }}</ref>

[[File:Arsenal FC Football and Premier League performance.PNG|thumb|right|Chart showing the progress of Arsenal's league finishes since the 1893–94 season]]

Chapman died suddenly of [[pneumonia]] in early 1934, leaving [[Joe Shaw (footballer born 1883)|Joe Shaw]] and [[George Allison]] to carry on his successful work. Under their guidance, Arsenal won three more titles, in [[1933–34 Football League|1933–34]], [[1934–35 Football League|1934–35]] and [[1937–38 Football League|1937–38]], and the [[1935–36 FA Cup|1936 FA Cup]] while also becoming known as the "[[Bank of England club]]." As key players retired, Arsenal had started to fade by the decade's end, and then the intervention of the Second World War meant competitive professional football in England was suspended.<ref>{{cite web

After the war, Arsenal enjoyed a second period of success under Allison's successor [[Tom Whittaker (footballer)|Tom Whittaker]], winning the league in [[1947–48 Football League|1947–48]] and [[1952–53 Football League|1952–53]], and the FA Cup in [[1949–50 FA Cup|1950]]. Their fortunes waned thereafter; unable to attract players of the same calibre as they had in the 1930s, the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in trophyless mediocrity. Even former [[England national football team|England]] captain [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.<ref name=FCHD/><ref>{{cite web

Arsenal began winning silverware again with the surprise appointment of club [[physiotherapist]] [[Bertie Mee]] as manager in 1966. After losing two [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] finals, they won their first European trophy, the [[1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. This was followed by an even greater triumph: their first [[1970–71 Football League|League]] and [[1970–71 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] in [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]].<ref>{{cite web

[[Terry Neill]] was recruited by the Arsenal board to replace [[Bertie Mee]] on 9 July 1976 and at the age of 34 he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like [[Malcolm Macdonald]] and [[Pat Jennings]], and a crop of talent in the side such as [[Liam Brady]] and [[Frank Stapleton]], the club enjoyed their best form since the 1971 double, reaching a trio of FA Cup finals ([[1977–78 FA Cup|1978]], [[1978–79 FA Cup|1979]] and [[1979–80 FA Cup|1980]]), and losing the [[1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]] on [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]]. The club's only success during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the [[1979 FA Cup Final]], widely regarded as a classic.<ref name=FCHD>{{cite web

The return of former player [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory.

The club's success in the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century owed a great deal to the 1996 appointment of [[Arsène Wenger]] as manager. Wenger brought new tactics, a new training regime and several foreign players who complemented the existing English talent. Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in [[1997–98 Arsenal F.C. season|1997–98]] and a third in [[2001–02 Arsenal F.C. season|2001–02]]. In addition, the club reached the final of the [[1999–2000 UEFA Cup]] (losing on penalties to [[Galatasaray S.K.

==Crest==
[[File:Arsenal crest 1888.png|thumb|right|Arsenal's first crest from 1888]]

Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first [[crest (sports)|crest]] featured three [[cannon]] viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]] (nowadays transferred to the [[coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich]]). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannon.<ref name="crest">{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest | title=The Crest | publisher=Arsenal F.C | accessdate=11 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080812085724/http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest| archivedate= 12 August 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.<ref name="crest"/>

In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club's name, set in [[blackletter]], and above the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted Latin [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit''  "victory comes from harmony", coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer.<ref name="crest"/> For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to [[copyright]] it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold "unofficial" Arsenal merchandise,<ref>{{cite web

Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a [[monogram]] of the club's initials in red on a white background.<ref name="shirt badge">{{cite web

The monogram theme was developed into an [[Art Deco]]-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.<ref name="artdeco">{{cite web

In the 2011–12 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all white, surrounded by 15 [[oak]] leaves to the right and 15 [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto "Forward" at the bottom of the crest.<ref name="125th anniversary crest">{{cite web

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.<ref name="soartyler23"/> The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Arsenal home kit|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/the-arsenal-kit|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="historicalkits">{{cite web

In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist [[Tom Webster (cartoonist)|Tom Webster]], with whom Chapman played golf.<ref name="kitdesign">{{cite web

Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;<ref name="historicalkits" /> this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.<ref name="kitdesign"/> In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.<ref name="historicalkits" />

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;<ref name="kitdesign"/> in 1938, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.<ref>{{cite web

For many years Arsenal's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the [[1971 FA Cup Final]] as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the [[Double (association football)|double]] for the first time in their history.<ref name=cupfinal>{{cite news|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/index.html|title=FA Cup Finals|accessdate=4 October 2013|work=Historical Football Kits}}</ref> Arsenal reached the [[1972 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between [[1978 FA Cup Final|1978]] and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]] wearing their "lucky" yellow and blue strip,<ref name=cupfinal/> which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.

When [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Adidas]] as Arsenal's kit provider in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web

==Stadiums==
{{Main|Emirates Stadium}}
[[File:Manor Ground, Woolwich Arsenal vs. Everton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manor Ground (Plumstead)|Manor Ground]], Woolwich Arsenal vs. [[Everton F.C.]]]]
For most of their time in south-east London, Arsenal played at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], apart from a three-year period at the nearby [[Invicta Ground]] between 1890 and 1893. The Manor Ground was initially just a field, until the club installed stands and [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]] for their first Football League match in September 1893. They played their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.<ref>{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=16–17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Suspension of the Plumstead Ground |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 1895 |page=6}}</ref>

Widely referred to as Highbury, [[Arsenal Stadium]] was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.<ref name="conservation_plan">{{cite web | url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/DownloadableDocuments/Environment/Pdf/highburyconservationplan_2005.pdf

Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|right|The North Bank Stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]|alt=A grandstand at a sports stadium. The seats are predominantly red.]]
Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]] and the other three stands were close to residential properties.<ref name="conservation_plan"/> These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.<ref>{{cite news

[[File:Arsenal Flag (7100433493).jpg|thumb|Arsenal supporters]]
Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Gunflash'' and the satirical ''Up The Arse!''.
