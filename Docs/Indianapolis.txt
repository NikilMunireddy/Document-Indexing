{{Main|History of Indianapolis|Timeline of Indianapolis}}

===Founding and early years===
In 1816, the year Indiana gained statehood, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] donated four sections of federal land to establish a permanent seat of state government.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

The availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American setters were [[Protestantism|Protestants]], a large proportion of the early [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Germans|German]] immigrants were [[Catholicism|Catholics]]. Few [[African American]]s lived in central Indiana before 1840.<ref>Baer, p. 10 and 58.</ref>  The first [[European American]]s to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the town's first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe [[George Pogue]] and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later called [[Pogue's Run]]. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 that [[John Wesley McCormick]], his family, and employees became the first European American settlers in area, settling near the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] in February 1820.<ref>Brown, p. 2; ''Centennial History of Indianapolis'', p. 6; and Hale, p. 8.</ref>
[[File:Indianapolis in 1831.png|thumb|left|Map of Indianapolis in 1831.]]

Indianapolis became a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, when [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]], was established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832, when Indianapolis incorporated as a town. Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847. [[Samuel Henderson (Indianapolis mayor)|Samuel Henderson]], the city's first mayor, lead the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council.

R. Holloway|title=Indianapolis: A Historical and Statistical Sketch of the Railroad City, A Chronicle of its Social, Municipal, Commercial and Manufacturing Progress with Full Statistical Tables|publisher=Indianapolis Journal|year=1870|location=Indianapolis}}</ref>

The city became a fixture on the first major federally funded highway in the U.S., the [[National Road]].<ref name=Hyman34-Baer11/> The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, the [[Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad|Madison and Indianapolis]], began operation on October 1, 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth. Indianapolis was the home of the country's first [[Union Station (Indianapolis)|Union Station]], or common rail passenger terminal.

During the [[American Civil War]], Indianapolis was loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause. [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Oliver P.

[[File:Monument Circle, Indianapolis, 1907.jpg|thumb|The [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (Indianapolis)|Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument]], built from 1888 to 1901.]]
Following the Civil War, Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity, much attributed to the [[Indiana gas boom]]. Renowned Indianapolis author [[Booth Tarkington]] captured the change in his 1899 novel, ''[[The Gentleman from Indiana]]'':

<blockquote>
Like hundreds of others throughout the country, this town, too, moved forward with the times, its old stock becoming less and less typical, and newcomers with energy and business acumen taking their places of community leadership. In the offspring of German, Jewish, Irish, Italian, and other settlers 'a new Midlander—in fact, a new American—was beginning dimly to emerge.' To this new spirit of citizenship the magnificent Ambersons, reared in luxury, were unable to adapt themselves. Others, with a heritage of labor, rapidly took high places as the town progressed from village to market town to a manufacturing city.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Eva Draegert|title=Cultural History of Indianapolis: Literature, 1875–1890: II|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=52|issue=4|pages=343–367|publisher=Indiana University Department of History|location=Bloomington|year=1956|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/8439/10591|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref>

With roads leading out of the city in all directions, the city became a major hub of regional transport, connecting to booming manufacturing centers like [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Detroit]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].

Amid the changes in government and growth, the city invested in an aggressive strategy to brand Indianapolis as a [[sport tourism]] destination.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Indianapolis|List of mayors of Indianapolis}}
[[File:Indiana State House 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Indiana Statehouse]], seat of Indiana state government.]]
Indianapolis has a [[consolidated city-county]] government known as [[Unigov]], a status it has held since 1970. Under this system, many functions of the city and county governments are consolidated, though some remain separate. The city has a [[mayor-council]] form of government. The executive branch is headed by an elected mayor, who serves as the chief executive of both the city and Marion County. The current [[List of mayors of Indianapolis|Mayor of Indianapolis]] is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Joe Hogsett|Joseph H. Hogsett]]. The mayor appoints deputy mayors, department heads, and members of various boards and commissions. The legislative body for the city and county is the [[Indianapolis City-County Council|City-County Council]], consisting of 25 members all of whom represent geographic districts. The council passes ordinances for the city and county and also makes appointments to certain boards and commissions.

As the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]], Indianapolis is the seat of [[Government of Indiana|Indiana's state government]]. The [[Indiana Statehouse]], located downtown, houses the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government, including the office of the [[Governor of Indiana|governor]], [[Indiana General Assembly]], [[Indiana Court of Appeals]], and the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. Most of the state's bureaus are located in the [[Indiana Government Center North]]. The [[Indiana Governor's Residence]] is located on [[Meridian Street (Indianapolis)|Meridian Street]] in the [[Butler-Tarkington, Indianapolis|Butler-Tarkington]] neighborhood, about {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of downtown. The [[Birch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse]] houses the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana]].

Most of Indianapolis is within the [[Indiana's 7th congressional district|7th Congressional District of Indiana]], represented by Democrat [[André Carson]]. Northern portions of the city are in the [[Indiana's 5th congressional district|5th District]], represented by Republican [[Susan Brooks]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The National Atlas|url=http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/congress.html|publisher=nationalatlas.gov|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref>
[[File:Indianapolis tea party 2007.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tea Party protests]] in 2007. The city has a history of [[political conservatism]].<ref name="politics"/>]]
Until the late-1990s, Indianapolis was considered one of the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] metropolitan areas in the U.S., but this trend has reversed recently. Unigov's absorption of Republican-leaning townships outside the city proper is considered the reason for this shift.<ref name="politics"/> [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s held the majority in the [[Indianapolis City-County Council|City-County Council]] for 36 years and the mayor's office for 32 years (1967–1999).<ref name="politics"/> More recently, Republicans have generally been stronger in the southern and western parts of the county ([[Decatur Township, Marion County, Indiana|Decatur]], [[Franklin Township, Marion County, Indiana|Franklin]], [[Perry Township, Marion County, Indiana|Perry]], and [[Wayne Township, Marion County, Indiana|Wayne]], townships), whereas Democrats have been stronger in the central and northern parts of the county ([[Center Township, Marion County, Indiana|Center]], [[Pike Township, Marion County, Indiana|Pike]], and [[Washington Township, Marion County, Indiana|Washington]] townships).
