'''Destiny's Child''' was an [[People from the United States|American]] [[girl group]] whose final and best-known line-up comprised [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Kelly Rowland]], and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]]. Formed in 1990 in [[Houston]], Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical endeavors as Girl's Tyme comprising, among others,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504044/destinys-childs-long-road-fame.jhtml |title=Destiny’s Child’s Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn’t Called ‘Survivor’ For Nothing) |publisher=MTV |date=2005-06-13 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> Knowles, Rowland, [[LaTavia Roberson]] and [[LeToya Luckett]]. After years of limited success, they were signed in 1996 to [[Columbia Records]] as Destiny's Child. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the 1999 release of their best-selling second album, ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'', which contained the number-one singles "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]" and "[[Say My Name]]". Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager [[Mathew Knowles]], citing favoritism of Knowles and Rowland.

Both Roberson and Luckett were soon replaced with Williams and [[Farrah Franklin]]; however, in 2000, Franklin left, leaving the group as a [[trio (music)|trio]]. Their third album, ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', which contains themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits "[[Independent Women]]", "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]" and "[[Bootylicious]]". In 2002, they announced a hiatus and re-united two years later for the release of their fourth and final studio album, ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'' (2004). Destiny's Child has sold more than 60 million records worldwide to date.<ref>{{cite news|last=Waxman|first=Olivia|title=Beyoncé and Destiny's Child to Release Original Track for First Time in Eight Years|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/01/11/beyonce-and-destinys-child-to-release-original-track-for-first-time-in-eight-years/|publisher=time.com|accessdate=June 11, 2013|date=2013-01-11}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time,<ref>{{cite web |title=Billboard Greatest Trios of All Time |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/greatesttrios/2006/destinys_child.jsp |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=2008-05-13|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430084937/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/greatesttrios/2006/destinys_child.jsp |archivedate = April 30, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> the ninth most successful artist/band of the 2000s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/charts-decade-end/artists-of-the-decade?year=2009&begin=1&order=position|title=Best of the 2000s.

[[Kelly Rowland]], who relocated to Knowles's house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named '''Girl's Tyme''', they were eventually cut down to six members including [[Támar|Támar Davis]] and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor.<ref name="E!">{{Cite video |title=Beyonce: All New |work=E!

The group would test routines in the salon, when it was on Montrose Boulevard in Houston, and sometimes would collect tips from the customers. Their try out would be critiqued by the people inside. During their school days, Girl's Tyme performed at local gigs. When summer came, Mathew Knowles established a "boot camp" to train them in dance and vocal lessons.<ref name="DunnDate">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2001/jun/10/life1.lifemagazine5|title=Date with destiny|last=Dunn|first=Jancee|date=2001-06-10|work=The Observer|accessdate=2009-02-27 | location=London}}</ref> After rigorous training, they began performing as opening acts for established [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] groups of that time such as [[SWV]], [[Dru Hill]] and [[IMx|Immature]].<ref name="Kaufman"/> Tina Knowles designed the group's attire for their performances.<ref name="DunnDate"/>

===1998–2000: Breakthrough and lineup changes===

Destiny's Child released their self-titled debut album in the United States on February 17, 1998, featuring productions by [[Tim & Bob]], [[Rob Fusari]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Dwayne Wiggins]] and Corey Rooney.<ref name="Kaufman"/> ''[[Destiny's Child (album)|Destiny's Child]]'' peaked at number sixty-seven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number fourteen on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]].<ref name="BillAlbumChart">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=destiny's child|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History – Destiny's Child|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> It managed to sell over one million copies in the United States, earning a platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Destiny%20Child&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold and Platinum|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> The remix version to the album's lead single, "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]", reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] and number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Its follow-up single, "[[With Me (Destiny's Child song)|With Me Part 1]]" failed to reproduce the success of "No, No, No". Meanwhile, the group featured on a song from the soundtrack album of the romantic drama ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' and "[[Get on the Bus (song)|Get on the Bus]]" had a limited release in Europe and other markets. In 1998, Destiny's Child garnered three Soul Train Lady of Soul awards<ref name="Kaufman"/> including Best New Artist for "No, No, No". Knowles considered their debut successful but not huge, claiming as a [[neo soul]] record it was too mature for the group at the time.<ref name="Anthony">{{cite news |last=Anthony |first=James |title='Of course you can lose yourself' |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1852025,00.html |work=The Guardian |date=2006-08-18 |accessdate=2008-05-13 | location=London}}</ref>

After the success of their debut album, Destiny's Child re-entered the studio quickly, bringing in a new lineup of producers, including [[Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs]]<ref name="Kaufman"/> and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. Coming up with ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'', they released it on July 27, 1999 and it eventually became their breakthrough album.<ref name="Anthony"/> ''The Writing's on the Wall'' peaked at number five on the ''Billboard'' 200 and number two on R&B chart in early 2000.<ref name="BillAlbumChart"/> "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]" was released in 1999 as the album's lead single and reached the top spot of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming their first US number-one single.<ref name="Kaufman"/> ''The Writing's on the Wall'' has been credited as Destiny's Child's breakthrough album, spurring their career and introducing them to a wider audience.<ref name="DunnDate"/><ref name="FlynnLose">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/aug/18/urban.popandrock|title='Of course you can lose yourself'|last=Flynn|first=Paul|date=2006-08-18|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-02-26 | location=London}}</ref> The main key to the group's breakthrough was the album's third single, "[[Say My Name]]",<ref name="FlynnLose"/> which topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks.

[[File:Michelle Williams - The Drama League (PNG).png|thumb|upright|[[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] joined the group as a replacement for Luckett and Roberson.]]
In December 1999, Luckett and Roberson attempted to split with their manager, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the group's profits and unfairly favored Knowles and Rowland.<ref name="Kaufman"/> While they never intended to leave the group, when the video for "[[Say My Name]]" surfaced in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that two new members were joining Knowles and Rowland.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Prior to the video premiere, Knowles announced on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' that original members Luckett and Roberson had left the group.<ref name="People"/> They were replaced by [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], a former backup singer to [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]], and [[Farrah Franklin]], an aspiring singer-actress.<ref name="DunnDate"/> Shortly after her stint with Monica, Williams was introduced to Destiny's Child by choreographer Braden Larson aka "Peanut Orlando", and was flown to Houston where she stayed with the Knowles family.<ref name="DunnDate"/>

In March 2000, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. Following the suit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Five months after joining, Franklin left the group. The remaining members claimed that this was due to missed promotional appearances and concerts. According to Williams, Franklin could not handle stress.<ref name="DunnDate"/> Franklin, however, disclosed that she left because of the negativity surrounding the strife and her inability to assert any control in the decision making.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Her departure was seen as less controversial. Williams, on the other hand, disclosed that her inclusion in the group resulted in her "battling insecurity": "I was comparing myself to the other members, and the pressure was on me."<ref name="DunnDate"/>

Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Rowland and Knowles in exchange for a settlement, though they continued the action against their manager. As part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from speaking about each other publicly.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Roberson and Luckett formed another girl group named Anjel but also left it due to issues with the record company. Although band members were affected by the turmoil, Destiny's Child's success continued. The following years of their career were seen as the group's most successful stretch,<ref name="Kaufman"/> becoming a pop culture phenomenon.<ref name="People"/> "Say My Name" became their second number-one and biggest single to date.<ref name="Anthony"/> The fourth single from ''The Writing's on the Wall'', "[[Jumpin', Jumpin']]", also became a top-ten hit. During this time, Destiny's Child began performing as an opening act at the concerts of pop singers [[Britney Spears]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].<ref name="Kaufman"/>

With Williams in the new lineup, Destiny's Child released a theme song for the soundtrack to the [[Charlie's Angels (film)|film version of ''Charlie's Angels'']]. Released as a single in October 2000, "[[Independent Women Part 1]]" spent eleven consecutive weeks atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 from November 2000 to January 2001,<ref name="People"/> the longest-running number-one single of Destiny's Child's career and of that year in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/64057/chart-beat-bonus |title=Chart Beat Bonus: Endless Love |date=2005-02-18 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |accessdate=2009-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130525152728/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/64057/chart-beat-bonus |archivedate=May 25, 2013 }}</ref> The successful release of the single boosted the sales of the soundtrack album to ''Charlie's Angels'' to 1.5 million by 2001.<ref name="GillingsSoul"/> In 2000, Destiny's Child won Soul Train's Sammy Davis Jr. Entertainer of the Year award.<ref name="GillingsSoul"/>

After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that now is the time to pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists.

[[File:The Supremes (Promo Pic 1).png|thumb|left|The Supremes]]

Destiny's Child recorded [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs with styles that encompasses [[urban contemporary|urban]], [[contemporary R&B|contemporary]], and [[dance-pop]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p278369|pure_url=yes}}|title=Destiny's Child: Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision Company|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> Destiny's Child revealed that R&B singer [[Janet Jackson]] is one of their influences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12056577 |title=Destiny's Child Inspired By Janet Jackson |last=Atwood |first=Brett |date=2001-01-11 |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070611134935/http://music.yahoo.com:80/read/news/12056577 |archivedate=June 11, 2007 }}</ref> Ann Powers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Destiny's Child music as "fresh and emotional&nbsp;... these ladies have the best mixes, the savviest samples and especially the most happening beats."<ref name="PowersFeminism"/> In the same publication, Jon Pareles noted that the sound that defines Destiny's Child, aside from Knowles' voice, "is the way its melodies jump in and out of double-time. Above brittle, [[syncopation|syncopated rhythm]] tracks, quickly articulated verses alternate with smoother choruses."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E6DE1E3FF932A3575BC0A9639C8B63&fta=y&scp=36&sq=Destiny%27s%20child&st=cse|title=Pop Review; Empowerment, Allure And a Runway's Flair |last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=2005-08-01|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> The group usually harmonize their vocals in their songs, especially on the ballads. In most instances of their songs, each member sings one verse and chimes in at the chorus. In ''Survivor'', each members sings lead in the majority of the album:<ref name="DunnDate"/> "...&nbsp;everybody is a part of the music&nbsp;... Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it's so great—because now Destiny's Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443010/20010420/destinys_child.jhtml|title='Bootylicious' Destiny's Child Sample Stevie Nicks, More On Survivor|last=Basham|first=David|date=2001-04-20|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> Knowles, however, completely led songs like "Brown Eyes" and "[[Dangerously in Love (song)|Dangerously in Love]]". The group explored their lyrics to man-to-woman relationship, and sisterhood and female empowerment anthems.

''Survivor'' contains themes interpreted by the public as a reference to the group's internal conflict. The title track, "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]", which set the theme used throughout the album,<ref name="DunnDate"/> features the lyrics "I'm not gonna blast you on the radio&nbsp;... I'm not gonna lie on you or your family&nbsp;... I'm not gonna hate you in the magazine" caused LaTavia and [[LeToya Luckett]] to file a lawsuit against the group; the lyrics were perceived to be a violation over their agreement following a settlement in court.<ref name="Kaufman"/> In an interview, Knowles commented: "The lyrics to the single 'Survivor' are Destiny's Child's story, because we've been through a lot,&nbsp;... We went through our drama with the members&nbsp;... Any complications we've had in our 10-year period of time have made us closer and tighter and better."<ref name="DunnDate"/> In another song called "Fancy", which contains the lyrics "You always tried to compete with me, girl&nbsp;... find your own identity", was interpreted by critic David Browne, in his review of the album for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine, as a response to the lawsuit.<ref name="BrowneSurvivor">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,108583,00.html|title=Survivor (2008): Destiny's Child|last=Browne|first=David|date=2001-05-07|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] summarized ''Survivor'' as "a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny's Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife.&nbsp;... It's a record that tries to be a bold statement of purpose, but winds up feeling forced and artificial."<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r528778|pure_url=yes}}|title=Survivor: Destiny's Child|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> Despite the albums receiving critical praise, Knowles' close involvement has occasionally generated criticism. Knowles wrote and co-produced the bulk of ''Survivor''.<ref name="DunnDate"/> Browne suggested that her help made ''Survivor'' a "premature, but inevitable, growing pains album".<ref name="BrowneSurvivor"/>

Destiny's Child were compared to [[The Supremes]], a 1960s American [[girl group|female singing group]], with Knowles being compared to Supremes frontwoman [[Diana Ross]]; Knowles, however, has dismissed the notion.<ref name="Anthony"/> Coincidentally, Knowles starred in the film adaptation of the 1981 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' as Deena Jones, the front woman of the Dreams, a female singing group based on the Supremes. With Knowles' wide role assumed in the production of ''Survivor'', Gil Kaufman of MTV noted that "it became clear that Beyoncé was emerging as DC's unequivocal musical leader and public face".<ref name="Kaufman"/> Her dominance to the creative input in the album made the album "very much her work".<ref name="BrowneSurvivor"/> For Lola Ogunnaike of ''[[The New York Times]]'', "It's been a long-held belief in the music industry that Destiny's Child was little more than a launching pad for Beyoncé Knowles's inevitable solo career."<ref name="LolaDate">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/music/14ogun.html|title=Beyoncé's Second Date With Destiny's Child|last=Ogunnaike|first=Lola|date=2004-11-14|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

In the wake of Knowles' ''Dangerously in Love'', rumors spread about a possible split of Destiny's Child after each member had experienced success and had ongoing projects.<ref name="GilSplit">{{Cite news |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |title=Destiny's Child Announce Split |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1503975/20050612/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=2005-06-12 |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref><ref name="Tanya">{{Cite news |last=Edwards |first=Tanya |title=Will 'NSYNC Or Destiny's Child Ever Record Another Album |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457698/20020920/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=2002-09-23 |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> Comparisons were drawn to [[Justin Timberlake]], who did not return to band [['N Sync]] after his breakthrough debut solo album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]''.<ref name="Kaufman"/><ref name="Tanya"/> Rowland responded to such rumors, announcing they were back in the studio together.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Destiny's Child Back In The Studio, So 'Shut Up!'

Whilst Knowles was compared to Ross, Kelly Rowland perhaps considered to be Destiny's Child deputy leader has been equated to [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], the Supremes's second lead singer. Wilson declared about their second lead singer -position in the groups as "Same as our situation...." and about the possibility to emerge as solo artist, she says "It's very difficult, but it can be done.

In the first three albums of the group, Rowland sang her solo verses and bridges in a lot of songs (like in the hit singles "Bills, Bills, Bills", "Independent Woman", "Survivor" and "Bootylicious"), led choruses ("Say My Name") and harmonized Knowles ("No, No, No" and "Jumpin' Jumpin'"), but in '' Destiny Fulfilled '' she conquered more space in all songs of the album.<ref name="SullivanFulfilled">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/nov/12/popandrock.shopping4|title=Destiny's Child, Destiny Fulfilled|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|date=2004-11-12|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-09-03|location=London}}</ref><ref name="SinclairWeekly">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,784896,00.html|title=Destiny Fulfilled (2004): Destiny's Child|last=Sinclair|first=Tom|date=2004-11-26|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref><ref name="EliscuRolling">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/6592847/review/6594165?utm_source=Rhapsody&utm_medium=CDreview|title=Destiny's Child: Destiny Fulfilled|last=Eliscu|first=Jenny|date=2004-10-25|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2008-09-03|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080518011228/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/6592847/review/6594165?utm_source=Rhapsody&utm_medium=CDreview |archivedate = May 18, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
