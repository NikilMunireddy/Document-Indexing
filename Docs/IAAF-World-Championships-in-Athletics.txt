The '''World Championships in Athletics''' is an event organized by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). Originally, it was planned to be held every four years, but this changed after the third edition in 1991, and it has since been run biennially.

==History==
The idea of having an Athletics World Championships was around well before the competition's first event in 1983. In 1913, the IAAF decided that the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] would serve as the World Championships for athletics. This was considered suitable for over 50 years until in the late 1960s the desire of many IAAF members to have their own World Championships began to grow. In 1976 at the IAAF Council Meeting in [[Puerto Rico]] an Athletics World Championships separate from the Olympic Games was approved.

Following bids from both [[Stuttgart]], [[West Germany]] and [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], the IAAF Council awarded the inaugural competition to Helsinki, to take place in 1983 and be held in the [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium]] (where the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] had been held).

Two IAAF world championship events preceded the inaugural edition of the World Championships in Athletics in 1983. The [[1976 World Championships in Athletics|1976 World Championships]] had just one event – the men's [[50 kilometres walk]] which was dropped from the Olympic programme for the [[Athletics at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Olympics]] and the IAAF responded by setting up their own contest. Four years later, the [[1980 World Championships in Athletics|1980 World Championships]] contained only two newly approved women's events, ([[400 metres hurdles]] and [[3000 metres]]), neither of which featured on the programme for the [[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=GBR>[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/wc.htm IAAF World Championships in Athletics]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2013-09-08.</ref><ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/competitions/iaaf-world-championships/history Archive of Past Events]. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2013-09-08.</ref>

Over the years the competition has grown in size. In [[1983 World Championships in Athletics|1983]] an estimated 1,300 athletes from 154 countries participated.<ref>[http://www.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?DUID=USATF_2005_05_06_14_27_25 "First World Outdoor Championships in Helsinki a landmark for track & field."] Usatf.org. Retrieved 2012-07-23.</ref> By the 2003 competition, in [[2003 World Championships in Athletics|Paris]], it had grown to 1,907 athletes from 203 countries with coverage being transmitted to 179 different countries.

There has also been a change in composition over the years, with several new events, all for women, being added. By [[2005 World Championships in Athletics|2005]] the schedule for men and women was almost equal. The only differences being the men had the extra event of the 50&nbsp;km walk, while women competed in the [[100 m hurdles]] and [[heptathlon]] compared to the men in the [[110 m hurdles]] and [[decathlon]] respectively.

The following list shows when new events were added for the first time.

*'''1987''', women's [[10,000 m]] and [[10 km walk]] were added.
*'''1993''', women's [[triple jump]] was added.
*'''1995''', women's [[5000 m]] was added, replacing the 3000 m race.
*'''1999''', women's [[pole vault]] and [[Hammer throw|hammer]] were added and the women's [[20 km walk]] replaced the 10&nbsp;km walk.
*'''2005''', women's [[3000 m steeplechase]] was added.
