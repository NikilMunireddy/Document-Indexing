==History==
[[File:Jeff Bezos' iconic laugh.jpg|thumb|upright|Amazon founder [[Jeff Bezos]]]]
{{further|Timeline of Amazon.com}}
The company was founded in 1994, spurred by what Bezos called his "regret minimization framework," which described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the [[Dot-com bubble|Internet business boom]] during that time.<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000408032804/http://www.time.com/time/poy/bezos5.html|url=http://www.time.com/time/poy/bezos5.html|archivedate=April 8, 2000|work=Time|title=Person of the Year&nbsp;– Jeffrey P. Bezos|accessdate=January 5, 2008|date=December 27, 1999}}</ref> In 1994, Bezos left his employment as vice-president of [[D. E. Shaw & Co.]], a Wall Street firm, and moved to Seattle.  He began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become Amazon.com.

[[Jeff Bezos]] incorporated the company as "Cadabra" on July 5, 1994.<ref name="nasdaq.com"/> Bezos changed the name to Amazon a year later after a lawyer misheard its original name as "cadaver".<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/amazon/11800890/jeff-bezos-interview-amazon-prime-jeremy-clarkson.html Amazon's Jeff Bezos: With Jeremy Clarkson, we're entering a new golden age of television] Retrieved August 18, 2015.</ref> The company went online as Amazon.com in 1995.<ref name=byers>{{citation|first=Ann|last=Byers|year=2006|title=Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon.com|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz43wixr2IcC&pg=PA47|pages=46–47}}</ref>

Bezos selected the name Amazon by looking through the dictionary, and settled on "Amazon" because it was a place that was "exotic and different" just as he planned for his store to be; the [[Amazon river]], he noted was by far the "biggest" river in the world, and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world.<ref name="byers" /> Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand, telling a reporter, "There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time. But you know, [[McDonald's]] got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world."<ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy Jr.|first=Bill|title='Follow the Money' and Other Lessons From Jeff Bezos|url=http://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/follow-the-money-lessons-from-jeff-bezos.html}}</ref> Additionally, a name beginning with "A" was preferential due to the probability it would occur at the top of any list that was alphabetized.

Since June 19, 2000, Amazon's logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from A to Z, representing that the company carries every product from A to Z, with the arrow shaped like a smile.<ref name="a-to-z">{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=70550&highlight=|title=Amazon.com Introduces New Logo; New Design Communicates Customer Satisfaction and A-to-Z Selection|publisher=Corporate IR.net|date=January 5, 2000}}</ref>

After reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected annual Web commerce growth at 2,300%, Bezos created a list of 20 products that could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, due to the large world-wide demand for literature, the low price points for books, along with the huge number of titles available in print.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/amazon-com-inc-history|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref> Amazon<ref>{{cite book|last=Brandt|first=Richard L.|title=One Click: Jeff Bezos and the Rise of Amazon.com|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Publishing|isbn=0670920665|page=228}}</ref> was originally founded in Bezos' garage in Bellevue, Washington.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spiro|first=Josh|title=The Great Leaders Series: Jeff Bezos, Founder of Amazon.com|url=http://www.inc.com/30years/articles/jeff-bezos.html|publisher=Inc.com|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}</ref>

The company began as an online [[bookstore]], an idea spurred off with discussion with [[John R. Ingram (businessman)|John Ingram]] of Ingram Book (now called [[Ingram Content Group]]), along with Keyur Patel who still holds a stake in Amazon.<ref name="nyt10years">{{cite news|last=Rivlin|first=Gary|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/business/yourmoney/10amazon.html?ei=5090&en=c805d53acf76f2b3&ex=1278648000&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all|title=A Retail Revolution Turns 10|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 10, 2005|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Amazon was able to access books at wholesale from Ingram. In the first two months of business, Amazon sold to all 50 states and over 45 countries. Within two months, Amazon's sales were up to $20,000/week.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spiro|first=Josh|title=The Great Leaders Series: Jeff Bezos, Founder of Amazon.com|url=http://www.inc.com/30years/articles/jeff-bezos.html}}</ref> While the largest [[brick and mortar]] bookstores and [[mail order]] catalogs might offer 200,000 titles, an online bookstore could "carry" several times more, since it would have a practically unlimited virtual (not actual) warehouse: those of the actual product makers/suppliers.

Amazon was incorporated in 1994, in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. In July 1995, the company began service and sold its first book on Amazon.com: [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies|Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-corporateTimeline|title=Amazon company timeline|publisher=Corporate IR}}</ref> In October 1995, the company announced itself to the public.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/100495.html|title=World's Largest Bookseller Opens on the Web|publisher=URLwire}}</ref> In 1996, it was reincorporated in [[Delaware]]. Amazon issued its [[initial public offering]] of [[stock]] on May 15, 1997, trading under the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange symbol '''AMZN''', at a price of [[United States dollar|US$]]18.00 per share ($1.50 after three [[stock split]]s in the late 1990s).

Amazon's initial [[business plan]] was unusual; it did not expect to make a profit for four to five years. This "slow" growth caused stockholders to complain about the company not reaching profitability fast enough to justify investing in, or to even survive in the long-term. When the [[dot-com bubble]] burst at the start of the 21st century, destroying many e-companies in the process, Amazon survived, and grew on past the bubble burst to become a huge player in online sales. It finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $5 million (i.e., 1¢ per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional [[business model]] could succeed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Spector|title=Amazon.com: Get Big Fast|year=2002}}</ref> In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Bezos the [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]], recognizing the company's success in popularizing [[online shopping]].

[[Barnes & Noble]] sued Amazon on May 12, 1997, alleging that Amazon's claim to be "the world's largest bookstore" was false. Barnes and Noble asserted, "[It] isn't a bookstore at all. It's a book broker." The suit was later settled out of court, and Amazon continued to make the same claim.<ref name="referenceforbusiness.com">[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/businesses/A-F/Amazon-com.html "Forming a Plan, The Company Is Launched, One Million Titles"]. Reference for Business: Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd ed. Retrieved September 1, 2012.</ref> [[Walmart]] sued Amazon on October 16, 1998, alleging that Amazon had stolen Walmart's trade secrets by hiring former Walmart executives. Although this suit was also settled out of court, it caused Amazon to implement internal restrictions and the reassignment of the former Walmart executives.<ref name="referenceforbusiness.com"/>

===Fulfillment and warehousing===
Fulfillment centers are located in the following cities, often near airports. These centers also provide warehousing and order-fulfillment for third-party sellers.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/ Fulfillment by Amazon] from the company's website</ref> Amazon Fulfillment centers can also provide warehousing and order-fulfillment for third-party sellers for an extra fee. Third-party sellers can use Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, to sell on other platforms as well, such as [[eBay]] or their own websites.<ref>[FBA - Multi-Channel Fulfillment FBM or FBA] Retrieved April 16, 2015.</ref>

Warehouses are large and each has hundreds of employees. Employees are responsible for four basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. A picker may walk 10 or more miles a day. In the United Kingdom initial staffing was provided by [[Randstad Holding]] and other temporary employment agencies. Some workers are accepted as Amazon employees and granted pension and shares of stock; others are dismissed. "When we have permanent positions available, we look to the top performing temporary associates to fill them."<ref name=FT02813 /> Development of a high level of [[automation]] is anticipated in the future following Amazon's 2012 acquisition of [[Kiva Systems]], a warehouse automation company.

In November 2005, Amazon began testing [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]], an [[application programming interface]] (API) allowing programs to dispatch tasks to human processors.

In March 2006, Amazon launched an online storage service called [[Amazon S3|Amazon Simple Storage Service]] (Amazon S3). An unlimited number of data objects, from 1&nbsp;[[byte]] to 5&nbsp;[[terabyte]]s in size, can be stored in S3 and distributed via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] or [[BitTorrent]]. The service charges monthly fees for data stored and transferred. In 2006, Amazon introduced [[Amazon Simple Queue Service]] (Amazon SQS), a distributed queue messaging service, and product [[wiki]]s (later folded into [[#2007|Amapedia]]) and [[Internet forum|discussion forums]] for certain products using guidelines that follow standard [[Internet forum|message board]] conventions.

In 2008, Amazon improved the service by adding Elastic Block Store (EBS), offering persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances and [[Elastic IP address]]es, and offering static IP addresses designed for dynamic [[cloud computing]].
Amazon introduced [[Amazon SimpleDB|SimpleDB]], a database system, allowing users of its other infrastructure to utilize a high-reliability, high-performance database system.  In 2008, Amazon graduated EC2 from beta to "Generally Available" and added support for the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1216597&highlight=|title=Amazon Web Services Launches Amazon EC2 for Windows|publisher=Amazon.com|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>

===Reviews===
{{see also|Amazon.com controversies#Amazon reviews}}
Amazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a [[rating scale]] from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicate the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicate that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. Customers may comment or vote on the reviews, indicating whether they found a review helpful to them. If a review is given enough "helpful" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.<ref>{{cite web|author=Business Wire|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100503005110/en/2010-Social-Shopping-Study-Reveals-Consumers%E2%80%99-Online|title=2010 Social Shopping Study Reveals Changes in Consumers' Online Shopping Habits and Usage of Customer Reviews|publisher=Business Wire|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=January 31, 2013}}</ref>

Amazon has cooperated with around 130 [[publisher]]s to allow users to perform these searches.

To avoid copyright violations, amazon.com does not return the computer-readable text of the book. Instead, it returns a picture of the matching page, instructs the web browser to disable printing, and puts limits on the number of pages in a book a single user can access. Additionally, customers can purchase online access to some of the same books via the "Amazon Upgrade" program.

Amazon derives many of its sales from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon (around 40% in 2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee204/Publications/Amazon-EE353-2008-1.pdf|format=PDF|title=AMAZON ENTERS THE CLOUD COMPUTING BUSINESS|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref> Associates receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites, if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has "over 900,000 members" in its affiliate programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/join |title=Amazon.co.uk Associates: The web's most popular and successful Affiliate Program |publisher=Affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk |date=July 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100730022710/http://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk:80/gp/associates/join |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}</ref> In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites, and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/advertising/all|title=Usage of advertising networks for websites|publisher=W3Techs.com|date=July 22, 2014|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}</ref> It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them commission.<ref>{{cite web|title=14 Easy Fundraising Ideas for Non-Profits|url=http://www.blisstree.com/2009/04/12/sex-relationships/14-easy-fundraising-ideas-for-non-profits/|website=blisstree.com|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}</ref> Amazon reported over 1.3 million sellers sold products through Amazon's websites in 2007. Unlike eBay, Amazon sellers do not have to maintain separate payment accounts; all payments are handled by Amazon.

Associates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) [[XML]] service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched (rumored to be internally called "Project Genesis") to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazonservices.com/content/product_alerts.htm?ld=AOguerillaPGJG|title=Amazon Seller Product Suggestions|publisher=Amazonservices.com|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

==Amazon sales rank==
The Amazon sales rank (ASR) provides an indication of the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a "best sellers list" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.<ref name="amazon">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911|title=Amazon FAQ|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its best-sellers lists.<ref name="amazon" /> Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website, and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of "movers and shakers"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.<ref name="movers">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers|title=Amazon.com Movers and shakers|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release [[point of sale]] data via the [http://en-us.nielsen.com/ Nielsen BookScan] service to verified authors.<ref name="pos">{{cite web|url=https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/help?topicID=200580390|title=Amazon.com Author Central|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,<ref name="JS">{{cite web| title = Amazon Sales Estimator | publisher = Jungle Scout | url = http://www.junglescout.com/estimator/}}</ref> though Amazon states:

==Amazon technology==
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Information Management (IM) support Amazon’s business strategy. The core technology that keeps Amazon running is Linux-based. {{as of|2005}}, Amazon had the world’s three largest Linux databases, with capacities of 7.8 TB, 18.5 TB, and 24.7 TB. The central data warehouse of Amazon is made of 28 Hewlett Packard servers with four CPUs per node running Oracle database software. Amazon’s technology architecture handles millions of back-end operations every day, as well as queries from more than half a million third-party sellers. With hundreds of thousands of people sending their credit card numbers to Amazon’s servers every day, security becomes a major concern. Amazon employs Netscape Secure Commerce Server using the Secure Socket Layer protocol which stores all credit card details in a separate database. The company also records data on customer buyer behavior which enables them to offer or recommend to an individual specific item, or bundles of items based upon preferences demonstrated through purchases or items visited.<ref name="technology">{{cite web|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon1.htm|title=How Amazon Works|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>

On January 31, 2013 Amazon experienced an outage that lasted approximately 49 minutes, leaving its site inaccessible to some customers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Letzing|first=John|title=Amazon Suffers Outage for Nearly an Hour|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324156204578276320631771436.html|accessdate=January 31, 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 31, 2013}}</ref>

On May 5, 2014 Amazon unveiled a partnership with [[Twitter]]. Twitter users can link their accounts to an Amazon account and automatically add items to their shopping carts by responding to any tweet with an Amazon product link bearing the hashtag #AmazonCart. Customers never leave the Twitter feed, and the product is waiting for them when they go to the Amazon website.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cheng|first=Roger|title=Amazon, Twitter link up for easy shopping through #AmazonCart|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-twitter-link-up-for-easy-shopping-through-amazoncart/|accessdate=May 5, 2014|newspaper=CNET|date=May 5, 2014}}</ref>

==Multi-level sales strategy==
Amazon employs a multi-level e-commerce strategy. Amazon started off by focusing on Business-to-Consumer relationships between itself and its customers, and Business-to-Business relationships between itself and its suppliers but it then moved to incorporate Customer-to-Business transactions as it realized the value of customer reviews as part of the product descriptions. It now also facilitates customer to customer with the provision of the Amazon marketplace which act as an intermediary to facilitate consumer to consumer transactions. The company lets almost anyone sell almost anything using its platform. In addition to affiliate program that lets anybody post Amazon links and earn a commission on click through sales, there is now a program which let those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon’s platform.<ref name="relationships">{{cite web|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon2.htm|title=How Amazon Works|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref>

Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.<ref name="value">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&nodeId=743056|title=Help|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>
Amazon also employs the use of [[drop shipping|drop shippers]] or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

On 2 February 2016, [[General Growth Properties]]’ CEO, Sandeep Mathrani, during a year-end conference call with investors, analysts and reporters mentioned that Amazon plans to roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country. This was an unconfirmed comment, however due to the source, a media frenzy ensued.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Passing Comment On Possible Bookstore Plans by Amazon.com Creates Internet Imbroglio - CoStar Group|url = http://www.costar.com/News/Article/Passing-Comment-On-Possible-Bookstore-Plans-by-Amazoncom-Creates-Internet-Imbroglio/179421?rpt=1|website = www.costar.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}</ref> In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore location. It is aptly named, Amazon Books and is located in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.<ref name=":1" />

==Revenue==
Over the 2000-2010 decade, Amazon has developed a customer base of around 30 million people. Amazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model. Amazon makes its money by taking a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website. Amazon also allows companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products.<ref name="revenue">{{cite web|url=http://marketingteacher.com/swot/amazon-swot.html|title=SWOT Analysis Amazon|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref>

==Controversies==

In 2011 it was publicized that at the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania warehouse, workers had to carry out work in {{convert|100|°F|°C}} heat, resulting in employees becoming extremely uncomfortable and suffering from dehydration and [[Collapse (medical)|collapse]]. Loading-bay doors were not opened to allow in fresh air as "managers were worried about theft". Amazon's initial response was to pay for an ambulance to sit outside on call to cart away overheated employees.

Some workers, "pickers", who travel the building with a trolley and a handheld scanner "picking" customer orders can walk up to 15 miles during their workday, and if they fall behind on their targets, they can be reprimanded. The handheld scanners feed back to the employee real-time information on how fast or slowly they are doing; the scanners also serve to allow Team Leads and Area Managers to track the specific locations of employees and how much "idle time" they gain when not working.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-rules-2011-9|last1=Yarrow|first1=Jay|last2=Kovach|first2=Steve|title=10 Crazy Rules That Could Get You Fired From Amazon Warehouses|accessdate=April 21, 2013|date=September 20, 2011|work=Business Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/ed6a985c-70bd-11e2-85d0-00144feab49a.html#slide0|title=Amazon unpacked|last1=O'Connor|first1=Sarah|accessdate=April 21, 2013|date=February 8, 2013|work=Financial Times}}</ref>
In a German television report broadcast in February 2013, journalists Diana Löbl and Peter Onneken conducted a covert investigation at the distribution center of Amazon in the town of [[Bad Hersfeld]] in the German state of [[Hessen]]. The report highlights the behavior of some of the security guards, themselves being employed by a third party company, who apparently either had a [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-nazi]] background or deliberately dressed in Neo-Nazi apparel, and who were intimidating foreign and temporary female workers at its distribution centres. The third party security company involved was delisted by Amazon as a business contact shortly after that report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/amazon136.html|title=Kritik an Arbeitsbedingungen bei Amazon|publisher=tagesschau.de|date=|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daserste.de/information/reportage-dokumentation/dokus/sendung/hr/13022013-ausgeliefert-leiharbeiter-bei-amazon-100.html|title=Ausgeliefert!

In March 2015, it was reported in ''[[The Verge]]'' that Amazon will be removing 18 month long [[non-compete clause]]s from its US employment contracts for hourly-paid workers, after criticism that it was acting unreasonably in preventing such employees from finding other work. Even short-term temporary workers have to sign contracts that prohibit them from working at any company where they would "directly or indirectly" support any good or service that competes with those they helped support at Amazon, for 18 months after leaving Amazon, even if they are fired or made redundant.<ref name=Verge>{{cite news|last1=Woodman|first1=Spencer|title=Exclusive: Amazon makes even temporary warehouse workers sign 18-month non-competes|url=http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8280309/amazon-warehouse-jobs-exclusive-noncompete-contracts|accessdate=March 28, 2015|work=The Verge|date=March 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|last1=Kasperkevic|first1=Jana|title=Amazon to remove non-compete clause from contracts for hourly workers|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/27/amazon-remove-noncompete-clause-contracts-hourly-workers|accessdate=March 28, 2015|work=The Guardian|date=March 27, 2015}}</ref>

In an effort to boost employee morale, on November 2, 2015 Amazon announced that it would be extending 6 weeks of paid leave for new mothers and fathers.

==Lobbying==
Amazon.com lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection, and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the US Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent $500,000 on lobbying in the second quarter of 2010, $630,000 in the first quarter of 2011, and $450,000 in the second quarter of that year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amazon spends $450K on lobbying government in 2Q|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9P5E2880.htm|newspaper=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>
