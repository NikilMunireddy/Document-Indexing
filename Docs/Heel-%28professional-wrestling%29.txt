Heel (professional wrestling)

In [[professional wrestling]], a '''heel''' (also known as a '''rudo''' in ''[[lucha libre]]'') is a wrestler who is [[villain]]ous or a "bad guy", who is [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] (scripted) by the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promotion|promotion]] to be in the position of being an [[antagonist]].<ref name=torchterms>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/insiderglossary.shtml|title=Torch Glossary of Insider Terms|publisher=PWTorch.com|accessdate=2007-07-10|year=2000|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110606073745/http://www.pwtorch.com/insiderglossary.shtml|archivedate=2011-06-06}}</ref><ref>Foley, Mick.

In order to gain '''heat''' (with boos and jeers from the audience), heels are often portrayed as behaving in an immoral manner by breaking rules or otherwise taking advantage of their opponents outside the bounds of the standards of the match. Others do not (or rarely) break rules, but instead exhibit unlikeable, appalling and deliberately offensive and demoralizing personality traits such as arrogance, cowardice or contempt for the audience. Many heels do both, cheating as well as behaving nastily. No matter the type of heel, the most important job is that of the antagonist role. Heels exist to provide a foil to the face wrestlers. If a given heel is cheered over the face, a promoter may opt to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that heel to face or vice versa, or to make the wrestler do something even more despicable to encourage heel heat.

In the world of ''[[lucha libre]]'' wrestling, heels are generally known for being brawlers and for using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size, often having outfits akin to [[demon]]s, [[devil]]s, or other [[trickster]]s. This is contrasted with the heroic ''técnicos'' that are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial maneuvers]].

== History ==
The term "heel" is most likely derived from a [[slang]] usage of the word that first appeared around 1914, meaning "contemptible person".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Common heel behavior includes cheating to win (e.g., using the ropes for leverage while [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] or attacking with [[Glossary of professional wrestling#Foreign object|foreign objects]] while the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] is looking away), employing [[Professional wrestling attacks#Illegal attacks|dirty tactics]] such as [[Chokes|blatant chokes]] or [[Professional wrestling attacks#Eye rake|raking the eyes]], attacking other wrestlers backstage, interfering with other wrestlers' matches, insulting the fans (referred to as "[[Heat (professional wrestling)#Cheap heat|cheap heat]]"), and acting in a haughty or superior manner.<ref name=mf117>Foley, Mick.

More theatrical heels would feature dramatic outfits giving off a nasty or otherwise dangerous look, such as wearing [[corpse paint]] over their faces, putting on demonic masks, covering themselves in dark [[leather]], and the like. These are often referred to as a gimp. An example of a dramatic looking heel is the wrestler [[The Undertaker]] (in his heel roles). During his period in [[The Ministry of Darkness]], he undertook performances where he would appear as a priest of the [[Occultism|occult]] in a hooded black robe and sit on a devilish throne.

Occasionally, faces who have recently turned from being heels still exhibit characteristics from their heel persona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2004/03/15/382634.html|title='WWE WrestleMania XX' Results|last=Powell|first=John|accessdate=2008-03-15|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> This occurs due to fans being entertained by a wrestler despite (or because of) their heel persona, often due to the performer's charisma or charm in playing the role. Certain wrestlers such as [[Ric Flair]] and [[Eddie Guerrero]] gained popularity as faces by using tactics that would typically be associated with heels, while others like [[Scott Hall]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] displayed heelish behavior through most of their careers yet got huge face reactions, leading them to be marketed as [[Antihero|anti-heroes]].

On other occasions, wrestlers who are positioned as faces receive a negative audience reaction despite their portrayal as heroes. Such characters often become nudged into becoming villains over time or retooled in order to present a different public image. The term heel does not describe a typical set of attributes or audience reaction per se, but simply a wrestler's presentation and booking as an antagonist.

Depending on the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], a heel can act cowardly or overpowering to their opponents. For instance, a "closet champion" in particular is a term for a heel in possession of a title belt who consistently dodges top flight competition and attempts to back down from challenges. One of many examples is [[Seth Rollins]] during his recently first [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] run. This helps to affirm the intended [[kayfabe]] reactions that the face(s) that said heel is feuding with is/are more deserving of the title. Also to note is that heels may in fact beg for mercy during a beat down at the hands of faces, even if they have delivered similar beat downs with no mercy. Other heels may act overpowering to their opponents as to play up the scrappy [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] success story for the face instead. [[Brock Lesnar]] has played heel in both capacities, but has become quite famous (either as a heel or a face) as an almost-unstoppable machine who can take down anything in his path.
