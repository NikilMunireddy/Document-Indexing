The attack led to the United States' entry into [[World War II]].

Japan intended the attack as a [[Preventive war|preventive]] action to keep the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] from interfering with military actions the [[Empire of Japan]] planned in [[Southeast Asia]] against overseas territories of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], and the United States.

There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan. However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to proclaim December 7, 1941, "[[Infamy Speech|a date which will live in infamy]]". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was judged by the [[Tokyo Trials]] to be a [[Japanese war crimes|war crime]].<ref name="Yuma Totani 57">{{cite book |title=The Tokyo War Crimes Trial: The Pursuit of Justice in the Wake of World War II |page=57 |author=Yuma Totani |date=April 1, 2009 |publisher=[[Harvard University Asia Center]]}}</ref><ref name="Stephen C.

{{Main|Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor}}

===Diplomatic background===
War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility of which each nation had been aware (and developed contingency plans for) since the 1920s, though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria]]. Over the next decade, Japan continued to expand into China, leading to [[Second Sino-Japanese War|all-out war between those countries in 1937]]. Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland; the "Southern Operation" was designed to assist these efforts.<ref name="Barnhart 1987">{{Harvnb|Barnhart|1987}}.</ref>

From December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on [[USS Panay incident|USS ''Panay'']], the [[Allison incident]], and the [[Nanking Massacre]] (the International Military Tribunal of the Far East concluded that more than 200,000 Chinese [[non-combatant]]s were killed in indiscriminate massacres, though other estimates have ranged from 40,000 to more than 300,000) swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan. Fearing Japanese expansion,<ref>Werner Gruhl (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&pg=PA39&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Imperial Japan's World War Two, 1931–1945]''. Transaction Publishers. p. 39. ISBN 978-0-7658-0352-8</ref> the United States, the United Kingdom, and France provided loan assistance for war supply contracts to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

In 1940, Japan [[Invasion of French Indochina|invaded French Indochina]] in an effort to control supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, [[machine tool]]s, and [[Avgas|aviation gasoline]] to Japan, which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act.{{refn|After it was announced in September iron and steel scrap export would also be prohibited, Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi protested to Secretary Hull on October 8, 1940 warning this might be considered an "unfriendly act".<ref name="PaW-96">{{Harvnb|GPO|1943|p=96|Ref=CITEREFGPO1943a}}</ref>|group=nb}} The U.S. did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step that Japan would likely consider a provocation, given Japanese dependence on U.S. oil.<ref name="PaW-94">{{Harvnb|GPO|1943|p=94|Ref=CITEREFGPO1943a}}</ref><ref>Toland, ''Japan's War''.{{clarify|date=September 2010}}</ref>

Early in 1941,<!--February?--> [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in [[San Diego]] and ordered a military buildup in the [[Philippines]] in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was (mistakenly) certain that any attack on the UK's Southeast Asian colonies would bring the U.S. into war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U.S. naval interference.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners. The U.S. [[War Plan Orange]] had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40,000-man elite force. This was opposed by [[Douglas MacArthur#Field Marshal of the Philippine Army|Douglas MacArthur]], who felt that he would need a force ten times that size, and was never implemented.<ref>{{Citation|author=William Chalek|title=Guest of the Emperor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30KUgALzEF8C|year=2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-23996-2|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30KUgALzEF8C&pg=PA45|chapter=8. War Plan Orange|pages=45–52}}</ref> By 1941, U.S. planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to Admiral [[Thomas C.

The U.S. ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941, following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption.<ref name="PaW-125">{{Harvnb|GPO|1943|p=125|Ref=CITEREFGPO1943a}}</ref> This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies, an oil-rich territory.{{refn|This was mainly a Japanese Navy preference; the Japanese Army would have chosen to attack the Soviet Union.<ref name="Peattie 1997">{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}; Coox, ''Kobun''.</ref>|group=nb}} On August 17, Roosevelt warned Japan that the U.S. was prepared to take steps against Japan if it attacked "neighboring countries".<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html Chapter IV The Showdown With Japan August-December 1941] Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare, 1941–1942</ref> The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of Southeast Asia.

Japan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during the course of 1941 in an effort to improve relations. During these negotiations, Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina when peace was made with the Nationalist government, adopt an independent interpretation of the [[Tripartite Pact]], and not to discriminate in trade provided all other countries reciprocated. Washington rejected these proposals. Japanese Prime Minister Konoye then offered to personally meet with Roosevelt, but Roosevelt insisted on coming to an agreement before any meeting.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-4.html Chapter IV: The Fatal Turn] Morton, Louis.

Strategy and Command: The First Two Years</ref>

Japan's final proposal, on November 20, offered to withdraw their forces from southern Indochina and not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia provided that the U.S., the UK, and the Netherlands ceased aiding China and lifted their sanctions against Japan.<ref name="Chapter V: The Decision for War"/> The American counter-proposal of November 26 (November 27 in Japan) (the [[Hull note]]) required Japan to evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers. However the day before the Hull Note was delivered, on November 26 in Japan, the main Japanese attack fleet left port for Pearl Harbor.

===Military planning===

Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the "Southern Resource Area" (the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], then commanding Japan's [[Combined Fleet]].<ref name=Gailey1995p68>{{Harvnb|Gailey|1995|p=68}}</ref> He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]] only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command.<ref name=Gailey1995p70>{{Harvnb|Gailey|1995|p=70}}</ref> Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Rear Admiral [[Ryunosuke Kusaka]], with assistance from Captain [[Minoru Genda]] and Yamamoto's Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain [[Kameto Kuroshima]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnrTdRy6t8MC&pg=PT14 |page=14 |last=Lord |first=Walter |title=Day of Infamy |publisher=Open Road Media |year=2012 |isbn=1-4532-3842-5}}</ref> The planners studied the [[Battle of Taranto|1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet]] at [[Taranto]] intensively.{{refn|"The Dorn report did not state with certainty that Kimmel and Short knew about Taranto. There is, however, no doubt that they did know, as did the Japanese. Lt. Cdr. Takeshi Naito, the assistant [[Military attaché|naval attaché]] to Berlin, flew to Taranto to investigate the attack first hand, and Naito subsequently had a lengthy conversation with Cdr. [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] about his observations. Fuchida led the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941."<ref>{{Harvnb|Borch|Martinez|2005|pp=53–54}}.</ref>|group=nb}}{{refn|"A [[torpedo bomber]] needed a long, level flight, and when released, its conventional torpedo would plunge nearly a hundred feet deep before swerving upward to strike a hull. Pearl Harbor deep averages 42 feet. But the Japanese borrowed an idea from the British carrier-based torpedo raid on the Italian naval base of Taranto. They fashioned auxiliary wooden tail fins to keep the torpedoes horizontal, so they would dive to only 35 feet, and they added a breakaway "nosecone" of soft wood to cushion the impact with the surface of the water."<ref>''Hellions of the Deep: The Development of American Torpedoes in World War II.'' By Robert Gannon, Published by Penn State Press, 1996, p. 49. ISBN 0-271-01508-X</ref>|group=nb}}

Over the next several months, pilots trained, equipment was adapted, and intelligence collected. Despite these preparations, [[Emperor Hirohito]] did not approve the attack plan until November 5, after the third of four [[Gozen Kaigi|Imperial Conferences]] called to consider the matter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wetzler|1998|p=39}}.</ref> Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1, after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the "[[Hull Note]]" would "destroy the fruits of the China incident, endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bix|2000|p=417}}, citing the Sugiyama memo</ref>

By late 1941, many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent. A [[Gallup poll]] just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not, and 21% had no opinion.<ref name="cipo19411208">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RPcuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s9sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5721%2C1471377 |title=Gallup Poll Found 52 p.c. of Americans Expected War |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=December 8, 1941 |accessdate=November 28, 2011 |author=The Canadian Institute of Public Opinion |page=1}}</ref> While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions, U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target; instead, they expected the Philippines would be attacked first. This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes, as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south.<ref>Noted by [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.|Arthur MacArthur]] in the 1890s. Manchester, William. ''[[American Caesar]]''</ref> They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time.<ref>Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''</ref>

Ever since the Japanese attack, there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics.  Military officers including Gen. [[Billy Mitchell]] had pointed out the vulnerabiliy of Pearl to Air attack.  At least two Naval War games, one in 1932 and another in 1936 proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack. Adm. [[James O. Richardson|James Richardson]] was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt's decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor.<ref>[http://unlearnedhistory.blogspot.com/2015/12/rehearsals-for-pearl-harbor.html Rehearsals for Pearl Harbor]{{unreliable source?|date=December 2015}}</ref>  The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings has contributed to conspiracy theories.  Several writers, including journalist Robert Stinnett and former United States rear admiral Robert Alfred Theobald, have argued that various parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the U.S. into war via the so-called "back door". However, this [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory]] is rejected by mainstream historians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prange|first=Gordon W.|title=Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History|year=1991|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0140159097|author2=Donald M.

===Objectives===
The attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 [[Two-Ocean Navy Act|Vinson-Walsh Act]] erased any chance of victory.<ref name=Willmott14>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=14}}.</ref><ref>[[Shigeru Fukudome|Fukudome, Shigeru]]. ''Shikan: Shinjuwan Kogeki'' (Tokyo, 1955), p. 150.</ref> Third, to deliver a blow to America's ability to commit its forces in the Pacific, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time.<ref name=Willmott14/> Finally, it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests, and would seek a compromise peace with Japan.<ref>Gordon W. Prange, Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine V.

Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages: the targeted ships would be in very shallow water, so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them; and most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on [[shore leave]] or would be rescued from the harbor. A further important disadvantage—this of timing, and known to the Japanese—was the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers ({{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}). IJN top command was so imbued with [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Admiral Mahan]]'s "decisive battle" doctrine—especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships—that, despite these concerns, Yamamoto decided to press ahead.<ref>''Kaigun''; Wilmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''; Blair, ''Silent Victory''</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}<!--& there may be other sources for this-->

Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor, especially the navy yard, oil tank farms, and submarine base, were ignored<!--not exactly ignored: commanders debated another attack to get them, but it was seen as being too risky-->, since—by their thinking—the war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt.<ref name="Willmott 1983">{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}</ref>

[[File:A6M2 on carrier Akagi 1941.jpeg|thumb|right|An Imperial Japanese Navy [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter on the aircraft carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]].]]''

On November 26, 1941, a Japanese task force (the [[Kido Butai|Striking Force]]) of six aircraft carriers—{{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sōryū||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiryū||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōkaku||2}}, and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}—departed northern Japan ''en route'' to a position northwest of Hawaii, intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor: 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive [[combat air patrol]] (CAP), including nine fighters from the first wave.

The first wave was to be the primary attack, while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second, with battleships as the third target.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zimm|2011|p=132}}</ref> The first wave carried most of the weapons to attack capital ships, mainly specially adapted [[Type 91 torpedo|Type 91]] [[aerial torpedo]]es which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{Harvnb|Peattie|2001}} p. 145.</ref> The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets (battleships and [[aircraft carrier]]s) or, if these were not present, any other high value ships (cruisers and destroyers). First wave [[dive bomber]]s were to attack ground targets. Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to intercept the bombers, especially in the first wave. When the fighters' fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat. Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed, especially over U.S. airfields.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

Before the attack commenced, two reconnaissance aircraft launched from cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Chikuma|1938|2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}} were sent to scout over Oahu and Maui and report on U.S. fleet composition and location. Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the U.S.,<ref>{{Harvnb|Zimm|2011|pp=173, 174}}</ref> and were not necessary. U.S. fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor was already known due to the reports of the Japanese spy [[Takeo Yoshikawa]]. A report of the absence of the U.S. fleet in Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the fleet submarine {{Jsub|I-72||2}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zimm|2011|p=153}}</ref> Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force (the [[Kido Butai]]) and [[Niihau]], to detect any counterattack.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|author=Tony DiGiulian |url=http://www.navweaps.com/index_oob/OOB_WWII_Pacific/OOB_WWII_Pearl_Harbor.htm |title=Order of Battle – Pearl Harbor – December 7, 1941 |publisher=Navweaps.com |accessdate=July 17, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630214745/http://navweaps.com/index_oob/OOB_WWII_Pacific/OOB_WWII_Pearl_Harbor.htm| archivedate=June 30, 2011 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

A third midget submarine, ''[[HA. 19 (Japanese Midget Submarine)|Ha-19]]'', grounded twice, once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu, where it was captured on December 8.<ref name="p60">Stewart, pp.&nbsp;59–61</ref> Ensign [[Kazuo Sakamaki]] swam ashore and was captured by [[Hawaii National Guard]] Corporal [[David Akui]], becoming the first Japanese [[prisoner of war]].{{refn|While the nine sailors who died in the attack were quickly lionized by the Japanese government as ''Kyūgunshin'' ("The Nine War Heroes"), the news of Sakamaki's capture, which had been publicized in U.S. news broadcasts, was kept secret.

In 1992, 2000, and 2001, [[Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory]]'s submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor. The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war, including vehicles and landing craft. Both of its torpedoes were missing. This correlates with reports of  two torpedoes fired at the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|St. Louis|CL-49|2}} at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer {{USS|Helm|DD-388|2}} at 08:21.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zimm|2011|pp=330–341}}</ref>

===Japanese declaration of war===
{{See also|Japanese war crimes}}
The attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto's intention. He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} However, the attack began before the notice could be delivered. Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the "14-Part Message") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, but transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it in time. (In fact, U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it.)<ref>Toland, ''Infamy''</ref> The final part of the "14 Part Message" is sometimes described as a declaration of war. While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator that negotiations were likely to be terminated<ref>At Dawn We Slept Prange, Goldstein. Dillon pp. 424, 475</ref> and that war might break out at any moment,<ref>''At Dawn We Slept'', Prange, Goldstein. Dillon pp. 493–494</ref> it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations. [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8]],<ref>[http://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/Rescript-English.pdf Declaration of War handout] Retrieved August 9, 2012.</ref> but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack.

For decades, conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without any official warning of a break in relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington. In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at [[International Christian University]] in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, "our deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success." Of this, Iguchi said, "The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations&nbsp;... and they clearly prevailed."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/world/pearl-harbor-truly-a-sneak-attack-papers-show.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Pearl Harbor Truly a Sneak Attack, Papers Show |author=Howard W.

As the first wave approached Oahu, it was detected by the U.S. Army [[SCR-270 radar]] at [[Opana Radar Site|Opana Point]] near the island's northern tip. This post had been in training mode for months, but was not yet operational.<ref>Prange, Goldstein, Dillon. ''At Dawn We Slept''. pages&nbsp;730–31 'Short mishandled radar&nbsp;...' In his (Short's) words '...&nbsp;more for training than any idea it would be real'</ref> The operators, Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard, reported a target.<ref>Evans, Harold. ''The American Century'' London: Jonathan Cape, 1998. p. 309.</ref>  But Lieutenant [[Kermit A. Tyler]], a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center, presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] bombers from California. The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close (only a few degrees difference) to the bombers,<ref>{{Harvnb|Prange|1999|p=98}}{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=no full cite present; unable to identify (Prange 1999)}}</ref> and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar, they neglected to tell Tyler of its size.<ref name="prange501">Prange ''et al.'', ''At Dawn We Slept'', p. 500-501.</ref> Tyler, for security reasons, could not tell the operators of the six B-17s that were due (even though it was widely known).<ref name="prange501"/>

As the first wave planes approached Oahu, they encountered and shot down several U.S. aircraft. At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning. Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing. Nevertheless, it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly. The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor, though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked Pearl Harbor.

The air portion of the attack began at 7:48&nbsp;a.m. Hawaiian Time<ref name="Prange 1941, p.174"/> (3:18&nbsp;a.m. December 8 [[Japanese Standard Time]], as kept by ships of the ''Kido Butai''),<ref>Symonds, Craig L.

See [[UTC−10:30]].|group=nb}} with the attack on Kaneohe. A total of 353<ref name="parillo288"/> Japanese planes in two waves reached Oahu. Slow, vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave, exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present (the battleships), while dive bombers attacked U.S. [[Military airbase|air bases]] across Oahu, starting with [[Hickam Field]], the largest, and [[Wheeler Field]], the main U.S. Army Air Forces fighter base. The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces' [[Bellows Field]] near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island, and [[Ford Island]]. The only aerial opposition came from a handful of [[P-36 Hawk]]s, [[P-40 Warhawk]]s, and some [[SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers from the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}.{{refn|In the twenty-five sorties flown, USAF Historical Study No.85 credits six pilots with ten planes destroyed: 1st Lt Lewis M.

In the first wave attack, about eight of the forty-nine 800&nbsp;kg (1760&nbsp;lb) armor-piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets. At least two of those bombs broke up on impact, another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck, and one was a dud.

Already damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships, ''Nevada'' attempted to exit the harbor. She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} bombs, which started further fires. She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance.

{{USS|California|BB-44|2}} was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from ''Arizona'' and {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}} drifted down on her, and probably made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed [[target ship]] {{USS|Utah|BB-31|2}} was holed twice by torpedoes. ''West Virginia'' was hit by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}} was hit by four torpedoes, the last two above her [[belt armor]], which caused her to capsize. {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}} was hit by two of the converted 40&nbsp;cm shells, but neither caused serious damage.

Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The light cruiser {{USS|Helena|CL-50|2}} was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer {{USS|Oglala|CM-4|2}}. Two destroyers in [[dry dock]], {{USS|Cassin|DD-372|2}} and {{USS|Downes|DD-375|2}} were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel [[Bunker fuel|bunkers]]. The leaking fuel caught fire; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise, and both were burned out. ''Cassin'' slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against ''Downes''. The light cruiser {{USS|Raleigh|CL-7|2}} was holed by a torpedo. The light cruiser {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|2}} was damaged, but remained in service. The repair vessel {{USS|Vestal|AR-4|2}}, moored alongside ''Arizona'', was heavily damaged and beached. The seaplane tender ''Curtiss'' was also damaged. The destroyer {{USS|Shaw|DD-373|2}} was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine.<ref>{{Harvnb|USS Shaw (DD-373)|Ref=CITEREFdanfs373}}</ref>

* A third wave would have required substantial preparation and turnaround time, and would have meant returning planes would have had to land at night.

* Weather had deteriorated notably since the first and second wave launching, and rough seas complicated takeoff and landing for a third wave attack.
* The task force's fuel situation did not permit him to remain in waters north of Pearl Harbor much longer, since he was at the very limit of logistical support.

At a conference aboard ''Yamato'' the following morning, Yamamoto initially supported Nagumo.<ref name=Gailey1997p97 /> In retrospect, sparing the vital dockyards, maintenance shops, and oil depots meant the U.S. could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific.

==Salvage==
[[File:NH64486 Wallin aboard BB-44.jpg|thumb|left|Captain [[Homer N. Wallin]] (center) supervises salvage operations aboard {{USS|California|BB-44|6}}, early 1942]]

After a systematic search for survivors, formal salvage operations began. Captain [[Homer N. Wallin]], Material Officer for Commander, Battle Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was immediately ordered to lead salvage operations. "Within a short time I was relieved of all other duties and ordered to full time work as Fleet Salvage Officer".<ref>Pearl Harbor: Why, How Fleet Salvage & Final Appraisal, Wallin, Homer Naval History Division 1968</ref>{{refn|Commander [[Edward Ellsberg]] was ordered to [[Massawa]] as his replacement, to assist the British in clearing [[Scuttling|scuttled]] Italian and German ships.

Around Pearl Harbor, divers from the Navy (shore and tenders), the [[Shipyard|Naval Shipyard]], and civilian contractors (Pacific Bridge and others) began work on the ships that could be refloated. They patched holes, cleared debris, and pumped water out of ships. Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships. Within six months, five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair.

Intensive salvage operations continued for another year, a total of some 20,000 man-hours under water.<ref>Raymer, E.C: "Descent Into Darkness", Presidio Press, 1996.</ref> ''Oklahoma'', while successfully raised, was never repaired, and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947.

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor}}
[[File:Pennsylvania-cassin-downes.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}}, behind the wreckage of ''Downes'' and  ''Cassin''.]]

In the wake of the attack, 15 [[Congressional Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]], 51 [[Navy Cross]]es, 53 [[Silver Star]]s, four [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]]s, one [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], four [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Crosses]], one [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]], and three [[Bronze Star Medal]]s were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p={{page needed|date=September 2010}}}}.</ref> Additionally, a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military award]], the [[Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal]], was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack.

The day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his famous [[Infamy Speech]] to a [[Joint Session of Congress]], calling for a [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan]]. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. On December 11, Germany and Italy, honoring their commitments under the [[Tripartite Pact]], declared war on the United States. The pact was an earlier agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan which had the principal objective of limiting U.S. intervention in any conflicts involving the three nations.<ref>History of the Second World War, Liddell Hart, B.H. p. 206</ref> Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day. [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Japan|The UK actually declared war on Japan]] nine hours before the U.S. did, partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and partially due to Winston Churchill's promise to declare war "within the hour" of a Japanese attack on the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772812,00.html |work=Time |title=The U.S. At War, The Last Stage |date=December 15, 1941}}</ref>

The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater. Further losses compounded the alarming setback. Japan [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|attacked the Philippines]] hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines). Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleships [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' were sunk]] off the coast of [[British Malaya|Malaya]], causing British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] later to recollect "In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked".<ref>{{Citation |title=The Churchill War Papers: The Ever-Widening War |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill |author2=Martin Gilbert |volume=Volume 3: 1941 |year=2001 |publisher=W.W.

Throughout the war, Pearl Harbor was frequently used in [[American propaganda during World War II|American propaganda]].<ref>Anthony Rhodes, ''Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II'', p. 257 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York</ref>

One further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath (notably the [[Niihau Incident]]) was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby [[Japanese-American internment]] camps. Within hours of the attack, hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high-security camps such as [[Sand Island (Hawaii)|Sand Island]] at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and [[Kilauea Military Camp]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiiinternment.org/history-of-internment |title=World War II Internment in Hawai'i |publisher=Education through Cultural & Historical Organizations |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>Levine, E.

The attack also had international consequences. The [[Canadian]] province of [[British Columbia]], bordering the [[Pacific Ocean]], had long had a large population of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the [[Government of Canada]]. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the [[War Measures Act]] allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as the prohibiting from them returning to the province. The Japanese-Canadians were given a choice: either be moved into [[Japanese Canadian Internment|internment camps]] or be deported back to [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=La Violette|first=Forrest E.|title=The Canadian Japanese and World War II|year=1948|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=59–60}}</ref>

===Niihau Incident===
[[File:Nishikaichi's Zero BII-120.jpg|thumb|Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi's aircraft shown ten days after it crashed]]
{{Main|Niihau Incident}}
The Japanese planners had determined that some means was required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were too badly damaged to return to the carriers. The island of Niihau, only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.

The Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of ''Hiryu'' was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point on Niihau. The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's maps and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radio and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.

The ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to the assistance of Nishikaichi was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.<ref>Douglas Shinsato, Translator/Publisher of For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, 2011, pp.&nbsp;293–294</ref>

===Strategic implications===
Admiral Hara Tadaichi summed up the Japanese result by saying, "We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war."<ref>Haufler, Herve. ''Codebreaker's Victory: How the Allied Cryptographers Won World War II'' (New York: NAL, 2003), quoted p. 127.</ref> While the attack accomplished its intended objective, it turned out to be largely unnecessary. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of [[War Plan Orange|Plan Orange]]).<ref name="autogenerated2">{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}</ref> The U.S. instead adopted "[[Plan Dog]]" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Hakim|1995}}</ref>

Fortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched by the Japanese attack; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines—the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]]). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a "decisive battle" that never happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}, ''War Plan Orange''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=need full cite. Need page number}}</ref>

The Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor's navy repair yards, oil tank farms, submarine base, and old headquarters building.<ref name="Willmott 1983"/> All of these targets were omitted from Genda's list, yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war efforts in the Pacific. The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support to the U.S. Navy's operations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://combinedfleet.com/battles/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor |title=Attack on Pearl Harbor &#124; Nihon Kaigun |publisher=Combinedfleet.com |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kalonanews.com/articles/2013/04/17/community/doc516eb7c9cbba1744569185.txt |title=Pearl Harbor vet remembers Dec. 7, 1941, sneak attack |publisher=[[Kalowna News]] |date=April 17, 2013 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> such as the Battles of [[Battle of Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]]. It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy's heavy ships and brought Japan's economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the transportation of oil and raw materials: by the end of 1942, import of raw materials was cut to half of what it had been, "to a disastrous ten million tons", while oil import "was almost completely stopped".{{refn|In less than eleven months, most of Japan's elite naval aviators who had been at Pearl Harbor were lost in subsequent battles.

===Present day===
[[File:USS Missouri watching over USS Arizona - Pearl Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|Photo from USS ''Missouri'', looking towards the USS ''Arizona'' memorial]] 
Today, the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]] on the island of Oahu honors the dead. Visitors to the memorial reach it via boats from the naval base at Pearl Harbor. The memorial was designed by Alfred Preis, and has a sagging center but strong and vigorous ends, expressing "initial defeat and ultimate victory". It commemorates all lives lost on December 7, 1941.<ref>[http://www.glencoe.com/sec/socialstudies/btt/pearl_harbor/aftermath.shtml] Glencoe Online website, retrieved on November 10, 2011.</ref> Although December 7 is known as Pearl Harbor Day, it is not a federal holiday in the United States. The nation does however pay homage remembering the thousands injured and killed when attacked by the Japanese in 1941. Ceremonies are held annually at Pearl Harbor itself, attended each year by some of the ever-dwindling number of elderly veterans who were there on the morning of the attack. Schools and other establishments in some places around the country lower the American flag to [[half-staff]] out of respect.<ref>[http://24sevenpost.com/world-news/4-key-facts-pearl-harbor-day-december-7-1941/] 24SevenPost website, December 7, 2010. retrieved on November 10, 2011.</ref> The naval vessel where the war ended on [[Surrender of Japan|September 2, 1945]]—the last U.S. Navy battleship ever built, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}—is now a [[museum ship]] moored in Pearl Harbor, with its bow barely 1,000 feet (300 meters) southwest of the ''Arizona'' memorial.

* ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' (1970), a Japan-U.S. coproduction about the attack is "meticulous"<ref>Bernardelli, James, [http://www.reelviews.net/movies/t/tora.html "''Tora! Tora!

* ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (2001), directed by [[Michael Bay]], a love story set amidst the lead up to the attack and its aftermath.

===Non-fiction/historical===
* ''The Attack on Pearl Harbor: An Illustrated History'' by Larry Kimmett and Margaret Regis is a careful recreation of the "Day of Infamy" using maps, photos, unique illustrations, and an animated CD. From the early stages of Japanese planning, through the attack on [[Battleship Row]], to the salvage of the U.S. Pacific fleet, this book provides a detailed overview of the attack.
* ''At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor'' by [[Gordon W. Prange]] is an extremely comprehensive account of the events leading up to the Pearl Harbor attack and is considered by most scholars to be the best single work about the raid. It is a balanced account that gives both the Japanese and American perspectives. Prange spent 37 years researching the book by studying documents about Pearl Harbor and interviewing surviving participants to attempt the most exhaustive account of what happened: the Japanese planning and execution, why U.S. intelligence failed to warn of it, and why a peace agreement was not attained. The book is the first in the so-called "Prange Trilogy" of Pearl Harbor books co-written with Donald Goldstein and Katherine Dillon, the other two being:
** ''Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History'' – a dissection of the various [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] theories surrounding the attack.
** ''December 7, 1941: The Day The Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor'' – a recollection of the attack as narrated by eyewitnesses.
* ''Day of Infamy'' by [[Walter Lord]] was one of the most popular nonfiction accounts of the attack on Pearl Harbor.<ref>Walter Lord, ''Day of Infamy'' (Henry Holt and Co., 1957. ASIN: B002A503FA; Holt Paperbacks, 60th ed. 2001, ISBN 0-8050-6803-1, ISBN 978-0-8050-6803-0)</ref>
* ''Pearl Harbor: Final Judgment'' by [[Henry C. Clausen]] and Bruce Lee tells of Clausen's top-secret investigation of the events leading up to the Pearl Harbor attack. Much of the information in this book was still classified when previous books were published.
* ''Pearl Harbor Countdown: Admiral James O. Richardson'' by Skipper Steely is an insightful and detailed account of the events leading up to the attack. Through his comprehensive treatment of the life and times of Admiral [[James O. Richardson]], Steely explores four decades of American foreign policy, traditional military practice, U.S. intelligence, and the administrative side of the military, exposing the largely untold story of the events leading up to the Japanese attack.
* ''Pearl Harbor Papers: Inside the Japanese Plans'', released by Goldstein and Dillon in 1993, used materials from Prange's library to further flesh out the Japanese perspective of the attack, including diaries from some officers and ship logs.
* [https://mises.org/books/pearl_harbor_greaves.pdf ''Pearl Harbor: The Seeds and Fruits of Infamy''] by [[Percy L. Greaves, Jr.]] The first part provides a detailed history of pre-war U.S.-Japan relations, documenting the sources of rising tension. The second part suggests that the attack on Pearl Harbor was neither unexpected nor unprovoked.
* ''The Last Zero Fighter'', released in 2012, uses interviews conducted in Japanese, in Japan, with five Japanese aviators, three of whom participated in the Pearl Harbor strike: Kaname Harada, Haruo Yoshino and Takeshi Maeda. The aviators share their personal experiences (translated into English) in regards to their personal experiences training for and executing the raid on Pearl Harbor.<ref>Dan King, ''The Last Zero Fighter'' (Pacific Press, 2012. ISBN 978-1468178807)</ref>

===Alternate history===
* The feature-length movie ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'' (1980), in which the nuclear [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|6}} [[time travel|travels through time]] to one day before the attack.
* ''[[Days of Infamy series|Days of Infamy]]'' is a novel by [[Harry Turtledove]] in which the Japanese attack on Hawaii a full-scale invasion (something one of the key planners of the attack, Commander [[Minoru Genda]], wanted but the senior officers realized was impossible).<ref>John J. Stephan, ''Hawaii Under the Rising Sun''.</ref>
* The airstrike and Hawaii-invasion premise of ''Days of Infamy'' was earlier used in the first episode of the anime OVA series ''[[Konpeki no Kantai]]''.
* [[William Sanders (writer)|William Sanders]] wrote the [[alternate history]] story "Billy Mitchell's Overt Act".<ref>In the anthology ''Alternate Generals'', edited by [[Harry Turtledove]], [[Baen Books]], 1998</ref> In the variant history depicted in the story, [[Billy Mitchell]] managed to avoid the court-martial which ended his military career and was still alive and still an active service general in 1941, correctly guessing Japanese intentions.
