==Terminology==
{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
{{Main|Hispanic/Latino naming dispute}}
The terms ''Hispanic'' and ''Latino'' refer to an [[ethnicity]]; people in this group may be of any race and often have mixed-race ancestry. Members of the Hispanic ethnicity may share a common language, culture, history, and heritage. According to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the term ''Latino'' includes peoples of Portuguese roots, such as [[Brazil]], as well as those of Spanish-language origin.<ref name='sihistory'>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/mexicanamerica/glossary.html|title=Mexican America: Glossary|work=Smithsonian Institution|deadurl=y|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621041320/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/mexicanamerica/glossary.html|archivedate=21 June 2008|quote=Note: It defines "Hispanic" as meaning those with Spanish-speaking roots in the Americas and Spain, and "Latino" as meaning those from both Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking cultures in Latin America.}}</ref><ref>"[T]he term 'Latino' ... may be more inclusive than the term 'Hispanic.'" Deborah A. Ramirez, "Excluded Voices: The Disenfranchisement of Ethnic Groups From Jury Service," ''1993 Wis. L. Rev.'' 761, 806 (1993).</ref> A Hispanic or Latino can be of any race. In the United States, most Hispanics and Latinos are [[mestizo]]s (of mixed race European and Native American ancestry). They may also be of predominately [[White Hispanic|white]] or [[American Indian]] ancestry. Many Hispanics and Latinos from the Caribbean and Latin American countries where slavery was widespread may also have at least some African ancestry.<ref name='sihistory'/><ref name="Dejud2007">{{cite book|author=Carlos Dejud|title=The Relationship Among Ethnic Identity, Psychological Well-being, Academic Achievement, and Intergroup Competence of School-age Hispanic/Latino Youth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6h6I0trgKUC&pg=PA21|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-29853-3|page=21}}</ref>

The difference between the terms ''Hispanic'' and ''Latino'' is confusing to some. The U.S. government defines Hispanic as anyone from Spain and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas. The term ''Latino'' has developed more varied definitions. One definition of Latino is "a Latin male in the United States".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=latino&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> This is the oldest and the original definition used in the United States, first used in 1946. This definition encompassed both Spanish speakers from Europe and the Americas. Under this definition, immigrants from Spain and immigrants from Latin America are both Latino.

This definition is consistent with the 21st-century usage by the U.S. Census Bureau and OMB, as the two agencies use both terms Hispanic and Latino interchangeably. A later definition of Latino is that it possibly could be a condensed form of the term "Latino-Americano," the Spanish word for Latin-American, or someone who comes from Latin America. Under this definition a [[Mexican American]] or [[Cuban American]], for example, is both a Hispanic and a Latino. A [[Brazilian American]] is also a Latino, under this definition, which would include those of Portuguese-speaking origin from Latin America. An immigrant from Spain would be classified as Hispanic but not Latino by this definition.<ref name="Ready1991">{{cite book|author=Timothy Ready|title=Latino Immigrant Youth: Passages from Adolescence to Adulthood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qz3gHaea22MC&pg=PA14|year=1991|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-0057-1|page=14}}</ref><ref>"Latino: People with roots in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Americas." http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/handle/10211.4/222</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/18/uselections2008-race-newmexico | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Kevin | last=Anderson | title=The complexity of race in New Mexico | date=2008-10-18}}</ref><ref name="APTwitter" >{{cite web

The [[Philippines]] and [[Guam]] were colonies of Spain for hundreds of years, but there were not as many colonists in these areas as in the Americas. After the Spanish–American War and United States rule for decades in the Philippines, English became one of the predominant official languages in the country.

But, according to definitions of the U.S. Census Bureau, Brazilians are considered Portuguese speakers and are not included in the "Hispanic or Latino" population surveys. The U.S. government census classifies individuals as Hispanic/Latino if they come from a Spanish-speaking country. Blog discussions about identity note that a significant number of Brazilians have Spanish ancestry mostly due to 20th century immigration but also the colonial history and movement of peoples on the continent, as well as African ancestry from numerous peoples due to the slavery times.<ref>{{cite news|author=Giovanni Rodriguez|url=http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2193619/are-brazilians-latino-and-does-anybody-care|work=ClickZ|title=Are Brazilians Latino (and Does Anybody Care)?|date=24 July 2012|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.allinportuguese.com/blog/2013/02/25/are-portuguese-and-brazilians-hispanic/|work=The ALL in Portuguese Blog|title=Are Portuguese and Brazilians Hispanic?|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> Brazil's culture has also been affected by other immigrants, including slaves from Africa, and later immigrants from Italy, Germany, Japan, China, Lebanon, Poland, Lithuania, France, Netherlands, Ukraine, Norway, Russia and Korea.

Other government agencies have slightly different definitions of the term. The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] defines "Hispanic" as "persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or others [of] Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/civilrights/faq.htm |publisher=US Department of Transportation Office of Civil Rights |title=What is a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)? |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100109165512/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov:80/civilrights/faq.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2010 }}</ref> This definition has been adopted by the [[Small Business Administration]] as well as by many federal, state, and municipal agencies. Unlike the Census Bureau's definition, this clearly includes people with origins in [[Lusophone|Portuguese-speaking]] countries.

Preference of use between the terms among Hispanics and Latinos in the United States often depends on where persons reside. Those in the Eastern United States tend to prefer the term ''Hispanic'', whereas those in the West tend to prefer ''Latino''.<ref name=omb/> Both terms refer to ethnicity, as a person of Latino or Hispanic origin can be of any race.<ref name="overview"/><ref name="compraceho">{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/compraceho.html |title=U.S. Census Bureau Guidance on the Presentation and Comparison of Race and Hispanic Origin Data |accessdate = 2007-03-18 |author=United States Census Bureau |quote = Race and Hispanic origin are two separate concepts in the federal statistical system.

===16th and 17th centuries===
Hispanic/Latinos have been settled continuously in the territory of the United States since the 16th century,<ref name=legacies/><ref name=st-aug/><ref name=amlib/><ref name=mhs/> earlier than any other colonial group of European origin. Spanish explorers were pioneers in the territory of the present-day United States. The first confirmed European landing in the continental U.S. was by [[Juan Ponce de León]], who landed in 1513 at a lush shore he christened ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''.

Within three decades of Ponce de León's landing, the Spanish became the first Europeans to reach the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Grand Canyon]] and the [[Great Plains]]. Spanish ships sailed along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], penetrating to present-day [[Bangor, Maine]], and up the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] as far as [[Oregon]]. From 1528 to 1536, [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] and three fellows (including an African named [[Estevanico]]), from a Spanish expedition that foundered, journeyed from Florida to the [[Gulf of California]], 267 years before the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].

In 1540 [[Hernando de Soto]] undertook an extensive exploration of the present U.S. That same year [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]] led 2,000 Spaniards and Mexican Indians across today's [[Arizona]]–Mexico border and traveled as far as central [[Kansas]], close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States. Other Spanish explorers of the US territory include, among others: [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]], [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]], [[Gaspar de Portolà]], [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], [[Tristán de Luna y Arellano]] and [[Juan de Oñate]], and non-Spanish explorers working for the Spanish Crown, such as [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]]. In all, Spaniards probed half of today's lower 48 states before the first English colonization effort in 1585 at [[Roanoke Island]] off the East Coast.

In 1565 the Spanish created the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States, at [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] was founded before [[Jamestown, Virginia]] (founded in 1607) and the New England [[Plymouth Colony]] (1620, of ''[[Mayflower]]'' and [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] fame). Spanish missionaries and colonists founded settlements in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], to name a few.

===18th and 19th centuries===
As late as 1783, at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (a conflict in which Spain [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|aided and fought]] alongside the rebels), Spain held claim to roughly half the territory of today's continental United States. From 1819 to 1848, the United States (through treaties, purchase, diplomacy, and the [[Mexican–American War]]) increased its area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, acquiring three of what are today's four most populous states—[[California]], [[Texas]] and [[Florida]].

===20th century===
The Hispanic and Latino role in the history and present of the United States is addressed in more detail below (See [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Notables and their contributions|Notables and their contributions]]). During the 20th and 21st centuries, Hispanic and Latino immigration to the US increased markedly following changes to the immigration law in 1965. To recognize their current and historic contributions, on September 17, 1968, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] designated a week in mid-September as National Hispanic Heritage Week, with [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s authorization. In 1988, President [[Ronald Reagan]] extended the observance to a month, designated [[Hispanic Heritage Month]].<ref name=heritage>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/013984.html |title=US Census Press Releases; Hispanic Heritage Month 2009: Sept. 15&nbsp;– Oct. 15 |accessdate=2010-01-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Of the nation's total Hispanic or Latino population, 49% (21.5 million) live in [[California]] or [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/factsheets/hispanics2006/Table-12.pdf |title=Hispanic Population by State: 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-07 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Hispanic Center]]}}</ref>

Over half of the Hispanic/Latino population is concentrated in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] region, mostly composed of Mexican Americans. [[California]] and [[Texas]] have some of the largest populations of Mexicans and Central American Latinos in the United States. The [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] region is dominated by [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Ricans]] and [[Dominican Americans]], having the highest concentrations of both in the country. In the Mid Atlantic region, centered on the [[DC Metro Area]], [[Salvadoran Americans]] are the largest of Hispanic groups. [[Florida]] is dominated by [[Cuban Americans]] and Puerto Ricans. In both the [[Great Lakes States]] and the [[South Atlantic States]], Mexicans and Puerto Ricans dominate. Mexicans dominate in the rest of the country including, the [[Western United States]], [[South Central United States]] and [[Great Plains]] states.

===National origin===
[[File:Cinco de mayo bush.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Chicano Movement]] ([[Chicanismo]]) of the 1960s helped increase cultural awareness, and social empowerment of [[Mexican American]]s ([[Chicano]]s) in the United States.]]

As of 2007, some 64% of the nation's Hispanic population are of Mexican origin (see table). Another 9% are of Puerto Rican origin, with about 3% each of [[Cuban American|Cuban]], [[Salvadoran American|Salvadoran]] and [[Dominican American|Dominican]] origins. The remainder are of other Central American or South American origin, or of origin directly from Spain. 60.2% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans were born in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/factsheets/hispanics2007/Table-3.pdf |title=Detailed Hispanic Origin: 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-30 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Hispanic Center]]}}</ref>

In northern New Mexico and southern [[Colorado]], there is a large portion of Hispanics who trace their ancestry to Spanish settlers of the late 16th century through the 17th century. People from this background often self-identify as "[[Hispanos]]", "Spanish", or "Hispanic". Many of these settlers also intermarried with local Amerindians, creating a [[Mestizo]] population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmculturenet.org/heritage/cuartocentenario/spanish_view.php |title=New Mexico CultureNet – Cuartocentenario |accessdate=2008-05-13 |publisher=New Mexico CultureNet}}</ref> Likewise, southern [[Louisiana]] is home to communities of people of [[Canary Islands]] descent, known as [[Isleño]]s, in addition to other people of Spanish ancestry.

A significant portion of the Hispanic and Latino population self-identifies as [[Mestizo]], particularly the Mexican and Central American community. [[Mestizo]] is not a [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|racial category in the U.S. Census]], but signifies someone who has both European and American Indian Ancestry. According to the [[2010 United States Census]], 36.7% of Hispanic/Latino Americans identify as "[[Race and ethnicity in the United States#Some other race|some other race]]" as these Hispanic/Latinos may feel the U.S. census does not describe their European or American Indian ancestry as they understand it to be.<ref name=c2010/>

Half of the Hispanic/Latino population in the United States self-identifies as white. Most of the multi-racial population in the Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan communities are of European and Native American ancestry (Mestizo), while most of the multiracial population in the Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban communities are of European and African ancestry (Mulatto).

Hispanic and Latinos are racially diverse, although different "races" are usually the majority of each Hispanic group. For example, of major US Hispanic groups with populations of over 1 million, in northern Mexico, most people are White or bi-racial having White/Native American Ancestry, while in southern Mexico, the majority are Native American or of Native American and European Ancestry. In Guatemala, Native American and bi-racial people of Native American and European descent make the majority, while in El Salvador, whites and Bi-racial people of Native American/European descent are the majority. In the Dominican Republic the population are largely made up of people with inter-mixed ancestries, in which there are even levels of African and European ancestry, with smaller numbers of Whites and Blacks as well. In Puerto Rico, people with European ancestry are the majority. There are also populations of predominantly of African descent as well as populations of American Indian descent as well as those with inter-mixed ancestries. Cubans are mostly of White Latin American ancestry, however there are also populations of Blacks and multi-racials as well.<ref>Mara Loveman; Jeronimo Muniz (2006).

Mexicans represent the bulk of the US Hispanic/Latino population, and most Mexican Americans that migrate to the United States are of Native American and White descent, which causes many non-Hispanics to equate being Hispanic with being of mestizo or Native American ancestry. Official sources report the racial makeup of these Hispanic subgroups as follows, Argentina,<ref name="cia.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> Uruguay,<ref name="cia.gov"/> Puerto Rico,<ref name="cia.gov"/> Cuba,<ref name="cia.gov"/> and Chile,<ref name="cia.gov"/> having the highest percentage of Hispanics self-identifying as white in their respective countries (this can include some multi-racials identifying as "white", especially in Puerto Rico and Cuba), usually of Spanish descent. As a result of their racial diversity, Hispanics form an [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|ethnicity]] sharing a language ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and cultural heritage, rather than a [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|race]].The phenomenon of bi-racial people who are predominantly of European descent identifying as white is not limited to Hispanics or Spanish speakers but is also common among English speakers as well. researchers found that most White Americans with less than 28 percent African-American ancestry say they are White. Above that threshold, people tended to describe themselves as African-American.<ref>Carl Zimmer (2014).

===Hispanic or Latino K-12 Education===
With the increasing Hispanic population in the United States, Latinos have had a considerable impact on the K-12 system. In 2011-12, Latina/os comprised 24% of all enrollments in the United States, including 52% and 51% of enrollment in California and Texas, respectively.<ref name=":0">Santiago, D., Galdeano, E. C., & Taylor, M. (2015). The Condition of Latinos in Education: 2015 Factbook. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(02)77934-8</ref> Further research shows the Latinos will continue to grow in the United States, implicating that more Latinos will populate U.S schools.

The state of Latina/o education shows some promise. First, Hispanic students attending pre-K or kindergarten were more likely to attend full-day programs.<ref name=":0" /> Second, Latinos in elementary education were the second largest group represented in gifted and talented programs.<ref name=":0" /> Third, Hispanic’s average [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|NAEP]] math and reading scores have consistently increased over the last 10 years.<ref name=":0" /> Finally, Latina/os were more likely than other groups, including whites, to go to college.<ref name=":0" />

However, their academic achievement in early childhood, elementary, and secondary education lag behind other groups.<ref name=":0" /> For instance, their average math and reading [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|NAEP]] scores were lower than every other group, except African Americans, and have the highest dropout rate of any group, 13% despite decreasing from 24%.<ref name=":0" />

To explain these disparities, some scholars have suggested there is a Latino "Education Crisis" due to failed school and social policies.<ref name="GandaraContreras2009">{{cite book|author1=Patricia C. Gandara|author2=Frances Contreras|title=The Latino Education Crisis: The Consequences of Failed Social Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fT421tCslksC|accessdate=10 January 2016|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03127-2}}</ref> To this end, scholars have further offered several potential reasons including language barriers, poverty, and immigrant/nativity status resulting in Latinos not performing well academically.<ref>Fergus, E. (2009). Understanding Latino Students’ Schooling Experiences: The Relevance of Skin Color Among Mexican and Puerto Rican High School Students. Teachers College RecordCarter & Segura Ogbu Portes & MacLeod, 111(2), 339–375.

</ref>

==== English Language Learners ====

Currently, 80% of Hispanic students in the U.S. are [[English-language learner|English Language Learners]].<ref name="Hispanics: Education Issues">{{Cite web|url = http://www.nea.org/home/HispanicsEducation%20Issues.htm|title = Hispanics: Education Issues|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref> In 2008-9, 5.3 million students were classified as English Language Learners (ELLs) in pre-K to 12th grade.<ref name=":1">Becerra, D. (2012). Perceptions of educational barriers affecting the academic achievement of Latino K-12 students. Children and Schools, 34(3), 167–177. doi:10.1093/cs/cds001</ref> This is a result of many students entering the education system at different points of their life course, although the majority of ELLs are not foreign born.<ref name=":1" /> In order to provide English instruction for Latinos students there have been a multitude of English Language programs. However, the great majority of these programs are English Immersion that undermine the students’ culture and knowledge of their primary language.<ref>Gándara, P. (2015). With the future on the line: Why studying Latino education is so important. American Journal of Education, 121(3), 451–463. doi:10.1086/680411</ref> As such, there continues to be great debate within schools as to which program can address these language disparities.

====Poverty====

Poverty affects many underrepresented students as racial/ethnic minorities tend stay isolated with pockets of low-income communities. This results in several inequalities, such as "school offerings, teacher quality, curriculum, counseling and all manner of things that both keep students engaged in school and prepare them to graduate."<ref>Gándara, P. (2015). With the future on the line: Why studying Latino education is so important. American Journal of Education, 121(3), 454. doi:10.1086/680411</ref> In the case of Latinos the poverty rate for Hispanic Children in 2004 was 28.6 percent.<ref name="Hispanics: Education Issues"/> Moreover, with these lack of resources, schools reproduce these inequalities for generations to come. In order to assuage poverty, many Hispanic families can turn to social and community services as resources.

==== Immigration Status ====

Immigrants have not always had access to compulsory education in the United States. However, due to the Landmark Supreme Court [[Plyler v. Doe]] in 1982, immigrants are allowed access to K-12 education. This significantly impacted all immigrant groups, including Latina/os. However, their academic achievement is dependent upon several factors including, but not limited to time of arrival and schooling in country of origin.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.acenet.edu/the-presidency/columns-and-features/Pages/By-the-Numbers-ACE-Report-Identifies-Educational-Barriers-for-Hispanics.aspx|title = By the Numbers: ACE Report Identifies Educational Barriers for Hispanics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref> Moreover, Latinos immigration/nativity status plays a major role regarding their academic achievement. For instance, first- and second- generation Latinos outperform their later generational counterparts.<ref>Valenzuela, A. (1999). Subtractive Schooling: U.S. - Mexican Youth and the Politics of Caring. SUNY Press. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://books.google.com/books/about/Subtractive_Schooling.html?id=j9FrdWNw5TIC&pgis=1</nowiki></ref> Additionally, their aspirations appear to decrease as well.<ref>Wojtkiewicz, R. a., & Donato, K. M. (1995). Hispanic Educational Attainment: The Efects of Family Background and Nativiy. Social Forces, 74(2), 559–574.</ref> This has major implications on their postsecondary futures.

=== Hispanic or Latino Higher Education ===
[[File:Engineering building area.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[University of Texas at El Paso]] is the number one graduate [[engineering]] school for Latinos.]]
Those with a bachelor's degree or higher ranges from 50% of Venezuelans compared to 18% for Ecuadorians 25 years and older. Amongst the largest Hispanic groups, those with a bachelors or higher was 25% for Cuban Americans, 16% of Puerto Ricans, 15% of Dominicans, and 11% for Mexican Americans. Over 21% of all second-generation Dominican Americans have college degrees, slightly below the national average (28%) but significantly higher than U.S.-born Mexican Americans (13%) and U.S.-born Puerto Rican Americans (12%).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dominican Diaspora Revisited, Dominicans and Dominican-Americans in a New Century |last=Castro |first=Max J. |year=2002}}</ref>

Hispanic and Latinos make up the second or third largest ethnic group in [[Ivy League]] universities, considered to be the most prestigious in the United States. Hispanic and Latino enrollment at [[Ivy League]] universities has gradually increased over the years. Today, Hispanics make up between 8% of students at [[Yale University]] to 15% at [[Columbia University]].<ref name="nationaljournal.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/education/ivy-league-schools-don-t-reflect-u-s-minority-ratios-20121019 |title=Ivy League Schools Don't Reflect U.S. Minority Ratios |work=www.nationaljournal.com |accessdate=5 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318010853/http://www.nationaljournal.com:80/thenextamerica/education/ivy-league-schools-don-t-reflect-u-s-minority-ratios-20121019 |archivedate=March 18, 2015 }}</ref> For example, 18% of students in the [[Harvard University]] Class of 2018 are Hispanic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/5/9/record-number-matriculate-2018/|title=Record Number of African Americans, Latinos Matriculate as Yield Increases|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Hispanics have significant enrollment in many other top universities such as [[University of Texas at El Paso]] (70% of students),
[[Florida International University]] (63%), [[University of Miami]] (27%), and [[MIT]], [[UCLA]], & [[UC-Berkeley]] at 15% each.

The geographic, political, social, economic, and racial diversity of Hispanic and Latino Americans makes all Hispanics very different depending on their family heritage and/or national origin. Yet several features tend to unite Hispanics from these diverse backgrounds.

====American Spanish dialects====
{{see also|Isleño|New Mexican Spanish}}

The Spanish dialects spoken in the United States differ depending on the country of origin of the person or the person's family heritage. Generally, however, Spanish spoken in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] is [[Mexican Spanish]] (or [[Chicano|Chicano Spanish]]). An old, colonial variety of Spanish is spoken by descendants of the early Spanish colonists in [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]], which is [[New Mexican Spanish]]. One of the major distinctions of New Mexican Spanish is its heavy use of colonial vocabulary and verb tenses that make [[New Mexican Spanish]] uniquely American amongst Spanish dialects. The Spanish spoken in [[Florida]] and in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] is [[Caribbean Spanish]] and is heavily influenced by the Spanish of [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. [[Canarian Spanish]] is the historic Spanish dialect spoken by the descendants of the earliest Spanish colonists beginning in the 18th century in [[Louisiana]]. Spanish spoken elsewhere throughout the country varies, although is generally [[Mexican Spanish]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/spanish-foreign-language_n_3430860.html|title=8 Reasons Spanish Isn't A Foreign Language In The U.S. (SLIDESHOW)|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=12 June 2013}}</ref>

====Spanglish and English dialects====
{{main|Chicano English|Spanglish|Miami#Dialect|New York Latino English}}
{{see also|List of English words of Spanish origin}}

Hispanics have influenced the way Americans speak with the introduction of many Spanish words into the English language. Amongst younger generations of Hispanics, [[Spanglish]], or a mix of Spanish and English, may be a common way of speaking. Although they are fluent in both languages, speakers will switch between Spanish and English throughout the conversation. Spanglish is particularly common in Hispanic-majority cities and communities such as [[Miami]], [[Hialeah]], [[San Antonio]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/spanglish/book/|title=Do You Speak American . Sea to Shining Sea . American Varieties . Spanglish . Book - PBS|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Hispanics have also influenced the way English is spoken in the United States. In Miami, for example, the [[Miami#Dialect|Miami dialect]] has evolved as the most common form of English spoken and heard in Miami today. This is a native dialect of English, and was developed amongst second and third generations of [[Cuban American]]s in Miami. Today, it is commonly heard everywhere throughout the city. [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Enrique Iglesias]] are examples of people who speak with the Miami dialect. Another major English dialect, is spoken by [[Chicano]]s and [[Tejano]]s in the [[Southwestern United States]], called [[Chicano English]]. [[George Lopez]] and [[Selena]] are examples of speakers of Chicano English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-why-locals-embrace-heavy-l-or-not?nopop=1|title=Miami Accents: Why Locals Embrace That Heavy "L" Or Not|author=Patience Haggin|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> An English dialect spoken by Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic groups is called [[New York Latino English]].

=== Religion ===
[[File:José Horacio Gómez .jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[José Horacio Gómez]], [[Archbishop of Los Angeles]]. Hispanics are overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]].]]
The most methodologically rigorous study of Hispanic or Latino religious affiliation to date was the [http://web.archive.org/web/20110409083331/http://latinostudies.nd.edu:80/pubs/pubs/HispChurchesEnglishWEB.pdf Hispanic Churches in American Public Life] (HCAPL) National Survey, conducted between August and October 2000. This survey found that 70% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans are Catholic, 20% are Protestant, 3% are "alternative Christians" (such as [[Mormonism|Mormon]] or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]), 1% identify with a non-Christian religion (including [[Hispanic and Latino American Muslims|Muslims]], [[American Jews|Jewish]], [[Buddhism in the United States|Buddhist]]...<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2007/04/hispanics-religion-07-final-mar08.pdf |title=Latinos and the Transformation of american religion|accessdate= 2014-10-11 |publisher=}}</ref>), and 6% have no religious preference (with only 0.37% claiming to be atheist or agnostic). This suggests that Hispanics/Latinos are not only a highly religious, but also a highly Christian constituency.

It also suggests that Hispanic/Latino Protestants are a more sizable minority than sometimes realized. Catholic affiliation is much higher among first-generation than second- or third-generation Hispanic or Latino immigrants, who exhibit a fairly high rate of defection to Protestantism.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21602226-latinos-are-quitting-catholic-church-select-faith Select-a-faith: Latinos are quitting the Catholic church], economist.com.</ref> Also Hispanics and Latinos in the [[Bible Belt]], which is mostly located in the [[Southern United States|South]], are more likely to shift to Protestantism than those in other regions, as it is all around them.

===Cuisine===
[[File:CornmealProducts.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Mexican food]] has become part of the mainstream American market just as [[Italian food]] did so decades before.]]
Latino food, particularly Mexican has influenced [[American cuisine]] and eating habits. [[Mexican cuisine]] has become mainstream in American culture that many no longer see it as an ethnic food. Across the US, making [[tortilla]]s and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]] more common as fast food than hamburger buns and [[ketchup]]. [[Tortilla chip]]s have surpassed [[potato chip]]s in annual sales, and [[Chifle|plantain chips]] popular in [[Caribbean]] cuisines, have continued to increase sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/17/hispanic-influence-tortillas-take-over-burger-buns/|title=Hispanic influence: Tortillas take over burger buns as fast-food fave|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> [[Tropical fruit]], such as [[mango]], [[guava]], and [[passion fruit|passion fruit (maracuyá)]], have become more popular and are now common flavors in desserts, candies, and food dishes in the US.

Due to the large Mexican-American population in the Southwestern United States, and its proximity to [[Mexico]], Mexican food there is believed to be some of the best in the US. [[Cubans]] brought [[Cuban cuisine]] to [[Miami]], and today, [[cortado|cortaditos]], pastelitos de guayaba, and [[empanada]]s are common mid-day snacks in the city.

===Family life and values===
[[File:QuinceañeraSanFranValleBravo.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Quinceañera]] after a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], celebrating a daughter's 15th birthday, common amongst Hispanic families.]]
Hispanic and Latino culture places a strong value on family, and is commonly taught to Hispanic children as one of the most important values in life. Statistically, Hispanic families tend to have larger and closer knit families than the American average. Hispanic families tend to prefer to live near other family members. This may mean that three or sometimes four generations may be living in the same household or near each other, although four generations is uncommon in the US. The role of [[grandparent]]s is believed to be very important in the upbringing of children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grandparents.about.com/od/grandparentingtoday/a/hispanic_family.htm|title=Grandparents Important in Hispanic Family Structure|author=Susan Adcox|work=About.com Parenting|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Hispanics tend to be very group-oriented, and an emphasis is placed on the well-being of the family above the individual. The extended family plays an important part of many Hispanic families, and frequent social, family gatherings are common. Traditional rights of passages, particularly [[Roman Catholic]] [[sacrament]]s: such as  [[baptism]]s, birthdays, [[First Holy Communion]]s, [[quinceañera]]s, [[Confirmation]]s, [[graduation]]s, and [[wedding]]s are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in Hispanic families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|title=Hispanic Priorities: Marriage, Family and Youth|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2011/03/cultural-values-of-latino-patients-and-families/|title=Cultural Values of Latino Patients and Families|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Education is another important priority for Hispanic families. Education is seen as the key towards continued [[upward mobility]] in the US among Hispanic families. A 2010 study by the Associated Press showed that Hispanics place a higher emphasis on education than the average American. Hispanics expect their children to graduate university.<ref name="nancys.landale">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19902/|title=Hispanic Families in the United States: Family Structure and Process in an Era of Family Change - Hispanics and the Future of America - NCBI Bookshelf|author=Nancy S.

Latin American youth today stay at home with their parents longer than before. This is due to more years spent studying and the difficulty of finding a paid job that meets their aspirations.<ref>Brown, B. Bradford, Reed W. Larson, and Tharakad Subramanium Saraswathi, eds.

=== Intermarriage ===
Hispanic Americans, like immigrant groups before them, are out-marrying at high rates. Out-marriages comprised 17.4% of all existing Hispanic marriages in 2008.<ref name="Pew Social Trends: Marrying Out">[http://pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/755-marrying-out.pdf Pew Social Trends: "Marrying Out"] June 15, 2010</ref> The rate was higher for newlyweds (which excludes immigrants who are already married): Among all newlyweds in 2010, 25.7% of all Hispanics married a non-Hispanic (this compares to out-marriage rates of 9.4% of whites, 17.1% of blacks, and 27.7% of Asians). The rate was larger for native-born Hispanics, with 36.2% of native-born Hispanics (both men and women) out-marrying compared to 14.2% of foreign-born Hispanics.<ref name=PewRiseIntermarriage>[http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/16/the-rise-of-intermarriage/2/ Pew Research Social & Demographic Trends: "The Rise of Intermarriage - Rates, Characteristics Vary by Race and Gender" by Wendy Wang] February 16, 2012</ref> The difference is attributed to recent immigrants tending to marry within their immediate immigrant community due to commonality of language, proximity, familial connections, and familiarity.<ref name="Pew Social Trends: Marrying Out" />

In 2008, 81% of Hispanics who married out married non-Hispanic Whites, 9% married non-Hispanic Blacks, 5% non-Hispanic Asians, and the remainder married non-Hispanic, multi-racial partners.<ref name="Pew Social Trends: Marrying Out"/>

Of the 275,500 new intermarried pairings in 2010, 43.3% were White-Hispanic (compared to White-Asian at 14.4%, White-Black at 11.9%, and Other Combinations at 30.4%; other combinations consists of pairings between different minority groups, multi-racial people, and American Indians).<ref name=PewRiseIntermarriage /> Unlike those for marriage to Blacks and Asians, intermarriage rates of Hispanics to Whites do not vary by gender. The combined median earnings of White/Hispanic couples are lower than those of White/White couples but higher than those of Hispanic/Hispanic couples. 23% of Hispanic men who married White women have a college degree compared to only 10% of Hispanic men who married a Hispanic woman. 33% of Hispanic women who married a White husband are college-educated compared to 13% of Hispanic women who married a Hispanic man.<ref name=PewRiseIntermarriage />

Attitudes among non-Hispanics toward intermarriage with Hispanics are mostly favorable, with 81% of Whites, 76% of Asians, and 73% of Blacks "being fine" with a member of their family marrying a Hispanic and an additional 13% of Whites, 19% of Asians, and 16% of Blacks "being bothered but accepting of the marriage." Only 2% of Whites, 4% of Asians, and 5% of Blacks would not accept a marriage of their family member to a Hispanic.<ref name="Pew Social Trends: Marrying Out"/>

Hispanic attitudes toward intermarriage with non-Hispanics are likewise favorable, with 71% "being fine" with marriages to Whites and 81% "being fine" with marriages to Blacks. A further 22% admitted to "being bothered but accepting" of a marriage of a family member to a White and 16% admitted to "being bothered but accepting" of a marriage of a family member to a Black. Only 3% of Hispanics objected outright marriage of a family member to a non-Hispanic Black and 3% to a non-Hispanic White.<ref name="Pew Social Trends: Marrying Out"/>

Unlike intermarriage with other racial groups, intermarriage with non-Hispanic Blacks varies by nationality of origin. Puerto Ricans and Dominicans have by far the highest rates of intermarriage with blacks, of all major Hispanic national groups.<ref name="nancys.landale"/><ref>{{cite journal|format=PDF |author1=Sharon M.

===Political affiliations===
[[File:CHCcirca1984.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]], circa 1984]]
Hispanics and Latinos differ on their political views depending on their location and backgroun. The majority  (57%)<ref name=BG>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/12/10/gop_debaters_beckon_hispanics/ |title=GOP hopefuls beckon Hispanics in debate – The Boston Globe |accessdate=2008-06-08 |last=Levenson |first=Michael |date=2007-12-10 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref> either identify as or support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and 23% identify as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].<ref name=BG/> This 34-point gap as of December 2007 was an increase from the gap of 21 points 16 months earlier.

Cuban Americans and Colombian Americans tend to favor conservative political ideologies and support the Republicans. Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominican Americans tend to favor liberal views and support the Democrats. However, because the latter groups are far more numerous—as, again, Mexican Americans alone are 64% of Hispanics and Latinos—the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position with the ethnic group overall.

===Election results===
The presidency of [[George W. Bush]] had a significant influence on the political leanings of Hispanics and Latinos, as he attracted new supporters. As a former Governor of Texas, Bush regarded this growing community as a potential source of growth for the conservative movement and the Republican Party.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} He made some gains for the Republicans among the group.

====Elections of 1996-2006====
[[File:President Clinton's Latino Appointees.png|thumb|200px|left|President [[Bill Clinton]] and his Hispanic appointees in 1998]]
In the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], 72% of Hispanics and Latinos backed President [[Bill Clinton]]. In [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] the Democratic total fell to 62%, and went down again in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], with Democrat [[John Kerry]] winning Hispanics 58–40 against Bush.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/2012/11/2012_Latino_vote_exit_poll_analysis_final_11-07-12.pdf|title=The Hispanic Vote in Presidential Elections, 1980-2012|accessdate=2013-05-11|publisher=Pew Research Center}}</ref> Hispanics in the West, especially in California, were much stronger for the Democratic Party than in Texas and Florida. California Latinos voted 63–32 for Kerry in 2004, and both Arizona and New Mexico Latinos by a smaller 56–43 margin. Texas Latinos were split nearly evenly, favoring Kerry 50–49 over their favorite son candidate, and Florida Latinos (who are mostly Cuban American) backed Bush, by a 54–45 margin.

In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm election]], however, due to the unpopularity of the [[Iraq War]], the heated debate concerning [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal Hispanic immigration]], and Republican-related Congressional scandals, Hispanics and Latinos went as strongly Democratic as they have since the Clinton years. Exit polls showed the group voting for Democrats by a lopsided 69–30 margin, with Florida Latinos for the first time split evenly.

The runoff election in Texas' 23rd congressional district was seen as a bellwether of Latino politics. Democrat [[Ciro Rodriguez]]'s unexpected (and unexpectedly decisive) defeat of Republican incumbent [[Henry Bonilla]] was seen as proof of a leftward lurch among Latino voters; majority-Latino counties overwhelmingly backed Rodriguez, and majority European-American counties overwhelmingly backed Bonilla.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic primary]] Hispanics and Latinos participated in larger numbers than before, with [[Hillary Clinton]] receiving most of the group's support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.afrik.com/article12914.html |title=Obama gets another ally – Politics – United States – United Kingdom – International – Obama running for the White House – Africa |date=2008-03-22 |author=Daniel Dombey |author2=Andrew Ward |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref> Pundits discussed whether a large percentage of Hispanics and Latinos would vote for an African-American candidate, in this case [[Barack Obama]], Clinton's opponent.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/us/politics/15hispanic.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/R/Richardson,%20Bill In Obama’s Pursuit of Latinos, Race Plays Role] By Adam Nagourney and Jennifer Steinhauer, January 15, 2008, ''New York Times''</ref> Hispanics/Latinos voted 2 to 1 for Mrs. Clinton, even among the younger demographic.

Obama defeated Clinton. In the matchup between Obama and Republican candidate [[John McCain]] for the presidency, Hispanics and Latinos supported Obama with 59% to McCain's 29% in the [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] tracking poll as of June 30, 2008.<ref name=afp/> This surprised some analysts, since a higher than expected percentage of Latinos and Hispanics favored Obama over McCain, who had been a leader of the comprehensive immigration reform effort.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100901033154/http://www.hispanictips.com/2008/11/06/mccain-lost-ground-with-hispanics-despite-immigration-stance/ Hispanictips.com]</ref> However, McCain had retreated during the Republican primary, saying that he would not support the bill if it came up again.

In the general election, 67% of Hispanics and Latinos voted for Obama<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-11-06-hispanics_N.htm |title=Hispanic vote grows, shifts to Democrats – USATODAY.com |accessdate=2009-04-11 |last=Lawrence |first=Jill |date=2008-11-06 | work=USA Today}}</ref> and 31% voted for McCain,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1 | work=CNN | title=Local Exit Polls – Election Center 2008 – Elections & Politics from CNN.com | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref> with a relatively stronger turnout than in previous elections in states such as Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and [[Virginia]], helping Obama carry those formerly Republican states. Obama won 70% of non-Cuban Hispanics and 35% of the traditionally Republican Cuban Americans who have a strong presence in Florida. The changing state demographics, in which the non-Cuban Hispanic community is increasing in number, also contributed to his carrying Florida's Latinos with 57% of the vote.<ref name=usatoday/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/politics/6099797.html |title=In record turnout, Latino voters flip red states to blue |work= Houston Chronicle |accessdate=2009-04-11 |last=Carroll |first=Susan |date=2008-11-06}}</ref> Hispanics and Latinos also offset Republican gains in traditional red states; for example, Obama carried 63% of Texas Latinos, when the overall vote of the state was for McCain by 55%.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#TXP00p1 | work=CNN | title=Local Exit Polls – Election Center 2008 – Elections & Politics from CNN.com}}</ref>

Although during 2008 the economy and employment were top concerns for Hispanics and Latinos, immigration was "never far from their minds": almost 90% of Latino voters rated immigration as "somewhat important" or "very important" in a poll taken after the election.<ref name=usnews>{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2009/01/30/republicans-and-latino-voters-has-the-gop-shifted-on-immigration-reform.html?PageNr=2 |title=Republicans and Latino Voters: Has the GOP Shifted on Immigration Reform? - US News and World Report |accessdate=2009-04-08 |publisher=[[US News]] |first=Justin |last=Ewers}} [http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2009/01/30/republicans-and-latino-voters-has-the-gop-shifted-on-immigration-reform.html?PageNr=1 Page 1]</ref> There is "abundant evidence" that the heated Republican opposition to the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]] has done significant damage to the party's appeal to Hispanics and Latinos in the years to come, especially in the [[swing state]]s such as Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico.<ref name=usnews/> In a [[Gallup poll]] of 4,604 registered Hispanic voters taken in the final days of June 2008, only 18% of participants identified as Republicans.<ref name=afp>{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gJyH1GO3NGTeG0KIQjK8-P98ktwg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118173624/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gJyH1GO3NGTeG0KIQjK8-P98ktwg |archivedate=2010-11-18 |title=AFP: Obama dominates McCain among Hispanics: poll |accessdate=2009-04-09}}</ref>

Some political organizations associated with Hispanic and Latino Americans are [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC), the [[National Council of La Raza]] (NCLR), the [[United Farm Workers]], the [[Cuban American National Foundation]], and the [[National Institute for Latino Policy]].

Hispanic and Latinos voted even more heavily for Democrats in the 2012 election with the Democratic incumbent Barack Obama receiving 71% and the Republican challenger Mitt Romney receiving about 27% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://njtoday.net/2012/11/27/opinion-the-latino-vote-in-2012-and-the-depth-of-the-gop-problem/|title=[OPINION] The Latino Vote In 2012 and the Depth Of The GOP Problem|work=njtoday.net|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57552681/are-republican-immigration-reform-opponents-losing-clout|title=Are Republican immigration reform opponents losing clout?|date=23 November 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015|work=CBS News}}</ref>

==Cultural issues==

=== Hispanophobia ===
{{Main|Hispanophobia|Anti-Mexican sentiment}}
[[Hispanophobia]] has existed in various degrees throughout U.S. history, based largely on ethnicity, race, culture, [[Anti-Catholicism]], economic and social conditions in [[Latin America]], and use of the [[Spanish language]].<ref>[http://amath.colorado.edu/carnegie/lit/lynch/migrant.htm Lynching and Violence in America: Migrant Workers] {{wayback|url=http://amath.colorado.edu/carnegie/lit/lynch/migrant.htm |date=20080114020946 }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061208043359/http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/press3b.htm press3b]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/21.1/forum_wilson.html |title=History Cooperative |publisher= |accessdate=5 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930061850/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/21.1/forum_wilson.html |archivedate=September 30, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030822003427/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/mexican_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=104 Digital History]</ref> In 2006, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' reported that the number of hate groups in the United States increased by 33 percent since 2000, primarily due to anti-illegal immigrant and anti-Mexican sentiment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1198895,00.html|title=How Immigration is Rousing the Zealots|date=29 May 2006|work=TIME.com|accessdate=5 March 2015|first=Jeffrey|last=Ressner}}</ref> According to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] statistics, the number of anti-Latino hate crimes increased by 35 percent since 2003 (albeit from a low level). In California, the state with the largest Latino population, the number of hate crimes against Latinos almost doubled.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2007/12/5/fbi_statistics_show_anti_latino_hate Democracy Now! | FBI Statistics Show Anti-Latino Hate Crimes on the Rise] December 5, 2007</ref>

For the year 2009, the FBI reported that 483 of the 6,604 [[hate crimes]] committed in the [[United States]] were anti-Hispanic comprising 7.3% of all hate crimes. This compares to 34.6% of hate crimes being anti-Black, 17.9% being anti-Homosexual, 14.1% being anti-Jewish, and 8.3% being anti-White.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2009/data/table_01.html|title=Table 1|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

=== Relations with other minority groups ===
As a result of the rapid growth of the Hispanic population, there has been some tension with other minority populations,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/us/13race.html New York Times: "Survey Points to Tensions Among Chief Minorities" by JULIA PRESTON] December 13, 2007</ref> especially the [[African American]] population, as Hispanics have increasingly moved into once exclusively Black areas.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0525/p01s03-ussc.html Christian Science Monitor: "Rising black-Latino clash on jobs"] May 25, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/us/politics/15hispanic.html New York Times: "In Obama’s Pursuit of Latinos, Race Plays Role"] January 15, 2008</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/07/opinion/op-hernandez7 Los Angeles Times: "Roots of anger Longtime prejudices, not economic rivalry, fuel Latino-black tensions"] January 07, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/9587776?story_id=9587776 The Economist:"Where black and brown collide: The struggle for political dominance"] August 2, 2007</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103093723/http://www.dailypress.com/bv-hispanics010320,0,4967522.story The Daily Press: "Hispanic Influx Causes Tensions with Blacks"] February 27, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/08/16/mexican-attacks-inflame-tensions-nyc-island/ FoxNews: "Alleged Bias Attacks Inflame Tensions in New York City"] August 16, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/20/AR2006022000976.html Washington Post: "Jail Riots Illustrate Racial Divide in California"] February 21, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4653328 National Public Radio: "Racial Tension at Los Angeles High School"] May 16, 2005.</ref><ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-11-04-minorities-south_x.htm USA Today: "Blacks, Latinos in the South: Cooperation or confrontation?"] November 4, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0126-compton-20130126,0,977110.story Los Angeles Times: "Attack on family in Compton latest incident in wave of anti-black violence - A Latino gang is intimidating blacks into leaving the city that was once an African American enclave.

* A 2007 [[UCLA]] study reported that 51% of Blacks felt that Hispanics were taking jobs and political power from them and 44% of Hispanics said they feared African-Americans identifying them (African Americans) with high crime rates. That said, large majorities of Hispanics credited American blacks and the civil rights movement with making life easier for them in the US.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/us/13race.html New York Times: "Survey Points to Tensions Among Chief Minorities"] December 13, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.c3.ucla.edu/newsstand/national/poll-explores-racial-tensions-among-minority-groups/ UCLA Center for Communications & Community] December 13, 2007</ref>
* A [[Pew Research Center]] poll from 2006 showed that Blacks overwhelmingly felt that Hispanic immigrants were hard working (78%) and had strong family values (81%) but also that they believed that immigrants took jobs from Americans (34%) with a significant minority of Blacks (22%) believing that they had directly lost a job to an immigrant and 34% of Blacks wanting immigration to be curtailed. The report also surveyed three cities: [[Chicago]] (with its well-established Latino community); [[Washington DC]] (with a less-established but quickly growing Hispanic community); and [[Raleigh-Durham]] (with a very new but rapidly growing Hispanic community). The results showed that a significant proportion of Blacks in those cities wanted immigration to be curtailed: Chicago (46%), Raleigh-Durham (57%), and Washington DC (48%).<ref>[http://www.pewresearch.org/2006/04/25/attitudes-toward-immigration-in-black-and-white/ Pew Research Center: "Attitudes Toward Immigration: In Black and White"] April 26, 2006</ref>
* Per a 2008 [[University of California, Berkeley]] Law School research brief, a recurring theme to Black / Hispanic tensions is the growth in "contingent, flexible, or contractor labor," which is increasingly replacing long term steady employment for jobs on the lower-rung of the pay scale (which had been disproportionately filled by Blacks). The transition to this employment arrangement corresponds directly with the growth in the Latino immigrant population. The perception is that this new labor arrangement has driven down wages, removed benefits, and rendered temporary, jobs that once were stable (but also benefiting consumers who receive lower-cost services) while passing the costs of labor (healthcare and indirectly education) onto the community at large.<ref>[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Saucedo_African_Am_Immigrant_Tensions_Final_brief.pdf University of Berkeley Law School: Research Brief "Labor arrangement corresponds with the growth in the Latino immigrant population"] July 2008</ref>
* A 2008 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll indicated that 60% of Hispanics and 67% of blacks believe that good relations exist between US blacks and Hispanics<ref name=Gallup2008>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/108868/whites-may-exaggerate-blackhispanic-tensions.aspx Gallup: "Whites May Exaggerate Black-Hispanic Tensions" by Lydia Saad] July 17, 2008</ref> while only 29% of blacks, 36% of Hispanics, and 43% of whites, say Black–Hispanic relations are bad.<ref name=Gallup2008 />
* In 2009, in [[Los Angeles County]], Latinos committed 77% of the hate crimes against black victims and blacks committed half of the hate crimes against Latinos.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/hate-crimes-in-la-county-down-overall-anti-jewish-vandalism-rises.html Los Angeles Times: "Hate crimes in L.A.
