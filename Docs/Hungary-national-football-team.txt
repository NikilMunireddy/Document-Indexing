The '''Hungary national football team''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar labdarúgó-válogatott}}) represents [[Hungary]] in international [[Association football|football]] and is controlled by the [[Hungarian Football Federation]].

Hungary has a respectable football history, having won three Olympic titles, finishing runners-up in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup]]s, and third in the [[1964 UEFA European Football Championship]]. Hungary revolutionised the sport in the 1950s, laying the tactical fundamentals of [[Total Football]] and dominating international football with the remarkable [[Magical Magyars|Golden Team]] which included legend [[Ferenc Puskás]], top goalscorer of the 20th century,<ref name="FIFA benefit">{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/president/index/0,4095,110412,00.html?articleid=110412|title=FIFA President: FIFA to help the Galloping Major|publisher=[[FIFA]]|date=12 October 2005|accessdate=2006-11-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061007122035/http://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/president/index/0,4095,110412,00.html?articleid=110412 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 October 2006}}</ref><ref name="Spanish obit">{{cite web|url=http://www.as.com/articulo/Futbol/Coronel/Puskas/zurdo/oro/dasftb/20061117dasdasftb_2/Tes/|title=Coronel Puskas, el zurdo de oro|language=Spanish|publisher=''[[AS (newspaper)|AS]]''|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref><ref name="Puskás auction">{{cite news|url = http://sport.guardian.co.uk/golf/story/0,10069,1590809,00.html|last = Mackay|first = Duncan|publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]]|title = Lineker tees up another nice little earner|date = 13 October 2005|accessdate = 2006-11-17|location=London}}</ref> whom FIFA dedicated<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/news/newsid=1120835.html Blatter unveils FIFA Puskas Award] {{wayback|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/news/newsid=1120835.html |date=20091213054051 |df=y }}</ref> its newest award, the [[FIFA Ferenc Puskás Award|Puskás Award]]. The side of that era has the second [[World Football Elo Ratings#All-time highest ratings|all-time highest Football Elo Ranking in the world]], with 2166 in 1954, and one of the longest undefeated runs in football history, remaining unbeaten in 31 games, spanning over 4 years and including matches such as [[England v Hungary (1953)|the Match of the Century]].

==History==
Although Austria and Hungary were constituent countries of the dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, they formed separate [[football association]]s and teams around the start of the 20th century.
[[File:Hajos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfréd Hajós]], who won two gold medals in [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle|swimming]] in the first [[Olympic Games]] in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], was one of the first managers of the national team]]

===1910s===

[[File:Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics - UK v.s. Hungary.JPG|thumb|left|Hungary versus [[Great Britain national football team|Great Britain]] at the [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympics]]]]
The national side first appeared at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. The team had to ask for donations in order to be able to go to the games. Hungary played with [[England national football team|England]] and lost 7–0 and thus were eliminated.
After the Olympic Games Hungary played two matches against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in [[Moscow]]. The first match was won by 9–0 while the second 12–0 which is still a record of the national side. The top scorer of the two matches was [[Imre Schlosser]] who scored seven goals. The beginning of [[World War I]] had a deep impact on the thriving Hungarian football. Not only was the country suffering financial problems but the clubs were too. During [[World War I]] Hungary played [[Austria national football team|Austria]] 16 times. In 1919 England claimed the exclusion of the [[Central Powers]] (including Hungary) from [[FIFA]]. Since FIFA refused England's plea, the British and the [[Irish Football Association|Irish]] associations ([[The Football Association|English]], [[The Scottish FA|Scottish]], [[Welsh Football Association|Welsh]]) decided to resign from FIFA.

===1920s===
[[File:Wawrzynieccyl.png|200px|thumb|right|[[Poland national football team|Poland]]-Hungary in 1924]]
Budapest was denied the opportunity to host the Summer Olympics in 1920, therefore it was held in [[1920 Summer Olympics|Belgium]]. Moreover, the countries of the [[Central Powers]] (Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Bulgaria]]) were excluded from the Olympics. During this period the Fogl brothers ([[József Fogl]] and [[Károly Fogl]]) played in the national team. The formation the Hungarians used was 2–3–5 which was unique at that time. In 1924 The national team played at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], France. In the first match Hungary beat [[Poland national football team|Poland]] but in the second round they lost to [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]]. As a consequence, both the head coach and the head of the [[Hungarian Football Federation]] resigned.
Between 1927 and 1930 Hungary participated in the Europa Cup, which is considered as the first international tournament, with [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], [[Russia national football team|Russia]], and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. In the final Hungary lost to Russia.
On 12 June 1927 Hungary beat [[France national football team|France]] by 13–1 which is still a record. [[József Takács]] scored six goals against France.

===1990s===
[[File:Dunai Antal 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antal Dunai]]'s team qualified for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]]]
During the 1990s Hungary were not able to qualify for any international tournaments except for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Atlanta]], the United States. The 1980s were considered as the most bitter years of the Hungarian football, but the 1990s proved to be the worst. In 1996 Hungary reached its lowest [[FIFA ranking]] (87). The fall of the [[Communist]] regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencváros]] and [[Újpest FC|Újpest]] faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This had a profound effect on the Hungarian national team as well since earlier the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencváros, Újpest, Honvéd and MTK) produced the players for the national side. Another important reason for the decline can be attributed to the [[Bosman ruling]]. Since the Hungarian clubs lost the financial aid from the state in the early 1990s, they were not able to compete with the richer Western European clubs. The crisis in the Hungarian club football affected the performance of the national team.<br/>
The Hungarian legend [[Ferenc Puskás|Puskás]] was appointed as the head coach of the national side in 1993 in order to bring back earlier success. However, he led the team during only four matches. Consequently, the coaching of the former [[Budapest Honvéd FC|Honvéd]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] legend could not change anything. The only remarkable success in the 1990s was the qualification of the Hungarian national team for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. [[Antal Dunai|Dunai]]'s team played its first group match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] and lost to 1–0 in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197142/matches/match=32224/report.html|title=Nigeria – Hungary 1:0 (0:0)|publisher=FIFA|date=21 July 1996|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> In the second group match Hungary played with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and lost to 3–1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197142/matches/match=32231/report.html|title=Brazil – Hungary 3:1 (1:0)|publisher=FIFA|date=23 July 1996|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> The only Hungarian goal was scored by [[Csaba Madar|Madar]]. The last group match was played against [[Japan national football team|Japan]].

Although the Olympic qualification of the young team was a big surprise and people thought that Hungary would have a better future in football history, the team never reached any similar success later.<br/>
In the 1990s Hungary were the closest to qualify for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] but they were eliminated in the play-offs by [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|FR Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1013/preliminaries/preliminary=893/index.html|title=1998 FIFA World Cup France Preliminaries|publisher=FIFA|date=19 October 1997|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>

===2000s===
[[File:Gera2011.png|thumb|right|[[Zoltán Gera]] in national team in November 2011]]
The most talented players of the 2000s were [[Zoltán Gera|Gera]] and [[Pál Dárdai|Dárdai]]. Both played abroad (Gera in the [[Premier League]] for [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]] and [[Fulham F.C.]], while Dárdai in the [[Bundesliga (football)|Bundesliga]] for [[Hertha BSC]]). However, other significant players did not emerge in order to form a strong national team which resulted the consecutive failures of the qualification for the international competitions in the 2000s. Hungary were unable to qualify for the [[UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA Euro]] [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]], [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]], [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]] and for [[FIFA World Cup]] [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. Moreover, during the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|UEFA Euro 2008 qualification]] Hungary finished sixth in their group reaching their nadir in their football history. They even lost to [[Malta national football team|Malta]] which resulted the resignation of [[Péter Bozsik|Bozsik]]. Couple of days later [[Péter Várhidi|Várhidi]] was appointed who was famous for his appearances in the [[Sport 1 (Europe)|Sport 1]], Hungarian sport television, and analysing the Italian [[Serie A]] clubs. He proved his talent by beating the 2006 FIFA World Champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] by 3–1 at the [[Ferenc Puskás Stadium]] in a friendly tie. However, neither Bozsik nor Várhidi could do well in the official matches which resulted their removal.

The [[Hungarian Football Federation]] even tried out foreign coaches. Both [[Lothar Matthäus|Matthäus]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=133727.html|title=Matthäus quits Partizan for Hungary|date=15 December 2003|publisher=[[Uefa.com]]}}</ref> and [[Erwin Koeman|Koeman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=687652.html|title=Koeman handed Hungarian posting|date=24 April 2008|publisher=[[Uefa.com]]}}</ref> failed to qualify for any tournaments.

In the 2000s only the [[Hungary national under-20 football team|Hungary]] U-20 team could bring back the emotions of the early years. Hungary won a bronze medal in the [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[Egypt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u20worldcup/egypt2009/results/index.html|title=2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup|date=10 November 2009|publisher=FIFA}}</ref> The new talents of the U-20 team were immediately signed by foreign clubs. [[Vladimir Koman|Koman]] to [[Sampdoria]], [[Krisztián Németh|Németh]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Ádám Simon (footballer born 1990)|Simon]] to [[US Palermo|Palermo]]. However, the big question was whether they can develop enough to be able to play in the senior team.

== Rivalry ==
{{Main|Hungary–Romania football rivalry}}
Hungary has a long-standing rivalry with her neighbor, [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. The rivalry between the two nations dates back from the [[Treaty of Trianon]], where Hungary lost [[Transylvania]] in favor of Romania, after [[World War I]]. Every time the two sides met, they threw flares and matches between the two sides usually end in a fight between Hungarian and Romanian supporters, however, recently also before the matches conflicts have emerged outside the stadium. These was seen as they shared the same group in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying|2014 World Cup qualifying]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].
{{Main|Austria–Hungary football rivalry}}
The match-up between Austria and Hungary is the second most-played international in football (only Argentina vs Uruguay met each other in more matches).

==Home stadia==

==Colours and kits==

Hungary's traditional home colurs are red shirts, white shorts and green socks. The combination of the colours represent the Hungarian flag. However, the team sometimes wears all white kit even at home. The coat of arms are worn on the left side of the shirt, where the human heart can be found. When the Hungarian players listen to the [[national anthem of Hungary]], [[Himnusz]], they put their arms on to their chest. The national anthem is considered beautiful by Hungarians but many football fans criticize it because of its melancholy which can have an effect on the players. The actual coat of arms could have always been found on the shirt of the national team in contrast with many other national teams which wear the logo of the football federation. [[Adidas]] is currently has been the main designer of the Hungary kits.

===Summer Olympics===
The first 3 Olympic football events were only unofficial tournaments, with a few nations represented by a club team. Starting from 1908, the Olympic football tournament became an official event, with representation of the official national football teams.

After the Olympics 1988, the football event was changed into a tournament, with participation only for the Under-23 national teams.

==Records==
[[File:Puskas Top scorer of 20th century.JPG|thumb|Puskás, Top scorer of the 20th century]]
The match between [[Austria national football team|Austria]] and Hungary in [[Vienna]] in 1902 was the first international match played between two non-British [[Europe]]an countries.

Hungary was the first team from outside the United Kingdom and [[Ireland]] to beat [[England national football team|England]] at home, famously [[England v Hungary (1953)|winning 6–3]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley]] on 25 November 1953. Six months later they beat England [[England v Hungary (1953)#Return fixture|7–1]] in 1954, this time in [[Budapest]]. This still ranks as England's record defeat.

The trainer responsible for gelling together the elements of the Hungarian side on the 1950s, [[Gusztáv Sebes]] holds the highest ratio of victories per game past 30 matches with 72.06% (49 wins, 12, draws, 7 defeats). Brazil great Vicente Feola (1955–1966) owns the second highest with 71.88% (46 wins, 12 draws, 6 defeats).

Hungary owns the records for quality in offensive throughput in a single World Cup finals competition. Football historians often relate to the 27 goals (5.4 gls / game) and a goal differential of +17 as records likely never to be passed in the more preventive modern game.
[[Sándor Kocsis]], along with his record 7 [[hat tricks]] in the international game, owns the single World Cup finals competition's record with 2.2 goals/match. In 1953, they also became Central European Champions

Hungary had the distinction of setting the then highest [[World Football Elo Ratings|Elo football rating]] of 2166 in 1954, a record that stood for 60 years until it was bettered by [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]]. It was set after Hungary's 4–2 victory over [[Uruguay National Football Team|Uruguay]] in the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] semi-final on 30 June 1954, the final match in their 31-game unbeaten streak (see below). They also own the third highest rating of 2156, set in 1956. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] owns the fourth highest with 2153, and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] with 2142 is the fifth.

[[Ferenc Puskás]] was recognized to be the top scorer of the 20th century, by the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics|IFFHS]].

===Top international goalscorers of the 20th century===

Two of the top six international goalscorers of the 20th century were Hungarian, both of them from the Golden Team of the 1950s. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Undefeated run===

Hungary, with its master narrative of being undefeated in the 1950s also broke one of football's timeless benchmarks being first to eclipse an 1888 [[Scotland national football team]] record of being undefeated in 22 consecutive matches. They bettered the old mark by nine additional games to 31 (or 32 counting the match against East Germany, that is not considered an official international for that team). Hungary holds the third longest consecutive run of matches unbeaten with 31 international games between 14 May 1950 and 4 July 1954, when they lost the World Cup final to Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesh/hong-intres.html |title=Hungary – list of international matches |publisher=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>

[[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] hold the longest string of 35 unbeaten matches.
