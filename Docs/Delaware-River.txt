The '''Delaware River''' is a major river on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the [[United States]]. Its watershed drains an area of {{convert|14119|sqmi}} in five [[U.S. state]]s—[[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]]. Rising in two branches in New York state's [[Catskill Mountains]], the river flows {{convert|419|mi}} into [[Delaware Bay]] where its waters enter the Atlantic Ocean near [[Cape May]] in New Jersey and [[Cape Henlopen]] in Delaware. Not including Delaware Bay, the river's length including its two branches is {{convert|388|mi}}.<ref>The main stem from Hancock, New York to the head of Delaware Bay is {{convert|301|mi}}.</ref><ref name=NHD>U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed April 1, 2011</ref>
The Delaware River is one of nineteen "Great Waters" recognized by the America's Great Waters Coalition.<ref>{{cite news|author= National Wildlife Federation |title=America's Great Waters Coalition|date= August 18, 2010|url= http://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/What-We-Do/Waters/Great-Waters-Restoration/Great-Waters-Coalition.aspx|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

The Delaware River rises in two main branches that descend from the western flank of the [[Catskill Mountains]] in New York. The [[West Branch Delaware River|West Branch]] begins near [[Mount Jefferson (New York)|Mount Jefferson]] in the [[Jefferson, New York|Town of Jefferson]] in [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]]. The river's [[East Branch Delaware River|East Branch]] begins at Grand Gorge near [[Roxbury, New York|Roxbury]]
[[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]]. These two branches flow west and merge near [[Hancock, New York|Hancock]] in [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]] and the combined waters flow as the Delaware River south. Through its course, the Delaware River forms the boundaries between [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York]], the entire boundary between [[New Jersey]] and Pennsylvania, and most of the boundary between [[Delaware]] and New Jersey. The river meets tide-water at the junction of [[Morrisville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Morrisville, Pennsylvania]] and [[Trenton, New Jersey]] at the Falls of the Delaware. The river's navigable, tidal section served as a conduit for shipping and transportation that aided the development of the industrial cities of Trenton, [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], and [[Philadelphia]]. The mean freshwater discharge of the Delaware River into the estuary of Delaware Bay is 11,550&nbsp;cubic feet (330&nbsp;m³) per second.

In 1609, the river was first visited by a [[Dutch East India Company]] expedition led by [[Henry Hudson]]. Hudson, an English navigator, was hired to find a western route to [[Cathay]] (present-day China), but his discoveries set the stage for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization of North America]] in the seventeenth-century. Early Dutch and Swedish settlements were established along the lower section of river and [[Delaware Bay]]. Both [[colonialism|colonial powers]] called the river the ''South River'' compared to the Hudson River which was known as the ''North River''. After the English expelled the Dutch and took control of the New Netherland colony in 1664, the river was renamed ''Delaware'' after [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Sir Thomas West]] [[Earl De La Warr|3rd Baron De La Warr]], an English nobleman and the Virginia colony's first royal governor who defended the colony during the [[First Anglo-Powhatan War]].

==Origin of the name==
[[File:3rdLordDeLaWarr.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]]
The Delaware River is named in honor of THOMAS WEST THE 3RD DE LA WEAR(1577–1618), an English nobleman and the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia colony's]] [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|first royal governor]] who defended the colony during the [[First Anglo-Powhatan War]].<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|no-icon=1|first=Albert Frederick|last=Pollard|wstitle=West, Thomas (1577-1618)|volume=60|pages=344-345}}</ref> Lord de la Warr waged a [[Punitive expedition|punitive campaign]] to subdue the [[Powhatan]] after they had killed the colony's council president, [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|John Ratcliffe]], and attacked the colony's fledgling settlements.<ref>Tyler, Lyon Gardiner (editor).

It has often been reported that the river and bay received the name "Delaware" after [[English colonial empire|English]] forces under [[Richard Nicolls]] expelled the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] and took control of the [[New Netherland|New Netherland colony]] in 1664.<ref>World Digital Library.

The name also became used as a collective name for the [[Lenape]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people (and their [[Delaware languages|language]]) who inhabited an area of the basins of the [[Susquehanna River]], Delaware River, and lower [[Hudson River]] in the [[northeastern United States]] at the time of European settlement.<ref>Schutt, Amy C.

==Course==

===West Branch of the Delaware===
[[File:Delaware headwaters map.png|thumb|left|The headwaters of the Delaware River including the river's East and West Branches and other tributaries]]
The [[West Branch Delaware River|West Branch of the Delaware River]] (also called the ''Mohawk Branch'') spans approximately {{convert|90|mi|km}} from the northern [[Catskill Mountains]] to where it joins in confluence with the Delaware River's East Branch at [[Hancock (town), New York|Hancock, New York]]. The last {{convert|6|mi|km}} forms part of [[New York–Pennsylvania border|the boundary between New York and Pennsylvania]].

The West Branch rises in [[Schoharie County, New York]] at {{convert|1886|ft}} above sea level, near [[Mount Jefferson (New York)|Mount Jefferson]], and flows tortuously through the plateau in a deep trough. The branch flows generally southwest, entering [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]] and flowing through the towns of [[Stamford (town), New York|Stamford]] and [[Delhi (town), New York|Delhi]]. In southwestern Delaware County it flows in an increasingly winding course through the mountains, generally southwest. At [[Stilesville, New York|Stilesville]] the West Branch was impounded in the 1960s to form the [[Cannonsville Reservoir]], the westernmost of the reservoirs in the New York City water system. It is the most recently constructed New York City reservoir and began serving the city in 1964. Draining a large watershed of {{convert|455|sqmi}}, the reservoir's capacity is {{convert|95.7|e9USgal|m3}}. This water flows over halfway through the reservoir to enter the {{convert|44|mi|km|adj=on}} [[West Delaware Tunnel]] in [[Tompkins, New York]]. Then it flows through the aqueduct into the [[Rondout Reservoir]], where the water enters the {{convert|85|mi|km}} [[Delaware Aqueduct]], that contributes to roughly 50% of the city's drinking water supply. At [[Deposit (town), New York|Deposit]], on the border between [[Broome County, New York|Broome]] and Delaware counties, it turns sharply to the southeast and is paralleled by [[New York State Route&nbsp;17]]. It joins the East Branch at {{convert|880|ft}} above sea level at [[Hancock (town), New York|Hancock]] to form the Delaware.

===East Branch of the Delaware===
[[File:East Branch Delaware River at Margaretville, NY.jpg|thumb|right|The East Branch of the Delaware River near Margaretville, New York]]
Similarly, the [[East Branch Delaware River|East Branch]] begins from a small pond south of [[Grand Gorge, New York|Grand Gorge]] in the [[Town (New York)|town]] of [[Roxbury, New York|Roxbury]] in [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]], flowing southwest toward its impoundment by New York City to create the [[Pepacton Reservoir]], the largest reservoir in the [[New York City water supply system]]. Its tributaries are the Beaver Kill River and the Willowemoc Creek which enter into the river ten miles (16&nbsp;km) before the West Branch meets the East Branch. The [[confluence]] of the two branches is just south of [[Hancock (village), New York|Hancock]].

Both the East Branch and West Branch of the Delaware River parallel each other, both flowing in a southwesterly direction.

===Upper Delaware Valley===
[[File:Hawk's Nest view of DelawareR.jpg|thumb|left|Canoeing on the river at [[Hawk's Nest, New York]]]]
From Hancock, New York, the river flows between the northern [[The Poconos|Pocono Mountains]] in Pennsylvania, and the lowered shale beds north of the Catskills. The river flows down a broad [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] valley, passing [[Hawk's Nest, New York|Hawk's Nest overlook]] on the Upper Delaware Scenic Byway. The river flows southeast for 78 miles through rural regions along the New York-Pennsylvania border to Port Jervis and the [[Shawangunk Mountains]].<!--{{rp|p.9}}
* Mongaup River
* Neversink River-->

===The Minisink===
{{See also|Minisink}}
At [[Port Jervis, New York]], it enters the Port Jervis trough. At this point, the Walpack Ridge deflects the Delaware into the Minisink Valley, where it follows the southwest [[Strike and dip|strike]] of the eroded [[Marcellus Formation]] [[bed (geology)|beds]] along the Pennsylvania–New Jersey state line for {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the end of the ridge at Walpack Bend in the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]].<ref name=White>{{cite web |url=http://www.njgeology.org/enviroed/newsletter/v2n1.pdf |title= Karst in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area |author1=White, Ron W. |author2=Monteverde, Donald H. |format= pdf|work= Unearthing New Jersey Vol. 2, No. 1 | date=Feb 2006 |accessdate=June 7, 2008|publisher=New Jersey Geological Survey}}</ref><ref name=White1882>{{cite book| author = White, I.C. |author2=Chance, H.M. | year = 1882 | title = The geology of Pike and Monroe counties | series = Second Geol. Surv. of Penna. | location = Harrisburg | volume = Rept. of Progress, G6 | pages = 17, 73–80, 114–115}}</ref>
The Minisink is a [[buried valley]] where the Delaware flows in a bed of [[glacier|glacial]] [[till]] that buried the eroded bedrock during the [[last glacial period]]. It then skirts the [[Kittatinny Mountains|Kittatinny ridge]], which it crosses at the [[Delaware Water Gap]], between nearly vertical walls of [[sandstone]], [[quartzite]], and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], and then passes through a quiet and charming country of farm and forest, diversified with plateaus and escarpments, until it crosses the Appalachian plain and enters the hills again at [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]. From this point it is flanked at intervals by fine hills, and in places by cliffs, of which the finest are the Nockamixon Rocks, {{convert|3|mi|0}} long and above {{convert|200|ft}} high.

The [[Appalachian Trail]], which traverses the ridge of Kittatinny Mountain in New Jersey, and Blue Mountain in Pennsylvania, crosses the Delaware River at the Delaware Water Gap near Columbia, New Jersey.

===Central Delaware Valley===
[[File:2014-05-12 12 17 50 View of the "Falls of the Delaware" and downtown Trenton, New Jersey from Morrisville, Pennsylvania.JPG|thumb|left|The "Falls" at Trenton]]

At Easton, Pennsylvania, the [[Lehigh River]] enters the Delaware. At [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] there is a fall of {{convert|8|ft}}.

===The Lower Delaware and Tide-Water===
[[File:Delaware River New Castle.jpg|thumb|right|The lower Delaware as viewed from New Castle, Delaware]]
Below Trenton the river flows between [[Philadelphia]] and [[New Jersey]] before becoming a broad, sluggish inlet of the sea, with many marshes along its side, widening steadily into its great estuary, [[Delaware Bay]].

The Delaware River constitutes the boundary between Delaware and New Jersey. The Delaware-New Jersey border is actually at the easternmost river shoreline within the [[Twelve-Mile Circle|Twelve-Mile Circle of New Castle]], rather than mid-river or mid-channel borders, causing small portions of land lying west of the shoreline, but on the New Jersey side of the river, to fall under the jurisdiction of Delaware. The rest of the borders follow a mid-channel approach.

==History==
[[File:Treaty of Penn with Indians by Benjamin West.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Benjamin West's painting ''The Treaty of Penn with the Indians' (1771–1772), depicts the 1683 peace treaty at Shackamaxon between William Penn and Tamanend, the chief of the Lenape's "Turtle Clan."  Voltaire referred to it as "the only treaty never sworn to and never broken."]]

The Delaware River played a key factor in the economic and social development of the Mid-Atlantic region. In the seventeenth century it provided the conduit for colonial settlement by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] ([[New Netherland]]), the [[Swedish colonial empire|Swedish]] ([[New Sweden]]). Beginning in 1664, the region became an [[English colonial empire|English possession]] as settlement by Quakers established the colonies of [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] (including present-day [[Delaware]]) and [[Province of West Jersey|West Jersey]]. In the eighteenth century, cities like [[Philadelphia]], [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] (then Cooper's Ferry), [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], and [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]] were established upon the Delaware and their continued commercial success into the present day has been dependent on access to the river for trade and power. The river provided the path for the settlement of northeastern Pennsylvania's [[Lehigh Valley]], and northwestern New Jersey by [[German Palatine]] immigrants—a population that became key in the agricultural development of the region.

===Washington's crossing of the Delaware===

{{Main|Washington's crossing of the Delaware}}

Perhaps the most famous "Delaware Crossing" involved the improvised boat crossing undertaken by [[George Washington]]'s army during the [[American Revolution]] on the night of December&nbsp;25–26, 1776. This led to a successful surprise attack on the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian troops]] occupying [[Trenton, New Jersey]].

===Canals===
[[File:Delaware and Hudson Canal near Summitville, NY.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A remaining section of the Delaware and Hudson Canal seen from [[U.S. Route 209|U.S. 209]] near Summitville, New York]]
The magnitude of the commerce of Philadelphia has made the improvements of the river below that port of great importance. Small improvements were attempted by [[Pennsylvania]] as early as 1771. Commerce was once important on the upper river, primarily prior to railway competition (1857).

* The [[Pennsylvania Canal (Delaware Division)|Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal]], running parallel with the river from Easton to Bristol, opened in 1830.
* The [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]], which runs along the New Jersey side of the Delaware River from [[Bulls Island, New Jersey]] to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], unites the waters of the Delaware and [[Raritan River|Raritan rivers]] as it empties the waters of the Delaware River via the canal outlet in  [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. This canal water conduit is still used as a water supply source by the State of [[New Jersey]].
* The [[Morris Canal]] (now abandoned and almost completely filled in) and the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]] connected the Delaware and [[Hudson River|Hudson rivers]].
* The [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] joins the waters of the Delaware with those of the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

In the "project of 1885" the U.S. government undertook systematically the formation of a {{convert|26|ft|adj=on}} channel {{convert|600|ft}} wide from Philadelphia to deep water in [[Delaware Bay]]. The River and Harbor Act of 1899 provided for a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} channel {{convert|600|ft|m}} wide from Philadelphia to the deep water of the bay.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Delaware River |volume=7 |page=951}}</ref>

===Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - On the Delaware River - George Inness - overall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|''On the Delaware River,'' oil on canvas (circa 1861-63) by George Inness [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
{{See also|Tocks Island Dam Controversy}}
The [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]] came about as a result of the failure of a controversial plan to build a dam on the Delaware River at [[Tocks Island]], just north of the [[Delaware Water Gap]] to control water levels for flood control and hydroelectric power generation. The dam would have created a {{convert|37|mi|km|adj=on}} lake in the center of present park for use as a reservoir. Starting in 1960, the present day area of the Recreation Area was acquired for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] through [[eminent domain]]. Between 3,000 and 5,000 dwellings were demolished, including historical sites, and about 15,000 people were displaced by the project.

Because of massive environmental opposition, dwindling funds, and an unacceptable geological assessment of the dam's safety, the government transferred the property to the [[National Park Service]] in 1978. The National Park Service found itself as the caretaker of the previously endangered territory, and with the help of the federal government and surrounding communities, developed recreational facilities and worked to preserve the remaining historical structures.<ref>''Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area'' (p. 7-8), Obiso, Laura, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.njskylands.com/pkdwgnra.htm Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area], ''njskylands.com''.</ref>

===Bridge crossings===

{{Main|List of crossings of the Delaware River}}

The Delaware River is a major barrier to travel between [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Most of the larger bridges are tolled only westbound, and are owned by the [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]], [[Delaware River Port Authority]], [[Burlington County Bridge Commission]] or [[Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission]].

==Environmental issues==

===New York City water supply===
{{details|New York City water supply system}}
After [[New York City]] built 15 reservoirs to supply water to the city's growing population, it was unable to obtain permission to build an additional five reservoirs along the Delaware River's tributaries. As a result, in 1928 the city decided to draw water from the Delaware River, putting them in direct conflict with villages and towns across the river in [[Pennsylvania]] which were already using the Delaware for their water supply. The two sides eventually took their case to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], and in 1931, New York City was allowed to draw {{convert|440|e6USgal|m3}} of water a day from the Delaware and its upstream tributaries.

===Flooding===
With the failure of the dam project to come to fruition, the lack of flood control on the river left it vulnerable, and it has experienced a number of serious flooding events as the result of snow melt or rain run-off from heavy rainstorms. Record flooding occurred in August 1955, in the aftermath of the passing of the remnants of two separate hurricanes over the area within less than a week: first [[Hurricane Connie]] and then [[Hurricane Diane]], which was, and still is, the wettest tropical cyclone to have hit the northeastern United States. The river gauge at [[Riegelsville, Pennsylvania]] recorded an all-time record crest of {{convert|38.85|ft}} on August 19, 1955.

More recently, moderate to severe flooding has occurred along the river. The same gauge at Riegelsville recorded a peak of {{convert|30.95|ft}} on September 23, 2004, {{convert|34.07|ft}} on April 4, 2005, and {{convert|33.62|ft}} on June 28, 2006, all considerably higher than the flood stage of {{convert|22|ft}}.<ref>[http://nj.usgs.gov/special/flood0606/ USGS]

Since the upper Delaware basin has few population centers along its banks, flooding in this area mainly affects natural unpopulated flood plains. Residents in the middle part of the Delaware basin experience flooding, including three major floods in the three years (2004–2006) that have severely damaged their homes and land. The lower part of the Delaware basin from Philadelphia southward to the Delaware Bay is tidal and much wider than portions further north, and is not prone to river-related flooding (although tidal surges can cause minor flooding in this area).

The [[Delaware River Basin Commission]], along with local governments, is working to try to address the issue of flooding along the river. As the past few years have seen a rise in catastrophic floods, most residents of the river basin feel that something must be done. The local governments have worked in association with FEMA to address many of these problems, however, due to insufficient federal funds, progress is slow.<ref>Delaware River Basin Commission (July 20, 2005).
