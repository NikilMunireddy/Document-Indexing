==Early life==
Akon was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and spent much of his childhood in the West African country [[Senegal]], which he describes as his "hometown". The child of a dancer mother and a percussionist father, [[Mor Thiam]], Akon learned to play five instruments, including drums, guitar and [[djembe]].<ref name=VH1_interview>Bottomley, C.

In regards to his birth date, Akon is very protective of it, which is the reason many media outlets have reported incorrect dates. However, legal documents released by [[The Smoking Gun]] list his date of birth as April 16, 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/akons-con-job |title=Akon's Con Job |publisher=Thesmokinggun.com |date=April 16, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref>

==Music career==

===2003–05: Discovery and ''Trouble''===
Akon's alleged three years in jail saw him begin to recognize his music abilities and develop an appreciation for his musical background. Music mogul Devyne Stephens, president of Upfront Megatainment first heard about Akon when the rapper [[Lil' Zane]] brought him along to Stephens' rehearsal hall, a place that at the time saw talents such as [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] and [[TLC (band)|TLC]] being developed. The relationship between Stephens and Akon began as a friendship and [[mentorship]], with the young artist regularly stopping by to ask for advice, but when Akon lost his deal with Elektra Stephens signed him to his production company and began grooming him professionally.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeromeFoster.html |title=Interview With Knobody |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=September 27, 2005 |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>  The songs Akon recorded with Stephens were brought to the attention of [[Universal Motown Records Group|Universal]]'s imprint [[SRC Records]].<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]] SRC A&R [[Knobody|Jerome Foster]] said, "What caught my attention right away was "Lonely", and I said, 'this kid is official – this is a huge record."<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Foster and SRC CEO Steve Rifkind immediately boarded a private plane to Atlanta to meet the young artist.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Akon knew of Foster's work as producer [[Knobody]] and so there was a mutual respect for one another and the pair hit it off.<ref name="hitquarters.com" />

Akon increased his exposure further by collaborating with overseas artists, including [[New Zealand]]'s [[rapper]] [[Savage (rapper)|Savage]] ("[[Moonshine (Savage song)|Moonshine]]" from [[Moonshine (Savage album)|album of the same name]]) and hip-hop producer [[P-Money]] ("Keep on Callin'" from ''[[Magic City (P-Money album)|Magic City]]''), performing choruses as a featured vocalist.

Akon's solo debut album, ''[[Trouble (Akon album)|Trouble]]'' was released on June 29, 2004. It spawned the singles "[[Locked Up (song)|Locked Up]]" and "[[Lonely (Akon song)|Lonely]]", "[[Belly Dancer (Bananza)]]", "[[Pot of Gold (Akon song)|Pot Of Gold]]", and "[[Ghetto (Akon song)|Ghetto]]". "Locked Up" reached 8th position in the U.S. and 5th in the UK. "Ghetto" became a radio hit when it was [[remix]]ed by [[DJ Green Lantern]] to include verses from rappers [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G]].  The album is a hybrid of Akon's silky, West African-styled vocals mixed with East Coast and Southern beats. Most of Akon's songs begin with the sound of the clank of a jail cell's door with him uttering the word "Konvict".<ref>{{cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|title=Akon&nbsp;— Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p535592/biography|pure_url=yes}}|work=Allmusic|year=2006|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref>

In 2005, he released the single "Lonely" (which samples [[Bobby Vinton]]'s "[[Mr. Lonely]]"). The song reached the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the charts in Australia, the UK and Germany. His album also climbed to number one in the UK in April 2005. When music channel [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] had a top ten weekly chart, which was calculated by the amount of video requests, Akon's "Lonely" became the longest running single on the top of the chart, spanning over fifteen weeks. Akon then released another single featuring with a New Zealand rapper, [[Savage (rapper)|Savage]] with the single ''[[Moonshine (Savage song)|Moonshine]]'', which had become a success in both New Zealand and Australia, becoming number one in the New Zealand charts. In 2005, He made his first critically acclaimed guest appearance on [[Young Jeezy]]'s debut album, ''[[Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101]]'', with the song "[[Soul Survivor (Young Jeezy song)|Soul Survivor]]". In December the same year his manager, Robert Montanez was killed in a shooting after a dispute in [[New Jersey]].

In 2006, Akon and Young Jeezy suggested plans for a collaborative album.<ref>Reid, Shaheem.

===Legal difficulties===
Akon has stated that he was part of an auto-theft ring and spent three years in prison from 1999 to 2002. However, in April 2008, [[The Smoking Gun]] website challenged his claim with court records and interviews with detectives involved in Akon's case, concluding that he was not convicted of any crime and did not serve time in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/arts/17arts-AKONSRAPSHEE_BRF.html |work=The New York Times |title=Akon's Rap Sheet Is Revealed |first=Ben |last=Sisario |date=April 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,351580,00.html |title=Report: Akon Embellished Criminal History |publisher=Fox News |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0416081akon1.html Akon's Con Job], ''The Smoking Gun'', April 16, 2008.</ref> Akon responded to the report by saying that he never spent 3 years in prison consecutively, but had many shorter sentences that add up to three years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Chris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1587614/20080516/akon.jhtml |title=Akon Responds To Smoking Gun Report That He Fabricated His Criminal Past: 'It Only Helps Me' |publisher=MTV News |date=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref>

In April 2007, Akon drew criticism for an onstage act which included simulated sex with a 15-year-old girl, at a club in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], as part of a fake contest, despite the club's claim to have a 21 years and over age requirement.<ref>Telesford, Nigel.

On April 20, 2007 local media, channel [[CCN TV6|TV6]], aired the video clip publicly. Amid criticism on the radio, television, and from the [[blogosphere]], [[Verizon Wireless]] removed ringtones featuring Akon's songs. Verizon also decided not to sponsor [[The Sweet Escape Tour]] where Akon was to be the opening act for [[Gwen Stefani]].<ref>Leeds, Jeff. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/arts/music/10akon.html?ex=1336536000&en=3a9b2615949e9be2&ei=5124 Verizon Drops Pop Singer From Ads], ''New York Times'', May 10, 2007.</ref> However, [[Universal Music Group]] did not take action against Akon, but rather simply ordered the video clip be removed from video-sharing site YouTube due to [[copyright infringement]]. Conservative commentator and [[Parents Television Council]] founder [[L. Brent Bozell III|Brent Bozell]] called this "corporate irresponsibility".<ref>Bozell, L. Brent III.

Political commentators [[Michelle Malkin]], [[Laura Ingraham]], and [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] criticized Akon for "degrading women".<ref>Malkin, Michelle.

On June 3, 2007, at [[WSPK]]'s KFEST concert at the [[Dutchess Stadium]] in [[Fishkill, New York]], a concert attendee threw an object towards Akon on stage. Akon asked the crowd to identify who threw the object and that he be brought on stage. Security staff grabbed the young man and took him up to the stage. Akon then pulled him up from the crowd and hoisted him across his shoulders. The singer then tossed the attendee back into the crowd from his shoulders. Video of the incident was reviewed by Fishkill police.<ref>[http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070829/ENT04/70829010 Police: Akon investigation continues], ''Poughkeepsie Journal'', August 29, 2007.</ref> Akon has claimed that the incident was staged and that he in fact used the act to set up for the next record.<ref name="Sawjani"/> Charges of endangering the welfare of a minor, a misdemeanor, and second-degree harassment, a violation, were filed, according to police Chief Donald F. Williams, and Akon was arraigned on the two charges on December 3, 2007 in the town of Fishkill Court.<ref>[http://www.pojonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071130/NEWS05/711300344 Akon Faces Charges], ''Poughkeepsie Journal'', November 30, 2007.</ref>

In 2010, Buddhist groups in Sri Lanka vehemently protested a planned concert by Akon, claiming his music video with [[David Guetta]] for "[[Sexy Bitch|Sexy Chick]]" insulted [[Buddhism]] because of the Buddha statue that can be seen several times in the background.  Considering the allegations against Akon, the [[Sri Lankan Government]] decided not to issue him a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to enter into [[Sri Lanka]].<ref>[http://adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=7584 No Visa to Akon], Ada Derana News</ref>
