'''Admiral''' is the [[military rank|rank]], or part of the name of the ranks, of the highest [[navy|naval]] officers. It is usually abbreviated to "Adm" or "ADM".

The rank is generally thought to have originated in Sicily from a conflation of {{lang-ar|أمير البحر}}, ''amīr al-baḥr'', "commander of the sea", with Latin ''admirabilis''<ref name="etymonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Admiral&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> ("admirable") or ''admiratus'' ("admired"), although alternative etymologies derive the word directly from Latin, or from the Turkish military and naval rank [[miralay]].

In the Commonwealth and the U.S., a "full" admiral is equivalent to a "full" [[general officer|general]] in the army, and is above [[vice admiral]] and below [[admiral of the fleet]] (or [[fleet admiral]]). In NATO, admirals have a rank code of [[OF-9]] as a [[four-star rank]].

==Etymology==
The word "admiral" in Middle English comes from Anglo-French ''amiral'', "commander", from [[Medieval Latin]] ''admiralis'', ''admirallus''. These themselves come from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] "[[emir|amīr]]", or ''amīr al-'' (<big>{{transl|ar|DIN|أمير&nbsp;الـ}}</big>), "commander of", as in ''amīr al-baḥr'' (<big>{{transl|ar|DIN|أمير&nbsp;البحر}}</big>), "commander of the sea".<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/admiral Merriam-Webster on-line dictionary]</ref>  [[Crusade]]rs learned the term during their encounters with the Muslim [[Arab]]s, perhaps as early as the 11th century.

The Norman [[Roger II of Sicily]] (1095–1154), employed a Greek Christian known as [[George of Antioch]], who previously had served as a naval commander for several North African Moslem rulers. Roger styled George in [[Abbasid]] fashion as "[[amir al-umara|Amir of Amirs]]", i.e. "Commander of Commanders", with the title becoming Latinized in the 13th century as "''ammiratus ammiratorum''".<ref>Abulafia (2011).</ref>

The [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]] and later [[Genoa|Genoese]] took the first two parts of the term and used them as one word, ''amiral'', from their [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] opponents. The [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] gave their sea commanders similar titles while in [[Portugal|Portuguese]] the word changed to ''almirante''. As the word was used by people speaking [[Latin]] or Latin-based languages it gained the "d" and endured a series of different endings and spellings leading to the English spelling "admyrall" in the 14th century and to "admiral" by the 16th century.

The word "admiral" has today come to be almost exclusively associated with the highest [[Naval officer ranks|naval rank]] in most of the world's [[navy|navies]], equivalent to the army rank of (full) [[general]]. However, this wasn't always the case; for example, in some European countries prior to the end of [[World War II]], admiral was the third highest naval rank after [[general admiral]] and [[grand admiral]].

The rank of admiral has also been subdivided into various grades, several of which are historically extinct while others remain in use in most present day navies. The [[Royal Navy]] used colours (red, white, and blue, in descending order) to indicate [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|seniority of its admirals]] until 1864; for example, [[Horatio Nelson]]'s highest rank was vice admiral of the white. The generic term for these naval equivalents of army generals is [[flag officer]]. Some navies have also used army-type titles for them, such as the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] "general at sea".
