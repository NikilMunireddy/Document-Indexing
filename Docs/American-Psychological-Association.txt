The '''American Psychological Association''' ('''APA''') is the largest scientific and professional organization of [[psychologist]]s in the [[United States]],<ref name="About">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/ |title=About APA |publisher=APA.org |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> with around 117,500 members including scientists, educators, clinicians, consultants and students.<ref name="About"/> The APA has an annual budget of around $115m.<ref name="Reports">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/info/reports/ |title=APA Reports |publisher=APA.org |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> There are 54 [[Divisions of the American Psychological Association|divisions of the APA]]—interest groups covering different subspecialties of psychology or topical areas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Divisions of the APA |url=http://www.apa.org/about/division/ |publisher=APA.org |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>

The American Psychological Association and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (both known by the acronym ''APA'') are sometimes distinguished as "the bigger APA" (American Psychological Association) and "the little APA" (American Psychiatric Association) because of their relative membership sizes.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Profile==
The APA has task forces which issue policy statements on various issues of social import such as the APA position on psychology of [[abortion]]; APA position on [[human rights]] (concerning issues such as detainee welfare, human trafficking, and rights for the mentally ill); APA position on [[IQ]]; APA position on treating homosexuality ([[sexual orientation]] change efforts); and APA position on men and women ([[gender differences]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/ |title=Council Policy Manual |accessdate=2012-12-14 |publisher=APA.org}}</ref>

===Governance===
APA is a corporation chartered in the District of Columbia. APA's bylaws describe structural components that serve as a system of checks and balances that ensure democratic process. The organizational entities include:
* APA President. APA's president is elected by the membership. The president chairs the Council of Representatives and the Board of Directors. During his or her term of office, the president performs such duties as are prescribed in the bylaws.
* Board of Directors. The board is composed of six members-at-large, the president-elect, president, past-president, treasurer, recording secretary, CEO, and the chair of the [[American Psychological Association of Graduate Students]] (APAGS). The Board oversees the association's administrative affairs and presents an annual budget for council approval.
* APA Council of Representatives. The council has sole authority to set policy and make decisions regarding APA's roughly $60 million annual income. It is composed of elected members from state/provincial/territorial psychological associations, APA divisions and the APA Board of Directors.
* APA Committee Structure: Boards and Committees. Members of boards and committees conduct much of APA's work on a volunteer basis. They carry out a wide variety of tasks suggested by their names. Some have responsibility for monitoring major programs, such as the directorates, the journals and international affairs.<ref name="APA Gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/index.aspx|title=APA Governance |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-20}}</ref>

===Good Governance Project===
The Good Governance Project (GGP) was initiated in January 2011 as part of the strategic plan to "[assure] APA's governance practices, processes and structures are optimized and aligned with what is needed to thrive in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex environment."<ref name="APA GGP">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/good-governance/ |date=2013-07-02 |title=Good Governance Project |publisher=APA.org |accessdate=2013-07-20}}</ref> The charge included soliciting feedback and input stakeholders, learning about governance best practices, recommending whether change was required, recommending needed changes based on data, and creating implementation plans.<ref name="APA GGP" /> The June 2013 GGP update on the recommended changes can be found in the document "Good Governance Project Recommended Changes to Maximize Organizational Effectiveness of APA Governance."<ref name="GGP July 2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/good-governance/final-report.pdf |title=Good Governance Project Recommended Changes to Maximize Organizational Effectiveness of APA Governance |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-07-20}}</ref> The suggested changes would change APA from a membership-based, representational structure to a corporate structure. These motions will be discussed and voted upon by Council on July 31, 2013 and August 2, 2013.<ref name="GGP July 2013" />

===Organizational structure===
APA comprises an executive office, a publishing operation, offices that address administrative, business, information technology, and operational needs, and five substantive directorates:
*the Education Directorate accredits doctoral psychology programs and addresses issues related to psychology education in secondary through graduate education;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/ed/ |title=Education Directorate of the American Psychological Association |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>
*the Practice Directorate engages on behalf of practicing psychologists and health care consumers;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/practice/ |title=APA Practice Directorate |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>
*the Public Interest Directorate advances psychology as a means of addressing the fundamental problems of human welfare and promoting the equitable and just treatment of all segments of society;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/ |title=Public Interest Directorate |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>
*the Public and Member Communications Directorate is responsible for APA's outreach to its members and affiliates and to the general public;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/offices/directorates/communications.aspx |title=Public and Member Communications |publisher=APA.org |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>
*the Science Directorate provides support and voice for psychological scientists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/science/ |title=Science Directorate |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>

===Membership and title of "psychologist"===
{{Main|Psychologist#United States and Canada}}
APA policy on the use of the title [[psychologist]] is contained in the Model Act for State Licensure of Psychologists:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apapracticecentral.org/ce/state/model-act.aspx |title=Model Act for State Licensure of Psychologists |publisher=APA.org |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> Psychologists have earned a doctoral degree in psychology and may not use the title "psychologist" and/or deliver psychological services to the public, unless the psychologist is licensed or specifically exempted from licensure under the law. State licensing laws specify state specific requirements for the education and training of psychologists leading to licensure. Psychologists who are exempted from licensure could include researchers, educators, or general applied psychologists who provide services outside of the health and mental health field.

Full membership with the APA in United States and Canada requires doctoral training whereas associate membership requires at least two years of postgraduate studies in psychology or approved related discipline. The minimal requirement of a doctoral dissertation related to psychology for full membership can be waived in certain circumstances where there is evidence that significant contribution or performance in the field of psychology has been made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/division/officers/handbook/ |title=Division Officers Handbook |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>

===Affiliate organizations===
The American Psychological Association Practice Organization (APAPO) and the Education Advocacy Trust, which operates autonomously as a part of APAPO, are 501(c)(6) entities, separate from APA. They engage in advocacy on behalf of psychological practitioners and health care consumers and psychology education, respectively.

===The Psychologically Healthy Workplace program===
The Psychologically Healthy Workplace Program (PHWP) is a collaborative effort between the American Psychological Association and the APA Practice Organization designed to help employers optimize employee well-being and organizational performance. The PHWP includes APA's Psychologically Healthy Workplace Awards, a variety of APA Practice Organization resources, including PHWP Web content, e-newsletter, podcast and blog, and support of local programs currently implemented by 52 state, provincial and territorial psychological associations as a mechanism for driving grassroots change in local business communities.

The award program highlights a variety of workplaces, large and small, profit and non-profit, in diverse geographical settings. Applicants are evaluated on their efforts in the following five areas: employee involvement, [[work-life balance]], employee growth and development, health and safety, and employee recognition. Awards are given at the local and national level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apapracticecentral.org/outreach/workplace/ |title=Psychologically Healthy Workplace Program |publisher=APApracticecentral.org |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>

===APA Style===
{{Main|APA style}}
'''American Psychological Association''' ('''APA''') '''Style''' is a set of rules developed to assist reading comprehension in the social and behavioral sciences. Designed to ensure clarity of communication, the rules are designed to "move the idea forward with a minimum of distraction and a maximum of precision."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apastyle.org/about-apa-style.aspx |title=APA Style |publisher=APAstyle.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> The ''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association'' contains the rules for every aspect of writing, especially in the [[social sciences]] from determining authorship to constructing a [[Table (information)|table]] to avoiding [[plagiarism]] and constructing accurate reference citations. "The General Format of APA is most commonly used to cite sources within the social sciences. General guidelines for a paper in APA style includes: typed, double-spaced on standard-sized paper (8.5" x 11") with 1" margins on all sides. The font should be clear and highly readable. APA recommends using 12 pt. [[Times New Roman]] font."<ref>{{cite web |title=APA Formatting and Style Guide |url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/ |work=[[Purdue OWL]] |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref>

==History==

===Founding===
The APA was founded in July 1892 at [[Clark University]] by a small group of around 30 men; by 1916 there were over 300 members. The first president was [[G. Stanley Hall]]. During World War II, the APA merged with other psychological organizations, resulting in a new divisional structure. Nineteen divisions were approved in 1944; the divisions with the most members were the clinical and personnel (now counseling) divisions. From 1960 to 2007, the number of divisions expanded to 54.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/apa/archives/apa-history.aspx |publisher=APA.org |title=APA History and Archives |accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> Today the APA is affiliated with 60 state, territorial, and Canadian provincial associations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/apa/organizations/associations.aspx |publisher=APA.org |title=State and Provincial Psychological Associations |accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>

===Dominance of clinical psychology===
Due to the dominance of [[clinical psychology]] in APA, several research-focused groups have broken away from the organization. These include the [[Psychonomic Society]] in 1959 (with a primarily cognitive orientation), and the [[Association for Psychological Science]] (which changed its name from the [[American Psychological Society]] in early 2006) in 1988 (with a broad focus on the science and research of psychology). [[Theodore H. Blau]] was the first clinician in independent practice to be elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1977.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 1, 2003 |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/01/Hillsborough/Noted_psychologist_Th.shtml |title= Noted psychologist Theodore Blau |work=St. Petersburg Times |accessdate=2007-09-14 }}</ref>

== Positions on homosexuality ==

===Cause of homosexuality===
The APA states the following:
{{blockquote|"There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx |title=Answers to your questions for a better understanding of sexual orientation and homosexuality |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>}}

===Conversion therapy===

The APA adopted a resolution in August 2009 stating that mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments. The approval, by APA's governing Council of Representatives, came at APA's annual convention, during which a task force presented a report<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf |title=Report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation |first1=Judith M. |last1=Glassgold |first2=Lee |last2=Beckstead |first3=Jack |last3=Drescher |first4=Beverly |last4=Greene |first5=Robin Lin |last5=Miller |first6=Roger L. |last6=Worthington |first7=Clinton W. |last7=Anderson |publisher=APA.org |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref> that in part examined the efficacy of so-called "[[reparative therapy]]," or [[sexual orientation change efforts]] (SOCE).

The "Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts |publisher=APA.org |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> also advises that parents, guardians, young people and their families avoid sexual orientation treatments that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and instead seek psychotherapy, social support and educational services "that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth."

=== Same-sex marriage ===
The APA adopted a resolution stating that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny same-sex couples legal access to civil marriage and to all its attendant rights, benefits, and privileges. It also filed an amicus brief in the federal court case in which Judge Vaughn Walker struck down California's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.<ref name="amici">{{cite web |url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/27/amicus29.pdf |title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as amici curiae in support of plaintiff-appellees - Appeal from United States District Court for the Northern District of California Civil Case No. 09-CV-2292 VRW (Honorable Vaughn R. Walker) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}</ref> The APA later praised the decision and denied the existence of any "scientific justification" for a ban on same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/08/prop-8-decision.aspx |title=APA Praises Prop 8 Decision as Victory for Science, Human Dignity |publisher=APA.org |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>

In August 2011, the APA clarified their support of same-sex marriage in light of continued research suggesting that the same community benefits accepted as result of heterosexual marriage apply to same-sex couples as well, "We knew that marriage benefits heterosexual people in very significant ways, but we didn't know if that would be true for same-sex couples," said Dr. Clinton Anderson, associate executive director of the APA and director of the Office on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns. Anderson would also go on to clarify the Association's view on Civil Unions as an alternative to same-sex marriages: "Anything other than marriage is, in essence, a stigmatization of same-sex couples. Stigma does have negative impacts on people."<ref>{{cite web |author=Alden Mahler Levine, CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/08/04/psychologists.gay.marriage/ |title=Psychological association calls for legalization of same-sex marriage |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>

==APA internship crisis for graduate students==
The APA is the main accrediting body for U.S. clinical and counseling psychology doctoral training programs and internship sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/about/about-accreditation.aspx |title=About Accreditation |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> APA-accredited Clinical Psychology PhD and PsyD programs typically require students to complete a one-year clinical internship in order to graduate (or a two-year part-time internship). However, there is currently an "internship crisis" as defined by the American Psychological Association, in that approximately 25% of clinical psychology doctoral students do not match for internship each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/apags/resources/internships.aspx |title=Doctoral Internships in Professional Psychology |publisher=APA.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.appic.org/Match/MatchStatistics/MatchStatistics2011PhaseI.aspx |title=2011 APPIC Match Statistics - Phase I |date= February 25, 2011 |website=http://www.appic.org |publisher=Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers |accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref> This crisis has led many students (approximately 1,000 each year) to re-apply for internship, thus delaying graduation, or to complete an unaccredited internship, and often has many emotional and financial consequences.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/04/pc.aspx |last=Vasquez |first=Melba |title=The internship crisis: strategies and solutions |journal=Monitor on Psychology |date=April 2011 |volume=42 |issue=4 |page=5}}</ref> Students who do not complete an APA accredited internships in the U.S. are barred from certain employment settings, including VA Hospitals, the military, and cannot get licensed in some states, such as Utah and Mississippi.<ref name="appic1">{{cite web |url=http://www.appic.org/Match/FAQs/Applicants/Eligibility-and-Participation#q3 |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Internship Applicants - Match Eligibility & Participation |website=http://www.appic.org/ |publisher=Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers |accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2004/04/accreditation.aspx |last=Smith Bailey |first=Deborah |title=Why accreditation matters: Accreditation guidelines set the standard for your education—and can ease your way to licensure |journal=gradPSYCH Magazine |date=April 2004}}</ref> Additionally, some post-doctoral fellowships and other employment settings require or prefer an APA Accredited internship.<ref name="appic1"/> The APA has been criticized for not addressing this crisis adequately and many psychologists and graduate students have petitioned for the APA to take action by regulating graduate training programs.

== Warfare and the use of torture ==
{{Merge portions from|APA Ethics Code|[[APA Ethics Code#Ethical controversies|Ethical controversies]]|discuss=Talk:American Psychological Association#Ethical controversies proposed merge|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
A year after the establishment of the [[Human Resources Research Organization]] by the U.S. military in 1951, the [[CIA]] began funding numerous psychologists (and other scientists) in the development of [[psychological warfare]] methods under the supervision of APA treasurer [[Meredith Crawford]]. [[Donald O. Hebb]], the APA president in 1960 who was awarded the APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1961, defended the torture of research subjects, arguing that what was being studied was other nations' methods of brainwashing. Former APA president [[Martin Seligman]] spoke upon the invitation of the CIA on his [[animal experimentation]] where he shocked a dog unpredictably and repeatedly into total, helpless passivity. Former APA president [[Joseph Matarazzo]] designed a new CIA interrogation regimen and supervised the torture of [[Abu Zubaydah]] at a secret CIA detention site in Thailand. Former APA president [[Ronald F. Levant]], upon visiting [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], affirmed that psychologists were present during the torture of prisoners, arguing that their presence was to "add value and safeguards" to interrogations.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chalquist |first=Craig |title=Why I Am Not a Member of the American Psychological Association |url=http://www.chalquist.com/apa.html |accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> Former APA president [[Gerald Koocher]] argued, referring to allegations of continuing systemic abuse by psychologists, that such allegations were originating from "opportunistic commentators masquerading as scholars".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Koocher |first1=Gerald |authorlink=Gerald Koocher |title=Speaking against torture |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb06/pc.aspx |journal=Monitor on Psychology |date=February 2006 |volume=37 |issue=2 |page=5}}</ref>

The APA claims that it condemns the use of any of the following practices by military interrogators trying to elicit anti-terrorism information from detainees, on the ground that "there are no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether induced by a state of war or threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, that may be invoked as a justification."<ref name="coercion">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/national-security.aspx |title=Policy Related to Psychologists' Work in National Security Settings and Reaffirmation of the APA Position Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment |publisher=APA.org |date=2013 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>

When it emerged that psychologists as part of the [[Behavioral Science Consultation Team]] were advising interrogators in [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo]] and other U.S. facilities on improving the effectiveness of the "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]", the APA called on the U.S. government to prohibit the use of unethical interrogation techniques and labeled specific techniques as [[torture]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/releases/councilres0807.html |title=American Psychological Association calls on U.S. government to prohibit the use of unethical interrogation techniques |publisher=APA.org |date=20 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513130900/http://www.apa.org/releases/councilres0807.html |archivedate=13 May 2007 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Critics pointed out that the APA declined to advise its members not to participate in such interrogations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93740405 |title=Psychologists and Guantanamo |publisher=NPR.org |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/american-psychological-association-sees-no-evil |title=American Psychological Association Sees No Evil |publisher=ACLU.org |date=16 June 2009 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> One group of psychologists in particular, Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, has been very harsh in its criticism of the APA stance on its refusal to categorically prohibit members from participating in any phase of military interrogations. They recently stated their continuing disagreement with APA leadership in an open letter posted on their website on October 31, 2012 in which they reiterated their condemnation of torture and enhanced interrogation techniques, and called for the APA to require its members to refuse participation in military conducted interrogations of any kind.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ethicalpsychology.org/materials/Coalition-Response-to-Div42-Board.pdf | title=Open Letter |publisher=Coalition for an Ethical Psychology |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref> The diluted directive by the APA was in contrast to the [[American Psychiatric Association]] ban in May 2006 of all direct participation in interrogations by psychiatrists,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychiatry.org/file%20library/advocacy%20and%20newsroom/position%20statements/ps2006_interrogation.pdf |title=Position Statement on Psychiatric Participation in Interrogation of Detainees |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |date=May 2006 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> and the [[American Medical Association]] ban in June 2006 of the direct participation in interrogations by physicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion2068.page |title=Opinion 2.068 - Physician Participation in Interrogation |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] Ethics Group |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> In addition, an independent panel of medical, military, ethics, education, public health and legal professionals issued a comprehensive report in November 2013 that "charged that U.S. military and intelligence agencies directed doctors and psychologists working in U.S. military detention centers to violate standard ethical principles and medical standards to avoid infliction of harm".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imapny.org/medicine_as_a_profession/interrogationtorture-and-dual-loyalty/ | title=Interrogation/Torture and Dual Loyalty |publisher=[[Institute on Medicine as a Profession]] |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>

In September 2008, APA's members passed a resolution stating that psychologists may not work in settings where "persons are held outside of, or in violation of, either International Law (e.g., the UN Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions) or the U.S. Constitution (where appropriate), unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights."<ref name="coercion"/> The resolution became official APA policy in February 2009.

===Amending the Ethics Code===

In February 2010 APA's Council of Representatives voted to amend the association's [[APA ethical principles of psychologists|Code of Ethics]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/02/ethics-code.aspx |title=American Psychological Association amends ethics code to address potential conflicts among professional ethics, legal authority and organizational demands |publisher=APA.org |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> to make clear that its standards can never be interpreted to justify or defend violating human rights. Following are the two ethical standards and the changes adopted. Language that is in bold was newly adopted:

{{Quotation|1.02, Conflicts Between Ethics and Law, Regulations, or Other Governing Legal Authority

If psychologists' ethical responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, psychologists '''clarify the nature of the conflict''', make known their commitment to the Ethics Code and take '''reasonable''' steps to resolve the conflict '''consistent with the General Principles and Ethical Standards of the Ethics Code. Under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights.'''

1.03, Conflicts Between Ethics and Organizational Demands

If the demands of an organization with which psychologists are affiliated or for whom they are working '''are in''' conflict with this Ethics Code, psychologists clarify the nature of the conflict, make known their commitment to the Ethics Code, and '''take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the General Principles and Ethical Standards of the Ethics Code. Under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights.'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/ |title=Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct |publisher=APA.org |date=2010 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>|American Psychological Association||Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct}}

=== Hoffman report on interrogations and torture===
In November 2014 the APA ordered an independent review into whether it cooperated with the government’s use of torture of prisoners during the Bush administration, naming Chicago attorney [[David H. Hoffman]] to conduct the review.<ref name="American Psychological Association Bolstered C.I.A. Torture">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/report-says-american-psychological-association-collaborated-on-torture-justification.html |title=American Psychological Association Bolstered C.I.A.

The association’s “principal motive in doing so was to align APA and curry favor with DOD.”<ref name=wapost>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/report-american-psychological-association-colluded-with-us-interrogation-programs/2015/07/10/42b0cbec-2741-11e5-b72c-2b7d516e1e0e_story.html "Inquiry: Psychologists group colluded with Pentagon, CIA on interrogations" by Greg Miller] [[The Washington Post]], July 10, 2015</ref> An APA official said that ethics director Stephen Behnke had been "removed from his position as a result of the report" and indicated that other firings or sanctions might follow.<ref name=wapost/>

On July 14, 2015 the APA announced the retirement of its CEO, [[Norman B. Anderson]], effective the end of 2015, and of Deputy Chief Executive Officer [[Michael Honaker]], effective August 15, 2015, and the resignation of Rhea K.

===Ban on Psychologists' Involvement in Unlawful Interrogations===
For at least a decade dissident psychologists within and outside the APA, including the group WithholdAPAdues,<ref>[http://www.sectionfive.org/writings/withholding-apa-dues-in-protest-over-policy-on-torture The Sphinx: A site for inquiry and innovation in psychoanalysis, ''Withholding APA Dues in Protest over Policy on Torture'']</ref> had protested the involvement of psychologists “in interrogations at CIA black sites and Guantánamo”.  Prior to the release of the Hoffman report, which undermined the APA’s repeated denials and showed that some APA leaders were complicit in torture, the dissidents were ignored or ridiculed.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology'', Volume 1, By Daniel J. Christie, Wiley-Blackwell, December 2011, pp 580-581, ISBN 1405196440</ref><ref name=demnow/>

On August 7, 2015, just weeks following the release of the Hoffman report, the APA council of representatives met at the association's 123rd annual convention in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. At that meeting, the APA council passed Resolution 23B, which implemented the 2008 membership vote to remove psychologists from settings that operate outside of international law, and banning the participation of psychologists in unlawful interrogations. With 156 votes in favor and only one vote against, the resolution passed with the near unanimous approval of council members.<ref name=banned>[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/us/politics/psychologists-approve-ban-on-role-in-national-security-interrogations.html?_r=0 Psychologists Approve Ban on Role in National Security Interrogations], By James Risen, New York Times, August 7, 2015</ref> The adoption of Resolution 23B aligned the APA's policy with those of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the [[American Medical Association]] by prohibiting psychologists from participating in interrogations deemed illegal by the [[Geneva Conventions]] and the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]].<ref name=demnow>[http://www.democracynow.org/2015/8/10/no_more_torture_world_s_largest No More Torture: World's Largest Group of Psychologists Bans Role in National Security Interrogations], Democracy Now, August 10, 2015</ref>

{{Quotation|'''IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2008 MEMBERSHIP VOTE TO REMOVE PSYCHOLOGISTS FROM ALL SETTINGS THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW (NBI #23B)'''

This resolution further aligns the APA policy definition for “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” (in the 2006 and 2013 Council resolutions) with the United Nations (UN) Convention Against Torture and ensures that the definition applies broadly to all individuals and settings; offers APA as a supportive resource for ethical practice for psychologists, including those in military and national security roles; prohibits psychologists from participating in national security interrogations; clarifies the intended application of the 2008 petition resolution... and calls for APA letters to be sent to federal officials to inform them of these policy changes and clarifications of existing APA policy.
