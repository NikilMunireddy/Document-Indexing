'''Image Comics''' is an American [[comic book]] publisher. It was founded in 1992 by several high-profile illustrators as a venue where creators could publish their material without giving up the [[copyrights]] to the characters they created, as [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] properties.  It was immediately successful, and remains one of the largest comic book publishers in North America.  Its output was originally dominated by work from the studios of the Image partners, but now includes work by numerous independent creators.  Its best-known series include ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', ''[[Savage Dragon]]'', ''[[Witchblade]]'', ''[[The Darkness (comics)|The Darkness]]'', ''[[Invincible (comics)|Invincible]]'', ''[[The Walking Dead (comic book)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Saga (comic book)|Saga]]'', ''[[Chew (comics)|Chew]]'', ''[[Outcast (comic book)|Outcast]]'', and ''[[Haunt (comics)|Haunt]]''.

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:15th anniversary of Image Comics - seven founders.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Panel at [[ComicCon]] 2007 on the 15th anniversary of the founding of Image Comics. From left: [[Jim Lee]], [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Erik Larsen]], [[Jim Valentino]], [[Marc Silvestri]], [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Whilce Portacio]].]]

In the early 1990s, comics creators [[Erik Larsen]], [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Jim Valentino]] were having dinner with [[Malibu Comics]] editor-in-chief [[Dave Olbrich]], during which Olbrich expressed interest in publishing comics created by them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Valentino: Broadening the Base and Raising the Bar|url=http://comicsbulletin.com/jim-valentino-broadening-base-and-raising-bar/|website=Comics Bulletin|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Rich|title=The Not Quite Secret Origin Of Image Comics|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/02/26/the-not-quite-secret-origin-of-image-comics/|website=Bleeding Cool|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>  Around this time, Larsen, Liefeld, Valentino and several other [[freelance]] illustrators doing popular work for [[Marvel Comics]] grew frustrated with the company's [[work for hire]] policies and practices. Their primary complaint was that the artwork and new characters they created were being merchandised heavily, with the artists receiving only standard page rates for their work and modest [[royalties]] on sales of the comics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In December 1991, a group of these illustrators approached Marvel president Terry Stewart and demanded that the company give them ownership and creative control over their work. Accounts vary as to whom this group included, but it is generally accepted that [[Todd McFarlane]] and Liefeld were among its leaders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Marvel did not meet their demands.

In response, eight creators announced the founding of Image Comics: illustrators [[Todd McFarlane]] (known for his work on ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]''), [[Jim Lee]] (''[[X-Men]]''), [[Rob Liefeld]] (''[[X-Force]]''), [[Marc Silvestri]] (''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]''), [[Erik Larsen]] (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''), [[Jim Valentino]] (''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''), [[Whilce Portacio]] (''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'') and longtime ''Uncanny X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]].<ref name="CNN">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHhNZ73sC0k ''Moneyline with Lou Dobbs'', Greg Lemont reporting, CNN, 1992]</ref><ref name="TCJ">"Bye Bye Marvel; Here Comes Image: Portacio, Claremont, Liefeld, Jim Lee Join McFarlane's New Imprint at Malibu," ''The Comics Journal'' #148 (February 1992), pp. 11–12.</ref>  This development was nicknamed the "X-odus", because several of the creators involved (Claremont, Liefeld, Lee, Silvestri and Portacio) were famous for their work on the X-Men franchise. Marvel's stock fell $3.25/share when the news became public.<ref name="CNN" />

Image's organizing charter had two key provisions:<ref name="TCJhistory">[http://www.tcj.com/3_online/n_image3.html "The Image Story"], ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', 2005-10-25.  Retrieved on 2008-03-15.</ref>
* Image would not own any creator's work; the creator would.
* No Image partner would interfere – creatively or financially – with any other partner's work. Image itself would own no intellectual property except the company trademarks: its name and its logo,<ref>Erik Larsen, "Grand Larseny", printed in the back of various Image titles, February 2008</ref> which was designed by writer [[Hank Kanalz]].<ref>[http://forums.imagecomics.com/viewtopic.php?p=46093#p46093]</ref>

Each Image partner founded his own studio, which published under the Image banner but was autonomous from any central editorial control. Claremont was not part of the partnership, and Portacio withdrew during the formative stages to deal with his sister's illness,<ref>[http://www.asianjournal.com/galing-pinoy/59-galing-pinoy/786-whilce-portacio-the-man-behind-the-x-men.html "Whilce Portacio: The man behind the X-Men", by Cynthia de Castro, ''Asian Journal'', December 7, 2008]</ref> so Image originally consisted of six studios:
*[[Todd McFarlane|Todd McFarlane Productions]], owned by Todd McFarlane
*[[WildStorm|WildStorm Productions]], owned by Jim Lee
*[[Highbrow Entertainment]], owned by Erik Larsen
*[[ShadowLine]], owned by Jim Valentino
*[[Top Cow Productions]], owned by Marc Silvestri
*[[Extreme Studios]], owned by Rob Liefeld

===Development===
[[Image:Spawn.jpg|right|thumb|170px|''Spawn'' #1 (1992), art by Todd McFarlane.]]

Image's initial titles were produced through [[Malibu Comics]], a small but established publishing company sympathetic with Image's position on creator ownership.  Malibu provided administrative, production, distribution and marketing support for the launch of the initial titles.<ref name="TCJ" /><ref>[http://www.platinumstudios.com/universes/awesome.php Platinum Studios: Awesome Comics]. Accessed February 3, 2008</ref>

The first Image comic books to arrive in stores were Liefeld's ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'', Larsen's ''[[The Savage Dragon]]'', McFarlane's ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'',  and Lee's ''[[WildC.A.T.s]]''. Youngblood and Savage Dragon were not entirely new creations, having debuted in [[Gary Carlson]]'s ''Megaton'', an independent comic book title published from 1981 to 1987.<ref>[http://www.foxcitiesbookfestival.org/author/2013/gary-carlson Gary Carlson | Fox Cities Book Festival]</ref> Propelled by the artists' popularity and the eagerness of comic book collectors to get in on the "next big thing", these series sold in numbers that no publisher other than Marvel, DC or [[Valiant Comics]] had achieved since the market's decline in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} (The company experienced lesser successes with Silvestri's ''[[Cyberforce]]'', Valentino's ''[[Shadowhawk]]'' and Portacio's much-delayed ''[[Wetworks]]''.){{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}  Within a few months, the Image titles' success led to Malibu having almost 10% of the North American comics market share,<ref>"NewsWatch: Malibu Commands 9.73% Market Share," ''The Comics Journal'' #151 (July 1992), p. 21.</ref> briefly exceeding that of industry giant [[DC Comics]].<ref>"Malibu Moves Ahead of DC in Comics Market," ''The Comics Journal'' #152 (August 1992), pp. 7–8.</ref> By the beginning of 1993, Image's financial situation was secure enough to publish its titles independently, and it left Malibu.<ref>"Image Leaves Malibu, Becomes Own Publisher," ''The Comics Journal'' #155 (January 1993), p. 22.</ref>

Some of the founders' studios came to resemble separate publishers, each with several ongoing series set in a [[shared universe]] (At first there were indications of an "[[Image Universe]]" shared by all the studios, but these decreased as the studios developed their own directions).  The use of freelancers to write or illustrate series that were owned by the Image partners led to criticism that some of them had reproduced the very system they had rebelled against, but with them in charge instead of a corporation.<ref>[http://albert.nickerson.tripod.com/creatorsbillofrightsbsette.html The Creator's Bill of Rights: A Chat with Steve Bissette]</ref> Image partners such as Larsen and Valentino, who did not take this approach, assumed a neutral position on it, in keeping with the requirement that none of them had any say in how the others' studios were run.

Some of the Image partners used their studios to also publish works produced outside of their studios, allowing the creators to retain ownership and editorial control over those series, an arrangement which was then uncommon among large publishers.  These included [[Sam Kieth]] (''[[The Maxx]]''), [[Dale Keown]] (''[[Pitt (comics)|Pitt]]''),<ref>"NewsWatch: Hulk Artist Leaves Marvel" ''The Comics Journal'' #151 (July 1992), p. 21.</ref> [[Jae Lee]] (''Hellshock''), and the team of [[Kurt Busiek]], [[Brent Anderson]], and [[Alex Ross]] (''[[Astro City]]'').  Later, some established [[self-published]] series also moved to Image, such as [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]]'s ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' and [[Colleen Doran]]'s ''[[A Distant Soil]]''.

The partners had little business or management experience, and many series fell behind their intended publishing schedule.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first= | date = June 1993 | title = Wizard Market Watch | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 22 | pages = 134–5}}</ref><ref group="note">For example, ''WildC.A.T.s'' was a "monthly", but in one nine-month period only four issues appeared (#29–32: Apr '96, Jun '96, Sep '96, Jan '97).</ref> Comparing them to [[vaporware]], one reader reported that 17 of the 36 delayed items in his December 1992 order were from Image.<ref name="cgw199303">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=104 | title=Letters | work=Computer Gaming World | date=March 1993| pages=104}}</ref> Retailers' orders of newly offered issues were typically based on the sales of recent issues, but as the issues shipped weeks and even several months late, fans' interest tended to wane, leaving retailers with unsold inventory. In response, retailers cut orders to reduce their risk.  This significantly hurt the studios, which were each responsible for their own cash flow and profitability.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Rich|title=The Not Quite Secret Origin Of Image Comics|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/02/26/the-not-quite-secret-origin-of-image-comics/|website=bleedingcool.com|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}</ref>  In late 1993, the partners hired independent cartoonist [[Larry Marder]] to act as "executive director" for the publisher;<ref>"Newswatch: Larry Marder Joins Image," ''The Comics Journal'' #166 (February 1994), p. 40.</ref> Valentino quipped in interviews that Marder's job was literally to "direct the executives" (i.e. the Image partners).  Marder developed better financial planning and had some success in disciplining creators to deliver their work on time, in part by insisting that retail orders for new issues would not be solicited until the books had been illustrated, usually ensuring they would be ready to ship when promised.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[Image:Wb80cover.jpg|thumb|right|170px|''Witchblade'' #80.]]
By the mid-1990s Image series such as ''Spawn'' and ''The Savage Dragon'' had proven themselves as lasting successes (the former frequently topping the sales charts for months in which new issues came out), while new series such as Wildstorm's ''[[Gen¹³]]'', and Top Cow's ''[[Witchblade]]'' and ''[[The Darkness (comics)|The Darkness]]'' were also successful.  Image had become the third-largest comics publisher in North America, exceeded only by long-established industry leaders [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Partial break-up===
Clashes between partners began to harm the company. Several of the partners complained that Liefeld was using his position as [[CEO]] of Image to promote and perhaps even to financially support his own separate publishing company [[Maximum Press]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Silvestri withdrew [[Top Cow]] from Image in 1996 (although he retained his partnership in the company), protesting that Liefeld was recruiting artists from his studio, including the highly popular [[Michael Turner (comics)|Michael Turner]] (''Witchblade'').{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  The other five partners discussed ousting Liefeld from the company, and Liefeld resigned in September 1996, giving up his share of the company.<ref>"Chapter Three: Image Litigation, Cont.", ''The Comics Journal'' #192 (December 1996) pp. 17–19.</ref><ref>"News Watch: Image, Liefeld Settle Lawsuit, if not their Differences," ''The Comics Journal'' #195 (April 1997), p. 12.</ref>  Silvestri subsequently returned Top Cow to Image.

Wildstorm's [[Cliffhanger (comics)|Cliffhanger]] imprint, established in 1998, was a commercial success, launching high-selling creator-owned properties by [[Humberto Ramos]], [[J. Scott Campbell]], [[Joe Madureira]], and others.  However, Jim Lee sold Wildstorm to DC Comics in 1999, citing a desire to exchange his responsibilities as a publisher for the opportunity to do more creative work.

=== Diversification ===
[[File:10.9.10ImageComicsShowPanelByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|left|A panel of non-founding Image creators at the 2010 [[New York Comic Con]] (l–r): [[Tomm Coker]], [[Tim Seeley]], Ben McCool, [[James Zhang]], [[Nick Spencer]] and [[Ron Marz]].]]
The founders of Image were best known for their dynamic and extravagant art, and for character-driven thinly-plotted stories in the superhero genre, and although the company published dissimilar works, many readers came to perceive this as the "Image style" of comics.  Valentino had become less active as a creator after the company's first few years, and responded to this by using his position as a partner to seek out and publish a number of titles by other creators in distinctly different genres and styles, in a deliberate attempt to diversify Image's output and its perception. Although most of these series—ironically dubbed the "non-line" because of their lack of commonality—did not sell well and were soon cancelled, they introduced an increasingly important business model for the company: offering other creators the same total-ownership terms the partners enjoyed, but taking a fixed fee upon publication for the company's administrative costs.  This practice was later formalized as a function of "Image Central", the business unit independent of any of the studios.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}  This focus on non-studio comics increased when Valentino took on the role of Image's publisher, assuming many of the responsibilities held by Marder until he left the company in 1999.

The company's position in the North American [[direct market]] diminished in the 2000s, challenged by [[Dark Horse Comics]] and [[IDW Publishing]] for the position of "third largest publisher" after Marvel and DC.<ref name="comichron.com">[http://www.comichron.com/vitalstatistics/marketshares.html]</ref>  In February 2004, Larsen replaced Valentino as publisher, largely continuing existing business practices. Larsen stepped down as publisher in July 2008 and executive director [[Eric Stephenson (comics)|Eric Stephenson]] was promoted to the position.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080710-estephenson.html Eric Stephenson: Talking to the New Image Publisher], [[Newsarama]], July 9, 2008</ref>

Shortly after Stephenson's appointment, Image added a new partner. [[Robert Kirkman]], whose black and white series ''[[The Walking Dead (comics)|The Walking Dead]]'' had emerged as a long-running and popular series, and whose ''[[Invincible (comics)|Invincible]]'' had become one of the longest-running series featuring a newly created superhero in recent years, became the first partner added since its founding.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080722-KirkmanImage.html Robert Kirkman Named Image Partner]</ref>  In July 2010 he announced that he would create an imprint under his direction, known as [[Skybound]].<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38619/robert-kirkman-announces-skybound-a-new-division-image-comics "Robert Kirkman Announces Skybound, a New Division of Image Comics"], DreadCentral.com, July 19, 2010</ref>

Starting in 2009, Image entered a period of critical acclaim. They began to publish many award winning and award nominated series, including ''[[Chew (comics)|Chew]], [[Morning Glories (comics)|Morning Glories]], [[Fatale (Image Comics)|Fatale]], [[The Manhattan Projects]]'' and ''[[Saga (comics)|Saga]]''. Image's sales grew significantly during this period,<ref name="comichron.com"/> and an influx of big two creators began publishing creator-owned work with them.<ref>[http://multiversitycomics.com/columns/shifting-landscape-creator-owned-comics/]</ref>

As of 2010, the majority of titles Image publishes in a given month are non-studio productions.  McFarlane's ''Spawn'' and related titles, his [[McFarlane Toys]] line, Silvestri's [[Top Cow]] imprint, and Kirkman's various series remain a substantial segment of Image's total sales.  McFarlane's ''Spawn'' continues as the longest-running creator-owned title by an Image partner.  Valentino has returned to operating his own studio with his [[Shadowline]] imprint.
