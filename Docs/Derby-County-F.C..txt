'''Derby County Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑr|b|i|_|ˈ|k|aʊ|n|t|i}}) is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Derby]], [[Derbyshire]], England. Their home matches are played at [[Pride Park Stadium]], where the club moved to in 1997.

Notable for being one of the 12 founder members of [[the Football League]] in 1888, it is one of only ten clubs to have competed in every season of the [[English football league system]] and, in 2009, was ranked 137th in the top 200 European football teams of the 20th century by [[International Federation of Football History and Statistics]].<ref name="Europe">{{cite web|url=http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d|title=Europe's club of the Century|work=International Federation of Football History & Statistics|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref>

Derby County F.C. was founded in 1884, by William Morley, as an offshoot of [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]]; it has spent all but four seasons in the top two divisions of English football. The club's competitive peak came in the 1970s when they were twice [[Football League First Division|English League Champions]] and competed in major European competitions on [[Derby County F.C. in Europe|four separate occasions]], reaching the [[European Cup]] semi-finals, as well as winning several minor trophies. Additionally, the club was a strong force in the interwar years  and won the [[1945–46 FA Cup]].

The club adopted its now traditional black and white [[#Kit|club colours]] in the 1890s and appropriated its club nickname ''The Rams'', a tribute to its links with the First Regiment of Derby Militia, which took a [[sheep|ram]] as its mascot and the song "[[The Derby Ram (song)|The Derby Ram]]" as its regimental song,<ref name="The Derby Ram">{{cite news| url =http://www.folkplay.info/Texts/86sk--lj.htm| publisher =Folkplay| title =The Derby Ram, 1867|date = 28 June 2004}}</ref> at the same time.

===Beginning and early success===
Derby County F.C. was formed in 1884 as an offshoot of [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] in an attempt to give players and supporters a winter interest as well as secure the cricket club extra revenue. The original intention was to name the club "Derbyshire County F.C." to highlight the link, though the Derbyshire FA, formed in 1883, objected on the grounds it was too long and therefore would not have been understood by the fans who may mistake it for a Derbyshire FA team. Playing their home matches at the cricket club’s [[Racecourse Ground, Derby|Racecourse Ground]], 1884/85 saw the club undertake an extensive programme of friendly matches, the first of which was a 6–0 defeat to Great Lever on 13 September 1884. The club’s first competitive match came in the [[FA Cup 1884–85|1885 FA Cup]], where they lost 7–0 at home to [[Walsall Town F.C.|Walsall Town]].

Arguably the most important game in the club's history came in the [[FA Cup 1885–86|following season's]] FA Cup, when a 2–0 victory over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], already an emerging force in English football, helped establish Derby County F.C. on the English football map, helping the club to attract better opposition for friendlies and, in 1888, an invitation into the inaugural [[The Football League|Football League]]. The opening day of the first ever league season was 8 September 1888, when Derby came from 3–0 down away to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] to win 6–3, though the club ultimately finished 10th out of 12 teams. They absorbed another Derby club, [[Derby Midland F.C.]], who had been members of the [[Midland Football League|Midland League]], in 1891, leaving them as Derby's sole professional football club. [[Steve Bloomer]], generally considered to be Derby County's best-ever player, joined the club in 1892. In 1895 the club moved to a new stadium, the [[Baseball Ground]] (so called because it was previously used for baseball), which became their home for the next 102 years and adopted their traditional colours of black and white. Although Derby were inconsistent in the league, they did finish runners-up to Aston Villa in [[The Football League 1895–96|1896]] as well as achieving a number of third-place finishes. They were a strong force in the FA Cup, appearing in three finals in six years around the turn of the 20th Century, though lost all three, in 1898 (3–1 to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]],<ref name="1897FACup">{{cite web |url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1898.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110928080720/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1898.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 |title=Nottingham Forest 3 – 1 Derby County |publisher= facupfinals.co.uk|date=16 April 1898 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref> 1899 (4–1 to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]])<ref name="1899FACup">{{cite web |url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1899.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110928080749/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1899.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 |title=Sheffield United 4 – 1 Derby County |publisher= facupfinals.co.uk|date=15 April 1899 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref> and 1903 (6–0 to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]].<ref name="1903FACup">{{cite web |url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1903.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080804184801/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1903.html |archivedate=4 August 2008 |title=Bury 6 – 0 Derby County |publisher= facupfinals.co.uk|date=18 April 1903 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref>

===Edwardian and interwar era===
In 1906 Steve Bloomer was sold to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] due to financial constraints, and Derby subsequently suffered its first ever relegation the following [[The Football League 1906–07|season]],<ref name="historyofdcfc">{{cite web | title=The History of Derby County Football Club | publisher=Derby County F.C.|  url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/the-history-of-derby-county-255102.aspx| accessdate=30 October 2013 }}</ref> but under [[Jimmy Methven]]'s management they re-signed [[Steve Bloomer]] and regained their [[Football League First Division|First Division]] place in 1911.<ref name="historyofdcfc"/> In 1914 they were relegated again, but instantly won the Second Division to get promoted<ref name="historyofdcfc"/> (though World War I meant that they had to wait until 1919 to play First Division football again). After two seasons, they were relegated yet again in 1921. However, the appointment of [[George Jobey]] in 1925 kick-started a successful period for the Rams and, after promotion in 1926,<ref name="historyofdcfc"/> the club became a formidable force, with high finishes from the late 1920s and all through the 1930s.,<ref name="historyofdcfc"/> including finishing runners up twice.
[[File:Brian Clough and Brian Taylor Statue Derby.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The new Brian Clough and Peter Taylor Statue]]
Derby were one of several clubs to close down after the outbreak of [[World War II]] but restarted in the early 1940s, in part due to the persistence of Jack Nicholas and Jack Webb. Aided by the recruitment of [[Raich Carter]] and [[Peter Doherty (footballer)|Peter Doherty]], who had both been stationed in [[Loughborough]] during the War, Derby were one step ahead of the opposition when competitive football resumed with the [[FA Cup 1945–46|1946 FA Cup]] and won their first major trophy with a 4–1 victory over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]<ref name="FACupWinners">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10270~1026308,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090901205856/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10270~1026308,00.html |archivedate=1 September 2009 |title=FA Cup Winners 1946 |publisher= Derby County F.C.|date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref>

===Post-war success and decline===
The League restarted the following season after a break due to the [[Second World War]] and, under the management of Stuart McMillan, as well as twice breaking the British transfer record to sign [[Billy Steel]] and [[Johnny Morris (footballer)|Johnny Morris]] to replace Carter and Doherty, finished fourth and third in the 1948 and 1949 seasons respectively, before a steady decline set in and the club was relegated in 1953, after nearly 30 years in the top flight, and again in 1955 to drop to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history.<ref name="historyofdcfc"/> [[Harry Storer, Jr.|Harry Storer]] led Derby back into the second tier at the second attempt in [[1956–57 in English football|1957]], though the club progressed no further over the next decade under either Storer or his successor, former Derby player [[Tim Ward (footballer)|Tim Ward]].

===Brian Clough era===
In 1967, [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] took over and led them to their greatest glory. Having clinched the influential signing of [[Dave Mackay (footballer born 1934)|Dave Mackay]], Derby were promoted to the First Division in 1969, finished fourth in 1970,<ref name="historyofdcfc"/> were banned from competing in Europe due to financial irregularities in 1971 and won their first ever Football League Championship in 1972.<ref name="historyofdcfc"/> Though Derby did not retain their title the following season, they did reach the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. They lost to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in a controversial match which was subject to subsequent allegations that the Italian club had bribed the match officials, leading Clough to call the Italians "cheating bastards".<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/21/guardianobituaries.football Brian Clough obituary]  ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 September 2004</ref> Clough's frequent outspoken comments against football's establishment eventually led to him falling out with the board of directors at the club, and Clough and Taylor left in October 1973. Such was their impact on the club that, 37 years later, a 9'0 high bronze statue of the pair was erected outside [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]] in commemoration of their legacy.<ref name="cloughtaylormonument">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/CloughTaylorMonument/0,,10270~2083075,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101024222410/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/CloughTaylorMonument/0,,10270~2083075,00.html |archivedate=24 October 2010 |title=Rams Name The Date For Clough/Taylor Reveal |publisher= Derby County F.C.|date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref>

===Success and decline after Clough===
Despite the departure of Clough and Taylor, Derby's League success was repeated in the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75 season]] when they won the title under successor [[Dave Mackay (footballer born 1934)|Dave Mackay]], who had been a player under Clough when they had returned to the top flight in 1969. However, Derby's form declined towards the end of the 1970s and they went down to the Second Division in 1980 after a string of managers, including former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] boss [[Tommy Docherty]], unsettled the club trying desperately to maintain its place at the top of the First Division. Though they challenged well in their first season, Derby were soon hit hard by rising debts, falling attendances and dismal performances. Peter Taylor returned to the Baseball Ground as manager in early 1983 and kept Derby up that season, but he retired a year later just before Derby's relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for only the second time in their history. However, Derby did manage to avoid going out of business, and they were soon under the ownership of wealthy businessman [[Robert Maxwell]]. [[File:Derby Former Baseball Ground Commemoration by Denis O'Connor.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Derby County's former Baseball Ground commemoration by Denis O'Connor]]

===1980s revival===
After relegation to the Third Division in May 1984, the club appointed [[Arthur Cox (football)|Arthur Cox]] as manager. Although they missed out on promotion in Cox's first season as manager, they then won back-to-back promotions and were back in the First Division for the [[1987-88 in English football|1987–88 season]], with attendances also rising as the club's on-the-field fortunes and financial position improved. The financial backing of new chairman [[Robert Maxwell]] saw stars such as [[Peter Shilton]], [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]], [[Dean Saunders]], [[Trevor Hebberd]] and [[Ted McMinn]] brought to the club and they finished fifth in the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89 season]] However, English clubs were banned from European competition at the time following the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]] and so the Rams missed out on a place in the [[UEFA Cup]].

===End of the century===
A lack of any further investment from Maxwell quickly led to a decline, culminating in relegation back to the Second Division in 1991. At this time, local newspaper businessman [[Lionel Pickering]] became the majority shareholder of the club, taking control just before Maxwell's death in November 1991.

In 1992, Derby County paid £2.5 million for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] central defender [[Craig Short]], at the time – and for five years afterwards – the most expensive player to be signed by a club outside the top flight, and indeed one of the highest fees paid by any English club for a player at the time. Other expensive signings included strikers [[Tommy Johnson (footballer, born 1971)|Tommy Johnson]] and [[Marco Gabbiadini]].

Cox's resignation as manager in October 1993 saw the appointment of legendary former player [[Roy McFarland]] as manager. Derby reached the final of the Division One playoffs that season, but were beaten by local rivals [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. McFarland was sacked a year later after Derby missed out on the playoffs, and his replacement was [[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]] – a manager whose track record at his previous clubs included four promotions and an [[FA Cup]] semi-final appearance.

Although the [[1995-96 in English football|1995–96 season]] started slowly, the signing of sweeper [[Igor Štimac]] in the early autumn proved pivotal. Smith guided the Rams to a second-place finish and the [[Premier League]], now the top flight of English football. During that season, it was announced that Derby would be leaving the Baseball Ground after more than 100 years to move into a new all-seater stadium, following earlier plans to develop the Baseball Ground as a 26,000-seat stadium.

After finishing in 12th place in their first season back into the top flight, the club left the Baseball Ground, its home of 102 years, to move into the new 33,597-seat [[Pride Park Stadium]] for the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98 season]]. The Baseball Ground was demolished six years later and a memorial was eventually erected in memory of its role in [[Derby]] city history.<ref name="BBGMemorial">{{cite web | title=Baseball Ground sculpture has been unveiled| work=ThisIsDerbyshire|  url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Baseball-Ground-sculpture-unveiled/story-11593931-detail/story.html| accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref>

===21st century===
The club settled well into its new home as it recorded back-to-back top 10 finishes for the first time since their 1970s peak, before a sudden decline at the turn of the millennium saw three years of struggle. Smith resigned to be replaced by former players, [[Colin Todd]], who lasted just three months, and [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] before the Rams were relegated after a six-year stay in the top flight, in 2002.

Derby County's relegation saw the club enter a serious financial crisis, which forced them to sell many key players. Gregory was later suspended from his managerial duties over alleged misconduct and former [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] boss [[George Burley]] was brought in. The club was put into [[receivership]] then sold in October 2003 for £3 to a group led by [[Jeremy Keith]]. After finishing 20th in the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season, a dramatic improvement in the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] season saw Derby finish 4th in the [[Football League Championship]], qualifying for a promotion play-off spot, though they lost in the semi-finals to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. Soon afterwards, Burley resigned citing differences between himself and the board. He was replaced by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] first team coach, [[Phil Brown (footballer born 1959)|Phil Brown]]. In January 2006, Brown was sacked after a poor run of results. Terry Westley, the academy coach at the time, took over first team duties until the end of the season and saved Derby from relegation.

In April 2006 a consortium of local businessmen led by former vice-chairman [[Peter Gadsby]] bought the club, reducing its debt and returning Pride Park Stadium to the club's ownership in the process. In June 2006, former [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] boss [[Billy Davies]] was appointed Derby County's new permanent manager. In his first season, Davies took Derby to the Championship [[play-off]]s, where they beat [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on penalties in the semi-finals before defeating [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 1–0 with a second-half [[Stephen Pearson]] goal at the new [[Wembley Stadium]] to secure a return to the Premier League and the associated £60m windfall. In October 2007, Peter Gadsby stepped down as chairman to be replaced by former Hull City owner [[Adam Pearson]], who immediately began searching for investment from overseas.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067444.stm New Derby chairman backs Davies] BBC Sport Online</ref> After a poor start to the season, manager Billy Davies left by mutual consent in November.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/derby/article2946767.ece Billy Davies leaves Derby by mutual consent] ''The Times''</ref> He was succeeded by [[Paul Jewell]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2326932/Paul-Jewell-appointed-Derby-manager.html|title=Paul Jewell appointed Derby manager|author=Giles Mole and agencies|date=28 November 2007|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> who failed to save the club as Derby suffered the Premier League's earliest ever relegation, in March,<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Derby 2–2 Fulham |url=http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7309363.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 March 2008 |accessdate=29 March 2008 }}</ref> recorded the Premier League's lowest-ever points total,<ref>{{cite news |title=Dismal Derby take Cats' sad place in the record books |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/dismal-derby-take-cats-sad-place-in-the-record-books-1-1149317 |publisher=Sunderland Echo |date=29 March 2008 |accessdate=31 October 2013 }}</ref> and equalled [[Loughborough F.C.|Loughborough's]] 108-year Football League record of going through an entire season with only one win. In January, the club was taken over by an international investment group led by General Sports and Entertainment, with Pearson remaining as de facto chairman.<ref>{{cite news |title=New owners reveal Derby ambition |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7210230.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 January 2008 |accessdate=31 October 2013 }}</ref>

Derby's match at home to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 13 September 2008 generated much media coverage as it was approaching a year since Derby's last league win, a run which saw the club break the English league record for most matches without a win. Just four days short of the anniversary of the 1–0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]], Rob Hulse scored against his former club as Derby ran out 2–1 winners, earning Paul Jewell his first league win as Derby boss at his 27th attempt. Despite taking the club to the League Cup semi-final, the club's first major cup semi-final since 1976, where Derby lost 4–3 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] over two legs, Jewell resigned as manager in December 2008 after a run of just 2 wins in 11 matches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7802617.stm|title=Jewell resigns as Derby manager|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Nigel Clough]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Clough takes over as Derby boss |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7813858.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=31 October 2013 }}</ref> son of former manager [[Brian Clough|Brian]]. He led the club to 18th place and safety. After two seasons that saw the club finish in the bottom half of the table, Derby finished the two subsequent seasons in 12th and 10th place. Clough was sacked nine games into the [[2013-14 in English football|2013–14 season]], after defeat to local rivals Nottingham Forest, and was replaced by former Derby player and assistant manager [[Steve McClaren]]. Under McClaren the club finished third in the Championship and reached the final of the [[Football League Championship play-offs|play-offs]], after beating [[Brighton & Hove Albion]] 6–2 on aggregate in the semifinals, although in the finals they lost 1–0 to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the 89th minute.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Paul|title=Derby 0 – 1 QPR|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27452294|accessdate=25 May 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=24 May 2014}}</ref> McClaren also saw The Rams beat their record for most goals scored in one season (84 goals).

The [[2014-15 in English football|2014–15 season]] saw Derby competing at the top end of the Championship for much of the season, even leading the table going in to March. However, a slump in performances and a poor run of form towards the end of the season in which Derby only picked up two wins in thirteen matches saw them slide down to eighth, not only missing out on automatic promotion, but the play-off positions as well. As a result of this, on 25 May 2015 Steve McClaren was sacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32878657|title=Steve McClaren: Derby County sack head coach|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> Paul Clement was announced as McClaren's successor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32955201|title=Derby County appoint Paul Clement as head coach|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> On 3 June 2015, local businessman Mel Morris was named as the new Chairman of the club, replacing Andrew Appleby who remained as a director.

The [[2015–16 Football League Championship|2015-16 season]] saw Derby again competing for promotion to the Premier League. They sacked their head coach, [[Paul Clement (football coach)|Paul Clement]] after eight months in charge, appointing academy director [[Darren Wassall]] as coach for the remainder of the season.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35528402</ref> They finished fifth in the league, but lost to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull]] in the play-off semi final.

===Crest===
[[File:Derby County badge old.png|frame|lright|Derby County's badge from 1946]]
Like most old football clubs, Derby County did not initially have any badge displayed on their shirts. Their first badge was introduced in 1924. The badge consisted of a circular shield split into three equally sized sections, representing the club, its fans and the area, all containing items traditionally associated with the city of Derby: a [[Tudor rose]] and a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] in one section, a [[deer|buck]] in a park in the second and a [[domestic sheep|ram]]'s head in the final section. The badge was worn on the players' shirts for just two seasons before they reverted to plain shirts.

By 1934, another badge had been introduced. This time it was a traditionally shaped shield, again with three sections. The buck in the park had been removed and the rose and the crown had been split up and now occupied a section each. The ram's head also remained and was now given the largest section of the shield. The badge never appeared on the players' shirts. The shield was modified in 1946 when the rose and crown were removed and replaced with the letters DC (Derby County) and FC (Football Club) respectively. The badge, right, was featured on to the player's shirts from its introduction onwards, though the ram's head on its own was used from the late 1960s (the full shield, however, remained the club's official logo).

A new club badge was introduced in 1971, featuring a more modern design that, with modifications, is still in use. The badge was initially consisted of a stylised white ram facing left. The badge was first modified slightly in 1979 to include the text 'Derby County FC' under the ram (though the ram remained on its own on away kits). In 1982 the ram turned to face to the right and the text under it was removed. The ram was surrounded by a wreath of laurel and the text 'Centenary 1984–1985' was printed underneath for the club's centenary season. The laurel was removed and the text reading 'Derby County FC' returned from the next season. In 1993, the ram faced left again and the text was removed once more. From 1995, the ram faced right and was enclosed in a diamond, with a gold banner reading 'Derby County FC' underneath and the text '1884' (the year of the club's foundation) underneath that. The design was changed again in 1997 (see left): the ram faced now left and the golden banner now simply read 'Derby County'; the diamond and year of formation were removed.

[[File:Derby County F.C. logo.png|thumb|150px|right|Derby County's badge from 2009 to 2013, a version of this badge with gold trim was used from 2007 to 2009.]]
A decade later, in 2007, the badge was modified again with the ram still facing left and the text 'Est. 1884' now in the middle of a circular frame featuring 'Derby County Football Club' in gold lettering, with the colours being modified to the club colours of black and white in 2009 (see top of page). In July 2012, the club announced intention to show only the iconic Ram on future shirts, rather than the full club logo. In July 2013, this traditional Ram became the club's full logo again.

===Colours===
Derby County's original colours (right) were amber, chocolate and blue, though by the 1890s the club had adopted its now traditional colours of black and white, which are still in use today. In the 1970s and 80s, colours for home matches were white shirts with small blue or red touches (on the club badge or shirt makers insignia), blue shorts and socks that were blue, red, white or a combination of the three.<ref name="DerbyKits">{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Derby_County/Derby_County.htm |title=Derby County |publisher=Historical Football Kits |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> The colours of away kits have varied widely, and although they are usually yellow/gold or blue, the colour for the away kit for the 2008–09 season was fluorescent green.<ref name="AwayKits">{{cite web | title=New green Rams away kit revealed| work=Soccerlens|  url=http://www.derbycounty-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/new_rams_green_away_shirt_revealed_401625/index.shtml| accessdate=31 October 2013 }}</ref> The club also introduced a surprise third kit in August 2008. Similar in design to the club's away kit of the 1970s, with blue and white stripes and reminiscent of the [[Argentina National Football Team|Argentina]] strip, the style was re-introduced following feedback from fans who said it was one of their favourite kits from the club's past.<ref name="ThirdKit">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~1379192,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100301143310/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~1379192,00.html |archivedate=1 March 2010 |title=Stars in stripes |publisher= Derby County F.C.|date=30 August 2008 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref>

===Club mascot===
Derby's mascot is a ram named Rammie. Rammie is a full-time employee of the club who also works to maintain the club's links with fans and the East Midlands in general, such as school visits to promote literacy and charity events.<ref name="Rammie">{{cite web | title=Rammie| publisher=Derby County F.C. | url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/club/rammie/| accessdate=31 October 2013 }}</ref><ref name="RammiePledge">{{cite web |url=http://www.therams.co.uk/details.asp?back=true&key=3957%7C0%7C33E8304982607%7CR%7C830%7C1047024412007312598132&parentkey=3957%7C0%7C33E8304982607%7Cp%7C830%7C0 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070711224408/http://www.therams.co.uk/details.asp?back=true&key=3957%7C0%7C33E8304982607%7CR%7C830%7C1047024412007312598132&parentkey=3957%7C0%7C33E8304982607%7Cp%7C830%7C0 |archivedate=11 July 2007 |title=Rammie sets example with pledge for 2007 |publisher= therams.co.uk |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Rammie originally emerged as a more friendly option to the club's traditional links with the [[British Army]].

Shortly thereafter, Rammie was joined by a female equivalent, named Eweie. Eweie did not last very long at Pride Park, however, and took a reported "vacation" to the United States. She returned from a 10-year exile on 3 October 2015, at a home match against Brentford F.C.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Derby County: Rams supporters welcome home Ewie – can you spot yourself with Rammie?|url = http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/pictures/Derby-County-Rams-supporters-welcome-home-Ewie/pictures-27915294-detail/pictures.html|website = Derby Telegraph|accessdate = 1 December 2015}}</ref>

==Stadium==
[[File:Pride Park.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Pride Park Stadium has been Derby's home since 1997]]
As an offshoot of [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]], Derby County’s first home stadium was [[County Cricket Ground, Derby|County Cricket Ground]], also known as the Racecourse Ground, where the club played its [[Football League|league]] and [[FA Cup]] matches between 1884 and 1895. Although the ground itself was good enough to hold the first FA Cup final match outside London, when [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] beat [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|W.B.A.]] 2–0 in the [[1886 FA Cup Final|1886 FA Cup final Replay]]<ref name="1886CupFinal">{{cite web |url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1886.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110928075854/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1886.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 |title=1886 – Blackburn Rovers |publisher= facupfinals.co.uk |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> and a full [[England national football team|England International]], disputes over fixture clashed between the football and cricket clubs meant that when the opportunity to play at [[Francis Ley|Sir Francis Ley’s]] [[Baseball Ground]] arose, the club accepted.<ref name="BBGArtcicle">{{cite news| url =http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-derbys-muddy-oasis-of-sulphur-and-spectacle-1260743.html| work =The Independent| title =Derby's muddy oasis of sulphur and spectacle| date = 10 May 1997 | location=London | first=Jon | last=Culley | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

Commonly referred to amongst supporters as "the BBG", the club moved to the [[Baseball Ground]] in 1895 and remained there for the next 102 years, despite opportunities to move in the 1920s and 1940s.<ref name="BBGArtcicle"/> Derby had already played there, a 1–0 win over [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] during the [[1891–92 Football League|1891–92 season]], as an alternate venue after a fixture clash at The County Ground. At its peak during the late 1960s, the ground could hold around 42,000 – the club’s record attendance achieved following the opening of the Ley Stand with a 41,826 crowd watching a 5–0 defeat of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 20 September 1969.<ref name="BBGArtcicle"/> From this peak, the continued addition of seating saw the capacity drop over the next 15 years to 26,500 in 1985.

Following the [[Taylor Report]] in 1989, and the legal requirement for all seater stadia, the ground’s capacity dwindled to just 18,500 by the mid-1990s, not enough for the then ambitious second tier club. Despite initially hoping to rebuild the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000 spectators, and rejecting the offer of two sites elsewhere in Derby, then-Chairman [[Lionel Pickering]] announced in February 1996 the intention to move to a new, purpose built stadium at the newly regenerated [[Pride Park]], with the last ever first team game at the Baseball Ground being in May 1997, a 1–3 home defeat to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], though it continued to host reserve games until 2003. Derby's new ground, named [[Pride Park Stadium]], was officially opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 18 July, with a friendly against [[Sampdoria]] following on 4 August.

Derby hold the unique distinction of being the only club to have had three home grounds host full England internationals. [[England national football team|England]] beat [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]] 9–0 at the [[County Cricket Ground, Derby|Racecourse Ground]] in 1895, beat Ireland again, 2–1, at the [[Baseball Ground]] in 1911 and, most recently, [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]] hosted England's 4–0 win over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in May 2001.<ref>[http://www.englandstats.com/venue.php], England AFC. Retrieved 31 October 2013</ref>

Pride Park was renamed the iPro Stadium on 7 December 2013, as part of a 10-year, £7 million sponsorship deal with global sports' drink company iPro.

Tony Francis of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' noted: "Derby is a passionate football town... Even in Division Two, it's a reasonable bet that crowds at Pride Park would not fall far below 20,000.

Retrieved 9 April 2008</ref> Meetings between the side are often christened with the sobriquet [[Derby County F.C.–Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|East Midlands derby]] and the winning team is awarded the [[Brian Clough Trophy]]. The rivalry as a whole largely developed from the 1970s, due to former Derby manager [[Brian Clough]] taking over at Forest, much to the anger of the Derby fans; in fact some commentators have described the rivalry to be as much about which club owns Clough's heart as much as the proximity of the clubs geographically.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/football_league/article5489265.ece|title=Nigel Clough: father's pride|work=The Times|accessdate=15 January 2010 | location=London | first=Duncan | last=Hamilton | date=11 January 2009}}</ref>

The rivalry with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] stems largely from geographical location rather than any shared history.<ref name="Rivals">{{cite web |url=http://www.youandyesterday.co.uk/articles/Derby_County#Local_rivals |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091217010209/http://bygonederbyshire.co.uk/articles/Derby_County#Local_rivals |archivedate=17 December 2009 |title=Derby County |publisher= You and Yesterday|date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref>

[[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] are disliked due to ongoing friction from the early 1970s when Derby and Leeds were two of the top English teams and the scarcely concealed hostility between their respective managers, Brian Clough and Don Revie.<ref name="Rivals"/> The rivalry is documented in the [[The Damned Utd|novel]] and [[The Damned United|film]] ''The Damned United''. This rivalry is stronger on Derby's side; whilst Derby consider Leeds their 2nd biggest rivals, Leeds fans focus more on their dislike of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref name="top3rivals"/>

===Top 10 Derby goals===
On 2 June 2009, the Club announced the supporters choice of the Top 10 Goals in the club's history, with the fans then asked again to choose their favourite from the 10 nominated. The list was obviously biased in favour of more recent goals, largely thanks to the increased coverage modern football enjoys. Three goals featured from the club's 2008/09 campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/125News/0,,10270~1677968,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090605150144/http://www.dcfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/125News/0,,10270~1677968,00.html |archivedate=5 June 2009 |title=The Final Countdown |publisher= Derby County F.C.|date=4 June 2009 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> The winners were announced on 22 June 2009.<ref>{{cite web

==Derby County in Europe==
{{Main|Derby County F.C. in Europe}}

Derby first competed in Europe when they entered the [[European Cup 1972-73|1972–73 European Cup]] after winning the [[1971–72 in English football#First Division|1971–72 First Division Title]],<ref name="DerbyInEurope">{{cite web |url=http://beehive.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&ID=11165&PageID=65889 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110926231729/http://beehive.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&ID=11165&PageID=65889 |archivedate=26 September 2011 |title=The Rams in Europe |publisher= thisisderbyshire.co.uk |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> reaching the semi-final stages, where they lost 3–1 on aggregate to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in controversial circumstances. They had qualified for the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1970-71|1970–71 Fairs Cup]] after finishing the [[1969–70 in English football#First Division|1969–70 First Division]] in 4th, but were banned from entering the competition for financial irregularities. The 70s was the Derby County’s peak in English football and they qualified for Europe in three of the next four seasons, competing in the [[UEFA Cup]] or the [[European Cup]] in each of the three seasons between [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75]] and [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77]].

The club then declined rapidly and has not appeared in the top European competitions since, though it finished in 5th in the [[1988–89 in English football|1989 First Division]] which would have guaranteed entry into the [[1989–90 UEFA Cup]] but English Clubs were banned from Europe following the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]].

Outside of major competition, the club competed in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] between [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] and [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]], reaching the final in 1993, losing 3–1 to [[U.S. Cremonese|Cremonese]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].

{{Details|Derby County F.C. league record by opponent}}

[[Kevin Hector]] holds the record for Derby County appearances in all competitions, turning out 589 times in two separate spells with the club between 1966 and 1982.

Just counting league appearances, Hector is again in the lead, with 486 appearances, ahead of Jack Parry, who played 483 times for the club between 1948 and 1967.

The club's all-time top scorer is [[Steve Bloomer]], often referred to as ''Football's First Superstar'', who netted 332 goals for the club in two spells between 1892 and 1914.

The club's record attendance is 41,826, for a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] match against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at the [[Baseball Ground]] on 20 September 1969, which Derby won 5–0. The record is unlikely to be broken in the near future as Derby's current stadium, [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]] has a limit of 33,597 spectators. The record attendance at Pride Park for a competitive Derby County match is 33,378 for a [[Premier League]] match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 18 March 2000.

Derby hold several [[Football records in England|records in English football]]. The [[Derby County F.C. season 2007–08|2007–08 Premier League campaign]] saw the club equal [[Loughborough F.C.|Loughborough]]'s all-time league record of just one win in an entire league season. They also equalled or set several [[FA Premier League|Premier league]] records (1992–present), including Least Home Wins in a Season (1, joint with [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]]) and Least Away Wins in a Season (0, joint with 5 other teams) and Most Defeats in a Season (29). Records set included Fewest Points in a season (3 points for a win) with 11, Fewest Goals Scored (20) and Worst Goal Difference (−69). The club also holds the record for Most Consecutive League Games Without A Win, with 37 matches between 22 September 2007 and 13 September 2008, and the Record Defeat in an FA Cup Final, when they lost 6–0 to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] in 1903.<ref name = "Derby County Stats">Statistics taken from Rothman's Football Yearbook 2008.</ref>
