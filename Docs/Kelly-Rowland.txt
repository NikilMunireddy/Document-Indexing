==Career==

===1997–2001: Destiny's Child===
Taken from a passage in the Biblical [[Book of Isaiah]], the group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1993.<ref name="Kaufman"/>  Together, they performed in local events and, after four years on the road, the group was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in late 1997. That same year, Destiny's Child recorded their major label debut song "Killing Time", for the soundtrack to the 1997 film, ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]''.<ref name="J.R."/><ref name="Kaufman"/> The following year, the group released their [[Destiny's Child (album)|self-titled debut album]], spawning hits such as "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]".<ref name="Farley"/> The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, amassing moderate sales and winning the group three [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards]].<ref name="Kaufman"/> The group rose to fame after releasing their multi-platinum second album ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'' in 1999.<ref name="mtvnews">{{cite web |title=Destiny's Child: Where did it all go wrong? |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature_061405/ |work=MTV News |publisher=Viacom |date=March 13, 2000 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> The album featured some of the group's most widely known songs such as "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]", "[[Jumpin' Jumpin']]" and "[[Say My Name]]", which became their most-successful song at the time, and would remain as one of their [[signature song]]s. "Say My Name" won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[43rd Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name="Kaufman"/> ''The Writing's on the Wall'' sold more than 15 million copies worldwide,<ref name="Farley"/> essentially becoming their breakthrough album.<ref name="ASCAP">{{cite web|title=The Best in Hip hop/Soul |url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2004/winter/hiphopsoul2.html |publisher=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) |accessdate=April 2, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Anthony">{{cite news|last=Anthony|first=James|title='Of course you can lose yourself'|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1852025,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=August 18, 2006|accessdate=April 16, 2008|location=London}}</ref>

Along with their commercial successes, the group became entangled in much-publicized turmoil involving the filing of a lawsuit by Luckett and Roberson for breach of contract. The issue was heightened after [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]] appeared in the video of "Say My Name", implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Eventually, Luckett and Roberson left the group. Franklin would eventually fade from the group after five months,<ref name="Farley"/> as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the departure.<ref name="Kaufman"/> After settling on their final lineup, the trio recorded "[[Independent Women Part I]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. It became their best-charting single, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eleven consecutive weeks.<ref name="Kaufman"/><ref name="ASCAP"/> The success cemented the new lineup and skyrocketed them to fame.<ref name="People"/> Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former band mates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.<ref name="Kaufman"/>

Later that year, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', Rowland appeared on the remix of [[Avant]]'s single "[[Separated (song)|Separated]]". ''Survivor'', which channeled the turmoil the band underwent, spawned its [[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|lead single of the same name]], which was a response to the experience.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |title=Destiny's Child Use Turmoil To Fuel New LP |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435986/20010108/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |publisher=Viacom |date=2001-01-08 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> The song went on to win a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.<ref name="survivorgrammy">{{cite web|title=Destiny's Child Timeline |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-d/destinyschild.htm |work=''Rockonthenet.com'' |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> The themes of "Survivor", however, caused Luckett and Roberson to refile their lawsuit;<ref name="Kaufman"/> the proceedings were eventually settled in June 2002.<ref name="Anthony"/> Meanwhile, the album was released in May 2001, debuting at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.<ref name="Martens3">{{cite web|last=Todd |first=Martens |title=Beyonce, Branch Albums Storm The Chart |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70145/beyonce-branch-albums-storm-the-chart |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |date=July 2, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> To date, ''Survivor'' has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the US alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Troy |title=Destiny's Child Slapped With Infringement Suit |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68539/destinys-child-slapped-with-infringement-suit |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=October 22, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> The album also spawned the number-one hit "[[Bootylicious]]".
