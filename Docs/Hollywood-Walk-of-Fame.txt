The '''Hollywood Walk of Fame''' comprises more than 2,500 five-pointed [[terrazzo]] and [[brass]] stars embedded in the [[sidewalk]]s along 15 [[city block|blocks]] of [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and three blocks of [[Vine Street]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the [[entertainment industry]], bearing the names of a mix of actors, musicians, directors, producers, musical and theatrical groups, fictional characters, and others. The Walk of Fame is administered by the Hollywood [[chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] and maintained by the self-financing Hollywood Historic Trust. It is a popular tourist destination, with a reported 10 million visitors in 2003.<!-- detail moved to Description-->

==Description==
{{See also|List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame}}

The Walk of Fame runs 1.3 miles (2.1&nbsp;km) east to west on Hollywood Boulevard from Gower Street to [[La Brea Avenue]], plus a short segment of Marshfield Way that runs diagonally between Hollywood and La Brea; and 0.4 miles (0.7&nbsp;km) north to south on Vine Street between Yucca Street and [[Sunset Boulevard]].

According to a 2003 report by the market research firm NPO Plog Research, the Walk attracts about 10 million visitors annually—more than [[Sunset Strip]], [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] (formerly Grauman's), the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]—and has played an important role in making tourism the largest industry in [[Los Angeles County]].<ref name=Martin1>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/06/business/la-fi-walk-of-fame6-2010feb06|title=Golden milestone for the Hollywood Walk of Fame||last=Martin|first=Hugo|date=February 8, 2010|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate= March 6, 2016}}</ref>

{{As of|2016|01|06|df=US}}, the Walk comprises 2,570 stars,<ref>[http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/upcoming-ceremonies "Upcoming ceremonies, 2570th star"].walkoffame.com.</ref> spaced at {{convert|6|ft|m|sing=on}} intervals.  The monuments are coral-pink [[terrazzo]] five-point stars rimmed with [[brass]] (not bronze, an oft-repeated inaccuracy<ref name="WOFFAQ">{{cite web|publisher = Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|title = Walk of Fame Frequently Asked Questions|url = http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/faqs |accessdate = May 13, 2011}}</ref>) inlaid into a charcoal-colored terrazzo background. In the upper portion of each star field the name of the honoree is inlaid in brass block letters. Below the inscription, in the lower half of the star field, a round inlaid brass emblem indicates the category of the honoree's contributions. The emblems symbolize five categories within the entertainment industry:

==History==

===Origin===
[[File:Hollywood boulevard from kodak theatre.jpg|thumb|The Walk of Fame at the 6800 block of Hollywood Boulevard, looking eastward. The Dolby Theatre is in the foreground at left. In the upper left quadrant is the famous intersection of [[Hollywood and Highland]].]]

The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce credits E.M. Stuart, its volunteer president in 1953, with the original idea for creating a Walk of Fame.  Stuart reportedly proposed the Walk as a means to "maintain the glory of a community whose name means glamour and excitement in the four corners of the world."<ref name="historyof">
{{cite web|title=History of the Walk of Fame|work=walkoffame.com|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}</ref>  Harry Sugarman, another Chamber member and president of the Hollywood Improvement Association, receives credit in an independent account.<ref name="LA Magazine">

}}</ref> A committee was formed to flesh out the idea, and an architectural firm was retained to develop specific proposals. By 1955 the basic concept and general design had been agreed upon, and plans were submitted to the [[Los Angeles City Council]].

Multiple accounts exist for the origin of the star concept. According to one, the historic [[Hollywood Hotel]] — which stood for more than 50 years on Hollywood Boulevard at the site now occupied by the [[Hollywood and Highland|Hollywood and Highland complex]] and the [[Dolby Theatre|Dolby (formerly Kodak) Theatre]]<ref>Garcia, Courtney (June 11, 2012) [http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/11/entertainment-us-oscars-dolby-idUSBRE85A1MH20120611 "Out with Kodak, in with Dolby at home of Oscars"].

Retrieved December 11, 2013.</ref> — displayed stars on its dining room ceiling above the tables favored by its most famous celebrity patrons, and that may have served as an early inspiration.<ref name="latimes.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hollywood-walk-of-fame6-2010feb06-pictures,0,3869071.photogallery|title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame {{!}} A brief history in photos|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> By another account the stars were "inspired ... by Sugarman's [Tropics Restaurant] drinks menu, which featured celebrity photos framed in gold stars."<ref name="LA Magazine"/><ref>{{cite web |first=Martin|last=Townsend|title=Los Angeles History – Extinct Restaurants & Cafes S-Z|publisher=LATimeMachines.com|url=http://www.latimemachines.com/new_page_43.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020123952/http://www.latimemachines.com/new_page_43.htm|archivedate=October 20, 2006|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}<!-- ownership only --></ref>

In February 1956 a prototype was unveiled featuring a [[caricature]] of an example honoree ([[John Wayne]], by some accounts<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=David|title=The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood|publisher=Vintage|year=2006|isbn=0-375-70154-0|page=149}}</ref>) inside a blue star on a brown background.<ref name="historyof"/> However, caricatures proved too expensive and difficult to execute in brass with the technology available at the time; and the brown and blue motif was vetoed by [[Charles E. Toberman]], the legendary real estate developer known as "Mr. Hollywood", because the colors clashed with a new building he was erecting on Hollywood Boulevard.<ref name="historyof"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Gregory Paul|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9W4R_CZtFe8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Story of Hollywood: An Illustrated History|publisher=BL Press|isbn=978-0-9776299-0-9|accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref>

===Selection and construction===
By March 1956 the final design and coral-and-charcoal color scheme had been approved, and between the spring of 1956 and the fall of 1957, 1,558 honorees were selected by committees representing the four major branches of the entertainment industry at that time: motion pictures, television, audio recording, and radio. The committees met at the [[Brown Derby]] restaurant,<ref name="ap2006">{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/preview/articles/0630walkoffame0630.html<!-- was http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/0630walkoffame0630.html-->|title= Price of Fame in Hollywood? $15,000|author=Cohen, Sandy|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=June 30, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> and included such prominent names as [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Jesse L. Lasky]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Mack Sennett]], and [[Walter Lantz]].<ref name="historyof"/>
[[File:hwof joanne woodward.jpg|thumb|left|Woodward's star, contrary to popular belief, was not the first.]] 
A requirement stipulated by the original audio recording committee (and later rescinded) specified minimum sales of one million records or 250,000 albums for all music category nominees.  The committee soon realized that many important recording artists would be excluded from the Walk by that requirement.  As a result, the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] was formed for the purpose of creating a separate award system for the music business.  The first [[Grammy Award]]s were presented in Beverly Hills in 1959.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z1gMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3612,4838071&dq=paul+weston+grammy&hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|page=13|newspaper=The Robesonian|location=Lumberton, N.C.|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref>

Construction of the Walk began in 1958 but two lawsuits delayed completion. The first was filed by local property owners challenging the legality of the [[United States dollar|$]]1.25 million tax assessment levied upon them to pay for the Walk, along with new street lighting and trees. In October 1959 the assessment was ruled legal.<ref name="historyof"/> The second lawsuit, filed by [[Charles Chaplin, Jr.]], sought damages for the exclusion of his father, whose nomination had been withdrawn due to pressure from multiple quarters (see [[Hollywood Walk of Fame#Controversial additions|Controversial additions]]). Chaplin's suit was dismissed in 1960, paving the way for completion of the project.<ref name="historyof"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/167734333.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Aug%2011,%201960&author=&pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times&edition=&startpage=&desc=Judge%20Refuses%20Chaplin%20Walk%20of%20Fame%20Request |title=Judge Refuses Chaplin Walk of Fame Request|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 11, 1960|page=B2|accessdate=June 11, 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref name="LATimesWhy">{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/#no-love|title=Why doesn't Clint Eastwood have a star?|accessdate=May 20, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

===Stagnation and revitalization===

Though the Walk was originally conceived in part to encourage redevelopment of Hollywood Boulevard, the 1960s and 1970s were periods of protracted urban decay in the Hollywood area as residents moved to suburbs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shuitt|first=Doug|date=April 16, 1972|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/156913667.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr%2016,%201972&author=DOUG%20SHUIT&pub=Los%20Angeles%20Times%20%281923-Current%20File%29&edition=&startpage=AB&desc=Hollywood%20Blvd.---The%20Old%20Glamor%20Has%20Vanished |title=Hollywood Blvd.---The Old Glamor Has Vanished|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Vincent1>{{cite news|author=Vincent, Roger|date=May 6, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/06/business/fi-hollyangst6|title=Neighborhood face-lift gives Hollywood pause|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 24, 2011}}</ref>
From the initial installation of more than 1,500 stars in 1960–1961, eight years<!-- [[WP:CALC]] --> passed without the addition of a new star. In 1962 the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance naming the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce "the agent to advise the City" about adding names to the Walk, and the Chamber, over the following six years, devised rules, procedures, and financing methods to do so.<ref name="historyof"/>

In 1984 a fifth category, Live Theatre, was added to permit acknowledgement of contributions from the live performance branch of the entertainment industry, and a second row of stars was created on each sidewalk to alternate with the existing stars.<ref name="historyof"/>
[[File:Hollywood-walk-of-fame.jpg|thumb|right|Hollywood Boulevard, 7000 block, north side, looking westward.]]

In 1994 the Walk of Fame was extended one block to the west on Hollywood Boulevard, from Sycamore Avenue to North LaBrea Avenue (plus the short segment of Marshfield Way that connects Hollywood and La Brea), where it now ends at the silver "Four Ladies of Hollywood" gazebo and the special "Walk of Fame" star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hwof.com/star/special/hollywood-walk-of-fame/3|title="Hollywood Walk of Fame" star|publisher=HWOF LLC|work=hwof.com|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}</ref> At the same time [[Sophia Loren]] was honored with the 2,000th star on the Walk.<ref name="historyof"/>

===Restoration===
In 2008 a long-term restoration project began with an evaluation of all 2,365 stars on the Walk at the time, each receiving a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F. Honorees whose stars received F grades, indicating the most severe damage, were [[Joan Collins]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Andrew L. Stone]], [[Willard Waterman]], [[Richard Boleslavsky]], [[Ellen Drew]], [[Frank Crumit]], and [[Bobby Sherwood]]. Fifty celebrities' stars received "D" grades. The damage ranged from minor cosmetic flaws caused by normal weathering to holes and fissures severe enough to constitute a walking hazard. At least 778 stars will eventually be repaired or replaced during the ongoing project at an estimated cost of $4 million to $4.2 million.<ref name="LAT22">{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=July 22, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/22/local/me-walk22|title=Walk of Fame going to have a little work done|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref>

The restoration is a collaboration among the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and various Los Angeles city and county governmental offices, along with the MTA, which operates the [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Red Line]] that runs beneath the Walk, since earth movement due to the presence of the subway line is thought to be partly responsible for the damage.<ref name="WOFfix">{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=July 17, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/17/local/me-walk17|title=Walk of Fame fix won't be easy stroll|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref>

===Controversial additions===
[[File:Walk of fames Charlie.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of Charlie Chaplin's star on the Walk of Fame|Selected 1956, installed 1972.]]
[[Charlie Chaplin]] is the only honoree to be selected twice for the same star on the Walk. He was unanimously voted into the initial group of 500 in 1956 but the Selection Committee ultimately excluded him, ostensibly due to questions regarding his morals (he had been charged with violating the  [[Mann Act]]—and exonerated—during the [[Sexual slavery#White slavery|White Slavery]] hysteria of the 1940s) but more likely due to his left-leaning political views.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/23/newsid_3055000/3055581.stm "On This Day: September 23, 1952: Charlie Chaplin Comes Home"].

Walk of Fame rules prohibit consideration of nominees whose contributions fall outside the five major entertainment categories, but the selection committee has been known to conjure some interesting rule interpretations to justify a selection. The Walk's four round Moon landing monuments at the corners of Hollywood and Vine, for example, officially recognize the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts for "contributions to the television industry". Johnny Grant acknowledged, in 2005, that classifying the first Moon landing as a television entertainment event was "a bit of a stretch". [[Magic Johnson]]'s considerable [[basketball]] skills had no direct connection to movies, music, TV, radio, or theater, but the committee added him to the motion picture category, based on his ownership of the [[Magic Johnson Theatres|Magic Johnson Theatre]] chain, citing as precedent [[Sid Grauman]], builder of Grauman's (now [[TCL Chinese Theatre|TCL]]) Chinese Theatre.  "[Now] people want [[Orville Redenbacher]]," Grant quipped in the 2005 interview, "because his popcorn is in all the theaters."<ref name="Q&A"/>

[[Muhammad Ali]]'s star was granted after the committee decided that [[boxing]] could be considered a form of "live performance".

===Fictional characters and their creators===
{{main|List of fictional characters with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame}}
[[File:Mickey Mouse star in Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|left|altalt=closeup of Mickey Mouse star, showing title and Motion Picture emblem|Mickey Mouse's star was the first awarded to an animated character]]
In 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, [[Mickey Mouse]] became the first animated character to receive a star. Other animated recipients are [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Woody Woodpecker]], [[Snow White (Disney)|Snow White]], [[Tinker Bell]], [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], [[The Simpsons]], the [[Rugrats]], and [[Snoopy]]. The star inscribed [[Charlie Tuna]] honors not the animated advertising mascot, but Art Ferguson, the long-time radio personality and game show announcer.

Other fictional characters on the Walk include the Munchkins (as mentioned), two individual [[The Muppets|Muppets]] ([[Kermit the Frog]] and [[Big Bird]]) and the Muppets as a group, one monster ([[Godzilla]]), and three non-animated canine characters ([[Strongheart]], [[Lassie]], and [[Rin Tin Tin]]).

Ten stars recognize cartoonists and animators: Walt Disney, [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]], Walter Lantz, [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Charles M. Schulz]], [[Jay Ward]], [[Dr. Seuss]], [[Matt Groening]] and [[John Lasseter]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bacalzo|first=Dan|title=Richard Burton, Hal David, Patricia Heaton, Scarlett Johansson, et al. to Be 2012 Walk of Fame Honorees|url=http://www.theatermania.com/los-angeles/news/06-2011/richard-burton-hal-david-patricia-heaton-scarlett_38362.html|publisher=Theater Mania|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref> Two puppeteers have stars: [[Jim Henson]] and [[Shari Lewis]], as does [[Fran Allison]], who appeared with [[Burr Tillstrom]]'s puppets on the TV show [[Kukla, Fran, and Ollie]].

==Star locations==
Locations of individual stars are not necessarily random or arbitrary. Stars of most legendary and world-famous celebrities—the so-called "show business royalty"—are found in front of TCL (formerly Grauman's) Chinese Theatre. [[Oscars|Oscar]] winners' stars are usually placed near the Dolby Theatre, site of the annual [[Academy Awards]] presentations. Decisions are occasionally made with a dollop of whimsy: [[Mike Myers]]'s star, for example, lies in front of an adult store called the International Love Boutique, an association with his [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] roles; [[Roger Moore]]'s star is located at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard in recognition of his seven [[James Bond]] films; [[Ed O'Neill]]'s star is located outside a shoe store in reference to his character's occupation on the TV show ''[[Married...with Children]]'';<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ed-oneills-walk-of-fame-star-in-front-of-shoe-store/ <!-- was http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20099294-10391698.html--> |title=Ed O'Neill's Walk of Fame star in front of shoe store - Celebrity Circuit |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> and the last star, at the very end of the westernmost portion of the Walk, belongs to [[The Dead End Kids]].

Honorees may request a specific location for their star, although final decisions remain with the Chamber.<ref name = "Q&A"/> [[Carol Burnett]] explained her choice in her 1986 memoir: While working as an usherette at the historic Warner Brothers Theatre (now the [[Hollywood Pacific Theatre]]) during the 1951 run of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'', she took it upon herself to advise a couple arriving during the final few minutes of a showing to wait for the next showing, to avoid seeing (and spoiling) the ending. The theatre manager fired her on the spot for "insubordination" and humiliated her by stripping the epaulets from her uniform in the theatre lobby. Twenty-six years later, at her request, Burnett's star was placed at the corner of Hollywood and Wilcox—in front of the theatre.<ref name="Burnett">{{cite book|title=One More Time|last=Burnett|first=Carol|authorlink=Carol Burnett|year=1986|publisher=Random House|location=New York |isbn=0-394-55254-7|edition=first|pages=194–95}}</ref>

It was commissioned in 1993 by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency Art Program and created by the architect, production designer, and film director [[Catherine Hardwicke]] as a tribute to the multi-ethnic women of Hollywood.<ref name="Art"/> The gazebo is a stainless steel stylized [[Art Deco]] lattice structure. The roof is an arched square supporting a circular dome, which is topped by a central [[obelisk]] with descending [[Neon sign|neon]] block letters spelling "Hollywood" on each of its four sides.

The gazebo was dedicated on February 1, 1994, to a mixed reception. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art critic Christopher Knight called it "the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent years", representing the opposite of Hardwicke's intended tribute to women.

Four of the stars, which weigh about 300 pounds (136&nbsp;kg) each, have been stolen from the Walk of Fame. In 2000  [[James Stewart]]'s and [[Kirk Douglas]]'s stars disappeared from their locations near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, where they had been temporarily removed for a construction project. Police recovered them in the suburban community of [[South Gate, California|South Gate]] when they arrested a man involved in an incident there and searched his house. The suspect was a construction worker employed on the Hollywood and Vine project. The stars had been badly damaged, and had to be remade. One of [[Gene Autry]]'s five stars (it is not clear which one) was also stolen from a construction area. Johnny Grant later received an anonymous phone tip that the missing star was in Iowa, but it was never found. "Someday, it will end up on eBay," Grant once joked. The most brazen and ambitious theft occurred in 2005 when thieves used a concrete saw to remove  [[Gregory Peck]]'s star from its Hollywood Boulevard site at the intersection of North El Centro Avenue, near North Gower. The star was replaced almost immediately, but the original was never recovered and the perpetrators never caught.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=November 30, 2005|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/30/local/me-star30|title=A Star is Torn from Boulevard|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

==Nomination process==

Each year an average of 200 nominations are submitted to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Walk of Fame Selection Committee. Anyone, including fans, can nominate anyone active in the field of entertainment as long as the nominee or his or her management approves the nomination (a letter of agreement from the nominated celebrity or representative must accompany the application). Nominees must have a minimum of five years' experience in the category for which they are nominated and a history of "charitable contributions".<ref name="Jet111"/> Posthumous nominees must have been deceased at least five years. At a meeting each June, the committee selects approximately 20 celebrities to receive stars on the Walk of Fame during the following year. One posthumous award is given each year as well. The nominations of those not selected are rolled over to the following year for reconsideration; those not selected two years in a row are dropped, and must be renominated to receive further consideration. Living recipients must agree to personally attend a presentation ceremony within five years of selection. A relative of deceased recipients must attend posthumous presentations. Presentation ceremonies are open to the public.<ref name="WOFFAQ"/>

A fee ($30,000 as of 2012),<ref name="WOFFAQ"/> payable at time of selection, is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star, as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame. The fee is usually paid by the nominating organization, which may be a fan club, or a film studio, record company, broadcaster, or other sponsor involved with the prospective honoree.<ref name="ap2006"/><ref>Donaldson-Evans, Catherine (December 3, 2003).

Numerous major entertainment figures and legendary show business acts are not included on the Walk of Fame for a variety of reasons. Some, such as [[Julia Roberts]]<ref name = "Q&A"/><ref name="UPITen">{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/Entertainment/Ten-celebrities-who-deserve-the-Walk-of-Fame-more-than-Tinker-Bell/3855/1 |title=Ten celebrities who deserve the Walk of Fame more than Tinker Bell |publisher=Upi.com |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> and [[Clint Eastwood]],<ref name="UPITen"/> have declined to participate; nominations cannot proceed without the nominee's consent. Others, such as [[George Clooney]] and [[John Denver]],<ref>[http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/ask-stargirl "Dear Stargirl: Hollywood's Stargirl has the answers"] Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. Retrieved May 31, 2010.</ref> were nominated but would not agree to the mandatory personal appearance at the unveiling ceremony. Others have simply never been nominated, or do not have a nominator willing or able to pay the selection fee, or have less than the required five years' minimum involvement in their designated field. Others are merely victims of selection constraints and probability; only about 10% of nominees are selected each year.

Traditionally, the identities of selection committee members, other than its chairman, have not been made public in order to minimize conflicts of interest and to discourage lobbying by celebrities and their representatives (a significant problem during the original selections in the late 1950s). However, in 1999, in response to intensifying charges of secrecy in the selection process, the Chamber disclosed the members' names: Johnny Grant, the longtime chair and representative of the television category; [[Earl Lestz]], president of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studio Group]] (motion pictures); Stan Spero, retired manager with broadcast stations [[KMPC]] and [[KABC (AM)|KABC]] (radio); Kate Nelson, owner of the [[Avalon Hollywood|Palace Theatre]] (live performance); and Mary Lou Dudas, vice president of [[A&M Records]] (recording industry).<ref>{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=January 6, 1999|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/06/local/me-60983|title=Hollywood Tries to Help Stars Shine|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Since that 1999 announcement the Chamber has revealed only that Lestz (who received his own star in 2004) became chairman after Grant died in 2008. Their current official position is that "each of the five categories is represented by someone with expertise in that field".<ref name="WOFFAQ"/>

In 2010, Lestz was replaced as chairman by John Pavlik, former Director of Communications for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref>[http://photos.presslist.oscars.org/listanevent.php?events=781 "Academy Appoints Unger Communications Chief"].
