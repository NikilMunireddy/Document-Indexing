The '''Democratic Party''' is one of the [[Two-party system|two]] [[Major party|major]] contemporary [[political parties in the United States]], along with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Tracing its heritage back to [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s and [[James Madison]]'s [[Democratic-Republican Party]], the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828, making it the world's oldest active party.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Janda |author2=Jeffrey M.

The Democrats' once dominant worldview was [[classical liberalism]], while, especially in the rural South, [[populism]] was a leading character. In the 1890s, under the influence of its three-time defeated presidential candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]], the party moved to the left from an economic point of view and, since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal coalition]] in the 1930s, it has promoted a [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] platform,<ref name="sarnold">{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=N.

Well into the 20th century, the party had [[Conservative Democrat|conservative]] pro-business and southern conservative-populist anti-business wings. The [[New Deal Coalition]] of 1932–1964  attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction—many of whom were [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholics]] based in the cities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Prendergast |first=William B. |date=1999 |title=The Catholic Voter in American Politics.

There have been 15 Democratic presidents: the first was [[Andrew Jackson]], who served from 1829 to 1837. The most recent is the current one, [[Barack Obama]], who has been in office since 2009.

In the [[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]], following the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 elections]], Democrats hold a minority of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] as well as in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The party also holds 18 [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] and control of a minority of [[List of United States state legislatures|state legislatures]].

{{See also|Democratic Party (United States)#Recent electoral history}}
[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Jackson]] was the first Democratic [[President of the United States]]]]
The Democratic Party traces its origins to the inspiration of the Democratic-Republican Party, founded by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other influential opponents of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] in 1792. That party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans. Organizationally, the modern Democratic Party truly arose in the 1830s, with the election of [[Andrew Jackson]]. Since the nomination of [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896, the party has generally positioned itself to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the Republican Party on economic issues. They have been more liberal on civil rights issues since 1948. On foreign policy both parties changed position several times.<ref>Arthur Paulson, ''Realignment and Party Revival: Understanding American Electoral Politics at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century'' (2000) pp 46-72.</ref>

===1828–60===
The Democratic Party evolved from the Jeffersonian Republican or [[Democratic-Republican Party]] organized by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in opposition to the [[Federalist party]] of Alexander Hamilton and John Adams. The party favored [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], a weak federal government, [[states' rights]], agrarian interests (especially Southern planters) and strict adherence to the [[Constitution]]; it opposed a national bank, close ties to Great Britain, and business and banking interests. That party, the Democratic-Republican Party, came to power in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]].

After the [[War of 1812]] the Federalists virtually disappeared and the only national political party left was the Democratic-Republicans. The era of one-party rule in the United States, known as the [[Era of Good Feelings]], lasted from 1816 until the early 1830s, when the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] became a national political group to rival the Democratic-Republicans. The Democratic-Republican party still had its own internal factions, however. They split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the modern Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828:
:Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party ... and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics."<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287</ref>

Opposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery. In 1854, angry with the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], anti-slavery Democrats left the party and joined Northern Whigs to form the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>Galbraith Schlisinger, ''Of the People: The 200 Year History of the Democratic Party'' (1992) ch 1–3</ref><ref>Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1–4</ref>

Behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:
:The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 "corrupt bargain" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. ... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual—the artisan and the ordinary farmer—by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp 287–88</ref>

===1860{{endash}}1900===
The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Buchanan]] along Northern and Southern lines; factions of the party provided two separate candidacies for President in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|election of 1860]], in which the Republican Party gained ascendancy. [[United States presidential election, 1860#Constitutional (Southern) Democratic|Southern Democrats]], after some delegates followed the lead of the [[Fire-Eaters]] by walking out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]] at [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]'s Institute Hall in April 1860, and were subsequently joined by those who, once again led by the Fire-Eaters, left the [[1860 Democratic National Convention#Baltimore convention|Baltimore Convention]] the following June when the convention would not adopt a resolution supporting extending slavery into territories whose voters did not want it, nominated the pro-slavery incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-President]], [[John C. Breckinridge]] of [[Kentucky]], for President and General [[Joseph Lane]], former [[Governor of Oregon]], for Vice President. The [[United States presidential election, 1860#National (Northern) Democratic|Northern Democrats]] proceeded to nominate [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of [[Illinois]] for President and former Governor of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Herschel Vespasian Johnson|Herschel V. Johnson]] for Vice-President, while some southern Democrats joined the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], backing its nominees (who had both been prominent Whig leaders), former Senator, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of [[Tennessee]] for President and the politician, statesman, and educator [[Edward Everett]] of [[Massachusetts]] for Vice-President. This fracturing of the Democrats led to a Republican victory, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected the 16th President of the United States.

As the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Northern Democrats were divided into [[War Democrats]] and [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace Democrats]]. The [[Confederate States of America]], whose political leadership, mindful of the [[:wikt:welter|welter]] prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance; consequently the Confederacy had none, or at least none with the wide organization inherent to other American parties. Most War Democrats rallied to Republican President Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans' [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|election of 1864]], which featured [[Andrew Johnson]] on the Republican ticket even though he was a Democrat from the South. Johnson replaced Lincoln in 1865, but stayed independent of both parties. The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. After [[Redeemers]] ended Reconstruction in the 1870s, and following the often extremely violent [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of African Americans led by such [[White supremacy#Academic use of the term|white supremacist]] Democratic politicians as [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] in the 1880s and 1890s, the South, voting Democratic, became known as the "[[Solid South]]." Though Republicans won all but two presidential elections, the Democrats remained competitive. The party was dominated by pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s led by [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and [[Grover Cleveland]], who represented mercantile, banking, and railroad interests; opposed [[imperialism]] and overseas expansion; fought for the [[gold standard]]; opposed [[bimetallism]]; and crusaded against corruption, high taxes, and tariffs. Cleveland was elected to non-consecutive presidential terms in 1884 and 1892.<ref>Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch 5–6</ref>

===1900{{endash}}60===
[[File:Breckinridgelong2.jpg|thumb|450px|'''The three leaders of the Democratic party during the first half of the 20th century:''' President '''[[Woodrow Wilson]]''' (nominated in 1912 and '16) Sec. of State '''[[William J. Bryan]]''' (nominated in 1896, 1900 and 1908), [[Josephus Daniels]], [[Breckinridge Long]], [[William Phillips (diplomat)|William Phillips]], and '''[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]''' (nominated for VP in 1920 and for president in 1932, '36, '40 and '44).  Photo taken June 14, 1913]]
Agrarian Democrats demanding [[Free Silver]] overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] for the presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908). Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he lost to the Republican [[William McKinley]]. The Democrats took control of the House in 1910 and elected [[Woodrow Wilson]] as president in 1912 and 1916. Wilson effectively led Congress to put to rest the issues of tariffs, money, and antitrust, which had dominated politics for 40 years, with new progressive laws. The [[Great Depression]] in 1929 that occurred under Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government; the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1930 until 1994 and won most presidential elections until 1968. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], elected to the presidency in 1932, came forth with government programs called the [[New Deal]]. New Deal liberalism meant the regulation of business (especially finance and banking) and the promotion of labor unions, as well as federal spending to aid to the unemployed, help distressed farmers, and undertake large-scale public works projects. It marked the start of the American welfare state.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ellen Russell|title=New Deal Banking Reforms and Keynesian Welfare State Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzOUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|pages=3–4}}</ref> The opponents, who stressed opposition to unions, support for business, and low taxes, started calling themselves "conservatives."<ref>Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch 7</ref>

Until the 1980s, the Democratic Party was a coalition of two parties divided by the Mason–Dixon line: liberal Democrats in the North and culturally conservative voters in the South, who though benefitting from many of the New Deal public works projects, opposed increasing [[Civil Rights]] initiatives advocated by Northeastern liberals.  The polarization grew stronger after Roosevelt died. Southern Democrats formed a key part of the bipartisan [[conservative coalition]] in an alliance with most of the Midwestern Republicans. The economically activist philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]], shaped much of the party's economic agenda after 1932. From the 1930s to the mid-1960s, the liberal [[New Deal coalition]] usually controlled the Presidency while the conservative coalition usually controlled Congress.<ref>Paul Finkelman and Peter Wallenstein, eds. ''The Encyclopedia Of American Political History'' (CQ Press, 2001) pp. 124–126</ref>

Issues facing parties and the United States after [[World War II]] included the [[Cold War]] and the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. Republicans attracted conservatives and white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their use of the [[Southern strategy]] and resistance to New Deal and [[Great Society]] liberalism. African Americans had traditionally supported the Republican Party because of the anti-slavery policies of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the civil rights policies of his successors, such as [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. But they began supporting Democrats following the ascent of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, the New Deal, the integration of the military and embrace of proposed civil rights legislation by President Harry Truman in 1947–48, and the postwar Civil Rights movement. The Democratic Party's main base of support shifted to the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], marking a dramatic reversal of history.

===1960{{endash}}80===
[[File:John F. Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John F. Kennedy]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th]] President of the United States (1961–1963)]]
The election of President [[John F. Kennedy]] from Massachusetts in 1960 was a partial reflection of this shift.  In the campaign, Kennedy attracted a new generation of younger voters.  In his agenda dubbed the [[New Frontier]], Kennedy introduced a host of social programs and public works projects, along with enhanced support of the [[NASA|space program]], proposing a manned spacecraft [[Apollo 11|trip to the moon]] by the end of the decade.  He pushed for civil rights initiatives and proposed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], but with his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] in November 1963, was not able to see its passage.  Kennedy's successor [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was able to persuade the largely conservative congress to pass civil rights bill in 1964 and with a more progressive congress in 1965 passed much of the [[Great Society]], which consisted of an array of social programs designed to help the poor.  Kennedy and Johnson's advocacy of civil rights further solidified black support for the Democrats, but had the effect of alienating southern whites, who would eventually gravitate towards the Republican party, particularly after the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] to the presidency in 1980.  The United States' involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s was another divisive issue that further fractured the fault lines of the Democrats' coalition.  After [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] in 1964, President Johnson committed a large contingency of combat troops to Vietnam, but the escalation failed to drive the [[Viet Cong]] from south Vietnam, resulting in an increasing [[Quagmire theory|quagmire]], which by 1968 had become the subject of widespread anti-war protests in the United States and elsewhere.  With increasing casualties and nightly news reports bringing home troubling images from Vietnam, the costly military engagement became increasingly unpopular, alienating many of the kinds of young voters that the Democrats had attracted the early 1960s.  The protests that year along with assassinations of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (younger brother of John F. Kennedy) climaxed in turbulence at the hotly-contested [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] that summer in Chicago (which, amongst the ensuing turmoil inside and outside of the convention hall, nominated Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]]), in a series of events that proved to mark a significant turning point in the decline of the Democratic party's broad coalition.

Republican presidential nominee [[Richard Nixon]] was able to capitalize on the Democrat's confusion that year and won the 1968 election to become the 37th president, and would win again in 1972 against Democratic nominee [[George McGovern]], who like Robert Kennedy reached out to the younger anti-war and counterculture voters, but unlike Kennedy, was not able to appeal to the party's more traditional white working class constituencies.  During Nixon's second term, his presidency was rocked by the [[Watergate]] scandal, which forced him to resign in 1974, being succeeded by vice president [[Gerald Ford]], who served a brief tenure.  Watergate offered the Democrats an opportunity to recoup, and their nominee [[Jimmy Carter]] won the 1976 presidential election.  With the initial support of  [[evangelical]] Christian voters in the South, Carter was temporarily able to re-unite the disparate factions within the party, but [[inflation]] and the [[Iran Hostage Crisis]] of 1979-1980 took their toll, resulting in a landside victory for Republican presidential nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980, which shifted the tectonic plates of the political landscape in favor of the Republicans for years to come.

===1980{{endash}}present===
[[File:Bill Clinton.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bill Clinton]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|42nd]] President of the United States (1993–2001)]]
With the ascendancy of the Republicans under Ronald Reagan, the Democrats searched for ways to respond, but were unable to succeed by running traditional candidates, such as former Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee [[Walter Mondale]] who lost to Reagan in the 1984 presidential election.  Many Democrats attached their hopes to the future star of [[Gary Hart]], who had challenged Mondale in the 1984 primaries running on a theme of "New Ideas", and in the subsequent 1988 primaries, he became the de facto front-runner and virtual "shoe-in" for the Democratic presidential nomination, before his campaign was ended by a sex scandal.  The party nevertheless began to seek out a younger generation of leaders, who like Hart had been inspired by the pragmatic idealism of John F. Kennedy and were sometimes dubbed "[[neo-liberals]]".  Arkansas governor, [[Bill Clinton]] was one such figure and in 1992 after the Democratic nomination was elected president, labeling himself and governing as a "[[New Democrats|New Democrat]]".  The party adopted a [[Centrism|centrist]] economic but [[Social progressivism|socially progressive]] agenda, with the voter base after Reagan having shifted considerably to the [[Right (politics)|right]]. In an effort to appeal to appeal to both liberals and fiscal conservatives, Democrats began to advocate for a [[balanced budget]] and [[market economy]] tempered by [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] ([[mixed economy]]), along with a continued emphasis [[social justice]] and [[affirmative action]].  The economic policy adopted by the Democratic Party, including the former [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], has been referred to as "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]". The Democratic Party lost control of Congress in the [[Republican Revolution|election of 1994]] to the Republican Party. Re-elected in 1996, Clinton was the first Democratic President since Franklin Roosevelt to be elected to two terms. Following twelve years of Republican rule, the Democratic Party regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]].

In the wake of the 2001 [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] and with growing concern over [[global warming]], some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century have included the methods of how to combat [[terrorism]], [[homeland security]], expanding access to [[health care]], [[labor rights]], environmentalism, and the preservation of liberal government programs.<ref>Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch 8</ref>  [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic party's nomination and was elected as the first [[African American]] president in 2008.  The Democrats gained control of congress in the wake of the [[Great Recession in the United States|2007 economic recession]]. The Democratic Party under the Obama presidency moved forward reforms including an [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2009|Economic Stimulus]] package, the [[Dodd-Frank Act|Dodd-Frank]] financial reform act, and the [[Affordable Care Act]]. In the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 elections]], the Democratic Party lost control of the House and lost its majority in state legislatures and state governorships. The [[2012 elections]] re-elected President Obama, but the party kept its minority in the House of Representatives. Later, in 2014, the party lost control of the Senate for the first time since 2006.

Initially calling itself the "Republican Party," Jeffersonians were labeled "Democratic" by the opposition [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]], with the hope of stigmatizing them as purveyors of democracy or mob rule.<ref>{{cite book

and became the official name in 1844.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/157244/Democratic-Party/308570/Slavery-and-the-emergence-of-the-bipartisan-system|title=Democratic Party|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}</ref> Members of the party are called "Democrats" or "Dems".

The term [[Democrat Party (epithet)|"Democrat Party"]] has also been in local use but has usually been used by opponents since 1952 as an epithet.

The most common mascot symbol for the party has been the [[donkey]], or [[Donkey|jackass]].<ref>see [https://web.archive.org/web/20090307093800/https://www.democrats.org/a/2005/06/history_of_the.php "History of the Democratic Donkey"]</ref> Andrew Jackson's enemies twisted his name to "jackass" as a term of ridicule regarding a stupid and stubborn animal. However, the Democrats liked the common-man implications and picked it up too, so the image persisted and evolved.<ref>{{cite book|author=John William Ward|title=Andrew Jackson: Symbol for an Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQQ_uxoWdpYC&pg=PA87|year=1962|publisher=Oxford Up|pages=87–88}}</ref> Its most lasting impression came from the cartoons of [[Thomas Nast]] from 1870 in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Weekly]]''. Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats, and the elephant to represent the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

In the early 20th century, the traditional symbol of the Democratic Party in Midwestern states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Ohio was the rooster, as opposed to the Republican eagle. This symbol still appears on Oklahoma, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbour County, West Virginia General Election Ballot |date=November 4, 2008 |url=http://www.wvsos.com/elections/ballots/barbourgen.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081024032144/https://www.wvsos.com/elections/ballots/barbourgen.pdf |archivedate=October 24, 2008 }}</ref> [[ballot]]s. In [[New York (state)|New York]], the Democratic ballot symbol is a five-pointed star.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ballots for Upcoming Elections|publisher=[[Schenectady County, New York]]|url=http://www.schenectadycounty.com/FullStory.aspx?m=320&amid=930}}</ref> For the majority of the 20th century, Missouri Democrats used the [[Statue of Liberty]] as their ballot emblem. This meant that, when [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidates received [[ballot access]] in Missouri in 1976, they could not use the Statue of Liberty, their national symbol, as the ballot emblem. Missouri Libertarians instead used the [[Liberty Bell]] until 1995, when the mule became Missouri's state animal. From 1995 to 2004, there was some confusion among voters, as the Democratic ticket was marked with the Statue of Liberty (used by Libertarians in other states) and the Libertarians' mule was easily mistaken for a Democratic donkey.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Although both major political parties (and many minor ones) use the traditional American colors of red, white, and blue in their marketing and representations, since election night [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], blue has become the identifying color for the Democratic Party, while red has become the identifying color for the Republican Party. That night, for the first time, all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: [[Red states and blue states|blue states]] for [[Al Gore]] (Democratic nominee) and red states for [[George W. Bush]] (Republican nominee). Since then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party. This is contrary to common practice outside of the United States where blue is the traditional color of the [[right-wing politics|right]] and red the color of the [[left-wing politics|left]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} For example, in Canada, red represents the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], while blue represents the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]]. In the United Kingdom, red denotes the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and blue symbolizes the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Blue has also been used both by party supporters for promotional efforts—[[ActBlue]], BuyBlue, BlueFund, as examples—and by the party itself in 2006 both for its "Red to Blue Program", created to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in the [[United States general elections, 2006|midterm elections]] that year, and on its official website.

In September 2010, the Democratic Party unveiled its new logo, which featured a blue D inside a blue circle. It was the party's first official logo, as the donkey logo had only been semi-official.

The song "[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]" is the unofficial song of the Democratic Party. It was used prominently when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was nominated for president at the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]] and remains a sentimental favorite for Democrats today. For example, [[Paul Shaffer]] played the theme on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]] after the Democrats won Congress in 2006. "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]" by [[Fleetwood Mac]] was adopted by [[Bill Clinton]]'s presidential campaign in 1992, and has endured as a popular Democratic song. Also, the emotionally similar song "[[Beautiful Day]]" by the band [[U2]] has become a favorite theme song for Democratic candidates. [[John Kerry]] used the song during his 2004 presidential campaign, and several Democratic Congressional candidates used it as a celebratory tune in 2006.<ref>{{cite news

As a traditional anthem for its Presidential nominating convention, [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' is traditionally performed at the beginning of the Democratic National Convention.

==Current structure and composition==

===National committee===
The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities. While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than [[public policy]]. In presidential elections, it supervises the [[Democratic National Convention]]. The national convention is, subject to the charter of the party, the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times. The DNC is chaired by [[Florida]] congresswoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]].<ref name="Wasserman">{{cite news | url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/04/debbie-wasserman-schultz-democratic-national-committee-chair-/1 | title=Obama taps Wasserman Schultz to lead DNC | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Camia, Catalina | date=April 5, 2011 | work=USA Today}}</ref>

===State parties===
{{main|List of state parties of the Democratic Party (United States)}}
Each state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex-officio committee members (usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn elects a chair. County, town, city, and ward committees generally are composed of individuals elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law. Rarely do they have much funding, but in 2005, DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the "50 State Strategy") of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and pay for full-time professional staffers.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gilgoff | first = Dan | title = Dean's List | date = July 16, 2006 | url = http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060716/24dems.htm | publisher = [[U.S. News & World Report]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/690hYQLWt|archivedate=July 8, 2012 | accessdate = April 26, 2007}}</ref>

===Major party groups===
The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races; its current chairman (selected by the party caucus) is Rep. [[Steve Israel]] of New York. Similarly, the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] (DSCC), headed by Senator [[Patty Murray]] of Washington, raises large sums for Senate races. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), chaired by Mike Gronstal of Iowa, is a smaller organization with much less funding that focuses on state legislative races. The DNC sponsors the [[College Democrats of America]] (CDA), a student-outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging a new generation of Democratic activists. [[Democrats Abroad]] is the organization for Americans living outside the United States; they work to advance the goals of the party and encourage Americans living abroad to support the Democrats. The [[Young Democrats of America]] (YDA) is a youth-led organization that attempts to draw in and mobilize young people for Democratic candidates, but operates outside of the DNC. In addition, the recently created branch of the Young Democrats, the Young Democrats High School Caucus, attempts to raise awareness and [[activism]] amongst teenagers to not only vote and volunteer, but participate in the future as well. The [[Democratic Governors Association]] (DGA), chaired by Governor [[Peter Shumlin]] of [[Vermont]], is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents. Likewise, the mayors of the largest cities and urban centers convene as the [[National Conference of Democratic Mayors]].

==Ideology==
{{Further|Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
Upon foundation, the Democratic Party supported [[agrarianism]] and the [[Jacksonian democracy]] movement of President [[Andrew Jackson]], representing farmers and rural interests, and traditional [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian democrats]].<ref>John Ashworth, ''"Agrarians" & "aristocrats": Party political ideology in the United States, 1837–1846''(1983)</ref> Since the 1890s, the party has favored [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions (the term "liberal" in this sense describes [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]], rather than [[classical liberalism]] or [[economic liberalism]]). In recent [[exit poll]]s, the Democratic Party has had broad appeal across all socio-ethno-economic demographics.<ref name="CNN. (2000). Exit Poll.">{{cite news

Historically, the party has represented farmers, laborers, labor unions, and religious and ethnic minorities; it has opposed unregulated business and finance, and favored progressive income taxes. In foreign policy, [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] (including [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]]) was a dominant theme from 1913 to the mid-1960s. In the 1930s, the party began advocating [[Social programs in the United States|welfare]] spending programs targeted at the poor. The party had a fiscally conservative, pro-business wing, typified by [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Al Smith]], and a [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] conservative wing that shrank after President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] supported the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The major influences for liberalism were labor unions (which peaked in the 1936–1952 era), and the [[African American]] wing, which has steadily grown since the 1960s. Since the 1970s, [[environmentalism]] has been a major new component.

The Democratic Party, once dominant in the [[Southeastern United States]], is now strongest in the Northeast ([[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]]), [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]], and the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] (including [[Hawaii]]). The Democrats are also very strong in [[List of United States cities by population|major cities]] (regardless of region).

Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue, "the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s."<ref>{{cite book|author1=Theodore Caplow|author2=Howard M.

A large majority of liberals favor [[universal health care]], with many supporting a [[single-payer health care|single-payer system]]. A majority also favor [[diplomacy]] over [[war|military action]], [[stem cell|stem cell research]], the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]], stricter [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]], and environmental protection laws as well as the preservation of [[pro-choice|abortion rights]]. Immigration and [[cultural diversity]] is deemed positive; liberals favor [[cultural pluralism]], a system in which immigrants retain their native culture in addition to adopting their new culture. They tend to be divided on [[free trade]] agreements and organizations such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).

The [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] (CPC) is a caucus of progressive Democrats, and is the single largest Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives. Its current chairs are [[Keith Ellison]] of Minnesota and [[Raúl Grijalva]] of Arizona. Its members have included Representatives [[Dennis Kucinich]] of Ohio, [[John Conyers]] of Michigan, [[Jim McDermott]] of Washington, [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia, [[Barbara Lee]] of California, and the late Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] of Minnesota. Senators [[Sherrod Brown]] of Ohio, [[Tammy Baldwin]] of Wisconsin, [[Mazie Hirono]] of Hawaii, and [[Ed Markey]] of Massachusetts were all members of the caucus when in the House of Representatives. Today, no Democratic Senators belong to the Progressive Caucus; however, Independent Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] is a member.

Centrist Democrats, or [[New Democrats]], are an ideologically [[Centrism|centrist]] faction within the Democratic Party that emerged after the victory of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George H. W. Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]]. They are an economically [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] and "[[Third Way]]" faction which dominated the party for around 20 years starting in the late 1980s after the US populace turned much further to the [[political right]]. They are represented by organizations such as the [[New Democrat Network]] and the [[New Democrat Coalition]].
 
The [[New Democrat Coalition]] is a pro-business, pro-growth, and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservativ]]e congressional coalition.<ref>http://newdemocratcoalition-kind.house.gov/about-me</ref> Compared to other Democratic factions, they are mostly more supportive of the use of military force, including the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], are more supportive of [[free trade]], and are more willing to reduce government welfare, as indicated by their support for [[welfare reform]] and [[tax cut]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} One of the most influential factions was the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), a nonprofit organization that advocated [[centrism|centrist]] positions for the party. The DLC hailed President [[Bill Clinton]] as proof of the viability of "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]" politicians and a DLC success story, the DLC disbanded in 2011. Much of the former DLC is now represented in the think tank [[Third Way (think tank)|Third Way]].<ref>[http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_dlc_does_it "How the DLC Does It"], Robert Dreyfuss, ''American Prospect'', April 23, 2001</ref>

While not representing a majority of the Democratic Party electorate, a decent amount of Democratic elected officials have self declared as being centrists. Some of these Democrats are former President [[Bill Clinton]], former Vice President [[Al Gore]], Senator [[Mark Warner]], former Pennsylvania governor [[Ed Rendell]], former senator [[Jim Webb]], Vice President [[Joe Biden]], and congresswoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]].<ref>http://newdemocratcoalition-kind.house.gov/membership</ref><ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2152360?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Making of the New Democrats ]</ref>

The [[Democratic Leadership Council]] was a group that supported centrist Democrats and called for the Democratic Party to be the party of centrism.<ref>http://ndn.org/</ref> The [[New Democrat Network]] supports socially moderate, fiscally conservative Democratic politicians and operates the congressional [[New Democrat Coalition]] in the House and Senate. Senator [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] was a member of the coalition when in congress and Senator [[Barack Obama]] self-described as a New Democrat.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Conservatives===
{{See also|Conservative Democrats|Blue Dog Coalition}}
A [[Conservative Democrat]] is a member of the Democratic Party with [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political views, or with views relatively conservative with respect to those of the national party. While such members of the Democratic Party can be found throughout the nation, actual elected officials are disproportionately found within the [[Southern United States|Southern states]], and to a lesser extent within [[Rural United States|rural]] regions of the [[United States]] generally, more commonly in the [[Western United States|West]].
Historically, [[Southern Democrats]] were generally much more ideologically [[conservative]] than conservative Democrats are now.

Many conservative Southern Democrats defected to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], beginning with the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the general leftward shift of the party. [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]], [[Billy Tauzin]] of [[Louisiana]], [[Kent Hance]] and [[Ralph Hall]] of [[Texas]], and [[Richard Shelby]] of [[Alabama]] are examples of this. The influx of conservative Democrats into the Republican Party is often cited as a reason for the GOP's shift further to the right during the late 20th century, as well as the shift of its base from the Northeast and Midwest to the South.

The Democratic Party had a conservative element, mostly from the South and Border regions, into the 1980s. Their numbers declined sharply as the Republican Party built up its Southern base. They were sometimes humorously called "[[Yellow dog Democrat]]s," or "[[Boll weevil (politics)|boll weevils]]," "[[Dixiecrats]]." In the [[United States House of Representatives|House]], they form the [[Blue Dog Democrats]], a caucus of [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]] and [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] and moderates, primarily southerners, willing to broker compromises with the Republican leadership. They have acted as a unified voting bloc in the past, giving its forty plus members some ability to change legislation.

There was a split vote among many conservative Southern Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s. Some supported local and statewide conservative Democrats while simultaneously voting for Republican presidential candidates.<ref>Roger Chapman, ''Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia'' (2010) vol 1 Page 136</ref>

===Economic issues===
[[Equal opportunity employment|Equal economic opportunity]], a base [[social safety net]] provided by the [[welfare state]], and strong [[Labor unions in the United States|labor unions]] have historically been at the heart of Democratic economic policy.<ref name="Larry E. Sullivan 2009 p 291"/> The welfare state supports a [[progressive tax]] system, higher [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wages]], [[Social Security (United States)|social security]], [[universal health care]], [[Education in the United States|public education]], and [[Public housing in the United States|public housing]].<ref name="Larry E. Sullivan 2009 p 291"/> They also support [[infrastructure]] development and government sponsored employment programs in an effort to achieve economic development and job creation, while stimulating private sector job creation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/issues/economy_and_job_creation|title=Jobs and the Economy|work=Democrats.org}}</ref> Additionally however, since the 1990s the party has at times supported [[Centrism|centrist]] economic reforms, which cut the size of government and reduced market regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/wall-street-deregulation-clinton-advisers-obama|title=Wall Street deregulation pushed by Clinton advisers, documents reveal|author=Dan Roberts|work=the Guardian}}</ref> The party has continuously rejected [[laissez-faire economics]] as well as [[market socialism]], instead favoring [[Keynesian economics]] within a capitalist market-based system.

====Fiscal policy====
Democrats support a more [[progressive tax]] structure to provide more services and reduce [[economic inequality]] by making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay the highest amount in taxes.<ref name=how-high>{{cite web |url=http://economics.about.com/od/monetaryandfiscalpolicy/a/high_taxes.htm |title=How High Should Taxes Be? |publisher=Economics.about.com |date=June 12, 2010 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Democrats support more [[government spending]] on social services while spending less on the military.<ref>{{cite web |author=Saturday, November 17, 2007 12:01 A.M.

Democrats believe the benefits of social services, in monetary and non-monetary terms, are a more [[Productive and unproductive labour|productive labor]] force and cultured population, and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services. Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential towards providing [[Positive liberty|positive freedom]], i.e. freedom derived from economic opportunity. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the [[PAYGO]] (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the start of the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].<ref>{{cite news

====Minimum wage====
{{see also|United States minimum wage}}
The Democratic Party favors raising the [[minimum wage]] and believes that all Americans have the right to a fair wage. They call for a $10.10/hour national minimum wage and think the minimum wage should be adjusted regularly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/minimum-wage-vote-senate-106103.html|title=Harry Reid slates minimum wage vote|author=Burgess Everett|work=POLITICO}}</ref> The [[Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007]] was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].

====Health care====
[[File:Obama signing health care-20100323.jpg|thumb|President Barack Obama signing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] into law at the White House on March 23, 2010.]]

Democrats call for "affordable and quality health care," and many advocate an expansion of government intervention in this area. Democrats favor [[national health insurance]] or [[universal health care]] in a variety of forms to address the rising costs of modern [[health insurance]]. Some Democrats, such as Representatives [[John Conyers]] and [[John Dingell]], have called for a [[single-payer health care|single-payer program]] of [[Medicare for All]]. The [[Progressive Democrats of America]], a group operating inside the Democratic Party, has made [[Single-payer health care|single-payer universal health care]] one of their primary policy goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdamerica.org/policy/priorities.php |title=Progressive Democrats of America - Priorities (Health Care for All) |publisher=Pdamerica.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100613021509/http://pdamerica.org/policy/priorities.php |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}</ref> The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, has been one of the most significant pushes for universal health care to become a reality. As of April 2014, more than 10 million Americans have enrolled in healthcare coverage since the launch of the Affordable Care Act.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Newsweek]]|title=Medicaid Enrollments Bring Obamacare Enrollment to More Than 10 Million|date=April 4, 2014|publisher=Reuters|url=http://www.newsweek.com/medicaid-enrollments-bring-obamacare-enrollment-more-10-million-244346}}</ref>

====Education====
Democrats favor improving [[public education]] by raising school standards and reforming the [[head start program]]. They also support [[universal preschool]] and expanding access to primary education, including through [[charter schools]]. They call for slashes in [[student loan]] debt and support reforms to force down tuition fees.<ref>http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/papers_pdf/101962.pdf</ref> Other proposed reforms have included nationwide [[universal preschool]] education, tuition-free college, and reform of [[standardized testing]]. Democrats have the long-term aim of having low-cost, publicly funded college education with low tuition fees (like in much of Europe and Canada), which should be available to every eligible American student. Alternatively, they encourage expanding access to post-secondary education by increasing state funding for student financial aid such as [[Pell Grants]] and [[college tuition]] [[tax deductions]].<ref>{{cite web

====Environment====
{{Main|Environmental policy of the United States}}
Democrats believe that the government should protect the environment and have a history of [[environmentalism]]. In more recent years, this stance has had as its emphasis alternative energy generation as the basis for an improved economy, greater [[national security]], and general environmental benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/a/national/clean_environment/ |title=Agenda&nbsp;— Environment |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070315113030/http://www.democrats.org:80/a/national/clean_environment/ |archivedate=March 15, 2007 }}</ref>

The Democratic Party also favors expansion of conservation lands and encourages open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport congestion and improve air quality and economy; it "believe[s] that communities, environmental interests, and government should work together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local economies. Once Americans were led to believe they had to make a choice between the economy and the environment. They now know this is a false choice."<ref>{{cite web

|title=Democratic Party on Environment
|accessdate=October 24, 2007}}</ref>

The most important environmental concern of the Democratic Party is [[climate change]]. Democrats, most notably former Vice President [[Al Gore]], have pressed for stern regulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es. On October 15, 2007, he won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts to build greater knowledge about man-made [[climate change]], and laying the foundations for the measures needed to counteract these changes asserting that "the climate crisis is not a political issue, it is a moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity."<ref>{{cite journal

====Renewable energy and fossil fuels====
Democrats have supported increased domestic [[renewable energy]] development, including wind and solar power farms, in an effort to reduce carbon pollution. The party's platform calls for an "all of the above" energy policy including clean energy, natural gas and domestic oil, with the desire of becoming energy independent.<ref name="democrats.org"/> The party has supported higher taxes on [[oil companies]] and increased regulations on [[coal power plant]]s, favoring a policy of reducing long-term reliance on [[fossil fuels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/issues/energy_independence|title=Energy Independence|work=Democrats.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/02/coal-state-democrats-to-obama-curb-emissions-um-no-thanks/|title=Coal state Democrats to Obama: Curb emissions? Um, no thanks.|work=Washington Post | first=Sean|last=Sullivan|date=June 2, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, the party supports stricter [[fuel emissions standard]]s to prevent air pollution.

====Trade agreements====
Many Democrats support [[fair trade]] policies when it comes to the issue of [[international trade]] agreements, and some in the party have started supporting [[free trade]] in recent decades.<ref name="Rorty">Rorty, R. (1997). ''Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought In Twentieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-00312-8</ref> In the 1990s, the Clinton administration and a number of prominent Democrats pushed through a number of agreements such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Since then, the party's shift away from free trade became evident in the [[Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) vote, with 15 House Democrats voting for the agreement and 187 voting against.<ref>{{cite news

===Social issues===
[[File:Shirley Chisholm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shirley Chisholm]] was the first major party African-American candidate to run nationwide primary campaigns.]]
The modern Democratic party emphasizes [[egalitarianism]] and [[social equality]] through liberalism. They support [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] and [[minority rights]], including [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], [[multiculturalism]], and [[Secularism|religious secularism]]. A longstanding social policy is upholding [[civil rights]], which affect ethnic and racial minorities and includes voting rights, [[equal opportunity]], and [[racial equality]]. The party championed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which for the first time outlawed segregation. Democrats made civil rights and [[anti-racism]] a core party philosophy. Carmines and Stimson say, "the Democratic Party appropriated racial liberalism and assumed federal responsibility for ending racial discrimination."<ref>Carmines, Edward G.; Stimson, James A. "Racial Issues and The Structure of Mass Belief Systems," ''Journal of Politics'' (1982) 44#1 pp 2-20 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2130281 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Talmadge Anderson |author2=James Benjamin Stewart |title=Introduction to African American Studies: Transdisciplinary Approaches and Implications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&pg=PA205|year=2007|publisher=Black Classic Press|page=205}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey M. Stonecash|title=New Directions in American Political Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNuOAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA131|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|page=131}}</ref>

Ideological social elements in the party include [[cultural liberalism]], [[civil libertarianism]], and [[feminism]]. Other Democratic social policies are [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], [[open immigration]], [[electoral reform]], and women's [[reproductive rights]].

====Equal opportunity====
The Democratic Party supports [[equal opportunity]] for all Americans regardless of sex, age, race, ethnicity, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], religion, creed, or national origin. Many Democrats support [[affirmative action]] programs to further this goal. Democrats also strongly support the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] to prohibit discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability. As such, the Democrats pushed as well the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008]], a legal expansion that became law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/issues/civil_rights|title=Civil Rights|work=Democrats.org}}</ref>

====Voting rights====
The party is very supportive of improving voting rights as well as election accuracy and accessibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usliberals.about.com/od/electionreform/a/VotingAgenda.htm|title=Liberalism 101: Democratic Party Agenda on Electoral Reform|author=Deborah White|work=About}}</ref> They support ending voter ID laws and increasing voting time, including making election day a holiday. They support reforming the electoral system to eliminate [[gerrymandering]] as well as passing comprehensive [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]].<ref name="ontheissues.org"/> They supported the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and as a party have often been pioneers for democracy in the United States.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

====Abortion and reproductive rights====
{{see also|Abortion law in the United States}}

The Democratic Party believe that all women should have access to [[birth control]], and support public funding of contraception for poor women. The Democratic Party, in its national platforms from 1992 to 2004, has called for [[abortion]] to be "safe, legal and rare"—namely, keeping it legal by rejecting laws that allow governmental interference in abortion decisions, and reducing the number of abortions by promoting both knowledge of reproduction and contraception, and incentives for adoption. The wording changed in the 2008 platform. When Congress voted on the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, Congressional Democrats were split, with a minority (including current [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]]) supporting the ban, and the majority of Democrats opposing the legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/HouseVote/Party_2003-530.htm |title=House Votes on 2003-530 |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date=October 2, 2003 |accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref>

The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which declared abortion covered by the constitutionally protected individual right to privacy under the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts. As a matter of the [[Privacy|right to privacy]] and of [[gender equality]], many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct.

Current [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] self-identifies as '[[pro-life]]', while President [[Barack Obama]] and [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] self-identify as '[[pro-choice]]'. Groups such as [[Democrats for Life of America]] represent the pro-life [[political faction|faction]] of the party, while groups such as [[EMILY's List]] represent the pro-choice [[political faction|faction]]. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were pro-life while a 69% majority was pro-choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm|title=Abortion|publisher=Pollingreport.com|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}</ref>

Many Democratic politicians have called for systematic reform of the U.S. immigration system such that residents that have [[Illegal immigration to the United States|come into the U.S. illegally]] have a pathway to legal citizenship. President Obama remarked on November 2013 that he felt it was "long past time to fix our broken immigration system", particularly to allow "incredibly bright young people" that came over as students to become full citizens. The Public Religion Research Institute found in a late 2013 study that 73% of Democrats supported the pathway concept, compared to 63% of Americans as a whole.<ref name=long-past>{{cite news | last = Frumin | first =Aliyah | title = Obama: 'Long past time' for immigration reform | date = November 25, 2013| url = http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/obama-long-past-time-reform | publisher = [[MSNBC.com]]|accessdate = January 26, 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, Democrats in the Senate passed [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013|S.744]], which would reform immigration policy to allow citizenship for illegal immigrants in the US and improve the lives of all immigrants currently living in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&session=1&vote=00167 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref>

====LGBT rights====
The Democratic Party is supportive of [[LGBT]] rights. Most support for [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] has come from Democrats, although some favor [[civil union]]s instead or oppose same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased in the past decade according to ABC News. An April 2009 ABC News/Washington Post public opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62%,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1089a6HotButtonIssues.pdf|title=Changing Views on Social Issues|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}</ref> while a June 2008 ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage while 23% support [[civil union]]s or [[domestic partnership]] laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm|title=Civil Rights|work=pollingreport.com}}</ref> A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT-related laws such as extending [[hate crime]] statutes, [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce]], and repealing [[Don't ask, don't tell]].

===Legal issues===

====Gun control====
With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] measures, most notably the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]] of 1993, and Crime Control Act of 1994. However, some Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abramsky |first=Sasha |title=Democrat Killer? |publisher=[[The Nation]] |date=April 18, 2005 |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050418/abramsky |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060813101152/http://www.thenation.com:80/doc/20050418/abramsky |archivedate=August 13, 2006 }}</ref> In the national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Assault Weapons Ban]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/wp/docs/2008/08/2008-democratic-platform-080808.pdf |accessdate=February 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120512191810/http://www.queerty.com/wp/docs/2008/08/2008-democratic-platform-080808.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2012 }}</ref>

====Death penalty====
The Democratic Party supports the [[death penalty]] far less than the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Though most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal death penalty]], both [[Russ Feingold]] and [[Dennis Kucinich]] have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in [[New Jersey#Capital punishment|New Jersey]] and in [[Government of New Mexico|New Mexico]]. They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and [[New York#Capital punishment|New York]]. During the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]]; the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.

In 1992, 1993, and 1995, Democratic Texas Congressman [[Henry B. Gonzalez|Henry González]] unsuccessfully introduced the [[s:Death Penalty Abolition Amendment|Death Penalty Abolition Amendment]] which prohibited the use of [[capital punishment in the United States]]. Democratic Missouri Congressman [[Bill Clay|William Lacy Clay, Sr.]] cosponsored the amendment in 1993.

During his [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|Illinois Senate career]], now-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] successfully introduced legislation intended to reduce the likelihood of [[miscarriage of justice|wrongful convictions]] in capital cases, requiring videotaping of confessions. When [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|campaigning for the presidency]], Obama stated that he supports the limited use of the death penalty, including for people who have been convicted of raping a minor under the age of 12, having opposed the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'' that the death penalty was unconstitutional in child rape cases.<ref>[http://www.newser.com/story/30953/obama-backs-death-penalty-for-child-rapists.html?utm_source=ssp&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=story "Obama Backs Death Penalty for Child Rapists"]. [[Newser]], June 26, 2008. Retrieved June 10, 2009.</ref> Obama has stated that he thinks the "death penalty does little to deter crime", and that it is used too frequently and too inconsistently.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Candidates on the Death Penalty|url=http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Death_Penalty|accessdate=July 26, 2009|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080704020036/http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Death_Penalty |archivedate = July 4, 2008}}</ref>

====Torture====
Many Democrats are opposed to [[torture and the United States|the use of torture]] against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]], and hold that categorizing such prisoners as [[unlawful combatant]]s does not release the U.S. from its obligations under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, decreases the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results. Democrats largely spoke out against [[waterboarding]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Torture became a very divisive issue in the party after Barack Obama was elected president. Many centrist Democrats and members of the party's leadership supported the use of torture while the liberal wings continued to be steadfastly opposed to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/obama/articles/2009/05/22/obama-and-democrats-torture-problem|title=Obama and Democrats' Torture Problem|author=Kenneth T. Walsh|work=US News & World Report}}</ref>

====Patriot Act====
Many Democrats are opposed to the [[Patriot Act]], however when the law was passed most Democrats were supportive of it and all but two Democrats in the U.S. Senate voted for the original [[Patriot Act]] legislation in 2001. The lone nay vote was from [[Russ Feingold]] of [[Wisconsin]]; [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]] did not vote. In the House the Democrats voted for the Act by 145 yea and 62 nay. Democrats split on the renewal in 2006. In the Senate, Democrats voted 34 for the 2006 renewal, and 9 against. In the House, Democrats voted 66 voted for the renewal, and 124 against.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doreen Miller |url=http://educate-yourself.org/cn/patriotact20012006senatevote.shtml |title=Senate Vote Roll Call on U.S. Patriot Act 2001 & 2006 |publisher=Educate-yourself.org |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref>

====Right to privacy====
The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a [[privacy law|right to privacy]]. For example, many Democrats have opposed the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|NSA warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens]].

Some Democratic officeholders have championed [[consumer protection]] laws that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations. Most Democrats oppose [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]] and believe that government should not regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults as a matter of personal privacy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ashtari|first=Shadee|title=Here's The Medieval-Sounding Sodomy Law That Helped Ken Cuccinelli Lose In Virginia|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/ken-cuccinelli-sodomy_n_4226708.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=November 6, 2013}}</ref>

===Foreign policy issues===
In foreign policy the voters of the two major parties have largely overlapped since the 1990s. The Gallup poll in early 2013 shows broad agreement on the top issues, albeit with some divergence regarding as human rights and international cooperation through agencies such as the UN.<ref>Lydia Saad, "Republicans, Democrats Agree on Top Foreign Policy Goals: Partisans disagree most on importance of working to achieve world cooperation," [http://www.gallup.com/poll/160649/republicans-democrats-agree-top-foreign-policy-goals.aspx "Gallup: Politics" Feb, 20, 2013]</ref>

In June 2014 the Quinnipiac Poll asked Americans which foreign policy they preferred:
:''A) The United States is doing too much in other countries around the world, and it is time to do less around the world and focus more on our own problems here at home. B) The United States must continue to push forward to promote democracy and freedom in other countries around the world because these efforts make our own country more secure.''

Democrats chose A over B by 65–32%; Republicans chose A over B by 56% to 39%; independents chose A over B by 67% to 29%.<ref>See "July 3, 2014 - Iraq - Getting In Was Wrong; Getting Out Was Right, U.S. Voters Tell Quinnipiac University National Poll" [http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2057 Quinnipiac University Poll] item #51</ref>

====Iraq War====
{{See also|Iraq War}}
In 2002, Congressional Democrats were divided on the [[Iraq Resolution|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq]]; 147 voted against it (21 in the Senate and 126 in the House) and 110 voted for it (29 in the Senate, 81 in the House). Since then, many prominent Democrats, such as former Senator [[John Edwards]], have expressed regret about this decision, and have called it a mistake, while others, such as Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] have criticized the conduct of the war but not repudiated their initial vote for it (though Clinton later went on to repudiate her stance during the 2008 primaries). Referring to Iraq, in April 2007 [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] declared the war to be "lost" while other Democrats (especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle) accused the President of lying to the public about WMDs in [[Iraq]]. Amongst lawmakers, Democrats are the most vocal opponents of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom VI|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and campaigned on a platform of withdrawal ahead of the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]].

A March 2003 [[CBS News]] poll taken a few days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] found that 34% of Democrats nationwide would support it without [[United Nations]] backing, 51% would support it only with its backing, and 14% would not support it at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq16.htm |title=Archive page #16 of polls |publisher=Pollingreport.com |date=June 1, 2003 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]'' stated in early April 2003 that 70% of Democrats supported the decision to invade while 27% opposed it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq15.htm |title=Archive page #15 of polls |publisher=Pollingreport.com |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref> The [[Pew Research Center]] stated in August 2007 that opposition increased from 37% during the initial invasion to 74%.<ref>[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/579/iraq-vietnam Pew Research Center: Along the Iraq-Vietnam Parallel].

Bush|Bush administration]]'s conduct and want to end the war within the next year.<ref>[http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm Recent polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport].</ref>

Democrats in the House of Representatives near-unanimously supported a [[non-binding resolution]] disapproving of President Bush's decision to send [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|additional troops into Iraq in 2007]]. Congressional Democrats overwhelmingly supported military funding legislation that included a provision that set "a timeline for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq" by March 31, 2008, but also would leave combat forces in Iraq for purposes such as targeted counter-terrorism operations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flaherty |first=Anne |title=Congress passes Iraq bill, veto awaits |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/04/26/veto_awaits_iraq_troop_withdrawal_bill/ |date=April 26, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 26, 2007 |work=The Boston Globe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070529185006/http://www.boston.com:80/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/04/26/veto_awaits_iraq_troop_withdrawal_bill/ |archivedate=May 29, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US Democrats push for 2008 Iraq exit |url=http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/us-democrats-push-for-2008-iraq-exit/20075426-9l4.html |date=April 26, 2007 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=April 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071011210013/http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au:80/us-democrats-push-for-2008-iraq-exit/20075426-9l4.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref> After a veto from the president, and a failed attempt in Congress to override the veto,<ref>{{cite news|title=Democrats fail to override Bush on war funding |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/02/africa/prexy.php |date=May 2, 2007 |work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=May 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070504015531/http://www.iht.com:80/articles/2007/05/02/africa/prexy.php |archivedate=May 4, 2007 }}</ref> the [[U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007]] was passed by Congress and signed by the president after the timetable was dropped.

====Iran sanctions====
{{see also|U.S. sanctions against Iran}}
The Democratic Party has been critical of the [[Iran|Iran's]] nuclear weapon program and supported economic sanctions against the Iranian government. In 2013, the Democratic led administration worked to reach a diplomatic agreement with the government of Iran to halt the Iranian nuclear weapon program in exchange for [[Sanctions against Iran|international economic sanction]] relief.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/world/middleeast/talks-with-iran-on-nuclear-deal-hang-in-balance.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael R. | last=Gordon | title=Accord Reached With Iran to Halt Nuclear Program | date=November 23, 2013}}</ref> As of 2014 negotiations had been successful and the party called for more cooperation with Iran in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.577070|title=Jewish Democratic donors urge Congress: Back off Iran sanctions|date=February 28, 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref> In 2015, the Obama administration agreed to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], which provides sanction relief in exchange for international oversight of the [[Iranian nuclear program]].

====Invasion of Afghanistan====

Democrats in the House of Representatives and in the Senate near-unanimously voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] against "those responsible for the [[September 11 attacks|recent attacks launched against the United States]]" in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001, supporting the [[NATO]] coalition [[Operation Enduring Freedom|invasion of the nation]].

The 2008 Democratic Party Platform acknowledges a "[[special relationship]] with Israel, grounded in shared interests and shared values, and a clear, strong, fundamental commitment to the security of Israel, our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy." It also included: <blockquote>It is in the best interests of all parties, including the United States, that we take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of Israel. To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace, while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements. Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States. The creation of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations, together with an international compensation mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there, rather than in Israel. All understand that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949. Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/a/party/platform.html |title=Renewing America's Promise: Democratic Party Platform, 2008 |publisher=Democrats.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100616214838/http://www.democrats.org/a/party/platform.html |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>

A January 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] study found that, when asked "which side do you sympathize with more", 42% of Democrats and 33% of liberals (a plurality in both groups) sympathize most with the Israelis.

[[File:Republican v Democrat Gallup 6-10.svg|thumb|right|250px|Self-identified Democrats (blue) versus self-identified Republicans (red) (January–June 2010 data).]]

===Professionals===
Professionals, those who have a [[Higher education|college education]], and those whose work revolves around the conceptualization of ideas have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12-percentage point margin. While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party, it has become increasingly split between the two parties, leaning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group.<ref name="Judis & Teixeira">{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=back_to_the_future061807|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712135150/http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=back_to_the_future061807|archivedate=July 12, 2007|author1=Judis, J.

A study on the political attitudes of [[Medical school|medical students]], for example, found that "U.S. medical students are considerably more likely to be liberal than conservative and are more likely to be liberal than are other young U.S. adults.

===Academia===

Academics, intellectuals, and the highly [[Educational attainment|educated]] overall constitute an important part of the Democratic voter base.

In the past, a self-identified Republican was more likely to have a 4-year college degree; however, according to some recent surveys, similar percentages of Republicans and Democrats are likely to have 4-year college degrees, and Democrats are more likely to hold post-graduate degrees.<ref name=NYT040112>{{cite news |url=http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/the-politics-of-going-to-college/|title=The Politics of Going to College|accessdate=September 18, 2012 | work=The New York Times|first=Thomas B.|last=Edsall|date=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

An analysis of 2008 through 2012 survey data from the General Social Survey, the National Election Studies, and the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press led to a slightly different assessment of the overall educational status of self-identified Democrats and Republicans: <blockquote>On average, self-identified Republicans have more years of education (4 to 8 months each, depending on the survey) and are probably more likely to hold, at the least, a 4-year college degree. (One major survey indicates that they are more likely, while the results of another survey are statistically insignificant.) It also appears that Republicans continue to out-test Democrats in surveys that assess political knowledge and/or current events. With respect to post-graduate studies, the educational advantage is shifting towards self-identified Democrats. They are now more likely to hold post-graduate college degrees.

===Youth===
Studies have shown that younger voters tend to vote mostly for Democratic candidates in recent years. Despite supporting [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], the young have voted in favor of the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992, and are more likely to identify as liberals than the general population.<ref name="Nagourney">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/washington/27poll.html?_r=3&hp=&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1182947253-8kvQkT+aYTOYz/BCpTsRCg&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|title=Nagourney, A.

===Women===

Although the "gender gap" has varied over many years, women of all ages are more likely than men to identify as Democrats. Recent polls have indicated that 41% of women identify as Democrats while only 25% of women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men identify as Democrats, 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents. Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to identify as Democrats. Also, American women that identified as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican. Again, women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic.<ref name=gallup2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/120839/Women-Likely-Democrats-Regardless-Age.aspx |title=Women More Likely to Be Democrats, Regardless of Age |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> The [[National Federation of Democratic Women]] is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues.

[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] Americans typically vote Democratic in national elections within the 70–77% range, according to national media exit polling. In heavily gay precincts in large cities across the nation, the average was higher, ranging from 85–94%. This trend has continued since 1996, when Bill Clinton won 71% of the LGBT vote compared to Bob Dole's 16% and 13% for others. In 2000, Al Gore won 70% to George W.

===Labor===
[[File:Fig 109 - does someone in house belong to union.JPG|thumb|375px|left]]
Since the 1930s, a critical component of the Democratic Party coalition has been [[Labor unions in the United States|organized labor]]. Labor unions supply a great deal of the money, [[Grassroots|grass roots]] [[Political organisation|political organization]], and voting base of support for the party. Democrats are far more likely to be represented by unions, although union membership has declined, in general, during the last few decades. This trend is depicted in the following graph from the book, ''Democrats and Republicans—Rhetoric and Reality''.<ref>Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans: Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 126.</ref> It is based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies (NES).

The historic decline in union membership over the past half century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the [[AFL-CIO]] and [[Change to Win Federation|Change to Win]] [[National trade union center|labor federations]], as well as the [[National Education Association]], a large, unaffiliated [[teacher|teachers']] union. Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the [[Employee Free Choice Act]]. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting [[industrial policy]] (including [[protectionism]]) that sustains unionized [[manufacturing]] jobs, raising the [[minimum wage]] and promoting broad social programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[universal health care]].

Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics.

Exit polls from the 2008 election showed that voters with a religious affiliation of "[[irreligion|none]]" accounted for the 12% of the electorate and overwhelmingly voted for Obama by a 75–25% margin.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p2 | work=CNN | title=Local Exit Polls - Election Center 2008 - Elections & Politics from CNN.com}}</ref> In his inaugural address, Obama acknowledged atheists by saying that the United States is not just "Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus but non-believers as well."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=An inaugural first: Obama acknowledges 'non-believers' | date=January 22, 2009}}</ref> In the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election cycle]], Obama has moderate to high rankings with the Secular Coalition for America, whereas the majority of the Republican candidates have ratings in the low-to-failing range.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://secular.org/content/2012-presidental-candidate-scorecard|title=2012 Presidential Primary Candidate Scorecard|work=secular.org}}</ref>

Atheists and secular people, although a diverse group themselves, may include individuals who are [[fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]]. In this case, fiscally conservative atheists and secularists will come together due to their opposition to the religiously-bound social policies of the Christian right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/godlessliberals/tp/Atheists-Voting-Elections.htm|title=Atheists & Voting: How Can Atheists Vote to Positively Influence Government?|author=Austin Cline|work=About.com Religion & Spirituality}}</ref>

There is still a [[social stigma]] relating to [[Irreligion in the United States|atheism in the nation]] and polls show that a majority of the American people would be more comfortable voting for a Muslim or gay candidate than an atheist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheistbigotryprejudice/a/AtheistSurveys.htm|title=Polls & Other Surveys on American Attitudes Towards Atheists|author=Austin Cline|work=About.com Religion & Spirituality}}</ref>

From the end of the Civil War, [[African American]]s primarily favored the Republican Party due to its overwhelming political and more tangible efforts in achieving abolition, particularly through President Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name="Blacks and the Democratic Party" /> The south had long been a Democratic stronghold, favoring a state's right to legal slavery. In addition, the ranks of the fledgling [[Ku Klux Klan]] were composed almost entirely of white Democrats angry over poor treatment by northerners and bent on reversing the policies of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ku Klux Klan - History|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/history.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&xpicked=4&item=kkk|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> However, [[African American]]s began drifting to the Democratic Party when [[Franklin D.

===Hispanic and Latino Americans===
The [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] population, particularly the large [[Mexican American]] population in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and the large [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] and [[Dominican American|Dominican]] populations in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party.

With his much more liberal views on immigration, President Bush was the first Republican president to gain 40% of the Hispanic vote (he did so in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]). Yet the Republican Party's support among Hispanics eroded in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], dropping from 44% to 30%, with the Democrats gaining in the Hispanic vote from 55% in 2004 to 69% in 2006.<ref name="CNN.

===Native Americans===

The Democratic Party also has strong support among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population, particularly in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Oklahoma]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Paying Attention to the Native American Vote|url = http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/election2008/2008/11/paying-attention-to-the-n.html|website = www.pbs.org|accessdate = January 2, 2016}}</ref> and [[North Carolina]].

[[File:Obama and Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.jpg|thumb|left||Democratic President Barack Obama, at a Conference with Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.]]

Jews as an important Democratic constituency are especially politically active and influential in large cities such as [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]]; and play critical roles in large cities within presidential [[swing states]], such as [[Philadelphia]], [[Miami]], and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Many prominent national Democrats in recent decades have been Jewish, including [[Chuck Schumer]], [[Carl Levin]], [[Abraham Ribicoff]], [[Ben Cardin]], [[Henry Waxman]], [[Martin Frost]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Barney Frank]], [[Barbara Boxer]], [[Paul Wellstone]], [[Rahm Emanuel]], [[Russ Feingold]], [[Herb Kohl]], and [[Howard Metzenbaum]].<ref name=ajc>[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=2818289&content_id=%7b1031E98B-96D6-4CA2-A3FD-2A1E4411F777%7d&notoc=1 Survey].

===Asian Americans===
The Democratic Party also has considerable support in the small but growing [[Asian American]] population. The Asian American population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the [[United States presidential election]] of 1992 in which [[George H. W. Bush]] won 55% of the Asian American vote, compared to Bill Clinton winning 31%, and [[Ross Perot]] winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, the vast majority of Asian Americans consisted of strongly anti-communist, pro-democracy [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese refugees]], [[Chinese Americans]], [[Taiwanese Americans]], [[Korean Americans]], and socially conservative [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] who fled [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the 1960s through the 1980s, and the general [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s socially conservative, fervently anti-communist position strongly resonated with this original demographic. The Democratic party made gains among the Asian American population starting with 1996 and in 2006, won 62% of the Asian American vote. Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated that Democratic candidate, [[Barack Obama]] won 62% of the [[Asian American]] vote nationwide.<ref>"[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress Dissecting the 2008 Electorate: Most Diverse in U.S. History]".

''[[The Times Of India]]''. May 6, 2012.</ref> The Asian American community's increasing number of young voters has also helped to erode traditionally reliably Republican voting blocs such as Vietnamese and Filipino Americans, leading to an increase in support for Democrats. Prominent Asian-American Democrats include Senators [[Daniel Inouye]], [[Daniel Akaka]] and [[Mazie Hirono]], former Governor and Secretary of Commerce [[Gary Locke]], and Representatives [[Mike Honda]], [[Judy Chu]], [[Doris Matsui]], and [[Norman Mineta]].
