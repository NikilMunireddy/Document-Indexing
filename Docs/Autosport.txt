==Editions==

===Autosport.com===
In addition to the magazine, the publishers also maintain a website which covers much of the same area. In 2005, autosport.com took over AtlasF1, a rival Formula One news website. For a short time the website was called Autosport-Atlas but in January 2006 the name changed back to autosport.com.

===Autosport International===
The same company also organises a motorsport-themed exhibition called [[Autosport International]], which has taken place every January at the NEC Birmingham, UK, since 1991. It reflects the magazine's coverage with displays from [[Kart racing|karting]] and grassroots motorsport to GTs and [[Formula One]]. There is also a Live Action area. Most industry players have presence there. It's the largest such exhibition in the world.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Autosport Asia Edition===
In April 2011, Autosport re-launched Autosport Asia Edition. It is published by Bespoke Media Pte Ltd in [[Singapore]]. It is a monthly magazine instead of a weekly and the aim is that it will carry over most of the month's content from the British edition, as well as placing a very strong emphasis on the Asian motorsport scene.

===Autosport Russian Edition===
On 11 February 2013, launched Autosport Russian Edition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/grapevine.php/id/105530|title=AUTOSPORT launches Russian version|work=Autosport|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=11 February 2013|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref>
