First published on 5 March 1876, ''Corriere della Sera'' is one of Italy's oldest newspapers. It reached a circulation of over 1 million under editor and co-owner [[Luigi Albertini]], 1900-1925. He was a strong opponent of Socialism, of clericalism, and of Prime Minister [[Giovanni Giolitti]] who was willing to compromise with those forces. Albertini's opposition to the Fascist regime forced the other co-owners to oust him 1925.<ref>Niek Nelissen, "The Corriere della Sera and the Rise of the Italian Nationalist Association."
