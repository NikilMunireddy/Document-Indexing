==History==
[[File:John Speed Anglesey.jpg|thumb|John Speed's map of Anglesey, 1607]]
Numerous [[megalith]]ic monuments and [[menhir]]s are present on Anglesey, testifying to the presence of humans in [[prehistory]]. [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]] is near one of 28 [[cromlech]]s that remain on uplands overlooking the sea. The [[Welsh Triads]] claim that Anglesey was once part of the mainland.
[[File:Plas Newydd Anglesey House NW view.jpg|thumb|right| Plas Newydd]]
Historically, Anglesey has long been associated with [[druids]]. In AD 60<!--Hist Channel, 3 experts---> the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], determined to break the power of the [[Celts|Celtic]] druids, attacked the island utilizing his amphibious [[Batavians|Batavian]] contingent as a surprise [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]] assault<ref>Tacitus Agricola 18.3-5</ref> and then destroying the shrine and the [[Nemeton|sacred groves]]. News of [[Boudica]]'s revolt reached him just after his victory, causing him to withdraw his army before consolidating his conquest. The island was finally brought into the Roman Empire by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], the [[Roman Governor]] of Britain, in AD 78. During the Roman occupation, the area was notable for the mining of [[copper]]. The foundations of [[Caer Gybi (fort)|Caer Gybi]] as well as a fort at [[Holyhead]] are Roman, and the present road from Holyhead to [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]] may originally have been a [[Roman road]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The island was known to the Romans as ''Mona''.

[[British Iron Age]] and Roman sites have been excavated, and coins and ornaments discovered, especially by the 19th century [[antiquarian]], [[William Owen Stanley]].<ref>Stanley, ''Anglesey'', 1871, and many Celtic contributions, especially on Celtic subjectsw, to ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]''.</ref> Following the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in the early 5th century, pirates from [[Ireland]] colonised Anglesey and the nearby [[Llŷn Peninsula]]. In response to this, [[Cunedda|Cunedda ap Edern]], a [[Gododdin]] warlord from [[Scotland]], came to the area and began the process of driving the Irish out. This process was continued by his son [[Einion Yrth ap Cunedda]] and grandson [[Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion]], the last Irish invaders finally being defeated in battle in 470. As an island, Anglesey was in a good defensive position and, because of this, [[Aberffraw]] became the site of the court, or ''Llys'', of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. Apart from a devastating [[Denmark|Danish]] raid in 853 it was to remain the capital until the 13th century, when improvements to the [[England|English]] navy made the location indefensible.

After the Irish, the island was invaded by [[Vikings]], some of these raids being noted in famous [[saga]]s (see [[Menai Strait#History|Menai Strait History]]), as well as [[Saxons]], and [[Normans]], before falling to [[Edward I of England]] in the 13th century.

==Geography==
[[File:Brittania Bridge Train crossing 3.JPG|left|thumb|Britannia Bridge from the east along the [[Menai Strait]]]]
Anglesey is a relatively low-lying island with hills spaced evenly over the north of the island. The highest six are: [[Holyhead Mountain]] ({{convert|220|m|ft}}); [[Mynydd Bodafon]] ({{convert|178|m|ft}}); [[Llaneilian|Mynydd Llaneilian]] ({{convert|177|m|ft}}); [[Mynydd y Garn]] ({{convert|170|m|ft}}); [[Bwrdd Arthur]] ({{convert|164|m|ft}}) and '''Mynydd Llwydiarth''' ({{convert|158|m|ft}}). To the south/south-east the island is separated from the Welsh mainland by the [[Menai Strait]], which at its narrowest point is about {{convert|250|m|yd}} wide. In all other directions the island is surrounded by the [[Irish Sea]].  It is the [[List of European islands by area|51st largest island]] in Europe.

Anglesey has several small towns scattered around the island, making it quite evenly populated.
The largest towns are [[Holyhead]], [[Llangefni]], [[Benllech]], [[Menai Bridge]], and [[Amlwch]]. [[Beaumaris, Wales|Beaumaris]] (Welsh: ''Biwmares''), in the east of the island, features [[Beaumaris Castle]], built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as part of his [[Bastide|Bastide Town]] campaign in [[North Wales]]. Beaumaris is a [[yachting]] centre for the region, with many boats moored in the bay or off Gallows Point. The village of [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] (Welsh: ''Niwbwrch''), in the south, created when the townsfolk of Llanfaes were relocated to make way for the building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of [[Llys Rhosyr]], another of the courts of the mediaeval Welsh princes, which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. [[Llangefni]] is located in the centre of the island and is the island's administrative centre. The town of [[Menai Bridge]] (Welsh: ''Porthaethwy'') (in the south-east) expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, in order to accommodate workers and construction. Until then, Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies [[Bryn Celli Ddu]], a [[Stone Age]] burial mound. Also nearby is the village with the longest purported place name in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]]gogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. Nearby is [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]], ancestral home of the [[Marquess of Anglesey|Marquesses of Anglesey]]. The town of [[Amlwch]] is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century supporting the [[copper]] mining industry at Parys Mountain.

Other villages and settlements include [[Cemaes]], [[Pentraeth]], [[Gaerwen]], [[Dwyran]], [[Bodedern]], [[Malltraeth]], and [[Rhosneigr]]. The [[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] is a local tourist attraction, providing a look at and descriptions of local marine [[wildlife]] from [[European lobster|lobsters]] to [[conger eel]]s. All the fish and [[crustacean]]s on display are caught around the island and are placed in reconstructions of their natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. They also make salt (evaporated from the local sea water) and breed commercially lobsters, for food, and [[oyster]]s, for pearls, both from local stocks.

The island's entire rural coastline has been designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and features many sandy beaches, especially along its eastern coast between the towns of Beaumaris and Amlwch and along the western coast from [[Ynys Llanddwyn]] through [[Rhosneigr]] to the little bays around Carmel Head. The northern coastline is characterised by dramatic cliffs interspersed with small bays. The [[Anglesey Coastal Path]] is a {{convert|200|km|0|adj=on}} path<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/news/topic/environment/2007/1858357/;jsessionid=468hLTYBX3BDy171zhMFJpzMYbD5Z3XtJfgl2LbyLvgz3RPG8vmy!686978193?lang=en|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060924153111/new.wales.gov.uk/location/north_west_wales/anob/?lang=en|date=13 December 2007|archivedate=7 January 2008|accessdate=2013-05-09|title=40 years of outstanding natural beauty|publisher=[[Welsh Assembly Government]]}}</ref> which follows nearly the entire coastline. Tourism is now the most significant economic activity on the island. Agriculture provides the secondary source of income for the island's economy, with the local dairies being amongst the most productive in the region.

===Industry and energy===
Major industries are restricted to [[Holyhead]] (Caergybi) which, until 30 September 2009, supported an [[aluminium smelter]], and the [[Amlwch]] area, once a major copper mining town. Nearby is the [[Wylfa nuclear power station]] and a former [[bromine]] extraction plant. In 1971 the Wylfa reactors began producing electricity. With one reactor decommissioned in 2012 and the other expected to end production in 2015, the site is a strong possibility for a replacement reactor, planned by [[Horizon]], a subsidiary of [[Hitachi]], to start production in the 2020s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/04/reduced-subsidies-onshore-windfarms-good-news|title=Renewables industry welcomes reduced subsidies for onshore windfarms|author=Damian Carrington|work=the Guardian|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The replacement has been enthusiastically endorsed by Anglesey Council and Welsh Assembly members, but protestors have raised doubts about the economic and safety claims made for the plant.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/8596392.stm Anglesey protest over plans for new nuclear power plant] BBC News, 30 March 2014</ref> Anglesey also has 3 windfarms on land,<ref name=energy>[http://www.anglesey-today.com/energy.html Anglesey Today: Energy] accessed 15 April 2014</ref> and more than 20 offshore [[wind turbine]]s established near the north coast. There are plans for the world's first Tidal Flow turbines, near [[The Skerries, Isle of Anglesey|The Skerries]], off the north coast,<ref>[http://seagenwales.co.uk/ SeaGen Wales] accessed 15 April 2014</ref> and for a major [[biomass]] plant on [[Holy Island, Anglesey|Holy Island]] (Ynys Gybi). Developing such low carbon energy assets to their full potential forms part of the Anglesey Energy Island project.<ref>[https://www.anglesey.gov.uk/business/energy-island/ Energy Island Programme], accessed 15 April 2014</ref>

When the aluminium smelting operation closed down in September 2009, it reduced its workforce from 450 to 80; this has been a major blow to the Island's economy, especially to the town of Holyhead. The Royal Air Force station [[RAF Valley]] (Y Fali) is home to the RAF Fast Jet Training School and also 22 Sqn Search and Rescue Helicopters, both units providing employment for approximately 500 civilians. RAF Valley is now home to the Headquarters of 22 Sqn Search and Rescue.

There is a wide range of smaller industries, mostly located in industrial and business parks especially at [[Llangefni]] and [[Gaerwen]]. These industries include an [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]] and [[fine chemicals]] manufacture as well as factories for timber production, aluminium smelting, fish farming and food processing. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The island is also on one of the major routes from Britain to [[Ireland]], via [[ferry|ferries]] from [[Holyhead]], off the west of Anglesey on Holy Island, to [[Dún Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin]] Port.

===Rivers, lakes and climate===

There are a few natural lakes, mostly in the west, such as [[Llyn Llywenan]], the largest natural lake on the island, Llyn Coron, and Cors Cerrig y Daran, but rivers are few and small. There are two large water supply reservoirs operated by [[Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water]]. These are [[Llyn Alaw]] to the north of the island and [[Llyn Cefni]] in the centre of the island, which is fed by the headwaters of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]].

The climate is humid (though much less so than neighbouring mountainous Gwynedd) and generally equable, being affected by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The land is of variable quality and it was probably much more fertile in the past. Anglesey is the home of the northernmost [[olive grove]] in Europe and presumably in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Welsh olive grove planted on Anglesey|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-welsh-olive-grove-planted-2262852|accessdate=2013-05-09|date=30 April 2007|work=WalesOnline}}</ref>

==Ecology and conservation==
Much of Anglesey is used for relatively intensive cattle and sheep farming. However, there are a number of important [[wetland]] sites which have protected status. In addition the several lakes all have significant ecological interest, including their support for a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic bird species. In the west, the [[Malltraeth Marsh]]es are believed to support an occasional visiting [[bittern]], and the nearby estuary of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]] supports a bird population made internationally famous by the paintings of [[Charles Tunnicliffe]], who lived for many years&nbsp;– and died - at [[Malltraeth]] on the Cefni estuary. The [[RAF]] airstrip at Mona is a nesting site for [[skylark]]s. The sheer cliff faces at [[South Stack]] near [[Holyhead]] provide nesting sites for huge numbers of [[auk]]s including [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]s, [[razorbill]]s and [[common guillemot|guillemot]]s together with [[chough]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]s. Three sites on Anglesey are important for breeding terns&nbsp;– see [[Anglesey tern colonies]]. There are significant occurrences of the [[Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow|''Juncus subnodulosus''-''Cirsium palustre'' fen-meadow]] [[plant association]], a [[habitat]] characterised by certain hydrophilic grasses, sedges and forbs.<ref>* C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=48639 ''Marsh Thistle: Cirsium palustre'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Strömberg]</ref> Anglesey is home to several species of tern, including the [[roseate tern]].

Anglesey is home to two of the UK's few remaining colonies of [[red squirrel]]s, at [[Pentraeth]] and [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redsquirrels.info|title=Home - Squirrels Map|work=Squirrels Map|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

Almost the entire coastline of Anglesey is designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) to protect the aesthetic appeal and variety of the island's coastal landscape and habitats from inappropriate development. The coastal zone of Anglesey was designated as an AONB in 1966 and was confirmed as such in 1967. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The AONB is predominantly a coastal designation, covering most of Anglesey's {{convert|125|mi|km|0}} coastline but also encompasses Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. Substantial areas of other land protected by the AONB form the backdrop to the coast. The AONB is about 221&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (85 sq mi) and it is the largest AONB in Wales, covering one third of the island.

A number of the habitats in Anglesey are afforded even greater protection through both UK and European designations because of their nature conservation value: these include:

6 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs)
4 Special Protection Areas (SPAs)
1 National Nature Reserve
26 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
52 Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs)

These protected habitats support a variety of wildlife such as [[harbour porpoise]]s and [[marsh fritillary]].

The AONB also takes in three sections of open, undeveloped coastline which have been designated as Heritage Coast. These non-statutory designations complement the AONB and cover about {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} of the coastline. The sections of Heritage Coast are:

# North Anglesey {{convert|28.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}
# Holyhead Mountain {{convert|12.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}
# Aberffraw Bay {{convert|7.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}

===A living and working landscape===
Employment on Anglesey is mainly based on agriculture and tourism. In a number of instances the local produce is also organic.

The most popular forms of recreation include sailing, angling, cycling, walking, wind surfing and jet skiing. These all place pressures and demands on the [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|AONB]]; but these activities contribute to the local economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.bangor.ac.uk/aerial/index.htm|title=Your Page Title|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

==Culture==
* Anglesey hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] in 1957, 1983, and 1999.
* The island is a member of the [[International Island Games Association]]. Its most successful Games were the [[1997 Island Games]] held on [[Jersey]], (11th in the medals table, with 2 gold, 3 silver and 9 bronze medals) and the [[2005 Island Games]] on the [[Shetland Islands]], (again 11th, with 4 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze).
* The annual Anglesey Show is held on the second Tuesday and Wednesday of August: farmers from around the country compete in livestock rearing contests including sheep and cattle.
* Anglesey has featured in the [[Channel 4]] archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' (series 14) - episode transmission date 4 February 2007.
* Anglesey is home to Gottwood, an electronic music and arts festival  held each summer at the Carreglwyd estate.

==Welsh language==
Anglesey has historically been a stronghold of the [[Welsh language]], and according to the 2011 census it was the second most Welsh-speaking local authority area in Wales. The historical proportions of residents who could speak Welsh are as follows:
*1901: 90.7% <ref name="Census-Report">[http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser2?ResourceType=Census&ResourceType=Legislation&SearchTerms=welsh%20speakers%201911&simple=yes&path=Results/Census/1911&active=yes&treestate=expandnew&titlepos=0&mno=156&tocstate=expandnew&tocseq=300&display=sections&display=tables&display=pagetitles&pageseq=first-nonblank Language in Wales, 1911 (official census report), Table I.]</ref>

Today, Welsh is less widely used on the island than earlier in the last century, but it is still the dominant language in certain areas of the island, particularly in the centre, including the town of [[Llangefni]] and some areas of the south coast: a notable example is the village of [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll|Llanfairpwll]]. The island's five secondary schools vary drastically with regard to the percentage of their pupils who come from predominantly Welsh-speaking homes, as does the percentage of pupils who can speak Welsh:
*Ysgol David Hughes (located in [[Menai Bridge]]): 33% come from Welsh-speaking homes while 90% 'can speak Welsh'.<ref name="Estyn Report,2012">[http://www.estyn.gov.uk/english/provider/6604028]</ref>
*Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni (located in [[Llangefni]]: 68% of pupils speak Welsh as their [[Mother Tongue|first language]] while 87% of pupils take their exams through the medium of Welsh.
*Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones (located in [[Amlwch]]: 34% of all pupils come from Welsh-speaking homes while 82% sit the Welsh First Language [[GCSEs|GCSE]]
*Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern (located in [[Bodedern]]: 67% of all pupils come from Welsh-speaking homes while 'a majority' speak Welsh as fluently{{clarify|date=July 2015}}.
*Holyhead High School (located in [[Holyhead]]: 14% of pupils speak Welsh at home while 11% of pupils are taught the 'Welsh First Language' curriculum.

==Geology==
The geology of Anglesey is notably complex and is frequently used for geology [[field trip]]s by schools and colleges. Younger strata in Anglesey rest upon a foundation of very old [[Precambrian]] rocks {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} that appear at the surface in four areas:
#a western region including Holyhead and [[Llanfaethlu]]
#a central area about [[Aberffraw]] and [[Trefdraeth]]
#an eastern region which includes [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]], [[Gaerwen]] and [[Pentraeth]]
#a coastal region at [[Menai Bridge#Glyn Garth|Glyn Garth]] between [[Menai Bridge]] and [[Beaumaris]]
These Precambrian rocks are [[schist]]s and [[phyllite]]s, often much contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the formations in the island is from north-east to south-west. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} A belt of [[granitic|granitic rocks]] lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from [[Llanfaelog]] near the coast to the vicinity of [[Llanerchymedd]]. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of [[Ordovician]] slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out in the north of the island between [[Dulas Bay]] and Carmel Point. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses [[Carboniferous]] rocks are found. The [[Carboniferous Limestone]] occupies a broad area south of [[Lligwy Bay]] and [[Pentraeth]], and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by [[Llangefni]] to [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth Sands]]. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow [[sandstone]] (sometimes considered to be of [[Old Red Sandstone]] age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast about [[Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd|Llanfihangel]] and [[Llangoed]]; and in the south-west round Llanidan on the border of the [[Menai Strait]]. [[Puffin Island, Anglesey|Puffin Island]] is made of Carboniferous Limestone. [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth marsh]] is occupied by Coal Measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the [[Menai Strait]]. A patch of rhyolitic/[[felsite|felsitic]] rocks form [[Parys Mountain]], where copper and iron ochre have been worked. [[serpentine group|Serpentine]] (Mona Marble) is found near [[Llanfair-yn-neubwll]] and upon the opposite shore in [[Holyhead]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Under the name ''[[GeoMôn]]'', and in recognition of its extraordinary geological heritage, the island gained membership of the [[European Geoparks Network]] in spring 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geomon.co.uk/#/about/4533286655|title=GeoMôn - Anglesey Geopark|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> and the [[Global Network of National Geoparks|Global Geoparks Network]] in September 2010.

==Government==
{{See also|Isle of Anglesey County Council}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
Anglesey (together with Holy Island) is one of the thirteen [[historic counties of Wales]]. In medieval times, before the conquest of Wales in 1283, ''Môn'' often had periods of temporary independence as it was frequently bequeathed to the heirs of kings as a [[sub kingdom]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. The last times this occurred were for a few years after 1171 following the death of [[Owain Gwynedd]] when the island was inherited by [[Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd]] and again between 1246 and c. 1255 when it was given to [[Owain Goch]] as his share of the kingdom. Following the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] it was created a county under the terms of the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] of 1284. Prior to this it had been divided into the ''[[cantref]]i'' of:
* [[Cantref Aberffraw|Aberffraw]]
* [[Cantref Rhosyr|Rhosyr]]
* [[Cantref Cemaes|Cemaes]]

In 1974 it formed a district of the new large [[Administrative divisions of Wales#Counties|county]] of [[Gwynedd]], until in the 1996 reform of local government it was restored as a local government county. The county council is a [[unitary authority]] and is named "Isle of Anglesey County Council" ({{lang-cy|Cyngor Sir Ynys Môn}}). In 2011, the [[Welsh Government]] appointed a panel of commissioners to administer the council, thus the elected members were not in control. The commissioners remained in control until an [[Isle of Anglesey County Council election, 2013|election]] was held in May 2013, restoring an elected Council. Prior to the direct administration, there were a majority of independent councillors, though members did not generally divide along party lines organised into five non-partisan groups on the council, containing a mix of party and independent candidates.  The position remains substantially unchanged after the election although the Labour party has formed a governing coalition with the independents.

==Schools==
{{Main|List of schools in Anglesey}}
Secondary schools:
*[[Ysgol David Hughes]], [[Menai Bridge]]
*[[Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni]], [[Llangefni]]
*[[Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones]], [[Amlwch]]
*[[Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern]], [[Bodedern]]
*[[Holyhead High School|Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi]], [[Holyhead]]

There are also 50 primary schools in Anglesey, all of which are co-educational day schools.<ref>[http://www.anglesey.gov.uk/doc.asp?cat=2601 Isle of Anglesey County Council, Serving Anglesey]</ref>

==Transport==
By road, Anglesey is linked from [[Holyhead]] to the mainland by the [[A55 road|A55]] which leads to [[Chester]]. Also the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] runs from the east of the island ([[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]]) to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and as far as [[St Albans]] via the [[Menai Bridge]]. The [[A5025 road|A5025]], which runs around the northern edge of Anglesey, and the [[A4080 road|A4080]], running around the southern edge, form a ring around the island.

There are six railway stations in Anglesey: [[Holyhead railway station|Holyhead]], [[Valley railway station|Valley]], [[Rhosneigr railway station|Rhosneigr]], [[Ty Croes railway station|Ty Croes]], [[Bodorgan railway station|Bodorgan]] and [[Llanfairpwll railway station|Llanfairpwll]]. All are on the [[North Wales Coast Line]] and services are operated by [[Virgin Trains]] to [[London Euston]], and by [[Arriva Trains Wales]] to [[Chester railway station|Chester]], [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]]. Historically the island was also served by the [[Anglesey Central Railway]] which ran from [[Gaerwen]] to [[Amlwch]], and the [[Red Wharf Bay branch line]] between the [[Holland Arms railway station]] and [[Red Wharf Bay]].

By air, [[Anglesey Airport]] has a twice-daily scheduled service to [[Cardiff International Airport]] where connections worldwide can be made.

[[Port of Holyhead|Holyhead Port]] is a busy [[ferry]] [[seaport|port]] handling more than 2 million passengers each year. [[Stena Line]] and [[Irish Ferries]] sail to [[Dublin]] and [[Dún Laoghaire]] in [[Ireland]], forming the principal link for surface [[transport]] from central and northern [[England]] and [[Wales]] to [[Ireland]].

==Sport==
Anglesey is independently represented in the [[Island Games]] (under its Welsh name ''Ynys Môn''). The team finished joint 17th in the [[2009 Island Games|2009 Games]] hosted by [[Åland]],<ref>{{cite web|title=NatWest Island Games XIII - Medal Table|url=http://www.alandresults2009.com/medal.aspx|accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref> winning medals in [[gymnastics]], [[sailing]] and [[shooting]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NatWest Island Games XIII - Ynys Môn Medal Winners|url=http://www.alandresults2009.com/medal.aspx?IslandID=22|accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref>

Anglesey made an unsuccessful bid to host the 2009 games, led by Ynys Môn MP [[Albert Owen]]. The island expected to benefit from more than £3m of spending if it had hosted the event. However, Anglesey currently lacks two facilities necessary for a successful bid, a six-lane competition swimming pool and an athletics track.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Rhodri|title=Out of the running for island ‘Olympics’|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/08/02/out-of-the-running-for-island-olympics-91466-21452392/|accessdate=30 August 2010|newspaper=Western Mail}}</ref>

Several precursors to the modern football codes were highly popular in Anglesey.  They had few rules, and were quite violent.  Rhys Cox, at the turn of the 18th century, described a game in [[Llandrygan]] as ending with "&#91;n&#93;umbers of players &#91;&hellip;&#93; left here and there on the road, some having limbs broken in the struggle, others severely injured, and some carried on biers to be buried in the churchyard nearest to where they had been mortally injured.".  William Bulkeley, in his April 1734 diary, records that the violence of such games left no hard feelings, with both sides parting "as good friends as they came, after they had spent half an hour together cherishing their spirits with a cup of ale &#91;&hellip;&#93; having finished Easter Holydays innocently and merrily".{{sfnp|ETBRS|2005b}}

===Association football===
Football arrived on the island in the 1870s.  It was initially met with resistance, given its perceived (by the islanders) associations with drunkenness and rowdiness, and the lower classes.  One critic dismissed it as "unchristian practice".  The Anglesey League, comprising teams from [[Amlwch]], [[Beaumaris]], [[Holyhead]], [[Menai Bridge]], [[Llandegfan]], and [[Llangefni]], was, however, formed in the 1895&ndash;1896 football season.{{sfnp|Pretty|2005}}

The [[Anglesey football team|Ynys Môn]] football team represents the island of Anglesey at the biannual Island Games, winning gold in 1999.

[[Llangefni Town F.C.|Llangefni Town]] are reigning [[Cymru Alliance]] champions, only failing promotion due to the restructuring of the [[Welsh Premier League]]. Similarly, [[Holyhead Hotspur]] and [[Llanfairpwll F.C.|Llanfairpwll]] were relegated despite finishing outside the usual relegation zone at the end of the 2009-10 season.

===Rugby Union===
[[Llangefni RFC]] is the island's highest competing team in the [[WRU Division One North]].

[[Llangoed]] hosts an annual [[rugby sevens]] contest. Touring sides have included Manhattan RFC.

=== Anglesey Hunt ===
The Anglesey Hunt, formed in 1757, was the second oldest [[fox hunting]] association in Wales (the oldest being the Tivyside Hunt in Cardiganshire).{{sfnp|ETBRS|2005a}}

===Athletics===
Every September the Anglesey Festival of Running takes place. There is a marathon, half-marathon, 10&nbsp;km and 5&nbsp;km race, as well as children's contests. Their slogan is ''Run the Island''.

===Motorsport===
The [[Anglesey Circuit]] (Welsh: Trac Môn) is a fully licensed MSA and ACU championship racing circuit, it opened in 1997.

=== Cricket ===
The Beaumaris Cricket Club was formed in 1858.  Clubs at [[Holyhead]], [[Amlwch]], and [[Llangefni]] were formed within the following decade, but it wasn't until the 1880s that the sport became popular outside of the upper classes. [[Bodedern]] Cricket Club was formed in 1947{{sfnp|Pretty|2005}}

===Sailing===
The Royal Anglesey Yacht Club hosts the Menai Strait Regatta yearly.

===Swimming===
Anglesey is Wales's largest island, separated from the mainland by the Menai Strait. The Straits host two annual open-water swimming contests; the Menai Strait Swim from Foel to Caernarfon (1 mile), and the Pier to Pier Open Water Swim, between [[Beaumaris Pier|Beaumaris]] and [[Garth Pier]], Bangor.

==Walking==
The [[Anglesey Coastal Path]], which follows the entire way around the island, is 200&nbsp;km long, takes roughly 12 days to complete, and passes by/through 20 towns/villages. The official start point is [[St Cybi's Church, Holyhead]].<ref>http://www.visitanglesey.co.uk/about-anglesey/isle-of-anglesey-coastal-path/</ref>
