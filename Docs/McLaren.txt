'''McLaren Racing Limited''', competing as '''McLaren Honda''', is a British [[Formula One]] team based at the [[McLaren Technology Centre]], [[Woking]], [[Surrey]], England. McLaren is best known as a [[List of Formula One constructors|Formula One constructor]] but has also competed and won in the [[Indianapolis 500]] and [[Can-Am|Canadian-American Challenge Cup]] (Can-Am). The team is the second oldest active team after [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. They are one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, having won 182 races, 12 drivers' championships and eight constructors' championships. The team is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[McLaren Technology Group]].

Founded in 1963 by New Zealander [[Bruce McLaren]], the team won its first Grand Prix at the [[1968 Belgian Grand Prix]], but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, where they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for [[Mark Donohue]] in [[1972 Indianapolis 500|1972]] and [[Johnny Rutherford]] in [[1974 Indianapolis 500|1974]] and [[1976 Indianapolis 500|1976]]. After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, [[Teddy Mayer]] took over and led the team to their first Formula One constructors' championship in [[1974 Formula One season|1974]], with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and [[James Hunt]] winning the drivers' championship in 1974 and [[1976 Formula One season|1976]], respectively; 1974 also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]]' [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarette brand.

In 1981, McLaren merged with [[Ron Dennis]]' [[Project Four Racing]]; Dennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This began the team's most successful era: with [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] and [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] engines, [[Niki Lauda]], [[Alain Prost]], and [[Ayrton Senna]] took between them seven drivers' championships and McLaren six constructors' championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant—together they won all but one race in [[1988 Formula One season|1988]]—but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Fellow English team [[Williams F1|Williams]] offered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between [[1984 Formula One season|1984]] and [[1994 Formula One season|1994]]. However, by the mid-1990s, Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to Williams, and the team went three seasons without a win. With [[Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines|Mercedes-Benz]] engines, [[West (cigarette)|West]] sponsorship, and former Williams designer [[Adrian Newey]], further championships came in [[1998 Formula One season|1998]] and [[1999 Formula One season|1999]] with driver [[Mika Häkkinen]] and during the 2000s the team were consistent front-runners, driver [[Lewis Hamilton]] taking their latest title in [[2008 Formula One season|2008]].

Ron Dennis retired as McLaren team principal in 2009, handing the former role to longtime McLaren employee [[Martin Whitmarsh]]. At the end of 2013, after the team's worst season since 2004, Whitmarsh was ousted. McLaren announced in 2013 that they would be using [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] engines from 2015 onwards, replacing [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes-Benz]]. The team raced as McLaren-Honda for the first time since 1992 at the [[2015 Australian Grand Prix]].

==Origins==

[[File:McLarenBruce.jpg|thumb|The McLaren Racing team's founder [[Bruce McLaren]]]]

Bruce McLaren Motor Racing was founded in 1963 by New Zealander [[Bruce McLaren]].<ref name="mclarenhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.mclaren.com/mclarengroup/mclaren-in-formula1.php |title=McLAREN IN FORMULA 1 |publisher=mclaren.com |accessdate=12 April 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080528224319/http://www.mclaren.com/mclarengroup/mclaren-in-formula1.php |archivedate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Bruce was a [[factory-backed|works]] driver for the British [[Formula One]] team [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] with whom he had won three [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grands Prix]] and come second in the [[1960 Formula One season|1960 world championship]]. Wanting to compete in the [[Australasia]]n [[Tasman Series]], Bruce approached his employers, but when team owner Charles Cooper insisted on using 1.5-litre Formula One-specification engines instead of the 2.5-litre motors permitted by the Tasman rules, Bruce decided to set up his own team to run him and his prospective Formula One team-mate [[Timmy Mayer]] with custom-built Cooper cars.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|page=65}}</ref>

Bruce won the [[1964 Tasman Series|1964 series]], but Mayer was killed in practice for the final race, prompting his brother and manager [[Teddy Mayer]] to become involved with the running of the team.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|p=15}}</ref><ref name="mayerobituary">{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/06/obituary-teddy-mayer |title=Obituary: Teddy Mayer| first=Alan |last=Henry |authorlink=Alan Henry |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]  |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref> In 1964 and 1965, McLaren were based in [[New Malden]], then [[Feltham]], before settling on premises in [[Colnbrook]].

During this period, Bruce drove for his team in [[sports car racing|sports car races]] in the United Kingdom and North America and also entered the [[1965 Tasman Series]] with [[Phil Hill]], but did not win it.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|pages=72–85}}</ref> He continued to drive in Grands Prix for Cooper, but judging that team's form to be waning, decided to race his own cars in 1966.<ref name="henry18">{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=18}}</ref>

Bruce made the team's Grand Prix debut at the [[1966 Monaco Grand Prix|1966 Monaco race]] (of the current Formula One teams only [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] is older<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/teams.html |title=Formula One Teams |publisher=Formula One |accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Current team [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] first competed in {{f1|1954}}–{{F1|1955}}, but did not race again until {{f1|2010}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8420969.stm |title=Mercedes Grand Prix team profile |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref>|group="nb"}}).<ref name="mclarenhistory"/> His race ended after nine laps due to a terminal oil leak.<ref name="McLaren Trust"/> The {{F1|1966}} car was the [[McLaren M2B|M2B]] designed by [[Robin Herd]], but the programme was hampered by a poor choice of engines: a 3.0-litre version of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s [[Indianapolis 500]] engine and a [[Scuderia Serenissima|Serenissima]] [[V8 engine|V8]] were used, the latter scoring the team's first point in [[1966 British Grand Prix|Britain]], but both were underpowered and unreliable.<ref name="henry18"/><ref name="McLaren Trust">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruce-mclaren.com/the-cars/f1.html |title=Formula One&nbsp;– hard and unforgiving |work=Bruce McLaren Trust |accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> For {{F1|1967}} Bruce decided to use a [[British Racing Motors]] (BRM) [[V12 engine]], but due to delays with the engine, was forced initially to use a modified [[Formula Two]] car called the [[McLaren M4B|M4B]] powered by a 2.1-litre BRM V8, later building a similar but slightly larger car called the [[McLaren M5A|M5A]] for the V12.<ref name="McLaren Trust"/> Neither car brought great success, the best result being a fourth at [[1964 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]].

===Successes, Bruce McLaren's death, McLaren under Teddy Mayer, and the DFV (1968–1982)===
For {{F1|1968}}, after driving McLaren's sole entry for the previous two years, Bruce was joined by 1967 champion and fellow New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]], who was already racing for McLaren in [[Can-Am]].<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=22}}</ref><ref name="clockworkorange"/> That year's new [[McLaren M7A|M7A]] car, Herd's final design for the team, was powered by [[Cosworth]]'s new and soon to be ubiquitous [[Cosworth DFV|DFV]] engine<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|page=54}}</ref><ref name="tremaynehughes223-228"/> (the DFV would go on to be used by McLaren until 1983) and with it a major upturn in form proceeded. Bruce won the [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Race of Champions]] at the [[Brands Hatch]] circuit and Hulme won the [[1968 BRDC International Trophy|International Trophy]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], both non-championship races,<ref>{{cite journal |title=M7A: McLaren's lucky number |journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]] |date=August 2008|volume=84 |issue=8 |publisher=Stratfield}}</ref> before Bruce took the team's first championship win at the [[1968 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/teams/McLaren.html |title=McLaren Team Profile |work=Formula 1&nbsp;– The Official F1 Website |publisher=[[Formula One]] |accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref> Hulme also won the [[1968 Italian Grand Prix|Italian]] and [[1968 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] Grands Prix later in the year, helping the team to second in the constructors' championship. Using an updated 'C' version on the M7,<ref name="henry24"/> a further three podium finishes followed for Bruce in {{F1|1969}}, but the team's fifth win had to wait until the last race of the 1969 championship when Hulme won the [[1969 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]]. That year, McLaren experimented with [[four-wheel drive]] in the [[McLaren M9A|M9A]], but the car had only a single outing driven by [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]] at the [[1969 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]]; Bruce described driving it as like "trying to write your signature with somebody jogging your elbow".<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=23–24}}</ref>

The year {{F1|1970}} started with a second place each for Hulme and Bruce in the first two Grands Prix, but in June, Bruce was killed in a crash at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] while testing the new M8D Can-Am car.<ref name="henry24">{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=24}}</ref> After his death, Teddy Mayer took over effective control of the team;<ref name="mayerobituary"/> Hulme continued with [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Peter Gethin]] partnering him. Gurney won the first two Can-Am events at Mosport and St. Jovite and placed ninth in the third, but left the team mid-season, and Gethin took over from there. While {{F1|1971}} began promisingly when Hulme led the opening round in [[1970 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]] before retiring with broken suspension,<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=25}}</ref> ultimately Hulme, Gethin (who left for BRM mid-season,<ref name="henry26">{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=26}}</ref>) and [[Jackie Oliver]] again failed to score a win. The 1972 season saw improvements though: Hulme won the team's first Grand Prix for two-and-a-half years in [[1972 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]] and he and [[Peter Revson]] scored ten other podiums, the team finishing third in the constructors' championship. McLaren gave [[Jody Scheckter]] his Formula One debut at the [[1972 United States Grand Prix|final race]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]].<ref name="henry26"/>

[[File:Emerson Fittipaldi McLaren M23 1974 Britain.jpg||thumb|right|[[Emerson Fittipaldi]] won the 1974 drivers' championship with McLaren.]]

The [[McLaren M23]], designed by Gordon Coppuck, was the team's new car for the [[1973 Formula One season]].<ref name="henry26"/> Sharing parts of the design of both McLaren's Formula One [[McLaren M19A|M19]] and Indianapolis M16 cars (itself inspired by [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]'s [[Lotus 72|72]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|page=174}}</ref> it was a mainstay for four years.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|loc=Appendix 1}}</ref> Hulme won with it in [[1973 Swedish Grand Prix|Sweden]] and Revson took the only Grand Prix wins of his career in [[1973 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and [[1973 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]]. In {{F1|1974}}, [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], world champion with Lotus two years earlier, joined McLaren.<ref name="fittipaldi">{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/drivers/hall-of-fame/Emerson_Fittipaldi.html |first=Gerald |last=Donaldson |title=Emerson Fittipaldi |work=Formula 1&nbsp;– The Official F1 Website |publisher=[[Formula One]] |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> Hulme, in his final Formula One campaign,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/drivers/hall-of-fame/Denny_Hulme.html |first=Gerald |last=Donaldson |title=Denny Hulme |work=Formula 1&nbsp;– The Official F1 Website |publisher=[[Formula One]] |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> won the [[1974 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentinian]] season-opener; Fittipaldi, with wins in [[1974 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], [[1974 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]] and [[1974 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], took the drivers' championship. It was a close fight for Fittipaldi, who secured the title with a fourth at the season-ending [[1974 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], putting him three points ahead of Ferrari's [[Clay Regazzoni]]. With Hulme and multiple motorcycle world champion [[Mike Hailwood]], he also sealed McLaren's first constructors' championship. The year {{F1|1975}} was less successful for the team: Fittipaldi was second in the championship behind [[Niki Lauda]]. Hulme's replacement [[Jochen Mass]] took his sole GP win in [[1974 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]].

At the end of 1975, Fittipaldi left to join his brother's [[Fittipaldi Automotive|Fittipaldi/Copersucar]] team.<ref name="fittipaldi"/> With the top drivers already signed to other teams, Mayer turned to [[James Hunt]], a driver on whom biographer Gerald Donaldson reflected as having "a dubious reputation".<ref>{{cite book |title=James Hunt: The Biography |first=Gerald |last=Donaldson |year=1995 |publisher=CollinsWillow | page=158 |isbn=0-00-218493-1}}</ref> In {{F1|1976}}, Lauda was again strong in his Ferrari; at midseason, he led the championship with 56 points whilst Hunt had only 26 despite wins in [[1976 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] (a race from which he was initially disqualified<ref name="henry32">{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=32}}</ref>) and [[1976 French Grand Prix|France]]. At the [[1976 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], though, Lauda crashed heavily, was nearly killed, and missed the next two races.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/drivers/hall-of-fame/Niki_Lauda.html |first=Gerald |last=Donaldson |title=Niki Lauda |work=Formula 1&nbsp;– The Official F1 Website |publisher=[[Formula One]] |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> Hunt capitalised by winning four more Grands Prix giving him a three-point deficit going into the finale in [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]. Here it rained torentially, Lauda retired because of safety concerns, and Hunt sealed the drivers' championship by finishing third.<ref name="henry32"/> McLaren, though, lost the constructors' championship to Ferrari.

In {{F1|1977}}, the M23 was gradually replaced with the [[McLaren M26|M26]], the M23's final works outing being [[Gilles Villeneuve]]'s Formula One debut with the team in a one-off appearance at the [[1977 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Villeneuve: The Life of the Legendary Racing Driver |first=Gerald |last=Donaldson |page=80 |edition=1st paperback |year=2003 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=0-7535-0747-1}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=34}}</ref> Hunt won on three occasions that year, but the Lauda and Ferrari combination proved too strong, Hunt and McLaren managing just fifth and third in the respective championships. From there, results continued to worsen. Lotus and [[Mario Andretti]] took the {{f1|1978}} titles with their [[Lotus 78|78]] and [[Lotus 79|79]] [[ground effect in cars|ground-effect]] cars<ref>{{cite book |title=The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Formula One |editor-first=Bruce| editor-last=Jones |year=1997 |publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]] |page=43 |isbn=0-340-70783-6}}</ref> and neither Hunt nor Mass's replacement [[Patrick Tambay]] were able to seriously challenge with the nonground-effect M26.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|pages=211–213}}</ref> Hunt was dropped at the end of 1978 in favour of Lotus's [[Ronnie Peterson]], but when Peterson was killed by a crash at the [[1978 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] was signed, instead.<ref name="henry33">{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=33}}</ref> No improvement occurred in {{f1|1979}}; Coppuck's [[McLaren M28|M28]] design was described by Mayer as "ghastly, a disaster" and "quite diabolical" and the [[McLaren M29|M29]] did little to change the situation.<ref name="henry33"/> Tambay scored no points and Watson only 15 to place the team eighth at the end of the year.

In the early 1980s, teams like [[Renault F1|Renault]], Ferrari and [[Brabham]] were using 1.5-litre [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] engines in favour of the 3.0-litre [[naturally aspirated engine]]s that had been standard since 1966.<ref name="tremaynehughes223-228">{{harvnb|Tremayne|Hughes|1998|pages=223–228}}</ref> Seeing the need for a turbo engine of their own, in {{f1|1982}}, Dennis convinced [[Williams F1|Williams]] backer [[Techniques d'Avant Garde]] (TAG) to fund [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]]-built, TAG-branded turbo engines made to Barnard's specifications; TAG's founder [[Mansour Ojjeh]] would later become a McLaren shareholder. In the meantime, they continued with Cosworth engines as old rival Lauda came out of retirement to drive alongside Watson in that year's 1B development of the MP4.<ref name="motorsportdennis"/><ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|pages=42–44}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| first = John| last = Blundsden| title = Dennis confronts the difficulties of his own success|work=The Times |location=UK| date=  7 July 1988}}</ref> They each won two races, Watson notably from 17th place on the grid in [[1982 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit]],<ref name="motorsportdennis"/> and McLaren were second in the constructors' title race. As part of a dispute with [[Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]], the sport's governing body, they boycotted the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|page=235}}</ref> Although {{f1|1983}} was not so fruitful, Watson did win again in the United States, this time from 22nd on the grid at [[1983 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach]].<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=45}}</ref>

Having been fired by Renault, Prost was once again at McLaren for {{f1|1984}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=46}}</ref> Now using the TAG engines, the team dominated, scoring 12 wins and two-and-a-half times as many constructors' points as nearest rival Ferrari. In the drivers' championship, Lauda prevailed over Prost by half a point, the narrowest margin ever.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=53}}</ref> The McLaren-TAGs were again strong in {{F1|1985}}; a third constructors' championship came their way whilst this time Prost won the drivers' championship. In {{F1|1986}}, the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team were resurgent with their [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] engine and drivers [[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Nelson Piquet]], whilst at McLaren, Lauda's replacement, 1982 champion [[Keke Rosberg]] could not gel with the car. Williams took the constructors' championship, but for Prost, wins in [[1986 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]], [[1986 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], and [[1986 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]] combined with the fact that the Williams drivers were taking points from each other meant that he retained a chance going into the last race, the [[1987 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]. There, a puncture for Mansell and a precautionary pit stop for Piquet gave Prost the race win and his second title, making him the first driver to win back-to-back championships since [[Jack Brabham]] in {{f1|1959}} and 1960.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|pages=57–63}}</ref> In {{f1|1987}} Barnard departed for Ferrari to be replaced by [[Steve Nichols]] (who himself joined Ferrari in 1989).<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=63}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=78}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tremayne|Hughes|1998|pages=198–199}}</ref> In the hands of Prost and [[Stefan Johansson]], though, Nichols's [[McLaren MP4/3|MP4/3]] and the TAG engine could not match the Williams-Honda.

For {{F1|1988}}, Honda switched their supply to McLaren and, encouraged by Prost, Dennis signed [[Ayrton Senna]] to drive.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]] |first=Nigel |last=Roebuck |authorlink=Nigel Roebuck |title=The best of enemies |date=October 2008 |volume=84 |issue=10 |publisher=Stratfield}}</ref> Despite regulations reducing the boost pressure and fuel capacity (and therefore, power) of the turbo cars, Honda persisted with a turbocharged engine.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=65}}</ref> In the [[McLaren MP4/4|MP4/4]], Senna and Prost engaged in a season-long battle, winning 15 of the 16 races (at the other race at [[1988 Italian Grand Prix|Monza]], Senna had been leading comfortably, but collided with back-marker [[Jean-Louis Schlesser]]<ref>{{harvnb|Rubython|2006|page=170}}</ref>). At the [[1988 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]], their relationship soured when Senna squeezed Prost against the pit wall; Prost won, but afterwards said, "It was dangerous. If he wants the world championship that badly he can have it."<ref>{{harvnb|Rubython|2006|page=171}}</ref> Prost scored more points that year, but because only the best 11 results counted, Senna took the title at the penultimate race in [[1988 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/results/season/1988/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007215552/http://www.formula1.com/results/season/1988/|archivedate=7 October 2014|title=1988 FIA Formula One World Championship |work=Formula 1&nbsp;– The Official F1 Website |publisher=[[Formula One]] |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|pages=70–71}}</ref>

The next year, with turbos banned, Honda supplied a new 3.5-L naturally aspirated [[V10 engine]]<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=71}}</ref> and McLaren again won both titles with the [[McLaren MP4/5|MP4/5]]. Their drivers' relationship continued to deteriorate, though, especially when, at the [[1989 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], Prost felt that Senna had reneged on an agreement not to pass each other at the first corner.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=73}}</ref> Believing that Honda and Dennis were favouring Senna, Prost announced mid-season that he would leave to drive at Ferrari the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prostfan.com/senna2.htm| title=Ayrton Senna by Alain Prost |publisher=prostfan.com |accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> For the second year in succession, the drivers' championship was decided at the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], this time in Prost's favour after Senna and he collided (Senna initially recovered and won the race, but was later disqualified).<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|pages=76–77}}</ref>

[[File:AyrtonSennaAtHockheimGP1993.jpg|thumb|right|By {{F1|1993}}, Honda had withdrawn from F1 and the team used underpowered [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[V8 engine]]s to power the [[McLaren MP4/8|MP4/8]]. Although Ayrton Senna (pictured at the [[1993 German Grand Prix|German GP]]) won five races, McLaren was not a match for the dominant [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team.

With former McLaren men Nichols and Prost (Barnard had moved to the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team), Ferrari pushed the British team more closely in {{F1|1990}}. McLaren, in turn, brought in Ferrari's [[Gerhard Berger]], but like the two seasons before, the drivers' championship was led by Prost and Senna and settled at [[1990 Japanese Grand Prix|the penultimate race in Japan]]. Here, Senna collided with Prost at the first corner, forcing both to retire, but this time Senna escaped punishment and took the title;<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=80}}</ref> McLaren also won the constructors' championship. The {{F1|1991}} year was another for McLaren and Senna, with the ascendent [[Renault F1|Renault]]-powered Williams team their closest challengers. By {{F1|1992}}, Williams, with their advanced [[Williams FW14B|FW14B]] car,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/cars_guide/4272031.stm| title=The changing face of F1 |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=28 February 2005 |accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> had overtaken McLaren, breaking their four-year run as champions, despite the latter winning four races.

===Ford-Cosworth, Lamborghini and Peugeot engines, entering a slump (1993–1994)===

Honda withdrew from the sport at end of the year. A deal to secure Renault engines fell through, which saw McLaren switching to customer [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] engines for the {{F1|1993}} season.<ref name="Henry 1999 pages=87–88">{{harvnb|Henry|1999|pages=87–88}}</ref> Senna—who initially agreed only to a race-by-race contract before later signing for the whole year<ref>{{harvnb |Rubython|2006|p=282}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb |Rubython|2006|pp=288–289}}</ref>—won five races, including a record-breaking sixth victory at [[1993 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and a win at the [[1993 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]], where he went from fifth to first on opening lap.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|pages=89–91}}</ref> His team-mate, 1991 [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] champion [[Michael Andretti]], fared much worse: he scored only seven points, and was replaced by test driver [[Mika Häkkinen]] for the final three rounds of the season.<ref>{{harvnb |Rubython|2006|p=290}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/1246610.stm |title=Andretti in Indy 500 return |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=27 March 2001 |accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> Williams ultimately won both titles and Senna—who had flirted with moving there for 1993—signed with them for the {{F1|1994}} season.<ref name="Henry 1999 pages=87–88"/><ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=95}}</ref> During the 1993 season McLaren took part in a seven part [[BBC Television]] documentary called ''[[A Season With McLaren]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4f4ba3afda47b |title=The TEAM&nbsp;– A SEASON WITH MCLAREN |work=British Film Institute Film & TV Database |accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref>

McLaren tested a [[Lamborghini]] V12 engine ahead of the {{F1|1994}} season, as part of a prospective deal with then-Lamborghini owner [[Chrysler]], before eventually deciding to use [[Peugeot]] engines. Thus powered, the [[McLaren MP4/9|MP4/9]] was driven by Häkkinen and [[Martin Brundle]], but no wins resulted, and Peugeot was dropped after a single year in favour of a [[Mercedes-Benz]]-branded, [[Ilmor]]-designed engine.<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|pages=95–101}}</ref>

===Mercedes power (1995–2014)===
The alliance with Mercedes started slowly: {{F1|1995}}'s [[McLaren MP4/10|MP4/10]] car was not a front-runner and Brundle's replacement, former champion [[Nigel Mansell]], was unable to fit into the car at first and departed after just two races, with [[Mark Blundell]] taking his place.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/mansell-faces-retirement-after-mclaren-exit-1620932.html |title=Mansell faces retirement after McLaren exit |first=Derick |last=Allsop |work=The Independent |location=UK  | date=24 May 1995 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref>

While Williams dominated in {{f1|1996}}, McLaren, now with [[David Coulthard]] alongside Häkkinen,<ref>{{harvnb|Henry|1999|page=104}}</ref> went a third successive season without a win. In {{F1|1997}}, however, Coulthard broke this run by winning the season-opening [[1997 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]; Häkkinen and he would each win another race before the end of the season, and highly rated designer [[Adrian Newey]] joined the team from Williams in August that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/1361946.stm |title=Newey's magic touch |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=2 June 2001 |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> Despite the car's improved pace, unreliability proved costly throughout the season, with retirements at the [[1997 British Grand Prix|British]] and [[1997 Luxembourg Grand Prix|Luxembourg]] Grands Prix occurring whilst Häkkinen was in the lead.

====Resurgence with Adrian Newey (1998–2006)====
With Newey able to take advantage of new technical regulations for {{F1|1998}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00289.html |title=The 1998 Formula 1 cars |first=Peter |last=Wright |date=8 March 1998 |publisher=grandprix.com |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref> and with Williams losing their works Renault engines, McLaren were once again able to challenge for the championship; ''[[F1 Racing]]'' magazine stated that the only way to increase their championship hopes was to hire Ferrari's double champion [[Michael Schumacher]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[F1 Racing]] |date=December 1997}}</ref> Häkkinen and Coulthard won five of the first six races despite the banning of the team's [[McLaren MP4/12|"brake steer"]] system, which allowed the rear brakes to be operated individually to reduce [[understeer]], after a protest by Ferrari at the second race in [[1998 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite news |first = Matt |last = Bishop |title = Pedal to Metal |work=The Best of F1 Racing 1996–2006 | page = 66}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-no-brake-in-mclaren-routine-1153193.html |title=Motor Racing: No brake in McLaren routine |first=David |last=Tremayne |authorlink=David Tremayne |work=The Independent |location=UK  |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tremayne|Hughes|1998|page=232}}</ref> Schumacher and Ferrari provided the greatest competition, the former levelled on points with Häkkinen with two races to go, but wins for Häkkinen at the [[1998 Luxembourg Grand Prix|Luxembourg]] and [[1998 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese]] Grands Prix gave both him the drivers' championship and McLaren the constructors' championship. Häkkinen won his second drivers' championship the [[1999 Formula One season|following season]], but due to a combination of driver errors and mechanical failures, the team lost the constructors' title to Ferrari.

[[File:Mclaren racing usgp 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Mechanics push [[Kimi Räikkönen]]'s MP4-19 into the garage during qualifying for the [[United States Grand Prix|US Grand Prix]] at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] in 2004.]]

The year {{f1|2000}} was not a repeat of recent successes: McLaren won seven races in a close fight with Ferrari, but ultimately Ferrari and Schumacher prevailed in both competitions. This marked the start of a decline in form as Ferrari cemented their position at the head of Formula One. In {{F1|2001}}, Häkkinen was outscored by Coulthard for the first time since 1997 and retired (ending Formula One's longest ever driver partnership), his place taken by [[Kimi Räikkönen]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2152164.stm|title=Hakkinen announces retirement|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 July 2002|accessdate=7 April 2010}}</ref> then in {{f1|2002}}, Coulthard took their solitary win at [[2002 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] while Ferrari repeated McLaren's 1988 feat of 15 wins in a season.

The year {{F1|2003}} started very promisingly, with one win each for Coulthard and Räikkönen at the first two Grands Prix. However, they were hampered when the [[McLaren MP4-18|MP4-18]] car designed for that year suffered crash test and reliability problems, forcing them to use a 'D' development of the year-old [[McLaren MP4-17|MP4-17]].<ref name="boldnewdawn">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3342535.stm|title=Bold new dawn for McLaren|first=Andrew|last=Benson|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 December 2003|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> Despite this, Räikkönen scored points consistently and challenged for the championship up to the final race, eventually losing by two points. The team began [[2004 Formula One season|2004]] with the [[McLaren MP4-19|MP4-19]], which technical director Adrian Newey described as "a debugged version of [the MP4-18]".<ref name="boldnewdawn"/> It was not a success, though, and was replaced mid-season by the MP4-19B. With this, Räikkönen scored the team's and his only win of the year at the [[2004 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], as McLaren finished fifth in the constructors' championship, their worst ranking since 1983.

Coulthard left for [[Red Bull Racing]] in {{F1|2005}} to be replaced by former CART champion [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] for what was McLaren's most successful season in several years as he and Räikkönen won ten races. However, the unreliability of the [[McLaren MP4-20|MP4-20]] cost a number of race victories when Räikkönen had been leading or in contention to win allowing Renault and their driver [[Fernando Alonso]] to capitalise and win both titles.
[[File:Lap4 Canada2005 Raikkonen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kimi Räikkönen]] nearly won the drivers' championship in {{F1|2005}}.]]
In {{f1|2006}}, the team failed to build on the previous year's good form as the superior reliability and speed of the Ferraris and Renaults prevented the team from gaining any victories for the first time in a decade. Montoya parted company acrimoniously with the team to race in [[NASCAR]] after the [[2006 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], where he crashed into Räikkönen at the start; test driver [[Pedro de la Rosa]] deputised for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5168206.stm|title=McLaren agree to release Montoya|date=11 July 2006|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref> The team also lost Räikkönen to Ferrari at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5332710.stm|title=Ferrari reveal Raikkonen signing|date=10 September 2006|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref>

[[Steve Matchett]] argued that the poor reliability of McLaren in 2006 and recent previous years was due to a lack of team continuity and stability.<ref name="f1june2007">{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Matchett|authorlink=Steve Matchett|title=No-catch 22|work=[[F1 Racing]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Publishing]]|pages=58–63|date=June 2007}}</ref> His cited examples of instability are logistical challenges related to the move to the [[McLaren Technology Centre]], Adrian Newey's aborted move to [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]] and later move to Red Bull, the subsequent move of Newey's deputy to Red Bull, and personnel changes at Ilmor.<ref name="f1june2007"/>

In {{f1|2008}}, a close fight ensued between Hamilton and the Ferraris of [[Felipe Massa]] and Räikkönen; Hamilton won five times and despite also crossing the finish line first at the [[2008 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], he was deemed to have gained an illegal advantage by cutting a chicane during an overtake and was controversially demoted to third.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article4703540.ece|title=World media bemused by Lewis Hamilton decision |first=Ben |last=Smith |date=8 September 2008|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=21 March 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081202091153/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article4703540.ece|archivedate=2 December 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Going into the [[2008 Brazilian Grand Prix|final race in Brazil]], Hamilton had a seven-point lead over Massa.

Despite winning his first Grand Prix in [[2008 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], Kovalainen finished the season only seventh in the overall standings, allowing Ferrari to take the constructors' title.

Before the start of the [[2009 Formula One season|2009 season]], Dennis retired as team principal, handing responsibility to [[Martin Whitmarsh]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Ron Dennis leaves McLaren in safe hands|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article5531559.ece|date=16 January 2009|work=The Times|location=UK|first=Kevin|last=Eason|accessdate=11 November 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110604150551/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article5531559.ece|archivedate=4 June 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref> but the year started badly: the [[McLaren MP4-24|MP4-24]] car was off the pace and the team was given a three-race suspended ban for misleading stewards at the [[2009 Australian Grand Prix|Australian]] and [[2009 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysian]] Grands Prix.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8024661.stm|title=McLaren given suspended race ban|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 April 2009|accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref> Despite these early problems, a late revival had Hamilton win at the [[2009 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian]] and [[2009 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]] Grands Prix. McLaren signed that year's champion, [[Jenson Button]], to replace Kovalainen alongside Hamilton in {{f1|2010}}.<ref name="Button">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8363892.stm|title=Button joins Hamilton at McLaren|first=Andrew|last=Benson|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 November 2009|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

Button won twice (in [[2010 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] and [[2010 Chinese Grand Prix|China]]) and Hamilton three times (in [[2010 Turkish Grand Prix|Turkey]], [[2010 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], and [[2010 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]]), but they and McLaren failed to win their respective championships, that year's [[McLaren MP4-25|MP4-25]] largely outpaced by Red Bull's [[Red Bull RB6|RB6]].

Hamilton and Button remained with the team into {{F1|2011}}, with Hamilton winning three races&nbsp;– [[2011 Chinese Grand Prix|China]], [[2011 German Grand Prix|Germany]], and [[2011 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi]] and Button also winning three races&nbsp;– [[2011 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], [[2011 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], and [[2011 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]. Button finished the driver's championship in second place with 270 points behind 2011 Drivers' Champion [[Sebastian Vettel]] of [[Red Bull Racing]], ahead of Hamilton's 227 points. McLaren were second in the Constructors' Championship to Red Bull Racing.

In 2012, McLaren won the first race of the year in [[2012 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] with a 1–3 finish for Button and Hamilton, while Hamilton went on to win in [[2012 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], but by the mid-way mark of the season at the team's home race at Silverstone, the McLaren cars managed only eighth place (Hamilton) and 10th place (Button), while the drivers' and constructors' championships were being dominated by Red Bull Racing and Ferrari, whose cars occupied the first four places of the {{F1 GP|2012|British}}, this was partially due to pit stop problems and Button's loss of form after not working as well with the new car as Hamilton and the car not adapting to the Pirelli tyres. The car also suffered reliability problems which cost the team and its drivers numerous potential points, most notably in [[2012 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]] and [[2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi]], where Hamilton had been leading from the front in both races.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/20193556|title=Abu Dhabi GP: Lewis Hamilton says McLaren not good enough|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=4 November 2012|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref>

===Return to Honda power (2015–)===
[[File:McLaren duo 2015 Malaysia Race.jpg|thumb|Alonso (no.14) and Button (no.22) line astern at the [[2015 Malaysian Grand Prix]]]]
For {{F1|2015}}, McLaren ended their engine deal with Mercedes and reforged their historical partnership with Honda. After a prolonged period, the team announced both Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button as their race drivers, with Kevin Magnussen demoted to test driver. During pre-season testing at the [[Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya]] in February, Alonso suffered a concussion and, as a result, [[Kevin Magnussen]] replaced him for the season opening {{F1 GP|2015|Australian}} in March. At that inaugural race for the new partnership, Button's Honda-powered car was lapped twice<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grandprix.com.au/2015/results/sunday |title=2015 Results - Sunday Tab |work=grandprix.com.au |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20150316141433/http://grandprix.com.au/2015/results/sunday |deadurl=yes |archivedate=16 March 2015}}</ref> and finished last, that being the McLaren-Honda's longest stint of running to that date. Following considerable unreliability and initial suggestions that the Honda engine was underpowered relative to its competitors, steady performance gains eventually resulted in Jenson Button managing to score McLaren-Honda's first (four) points at the [[2015 Monaco Grand Prix]], the team's sixth race.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/119151 | title = Jenson Button proud of first McLaren 2015 F1 points in Monaco GP| publisher = Autosport | date = 25 May 2015}}</ref> By contrast, Alonso scored his first point a further three races later at the [[2015 British Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/race/r925racenotes.html|title=Race Notes > Sunday -  British GP > F1 2015|work=Grandprix.com}}</ref>

==Racing history: other series==

===Can-Am===

[[File:McLaren M1A at Silverstone.jpg|thumb|right|The McLaren M1A [[sports car racing|sports car]] of 1964 was the team's first self-designed car. The 'B' version raced in [[Can-Am]] in [[1966 Can-Am season|1966]].]]

McLaren's first sports-racing car was the Group 7 M1&nbsp;– with a small-block Chevrolet engine in a modified Elva chassis. The car was raced in North America and Europe in 1963 and 1964 in various G7 and United States Road Racing Championship events. For the Can-Am Series, which started in 1966, McLaren created the M3 which Bruce and [[Chris Amon]] drove&nbsp;– customer cars also appeared in a number of races in the [[1966 Can-Am season|1966 season]]. With the M3, they led two races, but scored no wins, and the inaugural title was taken by John Surtees in a Lola T70. The following year, Robin Herd purpose-designed the [[Chevrolet]] V8-powered [[McLaren M6A|M6A]], delays with the Formula One programme allowing the team to spend extra resources on developing the Can-Am car which was the first to be painted in McLaren orange. With Denny Hulme now partnering Bruce, they won five of six races and Bruce won the championship, setting the pattern for the next four years. In [[1968 Can-Am season|1968]], they used a new car, the M8, to win four races; non-works McLarens took the other two, but this time Hulme was victorious overall. In [[1969 Can-Am season|1969]], McLaren domination became total as they won all 11 races with the M8B; Hulme won five, and Bruce won six and the driver's championship.<ref name="clockworkorange">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruce-mclaren.com/the-racing-team/articles/clockwork-orange-mclaren-domination.html |title=

McLaren's success in Can-Am brought with it financial rewards, both prize money and money from selling cars to other teams, that helped to support the team and fund the nascent and relatively poor-paying Formula One programme.<ref name="clockworkorange"/><ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|page=36}}</ref>

[[File:McLarenM8D.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce McLaren was killed testing a McLaren M8D at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] in 1970.]]
When Bruce was killed testing the [[1970 Can-Am season|1970 season]]'s M8D, he was at first replaced by [[Dan Gurney]], then later by [[Peter Gethin]]. They won two and one races, respectively, while Hulme won six on the way to the championship. Private teams competing in the 1970 Can-Am series included older M3Bs as well as the M12&nbsp;– the customer version of the team's M8B. In [[1971 Can-Am season|1971]], the team held off the challenge of 1969 world champion [[Jackie Stewart]] in the [[Lola Cars|Lola]] T260, winning eight races, with Peter Revson taking the title. Hulme also won three Can-Am races in [[1972 Can-Am season|1972]], but the [[McLaren M20]] was defeated by the [[Porsche 917]]/10s of [[Mark Donohue]] and [[George Follmer]]. Faced by the greater resources of Porsche, McLaren decided to abandon Can-Am at the end of 1972 and focus solely on [[open wheel car|open-wheel racing]].<ref name="clockworkorange"/> When the original Can-Am series ceased at the end of [[1974 Can-Am season|1974]], McLaren were by far the most successful constructor with 43 wins.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2009|page=301}}</ref>

===Indianapolis 500===

[[File:1973RevsonIndyMcLaren.jpg|thumb|right|The McLaren M16C was driven by Peter Revson in the [[1972 Indianapolis 500]]]]
McLaren first contested the [[United States Auto Club]]'s (USAC) Indianapolis 500 race in [[1970 Indianapolis 500|1970]], encouraged by their tyre supplier [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], which wanted to break competitor [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]]'s stranglehold on the event. With the M15 car, Bruce, Chris Amon, and Denny Hulme entered, but after Amon withdrew and Hulme was severely burned on the hands in an incident in practice, Peter Revson and [[Carl Williams (driver)|Carl Williams]] took their places in the race to retire and finish seventh, respectively. The team also contested some of the more prestigious races in the USAC championship that year, as they would do in subsequent years.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|pages=125–128}}</ref> For 1971 they had a new car, the M16, which driver Mark Donohue said "...obsoleted every other car on track..." At that year's Indianapolis 500, Revson qualified on pole and finished second, whilst in [[1972 Indianapolis 500|1972]], Donohue won in [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateer]] [[Team Penske]]'s M16B.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|pages=136–137}}</ref> The [[1973 Indianapolis 500|1973]] event had [[Johnny Rutherford]] join the team; he qualified on pole, but finished ninth, Revson crashed out.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|page=143}}</ref> McLaren won their first Indianapolis 500 in [[1974 Indianapolis 500|1974]] with Rutherford.

The team did not reproduce their recent success at Indianapolis in [[1977 Indianapolis 500|1977]], [[1978 Indianapolis 500|1978]], or [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979]], and although they continued to win other USAC races, by the end of 1979, they decided to end their involvement.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|pages=146–148}}</ref>

In the mid-1990s, McLaren Racing's sister company, McLaren Cars (now McLaren Automotive) built a racing version of their [[McLaren F1|F1]] road car, the [[McLaren F1 GTR|F1 GTR]] which won the [[1995 24 Hours of Le Mans]] and the 1995 and 1996 [[BPR Global GT Series]].<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080711152838/www.mclarenautomotive.com/cars/f1gtr_introduction.htm |title=McLAREN F1 GTR RACE CAR&nbsp;– INTRODUCTION |publisher=mclarenautomotive.com |url=http://www.mclarenautomotive.com/cars/f1gtr_introduction.htm |archivedate=22 August 2008 |accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref> More recently, a [[FIA GT3|GT3]] version of their new [[McLaren MP4-12C|MP4-12C]] road car was announced, and will be entered by CRS Racing in the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mclarengt.com/news-and-events/details/id/8|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20111015003308/http://mclarengt.com/news-and-events/details/id/8|archivedate=15 October 2011|title=New McLaren MP4-12C GT3 breaks cover|work=McLaren GT|publisher=[[McLaren Group]]|date=11 March 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

===Politics===

McLaren has had an uneasy relationship with the Formula One's governing body, the [[FIA]], and its predecessor [[Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]], as well as with the commercial rights holder of the sport. In the early 1980s, McLaren were involved, along with the other teams of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]], in a dispute over control of the sport with FISA and the teams of car manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Renault, and Ferrari. This was known as the [[FISA-FOCA war]] and had a breakaway series threatened, FISA refusing to sanction one race, and another race boycotted by FOCA. It was eventually resolved by a revenue-sharing deal called the [[Concorde Agreement]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tremayne|Hughes|1999|page=114}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Collings|2004|pages=116–117}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Collings|2004|pages=145–148}}</ref> Subsequent Concorde Agreements were signed in 1987 and 1992, but in 1996, McLaren were again one of the teams pitched into dispute over the terms of a new agreement, this time with former FOCA president [[Bernie Ecclestone]]'s [[Formula One Promotions and Administration]] organisation. McLaren rejected the Concorde Agreement of 1997 before signing a new 10-year agreement in 1998.<ref>{{harvnb|Collings|2004|pages=217–224}}</ref> Arguments over the commercial structure and regulations in the sport restarted in the mid-2000s with McLaren and their part-owner Mercedes again amongst teams threatening to start a rival series until 2009 when another Concorde Agreement, effective until the end of 2012, was settled upon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8179661.stm|title=New deal ends F1 breakaway fears|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 August 2009|accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref> In 2007, McLaren were involved in an [[2007 Formula One espionage controversy|espionage controversy]] after their chief designer [[Mike Coughlan]] obtained confidential technical information from Ferrari.

==Sponsorship, naming, and livery==

[[File:Marlboro McLarens Donington.jpg|thumb|right|McLaren's Formula One team was sponsored for 23 years by [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]]'s [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarette brand.]]

McLaren's Formula One team was originally called Bruce McLaren Motor Racing, and for their first season ran white-and-green coloured cars, which came about as a result of a deal with the makers of the film ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]''.<ref name="Colours">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebrucemclarenmovie.com/wscolours.htm |title=The Colours of McLaren |work=The Bruce McLaren Movie Official Website |accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref>

Between {{F1|1968}} and {{F1|1971}}, the team used an orange design, which was also applied to cars competing in the Indianapolis 500 and Can-Am series, and was used as an interim testing livery in later years.<ref name="Colours"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Speed and Power |first=Alexander |last=von Wegner |chapter=Grand Prix Motor Racing |page=77 |publisher=[[Parragon]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-7525-3144-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2006/1/3902.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806204331/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2006/1/3902.html |archivedate=6 August 2014 |title=Orange livery for interim McLaren |work=Formula 1&nbsp;– The Official F1 Website |publisher=[[Formula One]]|date=9 January 2006 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref>

McLaren altered their livery to introduce red into the design, and changed the silver to chrome.

In {{F1|2007}}, McLaren signed a seven-year contract with telecommunications company [[Vodafone]], and became known as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes".<ref>{{cite news| title = McLaren seal deal with Vodafone| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4527512.stm |publisher=BBC Sport | date=  14 December 2005| accessdate =12 April 2007}}</ref> The arrangement was due to last until {{F1|2014}}, although the team announced at the [[2013 Australian Grand Prix]] that their partnership would conclude at the end of the [[2013 Formula One season|2013 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=McLaren to lose Vodafone title sponsorship|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2013/03/14/mclaren-lose-vodafone-title-sponsorship/|first=Keith|last=Collantine|work=F1 Fanatic|publisher=Keith Collantine|date=14 March 2013|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> Despite explaining the decision to conclude the sponsorship as being a result of Vodafone's desire to reconsider its commercial opportunities, it was later reported that the decision to run the [[2012 Bahrain Grand Prix]] in spite of an [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|ongoing civil uprising]] and [[2012 Bahrain Grand Prix protests|protests against the race]], and Vodafone's inability to remove their logos from the McLaren cars during the race as being a key factor in the decision to terminate the sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bahrain violence convinces Vodafone to end its F1 deal|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/leisure/article3713073.ece|first=Nic|last=Fildes|work=[[The Times]]|date=14 March 2013|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>

McLaren's early cars were named simply with the letter M followed by a number and sometimes a letter denoting the model.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|loc=Appendix 1}}</ref> Since the 1981 merger with Project Four, the cars have been called "MP4/x", or since 2001 "MP4-x",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mclaren.com/historyofmclaren/timeline_00s.php |title=History of McLaren&nbsp;– Timeline&nbsp;– The 2000s |publisher=mclaren.com |accessdate=29 December 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080103005051/http://www.mclaren.com/historyofmclaren/timeline_00s.php| archivedate=3 January 2008}}</ref> where x is the generation of the chassis (e.g. [[McLaren MP4/1|MP4/1]], [[McLaren MP4-22|MP4-22]]).

Since the change of title sponsor in 1997, "MP4" is now said to stand for "'''M'''cLaren '''P'''roject '''4'''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnstar.com/formula1/formula1_teamdetails_2.html |title=Formula One Teams Profile: McLaren |publisher=espnstar.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070429214801/http://www.espnstar.com/formula1/formula1_teamdetails_2.html |archivedate=29 April 2007 |accessdate=12 April 2007 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref> 

At the end of 2015, it was announced that McLaren were due to lose sponsor Tag Heuer to Red Bull Racing. McLaren chief Ron Dennis later admitted to falling out with Tag Heuer CEO Jean-Claude Biver.

In 2015 McLaren were without a title sponsor, and set to lose a further £20m in sponsorship in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/11845062/McLaren-set-to-lose-20m-in-sponsorship-next-year.html|title=McLaren set to lose £20m in sponsorship next year|date=4 September 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>
