Contador's career has been marked by doping allegations.  The [[Operación Puerto doping case]] led his {{ct|ONC|2006c}} team (a team restructured to the current Astana team) to withdraw en masse from the [[2006 Tour de France]] before it began. He was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. In September 2010, Contador announced that he had tested positive for [[clenbuterol]] in a control taken during that year's Tour de France, in which he finished as winner, but although he was suspended during an investigation,<ref>{{cite news

== Personal life and early career ==
Contador was born on 6 December 1982 in [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]] in the [[Community of Madrid]], the third of four children. He has an older brother and sister and a younger brother, who has [[cerebral palsy]]. Having previously practised other sports, such as football and athletics, Contador discovered cycling at the age of 14 thanks to his elder brother Francisco Javier.<ref name="biografia">{{cite web

When Contador was 15, he began to compete in races at the amateur level in Spain, joining the Real Velo Club Portillo from Madrid. Although he got no victories that year or the next, he demonstrated great qualities and was soon nicknamed ''Pantani'' (after [[Marco Pantani]], regarded as one of the best climbers of all time) for his climbing skills.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Contador.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|Contador with the Liberty Seguros team in 2006]]
Contador turned professional in 2003 for {{ct|ONC|2003}}. In his first year as a professional he won the eighth stage of the [[Tour de Pologne]], an individual time trial.

On 13 February 2008, the organizer of the Tour de France, the [[Amaury Sport Organisation]], announced that Astana would not be invited to any of their events in 2008 due to the doping previously perpetrated by Astana, despite the fact that its management and most of its ridership had changed before the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web

He went on to win his second [[Vuelta a Castilla y León]], as well as the [[2008 Tour of the Basque Country|Tour of the Basque Country]] by winning the opening stage and the final individual time trial. His next scheduled race and objective was the [[2008 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré|Dauphiné Libéré]] but his team received an invite to the [[2008 Giro d'Italia]] one week prior to the start of the race.

Despite the lack of preparation, he finished second in the first individual time trial and took the [[General classification in the Giro d'Italia|pink jersey]] after the 15th stage up to Passo Fedaia. Upon winning the final pink jersey in Milan, he became the first non-Italian to win the Giro d'Italia since [[Pavel Tonkov]] in [[1996 Giro d'Italia|1996]] and also the second Spanish rider to win the Giro after [[Miguel Indurain]] won in [[1992 Giro d'Italia|1992]] and [[1993 Giro d'Italia|1993]]. He later emphasized the importance of this win by saying that "taking part in the Giro and winning it was a really big achievement, bigger than if I'd had a second victory in the Tour de France".<ref name=GiroYahoo>{{cite web| title=Vuelta a España&nbsp;– Contador plays down favourite tag |publisher=uk.eurosport.yahoo.com |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/29082008/58/vuelta-espana-contador-plays-favourite-tag.html |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=21 September 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907162824/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/29082008/58/vuelta-espana-contador-plays-favourite-tag.html |archivedate = 7 September 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Contador entered the [[2008 Vuelta a España]] as the main candidate to win. His biggest challenger was likely to be compatriot [[Carlos Sastre]], who had won the [[2008 Tour de France|Tour de France]] just a month before.<ref name=GiroYahoo/> Contador won stage 13 by attacking on the fabled [[Alto de El Angliru|Angliru]] climb and this resulted in him capturing the [[General classification in the Vuelta a España|golden jersey]] as the leader of the race. He extended his lead by winning stage 14 to Fuentes de Invierno and maintained his lead in subsequent flat stages and the final time trial. That final time trial was won by Leipheimer by a wide margin. Contador later took some offense to Leipheimer seemingly riding with winning the Vuelta in mind, after it had been established earlier in the race that Contador was Astana's team leader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/news/story?id=3604414

Amidst the clenbuterol controversy, Contador earned his first win in the Vuelta a Murcia. He won the overall classification as well as two stage victories en route to his victory. Later in the month of March, Contador entered in the [[2011 Volta a Catalunya|Volta a Catalunya]], where he claimed a win on the third stage to [[Vallnord]], maintaining his advantage until the end of the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/27032011/2/cycling-contador-wins-tour-catalunya.html|work=[[Yahoo!]] [[Eurosport]]|publisher=[[TF1 Group]]|date=27 March 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011|title=Contador wins Tour of Catalunya|agency=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> He also won the individual time trial of [[Vuelta a Castilla y León]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Contador competed in the [[2011 Giro d'Italia]], his first time racing in the Giro since his victory in [[2008 Giro d'Italia|2008]]. Contador won the [[2011 Giro d'Italia, Stage 1 to Stage 11#Stage 9|ninth stage]] on [[Mount Etna]], his first stage win at the Italian Grand Tour. He attacked mid way through the climb, dropping his overall rivals and gaining almost a minute on them. That stage gave him the overall lead in the Giro, as well as the points classification. Contador extended his overall lead to 3 minutes over second place Vincenzo Nibali where he broke away with Jose Rujano on the Grossglockner. He solidified his lead through stage 14 up the Zoncolan and a very difficult stage 15 through the Dolomites taking his lead up the 4 minutes ahead of second place Scarponi. He also won the {{convert|12.7|km|1|abbr=on}} mountain time-trial to Nevegal.

=== 2012 season ===
Contador started his season with still no verdict in the clenbuterol case. He finished second overall in the [[2012 Tour de San Luis|Tour de San Luis]] and he won both uphill finishes. He only fell short in the time trial stage of the race. On 6 February he was stripped of these early results, as well the [[2010 Tour de France]] and [[2011 Giro d'Italia]] wins and many other victories. He was also suspended until 5 August 2012 and his contract with {{ct|SAX|2012a}} was annulled.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 2013, Contador's only victory was a stage in the [[2013 Tour de San Luis|Tour de San Luis]] in January. From then on, his season did not go as expected: though finishing 3rd in the [[2013 Tirreno–Adriatico|Tirreno–Adriatico]] he became ill during the race. This disrupted his preparations for the rest of the season. Contador returned to racing in the [[2013 Tour of the Basque Country|Tour of the Basque Country]] in April and finished fifth in the general classification. He was too late to be in optimal condition for the [[2013 Tour de France|Tour de France]], where he could not match up to [[Chris Froome]] and finished in fourth place.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2013/11/news/alberto-contador-wraps-up-camp-sets-big-goals-for-2014_310255|title=Alberto Contador wraps up camp, sets big goals for 2014|work=VeloNews|date=30 November 2013|accessdate=12 April 2014|publisher=[[Competitor Group, Inc.]]}}</ref>

=== 2014 season ===
[[File:Critérium du Dauphiné 2014 - Etape 6 - Alberto Contador.jpg|thumbnail|left|Contador at the [[2014 Critérium du Dauphiné]]]]
After a disappointing 2013 season, Contador went into the season trying to find the form that allowed him to take numerous victories in the past. Contador's first objective of the season was the [[2014 Volta ao Algarve|Volta ao Algarve]]. Although he would lose time to [[Michał Kwiatkowski]] after the Pole took two consecutive stage wins, Contador showed his much improving form in the race, taking third in the second stage and fourth in the third stage [[individual time trial]] before taking his first win of the season on the fourth stage. In the stage featuring a summit finish at Alto do Malhao, Contador attacked a kilometer from the finish as he eventually soloed to the stage win, three seconds ahead of [[Rui Costa (cyclist)|Rui Costa]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/volta-ao-algarve-2014/stage-4/results|title=Contador wins Algarve stage atop Alto do Malhao|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=22 February 2014|accessdate=23 February 2014}}</ref> He would eventually finish second overall, 19 seconds down on Kwiatkowski.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Contador's next race was the [[2014 Tirreno-Adriatico|Tirreno-Adriatico]] where he faced a stiffer competition with riders such as [[Nairo Quintana]] and [[Jean-Christophe Péraud]]. He continued to show his strong form by winning the third stage of the race going to [[Cittareale]] after he outsprinted Quintana, his main rival for the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stage 4: Indicatore (Arezzo) to Cittareale (Selva Rotonda)|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/TirrenoAdriatico/it/download/info_tappe/4/T04_alt.pdf|work=[[Tirreno–Adriatico]]|publisher=[[RCS Sport]]|accessdate=12 March 2014|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref> He would take the lead in the general classification on the next day, winning a second successive stage as he attacked on the stage's penultimate climb before soloing to the finish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stage 5: Amatrice to Guardiagrele|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/TirrenoAdriatico/it/download/info_tappe/5/T05_alt.pdf|work=[[Tirreno–Adriatico]]|publisher=[[RCS Sport]]|accessdate=12 March 2014|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref> He would go on to keep his lead as he won the race in dominant fashion, finishing more than two minutes clear ahead of runner-up Quintana.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Contador would race the [[2014 Volta a Catalunya|Volta a Catalunya]] next, where he would have his first duel with riders such as [[Chris Froome]] and [[Joaquim Rodríguez]]. On the race's first mountain stage, he would follow attacks set by his fellow GC contenders before he had to settle for second in the stage, 5 seconds behind Rodríguez.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stage 3: Banyoles to La Molina|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/volta-ciclista-a-catalunya-2014/stage-3|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> He would finish the race in second place overall, just 4 seconds behind Rodríguez.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tinkoffsaxo.com/news/alberto-finished-second-overall-catalunya/|title=Alberto finished second overall in Catalunya|work={{ct|SAX|2014}}|publisher=Tinkoff Sport|date=30 March 2014|accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref>

Contador's next objective for the season was the [[2014 Tour of the Basque Country|Tour of the Basque Country]]. He would get into a duel with fellow Spaniard [[Alejandro Valverde]] and both riders did not disappoint on the first stage. Contador followed Valverde's attack on the stage's last climb before putting on an attack that Valverde was not able to answer. He would negotiate the descent and solo to the stage win and yellow jersey, 14 seconds ahead of Valverde. He would keep the race lead to the end, finishing second on the final stage time trial and winning the race by 49 seconds ahead of Michał Kwiatkowski.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tinkoffsaxo.com/news/contador-wins-vuelta-pais-vasco/|title=Contador wins Vuelta Pais Vasco|work={{ct|SAX|2014}}|publisher=Tinkoff Sport|date=12 April 2014|accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref>

As his final preparation for the Tour de France, Contador entered the [[2014 Critérium du Dauphiné|Critérium du Dauphiné]] where he would duel with Froome and [[Vincenzo Nibali]], his main rivals for the Tour. Contador started the Dauphiné on good form, finishing second to Froome on the race's short individual time trial before dueling with Froome on the [[Olliergues|Col du Béal]]. Unlike in 2013 where he was unable to follow the accelerations of Froome, Contador was able to stay on his rival's wheel, eventually finishing second on the stage after Froome outsprinted him to the line. He would have his next duel with Froome on the seventh stage, the queen stage of the race. Contador attacked with two kilometers left on the stage and Froome (who was suffering from the effects of a crash on the previous day's stage) wasn't able to bridge the gap to him as Contador took the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. However, Contador would fall victim to an ambush on the next stage as several riders in the top ten went into the breakaway including [[Andrew Talansky]], who was just sitting in third place in the GC, 39 seconds behind Contador. Contador was left isolated with no team-mates around him as he tried to bridge the gap to the leading group but he ran out of steam as Talansky won the race overall. However, Contador would deal a psychological blow to Froome ahead of the Tour as Froome struggled in the stage, eventually dropping to 12th place overall in the GC.
[[File:Contador after his Tour de France 2014 crash.jpg|thumb|Contador after his 2014 Tour de France crash, going to a medical facility with crutches]]
In the [[2014 Tour de France|Tour de France]], Contador entered the race in much better form. He would avoid crashing during the first week but he lost a lot of time in the fifth stage of the race, the stage featuring cobbles as part of the route. He lost around 2 and a half minutes to fellow GC contender, Nibali, as he was unable to bridge the gap to him after mud became stuck in his gears. On the Tour's first summit finish going to [[Gérardmer]], he attacked as Nibali went with him. Contador made a final acceleration near the finish line as he took 3 seconds back on Nibali. However, disaster struck him on the 10th stage. On the descent of the [[Petit Ballon]], Contador crashed heavily before he was treated on the side of the road.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cary|first1=Tom|title=Alberto Contador crashes out as Vincenzo Nibali takes Stage 10 and yellow jersey|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/tour-de-france/10967088/Tour-de-France-2014-Alberto-Contador-crashes-out-as-Vincenzo-Nibali-takes-Stage-10-and-yellow-jersey.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=14 July 2014}}</ref> He tried to ride for nearly 20&nbsp;kilometers after the crash but he eventually abandoned the Tour.

His Vuelta would have a good start as his team, {{ct|SAX|2014}}, finished eight in the opening team time trial, 19 seconds behind the {{ct|MOV|2014}}, the team which also fielded fellow GC contenders, Quintana and Valverde. On the race's first mountain stage to [[La Zubia]], he was able to stay with the GC contenders as he eventually finished the stage in third place behind Froome and Valverde. He would show his improving form on the next mountain stage to [[Valdelinares]], attacking with around two kilometers to go while dropping Froome and Valverde among others as he sat 3 seconds behind red jersey holder Quintana before the individual time trial. He would take the red jersey on the individual time trial as he finished fourth. He showed he could defend the red jersey by staying with his fellow GC contenders. On the race's queen stage to [[Somiedo Natural Park|La Farrapona]], he followed Froome's attack with 4 kilometers to go while distancing other GC contenders. He stayed in his rival's wheel before putting on a finishing kick with around 800 meters to go, winning the stage and strengthening his hold on the red jersey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2014/09/news/alberto-contador-drives-stake-vuelta_344601|title=Alberto Contador drives stake into Vuelta a España|work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc.|date= September 2014|accessdate=8 September 2014|author=Andrew Hood}}</ref> The same thing happened on the penultimate stage to [[Candín|Puerto de Ancares]] where he followed Froome throughout the climb, distancing other GC contenders once again before kicking on to take the stage, all but securing the red jersey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/vuelta-a-espana-2014/stage-20/results|title=Vuelta a España: Contador wins on Ancares|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=13 September 2014|accessdate=13 September 2014|author=Peter Cossins}}</ref> On the final stage individual time trial, he rode conservatively on wet conditions to avoid any mishaps and though he lost time to the other favorites, he had more than enough time in hand to win his third Vuelta.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/vuelta-a-espana-2014/stage-21/results|title=Contador seals overall 2014 Vuelta a España victory|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=14 September 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Giro 2015 contador.jpg|thumbnail|right|Contador wearing the Maglia Rosa at the [[2015 Giro d'Italia]]]]
At the Giro d'Italia, Contador's Tinkoff Saxo team performed well in the opening Team Time Trial, finishing 2nd to Orica Greenedge. He gained 6 seconds on Fabio Aru, 12 seconds on Rigoberto Uran, and 20 seconds on Richie Porte <ref>http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/contador-ahead-of-giro-ditalia-rivals-in-opening-ttt-skirmish</ref>
Contador took the Maglia Rosa on the summit finish on stage 5 to Abetone. However, the next day, Contador dislocated his shoulder after crashing on the finishing straight. He was able to finish but dislocated the shoulder again before the podium presentation.<ref>http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/contador-confirmed-to-start-giro-ditalia-stage-7</ref>
Despite this, Contador was able to continue in the race held on to the Maglia Rosa. However, on stage 13, on what most would have assumed was an "easy day" of racing, Contador crashed in a pile-up, 3.2 kilometers from the finish. Because of this, Contador crossed the line 42 seconds behind the finishers as well as his main rival [[Fabio Aru]], thus losing his pink jersey, the first time he lost the leader's jersey in any Grand Tour up to that point in his career.<ref>https://sport360.com/article/cycling/37091/fabio-aru-takes-pink-jersey-alberto-contador-caught-giro-ditalia-crash</ref> However the next day, on a 59.3 kilometer time trial, Contador led the field, taking back the pink jersey and created a sizable time difference over the rest of the ''peloton''.<ref>http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/giro-ditalia/alberto-contador-back-in-giro-ditalia-lead-after-crucial-time-trial-173347</ref><ref>http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/cycling/2015/05/23/contador-reclaims-giro-lead--aru-after-time-trial/27838333/</ref> On stage 16, Contador suffered a mechanical problem on the descent of Apria and other teams including Astana tried to take advantage. Still, Contador made contact with Aru at the [[Passo del Mortirolo]] and put another two minutes into his rival as [[Mikel Landa]] became the second-placed rider on the general classification.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingquotes.com/news/amazing_landa_makes_it_two_in_a_row_in_the_queen_stage/|title=Amazing Landa makes it two in a row in the queen stage|work=Cycling Quotes|publisher=CyclingQuotes.com 2013|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=27 May 2015|author=Emil Axelgaard}}</ref> On Stage 20, Contador lost some time to both Landa and Aru but retained his pink jersey.

In preparation for the Tour, Contador chose to ride the four-day [[Route du Sud]], where he won the queen stage and the overall classification. His main rival was [[Nairo Quintana]], a competitor he will have to contend with at the Tour de France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/route-du-sud-win-changes-nothing-says-contador|title=Route du Sud win changes nothing, says Contador|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=22 June 2015|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref>

Contador had solid opening to the first week of the tour. Despite losing a little time to Chris Froome in the Team Time Trial, he gained time on his rivals including Nibali and Quintana who both lost time on stage 2. He struggled though on the opening summit finish losing 3 minutes to stage winner Chris Froome putting a serious hurt to his victory chances. Despite this setback he improved on the next two Pyrennean stages staying in contact with his big rivals where he also remained 6th overall. His chances faded after he crashed on the descent of the Colle d'Allos on stage 17. Despite a hard effort on the finishing climb after, he lost over 2 minutes to Froome and Quintana. He was unable to recover from his crash on stage 17 and his efforts in the Giro which made him unable to match his rivals on the last 2 mountain stages. Contador finished the [[2015 Tour de France]] in fifth place, 9'48<nowiki>''</nowiki> minutes down on winner [[Chris Froome]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Classifications|url=http://www.letour.fr/le-tour/2015/us/classifications.html|publisher=ASO|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> Though he failed to achieve the double in the end, Contador had no regrets over his attempt. “It’s true that there are riders that would dream of finishing fifth. For me that was not my objective but I’m glad that I tried. If I hadn’t tried then after my career I might have wondered whether I could have done the Giro-Tour double and now I know. I don’t think it’s impossible to do the double but it’s really complicated because nobody has the experience on how to prepare it. However, I prefer having tried than being left with a desire to do it.”<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pretot|first1=Julien|title=Contador double bid fizzles out after Giro exertions|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-tour-contador-idUSKCN0Q00QJ20150726|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=7 March 2016|date=26 July 2015}}</ref>

== Doping ==

=== Operation Puerto ===
After final rosters had been presented for the 2006 Tour de France, Contador and five other members of the Astana-Würth team were barred from competing due to alleged connections with the [[Operación Puerto doping case]]. Contador and four other members of his team at the time, {{ct|ONC|2006c}}, were eventually cleared of all charges on 26 July 2006 by the Spanish courts and later two out of the five (including Contador) were cleared by the UCI.<ref name="libertyfive" /> Each received a written document signed by Manuel Sánchez Martín, secretary for the Spanish court, stating that "there are not any type of charges against them nor have there been adopted any type of legal action against them."<ref name="astanaclear">{{cite news |title=Astana 5' cleared by Spanish courts |author=Andrew Hood |url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2006/07/road/wednesdays-eurofile-astana-5-cleared-by-spanish-courts-landis-sets-post-tour-schedule_10588 |publisher=VeloNews |date=26 July 2006}}</ref>

In May 2006, a document from the summary of the investigation (''Documento 31'') was released. In it, the initials "A.C." were associated with a hand-written note saying, "''Nada o igual a J.J.''" (Spanish for "Nothing or the same as J.J."). J.J. were the initials of [[Jörg Jaksche]], who later admitted to being guilty of [[blood doping]] prepared by the Spanish doctor [[Eufemiano Fuentes]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite news

=== 2010 Tour de France ===
In September 2010, Contador revealed that a urine sample he had given on 21 July, a rest day in the [[2010 Tour de France]], had contained traces of [[clenbuterol]].

There has been some scepticism of Contador's claim that contaminated meat was to blame. In 2008 and 2009, only one animal sample came back positive for clenbuterol out of 83,203 animal samples tested by EU member nations. Out of 19,431 animal tests in Spain over the same period, there were no samples that came back positive for clenbuterol.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/feb/08/alberto-contador-defence-doping-ban |title=Alberto Contador submits final defence to overturn proposed doping ban |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>
Contador's urine sample, taken during the day before his clenbuterol positive sample, was reported to contain plastic residue indicating possible [[blood doping]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Macur|first=Juliet|title=2nd Failed Test Puts Heat on Contador|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/sports/cycling/05cycling.html|accessdate=19 February 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 October 2010}}</ref> but the test is not recognised by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], so no charges in relation to this finding were brought. A theory has circulated that blood doping could account for the minute traces if the clenbuterol was introduced through a transfusion of already contaminated blood, rather than ingestion or injection.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-10-01/sports/27076906_1_alberto-contador-clenbuterol-tour-de-france-title |title=Experts mixed on Alberto Contador's tainted beef defense for positive Clenbuterol test during Tour |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2011 |location=New York |work=Daily News}}</ref>

The UCI issued a statement reporting that the concentration was 50 [[picogram]]s per millilitre, and that this was 400 times below the minimum standards of detection capability required by [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]], and that further scientific investigation would be required. Contador was provisionally suspended from competition, although this had no short-term effect as he had already finished his racing programme for the 2010 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/30092010/58/contador-suspended-positive-test.html |title=Contador suspended after positive test&nbsp;– Yahoo!

Contador had been informed of the results over a month earlier, on 24 August.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11441045 |title=BBC News&nbsp;– Tour de France winner Alberto Contador tests positive |publisher=BBC  |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=30 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100930040148/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11441045| archivedate= 30 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Later the amount discovered was clarified as 40 times below the minimum standards, rather than the 400 times originally reported by the UCI. Contador's scientific adviser claimed that he would have needed 180 times the amount detected to gain any benefit in his performance.<ref>{{cite news |title=Contador's scientific expert De Boer details defense |author=Weislo, Laura |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/contadors-scientific-expert-de-boer-details-defense |work=Cyclingnews |date=30 September 2010}}</ref>

In late January 2011, the Spanish Cycling Federation ([[Royal Spanish Cycling Federation|RFEC]]) proposed a one-year ban, but it subsequently accepted Contador's appeal and cleared him of all charges. Contador returned to racing in February in the [[Volta ao Algarve]], a race he won in 2009 and 2010. The UCI and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] each appealed the RFEC decision independently to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] in March 2011, but Contador remained free to ride until the CAS made its ruling.<ref>{{cite news |title=UCI appeals Contador decision to Court of Arbitration for Sport |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-appeals-contador-decision-to-court-of-arbitration-for-sport |work=Cyclingnews |date=24 March 2011}}</ref> The hearing with CAS was initially scheduled for June, but following an extension requested by Contador's legal team, it was rearranged for August, in the week following the [[2011 Tour de France]],<ref name="cas hearing">{{cite news|publisher=velonation | url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/8640/Hushovd-unhappy-with-delays-in-Contador-doping-hearing.aspx | date=3 June 2011 | title=Hushovd unhappy with delays in Contador doping hearing}}</ref> and later postponed again until November 2011,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jul/26/alberto-contador-vuelta-tour-france |title=Alberto Contador's doping case delayed until November |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=27 July 2011 }}</ref> with the result to be given in 2012. The decision on 6 February 2012 found Contador guilty of accidental ingestion of the prohibited substance Clenbuterol<ref>[https://www.wada-ama.org/en/questions-answers/prohibited-list | work=WADA |date=20 January 2016]</ref> and hence he was stripped of his 2010 Tour de France title, and his results since that race, including victory in the [[2011 Giro d'Italia]] and fifth place in the [[2011 Tour de France]], were voided, and he was suspended until August 2012.<ref name="cascontador"/> The following day, in a press conference, his contract with {{ct|SAX|2012a|nolink=yes}} was annulled.<ref name="Contador contract"/>
