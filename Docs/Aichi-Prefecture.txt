{{nihongo|'''Aichi Prefecture'''|愛知県|Aichi-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located in the [[Chūbu region]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Aichi-ken" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 11|page=11}}; "Chūbu" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 126|page=126}}.</ref> The region of Aichi is also known as the [[Tōkai region]]. The capital is [[Nagoya]]. It is the focus of the [[Chūkyō Metropolitan Area]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Nagoya" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 685|page=685}}.</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Aichi Prefecture}}

Originally, the region was divided into the two provinces of [[Owari Province|Owari]] and [[Mikawa Province|Mikawa]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 780|page=780}}.</ref> After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Owari and Mikawa were united into a single entity. In 1871, after the [[abolition of the han system]], Owari, with the exception of the [[Chita Peninsula]], was established as Nagoya Prefecture, while Mikawa combined with the Chita Peninsula and formed [[Nukata Prefecture]]. Nagoya Prefecture was renamed to Aichi Prefecture in April 1872, and was united with Nukata Prefecture on November 27 of the same year.

The government of Aichi Prefecture is located in the [[Aichi Prefectural Government Office]] in Nagoya, which is the old capital of Owari.

The [[Expo 2005]] [[World's fair|World Exposition]] was held in [[Seto, Aichi|Seto]] and [[Nagakute, Aichi|Nagakute]].

===Etymology===
In the third volume of the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' there is a poem by Takechi Kurohito that reads: "The cry of the crane, calling to Sakurada; it sounds like the tide, draining from Ayuchi flats, hearing the crane cry". Ayuchi is the original form of the name ''Aichi'', and the [[Fujimae-higata|Fujimae tidal flat]] is all that remains of the earlier Ayuchi-gata. It is now a protected area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.aichi.jp/global/en/summary/profile/background.html |title=Summary of Aichi Prefecture |publisher=Aichi Prefecture |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Rediscovering an Ancient Poem to Save a Tidal Flat |author=Kato, Sadamichi |journal=International Studies in Literature and Environment |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2000 |volume=7 | issue = 2 |pages=189–197 |doi=10.1093/isle/7.2.189}}</ref>

For a time, an Aichi Station existed on the [[Kansai Line]] (at the time the Kansai Railway) between [[Nagoya Station|Nagoya]] and [[Hatta Station|Hatta]] stations, but its role was overtaken by [[Sasashima-Live Station]] on the [[Aonami Line]] and [[Komeno Station]] on the [[Kintetsu Nagoya Line]].

Located near the center of the Japanese main island of [[Honshu]], Aichi Prefecture faces the [[Ise Bay|Ise]] and [[Mikawa Bay]]s to the south and borders [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] to the east, [[Nagano Prefecture]] to the northeast, [[Gifu Prefecture]] to the north, and [[Mie Prefecture]] to the west. It measures 106&nbsp;km east to west and 94&nbsp;km south to north and forms a major portion of the [[Nōbi Plain]]. With an area of 5,153.81&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> it accounts for approximately 1.36% of the total surface area of Japan. The highest spot is [[Chausuyama (Aichi)|Chausuyama]] at 1,415 m above sea level.

The western part of the prefecture is dominated by [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]], Japan's third largest city, and its suburbs, while the eastern part is less densely populated but still contains several major industrial centers. Due to its robust economy, for the period from October 2005 to October 2006, Aichi was the fastest growing prefecture in terms of population, beating [[Tokyo]], at 7.4 per cent.

As of April 1, 2012, 17% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Aichi Kōgen Quasi-National Park|Aichi Kōgen]], [[Hida-Kisogawa Quasi-National Park|Hida-Kisogawa]], [[Mikawa Wan Quasi-National Park|Mikawa Wan]], and [[Tenryū-Okumikawa Quasi-National Park|Tenryū-Okumikawa]] Quasi-National Parks along with seven Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref>

Notable sites in Aichi include the [[Meiji Mura]] open-air architectural museum in [[Inuyama]], which preserves historic buildings from Japan's [[Meiji period|Meiji]] and [[Taishō period|Taishō]] periods, including the reconstructed lobby of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s old [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (which originally stood in Tokyo from 1923 to 1967).

Other popular sites in Aichi include the tour of the [[Toyota]] car factory in the city by the same name, the monkey park in [[Inuyama]], and the castles in [[Nagoya]], [[Okazaki, Aichi|Okazaki]], [[Toyohashi]], and [[Inuyama]].

Because of Aichi's location along the Eastern seacoast, there are some scenic spots, but other than the Atsumi Peninsula surf beaches there are no significant beach destinations when compared to neighboring [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. Most attractions are man-made destinations, dealing with the region's history or modern marvels.
